Regarding the above discussed Censorship-resistant decentralised file streaming chain, would it also be better to make only txns submitted by specific pubkeys as valid? -- > This is so that spam can't bloat the chain unnecessarily and hinder the legit transactions.
So only the streamer(and notaries) can submit transactions and others can just host nodes to support the resilience of the network

[15-Oct-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that was discussed

[15-Oct-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the one broadcasting being the only miner, but maybe rejecting any other tx is a good filter to add

[15-Oct-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is still in the proof of concept of basic things like bandwidth, but so far it is looking very doable

[15-Oct-18 07:37 PM] Mylo#8306
project called ascii_camera for video only no audio, and it grabs each frame, which i've just dumped into `console.log` to test i can grab frames.
original src forked on github.
being webcam, it makes me think of audio and syncing....so this is where intercepting webrtc streams (which are already mixed) would be easier and chunkify rather than frame-by-frame video, for a workable solution.   at least getting media through browser is demonstratable if we need to at least try with "dynamic" content

clone that and browse on your local machine - i added `console.log(asciiCharacters);` to line 51 of ascii.js  https://github.com/imylomylo/ascii-camera/blob/master/script/ascii.js#L51

[15-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Mylo#8306
better one.   captured and synced audio+video, captured in 10ms chunks - some blobs are under 8kB some are over, so may need to tune it to 5ms chunks.
Format is webm at capture source, possibly able to just re-assemble in a web container and hit play - not sure about as a streaming src on re-assemble.  something to look into if needed but at least we have synced A/V!!!

[15-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Mylo#8306
either way, can still chunkify it to fit.

[15-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Mylo#8306
here at line 76 i added `console.log("CAPTURED A BLOB! BYTE SIZE: " + event.data.size )`  https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/src/content/getusermedia/record/js/main.js#L76

@jl777c making it it's own coin will require it's own notaries if you want dpow for the temp chains

[15-Oct-18 11:23 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED is already well suited to do that

[15-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Alright#0419
Why create a new coin while we're in the process of getting a perfectly suitable coin off the ground?

[16-Oct-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I guess I should just keep working on that Streamer chain today ?

[16-Oct-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Oct-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Oct-18 01:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
ac_name=STREAMED. Ticker STREAM. 
For, literal, on chain audio/video streaming services.

STREAMED
Cambridge Dictionary defintion:
`past simple and past participle of stream`

Urban Dictionary definition:
`Music or video that is being being played via the internet on either a Computer, Phone or TV.`

[16-Oct-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah the PoC went well, but it cna be imporved no end ... I think really the chain creator needs total centralised control over what is put onto the chain... So likely they should be the only miner, and also the only one who can make transactions. This prevents someone spamming their chain, when trying to stream with it.

[16-Oct-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The whole point of this, is to get data into a blockchain that has been dPoW'ed to KMD - > BTC so that the source can always be verified as correct and not altered.

[16-Oct-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well thats the way I see it ...

[16-Oct-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess too, if someone wants to stream video and keeps gettig banned from a centralised service.

[16-Oct-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would have taught there would be alterniatives without a blockchain for that already though 🤔

[16-Oct-18 01:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Can you limit who accesses your stream through pubkey?

[16-Oct-18 02:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
or have limitations to open it or limit it as much as you want

[16-Oct-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems a LOT harder to solve.... but the stream cna be encrypted...

[16-Oct-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the encrypted stream in on  public blockchain... but without the right keys to decrypt it you cant see what it is.

[16-Oct-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not like notary nods would keep these chains running for an extended time after the stream happened.

[16-Oct-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as these chains grow in size very fast, for a 470MB file sent, I had 40MB approx of overhead, which is really not bad.

[16-Oct-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but over a few hours, the data would really add up

[16-Oct-18 02:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Would that be stored on the mining machine only though?

[16-Oct-18 02:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So you could have a dapp that hosts the chain for you

[16-Oct-18 02:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
and once the stream is complete, the dapp can store elsewhere (if you want to access it again) or delete it

[16-Oct-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not really ... the streamer would start the chain, and them stream and mine it ... hopefully to enough nodes, then all those nodes watching it would receive a copy.

[16-Oct-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
while it was being watched, the dApp could save a local copy not in the blockchain, but like I said before, keeping the raw blockchain, to be able to verify it against KMD later is the real thing that sets this apart from other forms of streaming.

[16-Oct-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to be noted, any data and be streamed into the blockchain, with what I tested yesterday.

[16-Oct-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not just video.

[16-Oct-18 02:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
why would one need to verify it against kmd?

[16-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to prove the copy was the exact same and unaltered

[16-Oct-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any normal video file cna be edited

[16-Oct-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this simply cant, if you ahev the blockchain raw copy.

[16-Oct-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resync it from youself with KMD running and check every notarisation TX against KMD ... it they all match ... then the source is genuine.

[16-Oct-18 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blockchains make things immutable, thats the whole point of them no ?

{Reactions}
👌 (2) 👍 

[16-Oct-18 02:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So if it wasn't verified, any of the people who received the data could manipulate the blockchain data, in turn 'editing' the video for example

[16-Oct-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it didnt ahve dPoW then anyone could just manipulate the raw data.

[16-Oct-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but with dPoW, there is checkpoint in the chain every 5 blocks (at least on staked, we might even try faster than this again later on, evey 3 seems possible)

[16-Oct-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this checkpoint contains the TXID of a transaction on KMD ... which contains the blockchash and a MoM

[16-Oct-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That MoM and blockhash allows you to erify the chain was the same as when it was notarised to KMD.

[16-Oct-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its been altered, then the hashes wont match up

[16-Oct-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or the chain sould simplly be corrupted and not sync.

[16-Oct-18 02:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks for the explanation. Still trying to wrap my head around the whole concept and uses that can come from it 😛

[16-Oct-18 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No body knows what usecases will come from it...

[16-Oct-18 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt even think somehting like this was possible only a few days ago

[16-Oct-18 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The possibilities it opens up are pretty broad.

[16-Oct-18 02:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think that's where my brain is getting caught in a loop. Trying to solve that thought aha

[16-Oct-18 02:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Isn't it just data verification secured by dPoW?

[16-Oct-18 02:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
In the case we are talking about, it is via a streaming process.
My understanding was that the difference to conventional video streaming services was that you could pay to have your own blockchain to host the video yourself. The only rules on that chain are whatever you decide to set. Nobody has the ability to stop it other than you (the miner).

[16-Oct-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... that also... but if some authority really wanted to stop you ... they woul djust switch off the internet the stream was comming from.

[16-Oct-18 02:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Indeed so

[16-Oct-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I jsut worked out how to make the coinbase notary node utxo ... so I can amke this chain mined only by the chain creator now 😄

[16-Oct-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should probably write a plan, before i start on this, as usualy my code ends up very messy with hundreds of commits to get it workin 😂

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
what do you mean by coinbase notary node utxo?

[16-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
splitting utxos for NNs in cb txs?

[16-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... so that the streamer chain, creates a p2pk utxo and can then use the notary node miner logic... so that the chain creator (ac_pubkey) is the only one who can mine. This will increase bandwidth a fair bit.

[16-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stops orphans

[16-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It really doesnt matter at all.. as the chain is spawned  used and then thats is it.

[16-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its for 1 person solely to push data to a chain and have it notarized

[16-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems 0 reason to allow eveyrone to mine it...

[16-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as that will mostly just enable anyone to break it.

[16-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very specific use ... going ahead and startong on it ... not 100% sure how I can push to FSM branch, as I will dev this on STAKED...

[16-Oct-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still need someone to help me with that... otherwise I will need to copy paste code around 😕

[16-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats plenty down the track though, this may take a few days.

[16-Oct-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
FML 🤣 
Spent the last 3H or so debugging something that makes no sense, accidently removed an `else`

[16-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Mylo#8306
We’ve all done it ✅

[16-Oct-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
even i have done that, but I try to make my indentation in a way so that it becomes immediately visible the else is missing, of course if you remove the entire else {}

[16-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I ust removed the word ... I started making a new `else if` then realised it didnt need to be that, and it was far less code to use use || in brackets ... 
At elast my first commit compiled this time 😄 Normally thats taken me many goes.

[16-Oct-18 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
with pure C I have had 1000+ lines of new code compile clean the first time, but with c++ I am still making simple syntax errors
