minimum to use the splitter in it is 64*3 but it's arbitrary

[01-Aug-19 06:55 AM] Alright#0419
I can reduce it when I have time

[01-Aug-19 06:56 AM] Alright#0419
if you mean using the literal staker.py script for combining, there is no minimum

Oh, we need to send a new pubkey for CFEKLOTTO1 game? Where to?

[01-Aug-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
we have to get on the ball in general, joker and I juggling KMD responsibilities and LABS not so easy

[01-Aug-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
should have promoted it a bit better

[01-Aug-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
should have started it on time and prepped better

[01-Aug-19 09:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe @Strob would be interested in becoming a Labs NN...

[01-Aug-19 09:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
well,  there's a lot going on, frankly the KMD stuff isn't going to settle for a while and afaiu is prerequisite for LABS' future

[01-Aug-19 09:30 AM] CMaurice#1685
pervasive awesomeness around all of it

[01-Aug-19 09:31 AM] CrisF#3405
My NN is slowly settling in and I'll be back home tomorrow so will have a bit more time. Think Smk and Tony are pretty busy atm.

[01-Aug-19 09:32 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright, what's coming up on the agenda after the Labs NNs are decided?

[01-Aug-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
Lotto and prices fungible chains

[01-Aug-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
prices is basically fully prepped, but we need tony jl joker and I to have enough time to focus on it when we do put it up

[01-Aug-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
joker currently working on something waaaay more important, so not sure the timeline for this

[01-Aug-19 09:37 AM] CrisF#3405
There are some Labs things I can work on. Like sorting out the Tweetter with @CMaurice. (haven't forgotten)

I reminded again my few friends. I hope that they will participate on time

[02-Aug-19 08:10 AM] Ondalf#1318
Say. Semi-stupid question, but the kmdlabs github doesn't cover getting wif, btcpubkey nor Radd. So based on the README.md, should I get them from komodo wallet, or what is the thing here?

[02-Aug-19 08:11 AM] Ondalf#1318
There is just "now just add keys to config.ini and write start.sh" basically after getting a bootstrap

[02-Aug-19 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Ondalf  
To participate in the lottery for a node, you will just need a KMD address. @Alright  will have more info on this.

[02-Aug-19 08:18 AM] Ondalf#1318
I got simplified guide from phm for this matter. Does the kmd addy need to hold coins, or just randomly generated one?

[02-Aug-19 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It wont need any coins no, but I think the poll is on LABS chain, so you would need a small amount of LABS to register. I can send if you need.

[02-Aug-19 08:20 AM] Ondalf#1318
Umm... So, which one I run then? KMD to get those needed keys and with those, the rest?

[02-Aug-19 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All KMD assetchins use the same address format, a WIF from any chain will work on any other

[02-Aug-19 08:21 AM] Ondalf#1318
Ah, okay. So running kmd for kicks is required to get the addys. So I'll fire up one then

[02-Aug-19 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We use a KMD node for notary, because we notarize to it. You would be able to generate the address with LABS node or any other assetchain

[02-Aug-19 08:24 AM] Ondalf#1318
I've ment to learn this NN jargon at some point, but I've had to postpone it over and over again. So just run komodod without params (so it runs KMD chain) to get those demanded addresses, keys etc to get the needed information for config.ini

[02-Aug-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. KMD will work just fine to generate an address.

[02-Aug-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or you can doi `./listassetchainparams.py`

[02-Aug-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and get the chain params for LABS

[02-Aug-19 08:25 AM] Ondalf#1318
Hmm... Well that can do probably as well

[02-Aug-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS will sync in like 10 mins

[02-Aug-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD takes 6H

[02-Aug-19 08:26 AM] Ondalf#1318
Nah, just few mins to go, until guts are loaded. It's doing it from bootstrap anyways

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02-Aug-19 08:27 AM] Ondalf#1318
And done. 2.5min to load guts. Now just remaining blocks from today and I should be good to go to dump some information...

[02-Aug-19 08:29 AM] Ondalf#1318
Another question, what command to use to dump the needed information?

[02-Aug-19 08:30 AM] Ondalf#1318
Err, komodo-cli param I mean

[02-Aug-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getnewaddress
validateaddress
dumpprivkey

[02-Aug-19 08:32 AM] Ondalf#1318
pubkey or script_pubkey? I'd assume first

[02-Aug-19 08:34 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it seems to me  that we got passed the timestamp deadline for the lottery <https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/commit/b9198f19ced2e5868e17be037a83b3905aee0820>
and there is no registration committed.

[02-Aug-19 08:34 AM] Ondalf#1318
Oh fun...

[02-Aug-19 08:35 AM] Ondalf#1318
rm -rf

[02-Aug-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess there could be another vote... like we did to add exile.

[02-Aug-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This first fork was badly orginised as there is just so much happening atm

[02-Aug-19 08:35 AM] gcharang#6833
its the pubkey
starts with 02 or 03

[02-Aug-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also have a change to test with iguana, it seems the delayt works ok, but nodes who should be benifiting the most (such as mine) are being destroyed with the current code.

[02-Aug-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I may have put it in the wrong place üòÖ

[02-Aug-19 08:37 AM] PHBA2061#2530
success at the first try is hard to achieve you know üòÇ

[02-Aug-19 08:40 AM] Ondalf#1318
so wait, did NNvote.py have requirements of running the whole orchestra (the KMDLABS NN ecosystem)?
if no, then i should've done it few hours ago, when i started this run up against time, which i kinda failed üòì

[02-Aug-19 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not 100% sure on how the vote stuff works tbh, @Alright  made it all, and I havent needed to really dig into it yet

[02-Aug-19 08:44 AM] PHBA2061#2530

Im sure we can work something out. You seem to be the only person who wants to apply this time lol

[02-Aug-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it must be voted by all notaries. Its not my call alone.

[02-Aug-19 08:47 AM] phm87#7395
Oh sorry I did not remember if it is cfekfek or labs chain to vote

[02-Aug-19 08:47 AM] phm87#7395
My friend d4v is also trying to vote

[02-Aug-19 08:48 AM] phm87#7395
Sigh ... aie

[02-Aug-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can extend the time, becuase of confusion.

[02-Aug-19 08:48 AM] phm87#7395
It is my fault

[02-Aug-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we need to wait for Alright

[02-Aug-19 08:48 AM] Ondalf#1318
Yup. Will do :)

[02-Aug-19 08:49 AM] Ondalf#1318
Still got plenty of resources left at my home machine, so if I can help, I will

[02-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Ondalf#1318
(saying this, because i recall someone saying, the KMD NNs are quite centralized to OVH datacenters a while ago)

[02-Aug-19 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
current code rewards nodes who can respond the fastest, we are trying to stop that.

[02-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Ondalf#1318
32ms to germany doesn't help a lot then :/

[02-Aug-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am in the most isolated captital city in the world... pings to germany are like 400ms here :abusedsmily:

[02-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Ondalf#1318
i'm here in the middle of reindeers. kind-of capital of northern Finland, but we got internets! no need to morse or use smoke signals, or postman with reindeer to carry packages to South

[02-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Ondalf#1318
although, i'd love to see the last one, when they carry SYN, ACK etc üòÇ

[02-Aug-19 08:58 AM] Ondalf#1318
hmm, wif is result of dumpprivkey? Radd is receiving address, so the KMD address, i just generated? pubkey is just pubkey, which goes with the generated address?

[02-Aug-19 09:02 AM] phm87#7395
Yes

[02-Aug-19 09:04 AM] Ondalf#1318
okies, so orchestra is going up hopefully. at least the chains gets synced when doing this

Cfefek complained about no connections...

[02-Aug-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, seed nodes being down is a problem.

[02-Aug-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need someone to run DNS seeders for LABS to solve it

[02-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Ondalf#1318
Hmm, I'll bug someone to give any node address, so it can find at least single connection and continue from there
Unless someone here has kind of a list of nodes

[02-Aug-19 11:19 AM] PHBA2061#2530
which chain ? CFEKFEK ?

the LOTTO branch has this commit which *shoudl* allow using specified DNS seeds rather than hard codes. 
`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/66a52a83172ea1b2846e0ac389896f8c1edab2d1`

[02-Aug-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That will solve the issue for us... but we need a DNS seed to test it

[02-Aug-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I pushed a change to he delay in iguana aswell... But I think we need to change port or something to know 100% that everyone updated... Dont want to stop LABS notarizations though so we may need to schecdule it for a few days time to make sure everyone does it close enough.

if that change is no good I have a few other things to try, but I would say a testnet that dosnt notarize real chains will be needed.
