lol... Well I figured a pool being able to stake would be fine, Although at some point it should stake and mine at once, but its not that useful for most chains... Unless they use a CPU algo of some kind daemon mining isnt really useful at all.

[08-Jul-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally at once would have to be daemon, but it's no small feat to support alternating *and* other chains as well is what I was getting at

[08-Jul-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've started it 5 times

[08-Jul-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Well the staking loop needs to be inside its own thread and it needs a diffrent way to be switched on and off, that way PoW mining can have some threads aswell.. but once I got staking working this good, I really didnt want to touch it again, it was no easy task to get it in a usable state.

[08-Jul-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And a pool that switches only when diff wall is down, is well... I dont know what that would do to the chain, I think it would effectivly over time reduce PoW difficulty.

[08-Jul-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think there's a user-base large enough that would actually do it to support the work to do same time in 1 daemon, tbh

[08-Jul-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because its calculated as an average of the PoW difficulty over the last 100 blocks... if you ONLY PoW mine when diff is low, you will lower the difficulty.

[08-Jul-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree, unless I find myself with nothing to do its not likey I will be doing it. If ppl want that, user VRSC to launch the chain lol.

[08-Jul-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
just launch a second daemon to stake

[08-Jul-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
30 seconds after you do it, prepare for:
`wen mobile staking/mining simultaneously in 1 wallet`

[08-Jul-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah lol.

[08-Jul-19 01:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
Look at it this way...

[08-Jul-19 01:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
PPl wanna stake in AGAMA like VRSC... how would that look to an end user?

[08-Jul-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS64 sint for end users

[08-Jul-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just not, it cant be

[08-Jul-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
too complicated

[08-Jul-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS is for devs lol, we want ppl who can stake PoS64 so it was a clear choice.

[08-Jul-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the goal is to get 64 NN OPs who can also test and contribute code.

[08-Jul-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not get a bunch of end users to stake coins and contribute nothing

[08-Jul-19 01:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
LABS is not the only POS64 coin...

[08-Jul-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that isnt my concern, thats a concer for the owners of those chains

[08-Jul-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`PPl wanna stake in AGAMA like VRSC... how would that look to an end user?`
you click the button and it sends `setgenerate true 0` to the daemon and you get what you get 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they want to make it easy for end users they should go for it.

[08-Jul-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS64 will stake just fine with 1 utxo... you just wont get many blocks

[08-Jul-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@daemonfox 
I despise Agama for many reasons, but if you can articulate how to make it all work with 1 button and no support is needed then I'll code it and submit the PR

[08-Jul-19 01:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
2 buttons are needed

[08-Jul-19 01:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
1 function to make 64segID addresses

[08-Jul-19 01:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
and 1 tool to sendmany properly to them

[08-Jul-19 01:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats it

[08-Jul-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you need 3, you forgot the actual "stake" button

[08-Jul-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont NEED to do that.. it just helps you stake more blocks... IMO if you cant figure out how to do that then you dont deserve to stake as much as the person who put in the time to learn how to

[08-Jul-19 01:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
so K64 and ZEXO take that stance...

[08-Jul-19 01:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
only want the elite users?

[08-Jul-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no diea what they do. I didnt make their chains. I specifically fixed PoS64 for LABS, if other chains decide to use it that is their choice

[08-Jul-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
K64 is only 10% PoS, so unlikey ayone would even bother to stake...

[08-Jul-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only want the elite users?`
With the existing button, even the village idiot can stake
they just cannot stake as efficiently as the advance user; and why should they?

[08-Jul-19 01:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
and thats a moral issue as the code maintainers

[08-Jul-19 01:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
you have the power...

>My Geo Metro isn't as fast as a Porsche Spyder

[08-Jul-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really... anyone can fork the code and change it for thier own chain, if its not working the way they would like.

[08-Jul-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats infact exactly what I did here... fork KMD and start ficing the things I wanted fixed

In the history of NASCAR, there hasn't been a single winner that refused to learn how to drive

[08-Jul-19 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
In crypto, the drivers arent the only participants and touch the engine

[08-Jul-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
\i get it for LABS its a new thing and it makes sense for what you want... i guess as a whole my complaint is the base POS64 code doesnt provide the tool to get what is truly needed without using other tools to force it.

[08-Jul-19 01:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
There should be an internal get64segidaddresses call.

[08-Jul-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
iguana has gen64addrs

[08-Jul-19 01:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
right

[08-Jul-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops a script from processing the output of that into a sendmany

[08-Jul-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this is just a gui/tools issue

[08-Jul-19 01:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
correct... it just needs better end user access

[08-Jul-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i guess as a whole my complaint is the base POS64 code doesnt provide the tool to get what is truly needed without using other tools to force it.`
because you don't **need** 64 addresses; it's an advanced case for advanced usage

[08-Jul-19 01:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
is there a reason Iguana doesnt come with AGAMA?

[08-Jul-19 01:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
i disagree genie

[08-Jul-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because agama is a glorified web page

[08-Jul-19 01:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
POS64 was coded.. 1 block per segid correct?

[08-Jul-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[08-Jul-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the current segid gets a time "advantage", but it's not a guarantee that someone will have something in that seg that is viable and then it goes to the next

[08-Jul-19 01:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
i said that kind of backwards lawl

[08-Jul-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if block 123456 is selected with seg 14, it's entirely possible (through distribution) that seg 63 will qualify and create the block (just delayed from the time that 14 would have)

[08-Jul-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getlastsegidstakes always shows interesting and unexpected results... There are alwys segids that stake heaps less... I tried to weight my coins in those and it made things much worse as far as the amount I was staking is concerned.

[08-Jul-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a CFEK chain staking to -pubkey and only running a single address that staked about 50,000 blocks. Way back in early testing.

[08-Jul-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there literally is no one "optimal strategy" 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there isnt... Ive tried a few and so far, it seems just "MORRR UTXOs and coinage" is just about the best thing you can do.

[08-Jul-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and all of that leaves out the difference that weight makes when compared to supply
2500 coins will stake way different on OUR as on ZEXO as on LABS

[08-Jul-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 200k ZEXO and cannot stake shit...

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
ZEXO lol... been trying to get a stake with 10K spread out and nada there too

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
tried several

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when im not getting anything with 200k and maximm coinage, there are some big players on that chain.

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
But boot up MGNX lol... itll stake like no ones business

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
ppl with 64X 75K utxos

[08-Jul-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
in ZEXO

[08-Jul-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had the opposite experience; ZEXO worked the same for me as MGNX and with OUR I felt like I couldn't stake if I killed ever other node on the planet

[08-Jul-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so adding "easy buttons" to agama isn't going to perform magic

[08-Jul-19 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope

[08-Jul-19 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
but it gives ppl options

[08-Jul-19 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
and ability to participate

[08-Jul-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they have options now

[08-Jul-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the `ability to participate`

[08-Jul-19 01:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
among how many users... thats a small sample is it not?

[08-Jul-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
may have been the only node, but the point is that you dont NEED to split to 63 address... in fact with smaller amount sof coins, thats either not possible or would mean you would find nothing.

[08-Jul-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
users are only 1 small part of it
my experience with OUR was 2 days after the params were released (how many users do you think were staking 2 days after release?)

[08-Jul-19 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if so, the OUR premine showed that as a fail 😛

[08-Jul-19 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now, yes; I mean early on

[08-Jul-19 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
weight matters

[08-Jul-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
what is needed for non-tech users to fully participate in PoS64 is to display all 64 segids and total weight in each segid

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
^^

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
then the user can allocate different percentage of his stake to various segids

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
make it like a board game

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
we had a devstat page early in STAKED

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is indeed a multiplayer game

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
on a chessboard

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
showed segid distribution and the staked segids call

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getsnapshot shows segid

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
an empty segid is the best place to put your stake

[08-Jul-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is already possible

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you dont know how many of those coins are actually staking

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and what is optimal at height X wont be at X+100

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you can see the recent staking activity

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes with `getlastsedidstakes`
