[29-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Exile13#4458
in the KMD docu, theres no "stop" mentioned till windows

[29-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Exile13#4458
oh

[29-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Exile13#4458
thats why setpubkey was made

[29-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Exile13#4458

if i use the same pubkey for different machines its ok because its like a wallet

[29-Apr-19 12:55 PM] Exile13#4458
i know thats prob not the correct terms

[29-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Exile13#4458
as if im running /staked on two machines, or do they need to be different addresses?

[29-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It depends on what you want to do. But I would say generally use a diffrent key on each node

[29-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Exile13#4458
ok

[29-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Exile13#4458
andi use a KMD Radd to genereate a pubkey that works across ALL asset chains?

[29-Apr-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes the Raddress/pubkey/wif/private key will work on all assetchains created with komodod.

[29-Apr-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Blackjok3r recommended this, and it's really goo `https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux`

[29-Apr-19 01:28 PM] Exile13#4458

tmux makes your life very easy. Learn it üòÉ Im so glad I started oput using it, even though it was hard at first, theres no way I could do what I do now without it

where do i want to put the .conf file for tmux

[29-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Exile13#4458
this is the directions
`$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
$ ln -s -f .tmux/.tmux.conf
$ cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .`

[29-Apr-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
.tmux.conf goes in $HOME

[29-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Exile13#4458
so `cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local /home`

[29-Apr-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
<https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect> is a good addon to have too üòâ

could KMDLabs be hacked to run on a ARM64 rockpi like what radix did to KMD?

[29-Apr-19 04:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes provided his fixes are in KMD we have them, most of the code is exactly the same.

[29-Apr-19 06:14 PM] Exile13#4458
ok ty! can KMDLabs and KMD be run on the same machine? I first installed Labs(staked), tried to run komodo from komodo/src and it doesnt exist. then i tried to install it thinking its not there? so i found the komodo.conf file and its prefilled.

[29-Apr-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
@Exile13 we have 20 operators locked in for launch. It's possible that we could launch with 22 if everyone agrees. This wouldn't guarantee you a spot though, it would be left to provably fair lottery.

[29-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
lottery would look something like this. 

1. We announce a future BTC block height. This block's blockhash will act as entropy for the lottery.
2. Participants entering the lottery will post some data to an oracle prior to the block happening.
3. We do `sha256(blockhash+participant_data)` (maybe `sha256(sha256(blockhash)+participant_data)`?)
4. Whichever 2 participants are closest to 0 get the open spot.

[29-Apr-19 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
open to suggestions on that btw

[29-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
Do believe we need a notary vote to veto sock puppets. Something like 51% of notaries are able to vote that they think a participant is a sock puppet( or otherwise unfit to run a notary)

[29-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
2.5* participants must post a signed message from the same key to discord/github

[29-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
@Exile13 we can add you for now so you can get some experience, but this wouldn't be a guarantee that you have a NN position for launch

[29-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Exile13#4458
agreed

[29-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
ok wait for @blackjok3r he has much more experience changing NN eras than I do

[29-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
pretty sure I could do it, but I'm not confident I wouldn't mess it up üòÇ

[29-Apr-19 06:28 PM] Exile13#4458
ok
