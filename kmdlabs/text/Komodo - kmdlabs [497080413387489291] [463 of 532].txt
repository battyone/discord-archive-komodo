I tend to overuse parentheticals out of habit; mostly because I had an English instructor in uni that refused to comprehend the proper usage of commas 🤷🏽

Shakespeare can make up words in English Lit, but you can't use tangent punctuation when discussing it

English is my second language, the first I have a preschool vocab and is more of a dialect than language. I oscillated between failing and aceing english each year through high school.  Came down to who was marking, and how much they agreed with or understood.  Subjective subjects < scientific method & math proofs. Sadly, most education is all about opinions and social engineering now.

[13-Aug-19 04:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
@Oszy  You are going to want to run the getlastsegidstakes command with the number of blocks you want to go back. This will show you the segid stake total for each.

[13-Aug-19 04:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
And I launched without pubkey so the 8 coins blocks are populating random segids as Genie said... and they stake like crazy.

[13-Aug-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
Most of my stakes now are 8 coin blocks i never moved

[13-Aug-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
and i sat 8 HEAVY utxos on the lightest 8 segids last month... 750 coin utxo in each of the 8 then random 8 coins utxos scattered randomly.

[13-Aug-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried something similar to that, 1300 size utxos didnt stake for shit lol.. I kept getting nbit errors... I guess my node is just shit

[13-Aug-19 05:17 PM] Oszy#5734
interesting thanks wil ltry

[13-Aug-19 08:09 PM] Oszy#5734
looks like it was a good tip

[13-Aug-19 08:09 PM] Oszy#5734
changed to avg size 8 utxo's 8 per segid + 1 segid with a 400 utxo and got a stake in an hour

[13-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Don King#8901
If you use blocknotiy with pos64, does the 8 coin blockreward get added to the original utxo that won the stake, or does it end up in a new utxo of 8 on a new address?

[13-Aug-19 11:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
scroll back about 12 hrs

[14-Aug-19 12:12 AM] Don King#8901
I only see discussion of setting  pubkey , not setting blocknotify

[14-Aug-19 12:19 AM] Don King#8901
I use this line when I start LABS  , 
-blocknotify=/home/<USER>/pos64staker/staker.py %s LABS
I assume it adds new 8 coins to old utxo

[14-Aug-19 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blocknotidy is just a trigger.. it does what you ask it to

[14-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Don King#8901
Thanks, so stakers.py does the utxo combining?

[14-Aug-19 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I also figured out a way to have the daemon do it when miuning... but im stil not too sure about it

[14-Aug-19 12:23 AM] Don King#8901
Can you see individual utxo on a LABS block explorer, or just address balance?
I just run the start command and follow wallet balance, I assume utxo have been combining, but maybe I have loads of 8coin utxo

[14-Aug-19 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not too sure.. I use listunspent to get utxos

[14-Aug-19 12:44 AM] Don King#8901
Thanks, I will try using that! I just run commands like a monkey and hope for the best lol , Linux noob

[14-Aug-19 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181

you can check / filter generated coins from transactions

[14-Aug-19 11:21 AM] Oszy#5734
` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listtransactions | jq '.[] | select(.category | contains("generate"))'`

[14-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to install `jq` for this `sudo apt-get install jq`

I've just done my first moths notary node accounts, ready to send my contribution to LABs. Should I spreaed this 50/50 between the dev and notarisation funds? And can someone please confirmed the pinned addresses are up to date valid?

[15-Aug-19 10:57 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright is the best to confirm.
I'll send my 1st months to DEV if that makes any difference in your decision.  I'll be sending more to DEV than notorizations this year as per proposal. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

Yeah, I think the dev fund probably needs it more than the ntx fund... might run Pareto and go 80/20

[15-Aug-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never specified how much I would donate to LABS, this testnet cost me a bit, so is indirectly going there lol

This seems ready to test with a live network that is not all owned by me. Its possible that it coudl cause issues in a very unstable network, but I havent really been able to force that to happen myself.

[15-Aug-19 12:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
has @Alright tried rocking the boats yet?

[15-Aug-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no not yet... But I dont think that letting peoiple with a valid notary key attack iguana is going to work out well.... It has some basic banning implemented, but only for sapling chains right now and it cannot cover everyhting, probabluy x10 the size of the code to prevent people screwing with it. 
I was mostly concerned with getting all nodes to agree that was quite hard lol.

[15-Aug-19 12:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
evil notary attack is identifiable and countermeasures in the chamber 🔫

[15-Aug-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, its very easily detected with this iguana... Unless there is a way for them to act badly that I do not know about yet.

[15-Aug-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When trying to make a node act badly... I managed to stop the entire network dead, but Im sure that was a bug in my code... Probably should revist that though and see if I can work it out now that things are stable

[15-Aug-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Going to run a few simulations first. I added a fix to it a few days back to stop it getting stuck on 12 sigs/13 but it had uniuntended concequence of skipping my entire code logic when that was the case.

The calcuaoltion for the k value is now pretty stupid... but as its a deterministic fuinction... doesnt really amtter. all nodes make the same outputs

[15-Aug-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  
Well it seems my first fix is the one that works... 😂  
You cant force the k value... It ends up makling too many valid ones and then nothing works

[15-Aug-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess we just need to see how the current network goes

no idea if it works tbh, haven't had a chance to play with it

merged it because we needed apow code

I'll give that branch a shot. got the right magc etc, but cant really PR coins file until have a node or 3 to put in for nSPV value

I have only very briefly tested nspv, no idea how to set up a "seed node"

or if it even requires anything special

How can a Zero-Knowledge Vote be made using the Labs voting mechanisn?

(By **Zero-Knowledge Vote** I mean a vote that can be made once per issue, and only once per issue, by a private 'voting' key that belongs to a set of 'voting' keys (eg, Notary keys).  The vote would provably belong to the set of keys, but unknown as to which key it came from.)

Could really use your input on this!

[17-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you could send 1.0002 coins to each taddr. then each voter would do a t -> z to a tmp address and from there a z->z to the voting address

[17-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming everybody votes, it seems to work, but if some dont vote it could be an issue

[17-Aug-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405

[17-Aug-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not seeing why the not voting would be an issue.  What am I missing?

[17-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
info is leaked

[17-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
not much, but you can tell who didnt vote

[17-Aug-19 10:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I see.
For the immediate case I have in mind I don't expect a 100% turn out, but knowing who didn't vote shouldn't have such drastic consequences.
Thanks for the help 🙇

[17-Aug-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
problem is fake votes though

[17-Aug-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so this would need to be done on a chain with all the other coins accounted for

Ahoy, PIRATEs, 

KMDLabs would like thank you and your community for your backing in our quest to advance the technologies we use in our ecosystems.

As you may know, during the KMD Notary Node elections the PIRATE community kindly pledged a portion of KMD mining earnings to KMDLabs to support our development. 

The first month of the 3rd notary season has passed and KMDLabs has gratefully received your donations.  :treasure:  

@mrlynch , who is running the PIRATE nodes, has been putting in a lot of work to keep the PIRATE nodes amongst the top performers while also contributing a great deal to the entire ecosystem.  We would like to thank him for his efforts as well.

Thank you very much for your support!

Hi @Deleted User ,
I made a chain that allows this.  In this case the vote would be a NN vote, so # of voters and addresses know.  There are only enough fees for 2 transactions.  There were some small amounts extra when I made the chain.  Not enough to make a full coin though, and only a full coin would be considered a vote.

[19-Aug-19 08:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been able to figure out how to `...enforces this flow:
coinbase -> taddr -> zaddr -> taddr`

[19-Aug-19 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The amount of fees available would ensure that wouldn't it?
