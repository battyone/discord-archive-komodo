make sure all the pending exports eventually complete

[16-Jan-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant be losing coins

[16-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes this was the point of the oracle logs, not sure if thats still the plan or what.

[16-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no easy way to get all export txns from the chains... imports is no problem we already ahve RPC for that and scorboard script to count amount per address.

[16-Jan-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the payouts hash, must be saved along with the export raw hex, so you can resume the process should it fail for any reason.

[16-Jan-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL 
The 5000 works becasse all export txns are covered by the same notarisation.

[16-Jan-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
10000 works too but slower a little

[16-Jan-19 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you amy find when lots of ppl  try to run it at the same time, the blocks would be full and this would no longer be the case.

[16-Jan-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r  bottleneck in spot of speed which I found so far is the export txs creation speed - im creating its too slow to fit much in one notarization

[16-Jan-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Multiple nodes should help

[16-Jan-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. .the only wauy around this is to use `createrawtransaction` instead fo fund raw.... Split to X utxos, then create raw for each. Broadcast alll at the same time.

[16-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure it will; still work the same...

[16-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just give createrawtransaction a utxo

[16-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of not giving it one... and calling fundraw after

[16-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Didnt try it myself yet though

yes

[16-Jan-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its from one of the bug fixes. It should pass before that date

[16-Jan-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ask james for more info, he fixed that one.

[16-Jan-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@Alright  
This branch VHT2... It syncs CFEKPOS51 can you please test it with MGNX? 
Have 100% PoS verushash chain running will leave for a while to see how it goes. We will need to laumch a test chain with PoS/PoW try to get lots of stakers and miners to see how it goes. 
The new changes will only work with chains called LABS and LAB. Other wise ti wont sync CFEK or MGNX.
I like this VerusHahs 100% PoS for 0BR chains... seems to work quite well provided the difficulty calibrates correctly.

:(
Its still not right.

[16-Jan-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed fix for 100% chains, should help mixed also.

[16-Jan-19 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hybrid PoW/PoS is working with verushash great.. 100% poS doesnt, dont need it for that anyway so that doesn't amtter.

[16-Jan-19 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r this verushash 100% chain I launched yesterday is running just fine

[16-Jan-19 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
did you touch consensus rules of normal ac_staked chains? ie MGNX

[16-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r the POS% never seems to adjust on VHT2 branch

[16-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
or well it adjusts within the first 100 blocks, but after that it stays at target%

[16-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
isn't increasing the pow target as it should because of that

[16-Jan-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
acts as if it's a 100% POW chain, but pos blocks are still possible

[16-Jan-19 11:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes it stays at the target because its working perfectly

[16-Jan-19 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The 100% pos did work because I had custom difficulty rules... Guess we can compare one of those chains with an ac_staked 100% chain on equihash, and see what works better. The version u have is a git commit so we can use it by adding some exemptions in the code.

[16-Jan-19 11:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do u mean that if you stop pow the pos mines all the blocks but the difficulty does not adjust? @Alright

[16-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
I turned off pos, and pow keep going just fine

[16-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
without target adjusting

[16-Jan-19 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
need to look at the chain again, coming back to this in a bit though

[16-Jan-19 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmmm... I'll check mine here also soon

[16-Jan-19 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible with the higher difficulty its using as default that it sees all pos blocks as pow or something

[17-Jan-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah mine is also broken god damn it

[17-Jan-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
got to like block 500 odd then just mine PoW 1s blocks for 70 blocks

[17-Jan-19 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess I have another day here of fucking around... this is very annoying to say the least

[17-Jan-19 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I cant make the early chain stable... I guess the changes I have made are breaking it later on down the track ðŸ˜¦

[17-Jan-19 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright I think I worked out what is wrong with it...

[17-Jan-19 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it not count PoS% for the first 10 blocks... seems that cant be done it breaks everything.

[17-Jan-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally worked out what the hell is going on

[17-Jan-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ˜…

[17-Jan-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The VRSC min diff gives 1-4s blocks

[17-Jan-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Started a -ac_algo=verushash chain pure PoW and ti got to block 200 very fast... only just started to slow down. So I will get teh nbits of 30s block times and try to use that for Staking Min Diff.

[17-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should be optimal for 0BR chains.... You would need to make a pool that works with disablecb or  use a server farm to drive diff through the roof and stall the chain for litterally no money. I think this will be secure enough. @Alright
Being a "dead" algo that no coins are using to mine actual currency it should be farily safe from FPGA or ASIC.

[17-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone using the chain, can either chuck a core on it or stake. It doesnt really cost them anything.

[17-Jan-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It won't hold teh exact %, but this isnt really what I set out to acheive here. It allows either PoW or PoS to keep the chain moving. Either one can "unstick" it. Its using the verus difficuty algo, which seems much much better than the equihash one. ðŸ˜„

[17-Jan-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Actually after a few minor adjustments I'm not seeing any 382s blocks like we see in equihash and pos % is within 1-2% all the time once the first 300 blocks pass.

[17-Jan-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess we need to test it with more than 2 nodes to be sure.

[17-Jan-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Current algo is holding about 100-120s block times pretty much perfectly... like so consistent its weird....

[17-Jan-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the more hashes needed to find a block, i think the more predictable it becomes

[17-Jan-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
equihash takes a long time to calculate so the variance will be high

[17-Jan-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. Ive noticed this exactly

[17-Jan-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with equihash is only low hash rate

[17-Jan-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can use that on the main chain, as I assume with a block reward people will actually mine it.

[17-Jan-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If we use equihash for 0BR chains we are basically limited to 100% PoS or the blocktimes will just be terrible. Wont make for nice migrations.

[17-Jan-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I propose that a chain in the LABS cluster costs a certain amount of LABS coin to create. Once it has been started it must have  some staking weight to live. This creates demand for the coin.

[17-Jan-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This also automatically purges chains that are not being used... as they will just stop and no more notarisations can ever happen, effectivly burning any supply left on them.

[17-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```### KMD LABS: Proposal

LABS Main Chain:
    51% PoS 49% PoW - Equihash, same as KMD.
    ac_founders=1440 - Pays notary node multisig address every 24H 33% of the supply split between all nodes, based on notarisation counts. (33% up to discussion, we need notaries to not collude to inflate supply.)
    -- Eventually we need some way of making sure all notary nodes are not too close together. This is a hard problem to solve.
    -- 1 KMD notary node at least to pay for KMD notarisations cost. More than one, each with a single operator is better.
    ---> blackjok3r, Alright, smk762 have all commited to running for election.
    -- Bounty Program:
        Alright: Put bounty info here.
    LABS is fungible with all chains in the LABS cluster. You can send LABS coins to any working LABS chain at any time using MoMoM. 
    
Fungible LABS chains:
    -- 60% PoS 40% PoW - VerusHash with PoS64. 
    -- 0 Block reward apart from transaction fees.
    -- These chains due to their PoS compenent require ~20,000-50,000 LABS to create. (this may need adjustment)
    ---> There must always be a supply of coins being staked on these chains to keep them moving. PoW can be done to unstick a chain if need be.
    ---> Anyone using these chains should be able to stake/CPU mine on them when using it for testing or contracts or whatever needed. 
    -- When a chain stops for X (64?) days, it is considered dead. Any supply left on it is burnt. 
    ---> Notaries must remove the dead chains and a copy of them will be backed up to the LABSMETA chain using the streamer.```

[17-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```Non Fungible LAB Chains:
    -- Any combination of whatever as params. These chains are for testing consensus changes that may break the cluster.
    ---> Chains free to create but have dPoW cost, this needs to be definitvly decided. I think maybe ~1000 LABS per chain? paid split to each notary that adds them.
    ---> These chains may be short lived or long, if proven stable they can be added as a Fungible chain after being tested (with new supply).
    ---> There is no need to backup these chains unless needed for data collection. Or something cool that happened ;)
    
CFEK Chains:
    ---> Designed to be broken. Cost maybe even 0. Used before making a LAB chain.
    ---> Likey where maybe bounties are paid from? ```

@LabsAssistant  This is my proposal. Please discuss.

[17-Jan-19 03:48 PM] jorian#4555
```-- 1 KMD notary node at least to pay for KMD notarisations cost. More than one, each with a single operator is better.
    ---> blackjok3r, Alright, smk762 have all commited to running for election.``` a dedicated KMD notary node to fund KMD tx cost for all LABS notaries?

[17-Jan-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. If all 3 of us win we pledge % of KMD to fund all KMD notarisation cost

[17-Jan-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even 1 should be enough for a fairly large cluster

[17-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This benifits KMD more than us... as it gets CC contracts battle tested before being added to KMD. ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jan-19 03:49 PM] jorian#4555
yes, agreed

[17-Jan-19 03:49 PM] jorian#4555
```ac_founders=1440 - Pays notary node multisig address every 24H 33% of the supply split between all nodes, based on notarisation counts.``` explain this a bit more

[17-Jan-19 03:49 PM] jorian#4555
there is a multisig addy?

[17-Jan-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r how much KMD monthly LABS NN will use?

[17-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the notary nodes pubkeys are alll added to a multi seig address and every 24H a percentage of the mined coins gets paid to that address.

[17-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it was 1 KMD per chain per day

[17-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats maybe a bit much... that over all nodes

[17-Jan-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
cant have more than 15 pubkeys in the msig redeemscript

[17-Jan-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it was some number of them... Who have been around longest or something... I forget the specifics it was a while ago this was decided.

[17-Jan-19 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I particularlty need help with the coin distribution, liek nhow much notaries get paid and bounties amounts etc... If we screw that up the coin will end up worthless... This si really something cool we were able to put together here. Dont want to screw it up by getting some numbers wrong.

[17-Jan-19 04:05 PM] SHossain#0007

how many notaries do we have again?

[17-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  We notarise at freq 5... it cost 2x as much and chains all have blocks every 60s. ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Jan-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
20 notaries but KMD Krazy dropped out.

notarisations are paid to the RXL addres still.. it was too ahrd to change it... so most of the KMD ntoary node mined KMD goes ti crypto holders ðŸ˜‚

[17-Jan-19 04:10 PM] jorian#4555
is that bad?

[17-Jan-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
