blackjok3r or jl777/FSM

[30-Oct-18 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok

[30-Oct-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think jl777 wont work on staked chains, buit not 100% sure ont hat

[30-Oct-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never tried it... I know notarisations wont work on it

[30-Oct-18 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
oh it definitely won't

`listrooms` returns all on `oracleslist` ?

[30-Oct-18 12:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so if I start spamming new oracles to test GPS side of things, do they become rooms also?

[30-Oct-18 12:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
suggest "CHAT:" prefix coded into description for  room creation?

[30-Oct-18 12:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
with troll box, oracle allows non-creators to publish. How can this be restricted to just the creator?

[30-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
by pubkey?

[30-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
anyone can register

[30-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
just pay attention to only your's

[30-Oct-18 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, so someone can spam the oracle, and I just filter out whats mine?

[30-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[30-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
it's all already separated by pubkey

looking at the troolbox code has cleared some things up. I was getting stuck on send, cos I didnt have the `lilend`

[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah thats one of the reasons I suggested he make it in python, heaps easier to read

[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
allows a great exaple for others.

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
there are other data types you can use other than S

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so with different pubkeys able to publish, the same oracle can recieve and transmit a whole array of sensor data from discrete sources, easily categorised.

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
S seems most versatile though

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[30-Oct-18 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
GPS NMEA strings are less than 256 char

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
The format string is a set of chars with the following meaning:
  's' -> <256 char string
  'S' -> <65536 char string
  'd' -> <256 binary data
  'D' -> <65536 binary data
  'c' -> 1 byte signed little endian number, 'C' unsigned
  't' -> 2 byte signed little endian number, 'T' unsigned
  'i' -> 4 byte signed little endian number, 'I' unsigned
  'l' -> 8 byte signed little endian number, 'L' unsigned
  'h' -> 32 byte hash

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any upside to 256 vs 65k outside of being able to write a novel?

[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
those are all the data types you can use

oh unicode

[30-Oct-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that seems all of them, likely name colur cna be derived from pubkey with soe existing function in python maybe ? this makes it unique

[30-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Alright#0419

I'm transitioning to python, so I might be able to knock that up. Used a bit of py in the past but mostly just for sql-like spatial db query, and batching geoprocesses, but nothing big yet.

[30-Oct-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I will need to merge the streamer options down to master, made a copy of master branch as `ac_address` and merged the streamer in, will sync a staked chain or 2 with it, to amke sure its good... Dont want to add ac_address support without streamer option already as merging it will be all but impossible.

[30-Oct-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be no reason streamer should break anything existing, although I should maybe diable the getdatafromblock RPC on chains that are not streamer, it wont hurt to have it active at all.

[30-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as it would jsut return nothing if no valid data exists.

[30-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Synced STKDDUST just fine, will review the code tomorrow then merge it in, and notaries can update to make sure its ok.. we need to get all these branches sorted and make sure stuff that should work in master does work before launch.

[30-Oct-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Adding ac_address is my next job which I will do in this branch as its even with master exactly + streamer_recv

[30-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```ASSETCHAINS_FOUNDERS_REWARD = GetArg("-ac_freward",0);
ASSETCHAINS_OVERRIDE_ADDRESS = GetArg("-ac_address","");```
Will work the same as commision and ac_pubkey, except pay to an address. (can me multisig, and hopefully a CC contract address also to fund a contract from block reward!)
Founders reward will differ from comission, because it will only be a percentage of the block reward, and will not take into account any txs.
Hopefully I can get this working tomorrow. 🤞

@blackjok3r watched more of your vids.... holy F man you have a single vid with over 7M views lol!

what error are you getting on stakedb1

what are you trying to test

[31-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
you likely only need a single chain

my STAKEDB1 nodes are probably dead

[31-Oct-18 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
haven't really cared about the testnet cluster all that much lately, as we'll be redoing it all shortly

[31-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have worked out what the issue is with faster frequency notarisations and import tx's failing..  I need to try and prove or disprove it., but not entirly sure how to ge the data I need, it appears that a notarisation tx sent to KMD for a chain, can sit in the mempool, and then be included either out of order or have 2 notariations in the same block. Because staked notaries do not have precedence on KMD chain for transacions, like the KMD notaries do, sometimes our txs can sit in mempool for a while, allowing this to happen. 

When doing the validation against KMD to create the import transaciton, it calculates MoMoM hashes until it gets a valid one, signs the tx with that then gives back the transaction, making the assumption, that the valid MoMoM hash it used, will be the same one as the MoMoM hash sent to the target chain.

[31-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However when iguana asks the KMD daemon for the MoMoM hash to be sent to the target chain, is does not ahve this transacion to compare to, and only uses a range and timing, and will use the first MoMoM it finds that is valid for all chains... if a MoM notarisation is in KMD out of order, or there is 2 in one block for a single chain, it could be picking the wrong one, as it has no way to know which one to use.

[31-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking what I need to do is make KMD print the MoM hashes its using to calc the MoMoM in both functions then try to sign impoort tx and send import tx, on some failed migrates.

[31-Oct-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the MoM hash being used for the target chain differs, we have the answer. At least for now, just making notarisations very far apart is working to stop this condition from happening... maybe also we can ry to increase the iguana KMD transaction fee per notaisation to make them be confirmed in the very next block.

[31-Oct-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott  @jl777c

[31-Oct-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```// See if we have an own notarisation in this block
        BOOST_FOREACH(Notarisation& nota, notarisations) {
            if (strcmp(nota.second.symbol, symbol) == 0)
            {
                seenOwnNotarisations++;
                if (seenOwnNotarisations == 1)
                    destNotarisationTxid = nota.first;
                else if (seenOwnNotarisations == 2)
                    goto end;
                break;
            }
        }```

[31-Oct-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This loop means that as soon as the function that calcualtes the MoMoM hash sees a single notarisation in the same KMD block, it ends and moves to the next block.

[31-Oct-18 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is 2 notariations for the chain in a single KMD block, it will skip one.

[31-Oct-18 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This explains why increaseing freq solves the issue. Not 100% sure on how to go about a fix, it seems far to easy to just remove the break.

[31-Oct-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
We need to start a new testnet with the break; removed from the above peice of code. I have done a sucessful migrate with it removed and it does not break anything. However if we get a condition where 2 notarisations happen from 1 chain into a single KMD block, it will no longer skip counting one of those. This allows us to revert back to a fast frequency, maybe even faster than 5, to mass test migrates... We need to get this happeing asap, so a few of us can all run mighrate loops for a few days, We should get as close as we can to full blocks of migrates, and also cycle GPU on and off one of the chains, to cause unstable and random block times.

[31-Oct-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the notarization is paused if a pending notarization is found in the mempool

[31-Oct-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why can it not just actually count if 2 notarisations are in a block ?

[31-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
ask @libscott, not sure the details

[31-Oct-18 09:07 AM] CMaurice#1685
@blackjok3r you want me to remove it from crosschain.cpp and ./start.sh will rebuild?

[31-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am talking to him right now ...

[31-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No we need to start all new chains

[31-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this will hard fork things

[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if indeed it does fix the problem. we need all nodes on the new code, new chains, and new iguana port

[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to wait for Alright.

[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] CMaurice#1685
kk will be out for about an hour in a few mins

[31-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats fine, likely belonger than that... If anyone isnt around their node will just stop working until they update

[31-Oct-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might acually be something else, could be that the backnotarisations are confirmed out of order and the code assumes they are not. The fix for this is to check a range of notarisations on the target to accout for this condition.

[31-Oct-18 10:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if start.sh is cron'd will I just seamlessley migrate? I'll be around for a few hours either way.

[31-Oct-18 10:49 AM] CMaurice#1685
think not @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator, new chains required per above, possibly

[31-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think it would be best to manually kill it all

[31-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no worries if people are not around

[31-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as I will move to a new iguana port
