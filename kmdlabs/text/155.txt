like set and forget kind of thing

[12-Dec-18 12:01 AM] SHossain#0007
`32M Dec 12 01:00 wallet.dat`

[12-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
should be ready to test if anyone wants to try it, not exactly ready to actually use though

[12-Dec-18 12:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`like set and forget kind of thing`
LOL I have a  whole rig just for that 😛

[12-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
What is your logic for merging UTXOs?

set a threshold for a segid then merge the newest ones once threshold is hit?

[12-Dec-18 12:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
30mb isn't big on a decent server

[12-Dec-18 12:02 AM] SHossain#0007
2 core server is decent?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[12-Dec-18 12:02 AM] riddler18k#0791
@Alright  do you have a sample .conf file for those python script kmdrpc.py by any chance please

[12-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
what do you mean sample .conf?

[12-Dec-18 12:02 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not even a dedicated server. just a VPS 😄

[12-Dec-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
More about single core speed than core count ( or mor specifically how fast the CPU gets data from ram)

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] riddler18k#0791
remove any private details... username/password etc

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm maybe the secret is in uptime

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r flat out calling him a cheater when we don't understand why it's happening isn't fair. @SHossain just please help us to understand what the difference is

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Umtime is most important.. It was a joke

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[12-Dec-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can't cheat, well I don't think u can... A

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Alright#0419
@riddler18k I'm not sure what you're asking for

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] TonyL#3577
My node was alive for a ~2-3 days after `CFEKLAMEDUCKS` is live and I have 102 notarisations on it

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] SHossain#0007
based on the stat @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 posetd, i'm not even near the top `'RKdLoHkyeorXmMtj91B1AAnAGiwsdt9MdF': 246,`

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] TonyL#3577
So 1400 seems legit

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] SHossain#0007
😄

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Alright#0419
that's CFEK not CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[12-Dec-18 12:04 AM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok

[12-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Alright#0419
so people were notarizing that couple weeks before you even had a notary

[12-Dec-18 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
It should be just a dispersion I think

[12-Dec-18 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
We can make an experiment

[12-Dec-18 12:06 AM] SHossain#0007
get a decent DC and connection speed

[12-Dec-18 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
it's not that

[12-Dec-18 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Take X nodes and ensure that it have same uptime on some distance

[12-Dec-18 12:07 AM] SHossain#0007
no one know why 😛

[12-Dec-18 12:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And then check if results suits the dispersion model

[12-Dec-18 12:07 AM] TonyL#3577
If assume that chances to notarise are equal

[12-Dec-18 12:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If every node is in the same DC and is is set up exact same, the results are random as they should be

[12-Dec-18 12:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested that

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright when I run for CFEKLAMEDUCKS I get
```$ ./stats.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./stats.py", line 16, in <module>
    if vin['address'] in stats:
KeyError: 'address'
```

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But if they are have same specs but different connection - ping/bandwith to where matters?

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
@riddler18k those scripts don't require any special .conf if that's what you're asking for

{Reactions}
👍🏾 

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] TonyL#3577
To all other nodes?

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 there's a reason that script isn't on git yet 😛

[12-Dec-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From my hundreds of hours of testing you need to be in the recv mask the fastest

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
thanks for reporting that though, will look at it

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are many factors to this

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] SHossain#0007
how to be in recv mask

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] SHossain#0007
?

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] SHossain#0007
all the time

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there's a reason that script isn't on git yet`
Because you code like a drunken redneck palsy victim? :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The official explnaition for that has been uptime and utxo, but that's not exactly the case

[12-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
didn't get the pep8 treatment yet

[12-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
or testing or *anything*

[12-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
ran it once, got what I wanted and stopped writing it

[12-Dec-18 12:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ran it once, got what I wanted and stopped writing it`
so, yes, I was right, you code like me 😛

[12-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Alright#0419
booo hooo "victim"

[12-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Alright#0419
the opposite of that from what I usually see 😂

I'd honestly bet $ that I notarized CFEK more often when I wasn't mining 😣

[12-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
Anyway, while this channel is active

[12-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
We have 2 more things to do

[12-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
wait for KMD hardfork and stress test momom

[12-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
and decide the notary change mechanism

[12-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Alright#0419
then LAUNCH

[12-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Alright#0419
🦄

[12-Dec-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and stress test momom`

[12-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Alright#0419
my proposed notary mechanism is 75% of top performing notaries keep their spot if they like. Bottom 25% can sign back up if they like along with new comers. New comers/notaries who lost their spot have to submit some garbage data that will let us rank them. We'll rank that garbage data based on a future BTC block hash. Top 5 in the list get a spot

[12-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Alright#0419
eh?

[12-Dec-18 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`75% of top performing notaries` based on what metric?

[12-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Alright#0419
tbd

[12-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
uptime + notarizations?

[12-Dec-18 12:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'tbd' = 1/2 a proposal 😛

[12-Dec-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing is counts, hopefully someone will.figure out the cheat :trollface:

[12-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
if we do only counts, it forces all notaries to notarize all chains

[12-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
which is not what we set out to do

[12-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe base it on % of notarizations for a given chain?

[12-Dec-18 12:20 AM] TonyL#3577
From which point this proposed mechanism have to start work?

[12-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
instead of just counts?

[12-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
2 months after launch @TonyL

[12-Dec-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notarisations counts only for the main chain ?

[12-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
oh yea that works

[12-Dec-18 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so maybe base it on % of notarizations for a given chain?`
imo, if that's the case, then we need to figure out why some do measurably better than others

[12-Dec-18 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to make it accurate

[12-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
it's "the weather"

{Reactions}
😂 

[12-Dec-18 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe % of notarisation is some kinda mandatory rule to remain the place

[12-Dec-18 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
And add some ecosystem contribution points

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I have wasted maybe 500h or something near that trying to work out that exact thing and failed and gave up

[12-Dec-18 12:22 AM] SHossain#0007

@blackjok3r is the staking mechanism and diff algo the same as for KMD?

I'm trying to sort out if the weights of CFEK naturally throw off the balance or there's a diff issue

[12-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean
