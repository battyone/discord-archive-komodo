that repo allows people to sync the chain, but it uses github assetchains.json right now..

[12-Oct-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as I get the server up though it can use that

[12-Oct-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or if the right chain is there, it can pull from chain, if the user has synced that chain.

[12-Oct-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
where is this TROLL dir

[12-Oct-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how you're grabbing just komodo-cli and komodod and putting them into the right directory

can you make it leave it in ~/StakedNotary/komodo/kvtroll/TROLL please

[12-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
with all of it's contents

[12-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why ?

[12-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
I want a place to put these scripts

[12-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
seems the best place to do it

[12-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
put them in the folder Ijut linked you pelase

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will update them to use the right shit

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is some trickery to make it get eh right branch from assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and stuff... its all mudular

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so changing assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will change EVERYTHING

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so no user has to worry about the extra branches

[12-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just work

we can have a script that serves the assetchains.sjon via an rpc call I think?

[12-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar... looked at it ...seems too hard ... will just do it the way I was going to... anaywya its late on a friday afteroon, I htink I am going to take some time off

made a really simple way to identify people by pubkey, you just need to set a name with `kvupdate <pubkey you'll use for oracle> <username> <largenumber> <password>`

[12-Oct-18 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Where can I look for info on using TROLLBOX?

[12-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
I'll have to make a readme for it

[12-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
I can walk you through how to use it right now if you like

[12-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
have an oracle on STAKEDB1

[12-Oct-18 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, if you don't mind!  
Either is ok üòÉ

[12-Oct-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
faucet was the first implementation that worked

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will probably be back in a few hours lol, nothing going on town is dead and wife went to city so got kids all weekend

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
you can certainly use the same validity check in the faucetget rpc as in the CC validation

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but the idea is that only 1 faucetget should be automatic

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but there was no way to ensure exactly 1, so I allow several

[12-Oct-18 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Couldn't work out how too, either way for this case just removing the new address requirements worked fi e

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
well if you do that, make sure to not call it faucet

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Command is get funds, it still mines

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe we make faucet configurable at create time

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can have faucets with different rules

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That would be good

[12-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but this is something I leave for a new CC dev to do

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright that's exactly how I was going to do the alias to pub key

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great job on beating me too it

@CrisF do
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesregister 742d2317a734fce4f6f99862dd878ed58538434dc855cd76879ad68be3f1bff4 1000000`

Do this^ a bunch of times. The number of times you do this is the number of messages you can send per block.

[12-Oct-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing that emptied my notary address of funds, use a different node

[12-Oct-18 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
after that save this
```
#!/bin/bash
orclid=742d2317a734fce4f6f99862dd878ed58538434dc855cd76879ad68be3f1bff4
chain=STAKEDB1
echo $1 > msg
xxd -p msg | tr -d '\n' > rawhex
hexraw=$(cat rawhex)
declen=$(($(xxd -p msg | tr -d '\n' | wc -c) / 2 ))
echo $declen
if [ $declen -lt 16 ]; then
        hexlen=$(echo "000$(printf '%x\n' $declen)")
elif [ $declen -lt 256 ]; then
        hexlen=$(echo "00$(printf '%x\n' $declen)")
elif [ $declen -lt 4096 ]; then
        hexlen=$(echo "0$(printf '%x\n' $declen)")
else
        hexlen=$(printf '%x\n' $declen)
fi
len=$(echo ${hexlen:2:2}${hexlen:0:2})
rawtx=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain oraclesdata $orclid $len$hexraw | jq -r .hex)
komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain sendrawtransaction $rawtx
```
This is the send script. Save it as something short like "s". Then you can send messages with `./s "this is a message"`

[12-Oct-18 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
open a separate terminal and run this script 
```

                        if [ "${message[$i]}" != "${latest[$i]}" ]; then
                                latest[$i]=${message[$i]}
                                        if [[ $n != 0 ]]; then

                                                if [[ $kv = "null" ]]; then
                                                        echo "[${pubsarray[$i]}]:${latest[$i]}"

        sleep 0.1

```

[12-Oct-18 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
also do `komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 kvupdate <pubkey> CrisF 1000 <password>`

[12-Oct-18 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
that will make your name show up in the chat instead of just pubkey

Just need to automate that start part to grab the pubkey from config.INI maybe ü§î

[12-Oct-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might have a go at implementing the oracle as a chatroom. On troll tonight

[12-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Alright#0419
it's already it's own chat room

[12-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Alright#0419
if you wanted a different room, make a different oracle

[12-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's what I meant... A way to make as many rooms as you like

[12-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using the same alias in each

[12-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using faucet to fund it

[12-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So u don't need to make heaps of oracle subscribes

[12-Oct-18 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF the second script

[12-Oct-18 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
make the first arg the chain name

[12-Oct-18 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
so `./<script> STAKEDB1`

[12-Oct-18 10:35 AM] CrisF#3405

Ok, just setting up through another pc so will take a bit.  Will ping .

[12-Oct-18 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
so right now to send a message, you have to do `./chatsend "<message>"` does anyone know how I could leave a shell open?

[12-Oct-18 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
so you could just type message and hit enter?
