I have an idea for a migrateion blaster... but tbh ... with 2-3 nodes it will fill blocks.

[09-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I got a very early hacky version working last night

[09-Jan-19 09:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
keen to look at it once ready for an eyeball

[09-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about it... and I think I can just make `fundrawtransaction` use the oldest utxos in the wallet first ...

[09-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What you do is sendmany yourself 2000 utxo on each chain, then send from one chain -> another and back ... running `cleanwallettranscations` perioodically.

[09-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pings the utxos between chains ....

how do we defend against migration spam? during bounty comp, I'm sure there'll be enough going on to defend against.

[09-Jan-19 09:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is there a point to doing that beyond brute testing?

[09-Jan-19 09:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just wandering if its worth documenting really

starting on another blog post for migrations, but dont want to TMI

[09-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Migrates take ages ... so spamming them isnt reall an issue I think... It takes a lot of effort and shit load of coins to spam them.

[09-Jan-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The change I made to let tiny migrate txs though yesterday (to fix tonys problem) should be reverted.... So you can only use more than like 1-2 coins for a migrate again.

[09-Jan-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No whale is going to spam the chain to death... They have finanical intrest not to do so.

no idea why... but I can look ...

[09-Jan-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
my logic was that process block is a pre-filter and that to be accepted a block will be fully validated again when connecting the tip

[09-Jan-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it must be setting a flag that it was validated and skipping a checkblock?

[09-Jan-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it shouldnt do that unless its a CC chain

[09-Jan-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
this code is for all chains

accept block is very early in the process, all sorts of blocks are accepted

[09-Jan-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking it is a two part bug

[09-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed

i just cant see if all tx in a block are checked how a tx v1 can sneak past

neither do I...

[09-Jan-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
which means, the checking is skipped in some cases

[09-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was the only place I seen where it was skipped

[09-Jan-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so how is there a block with tx v1 in the mainchain?

[09-Jan-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its definatly skipped in mempool, for CC chains... but should not be for blocks... unless this bug came from Verus merge or sapling itself

[09-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Got a question for a little bit other matter: want to add python UTXO checker/splitter to python migration script.
Why you count only 0.001 amount transactions here https://github.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary/blob/master/utxosplitter.sh#L49 ?

yes that is a method written in bash..,.. iguana actually has RPC to split...  for a while it was broken... So webworker and genie set that script up, as it works well I left it in.

[09-Jan-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the problem... reproduced on multiple chains and nodes now. Definatly this CC-EVAL is locking it up

[09-Jan-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there needs to be some new lock for mining and CC eval?

[09-Jan-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe yes.. lol I was litterally just thinking that

[09-Jan-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could the mutex and the LOCK conflict ?

[09-Jan-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like if we made the mutex a LOCK

[09-Jan-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what seems to be the problem is the miner (more threads there are the worse it gets ) locks cs_main and somehow when an import tx is received to the mempool it takes this path and ends up dead locking when it gets to the mutex

[09-Jan-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
another approach is to make sure the import isnt using anything with a lock main

[09-Jan-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i made a myGetTransaction that doesnt lock

[09-Jan-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can find what in the import validation is locking, that would be a cleaner way to solve it

[09-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wat does not make sends ois that the mempool is locked in the miner also, so I dont understand how its able to process the import at all.

[09-Jan-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
any CC validation is already locked

[09-Jan-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its strange, as there was a similar lock, that would do much the same thing (never backtraced it) that was for all tx not just CC's, that required locking cs_main and mempool.cs more often, now thats fixed I guess its exposed this problem. ONly happens when daemon PoW mining, dont think we ever saw it with PoS, but that could just have been luck.

[09-Jan-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
some function called by the CC validation is doing a lock

[09-Jan-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt be doing

[09-Jan-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
` <KOMODO_CC_mutex>` It stops here... so its inside this mutex another lock is called?
