It might be sending rpc commands intended for assetchains to KMD

[19-Feb-19 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats exactly what its doing

[19-Feb-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I couldnt find where... iut was late tho and as it was working i set it to do 500 and went to bed

[19-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
will check it out in a bit

[19-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
what changed?

[19-Feb-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks... I need to know if it was related to latest merge or not, very important

[19-Feb-19 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I merged FSM down, and there were lkike 900+ commits

[19-Feb-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also merged notarypay to master

[19-Feb-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and deletes all the other branches so we have a clean repo now

[19-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
nice

[19-Feb-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took a while. Everything appears to be working,  migrates on CFEK cluster are solid as far as I coul;d tell... the issue was on the script side not waiting long enough for them to finish

[19-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r do you know at what step of the process that is was throwing `ThreadRPCServer incorrect password attempt from 127.0.0.1:53892`

[19-Feb-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The first one where it creates the tx

[19-Feb-19 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe its just my system. Not sure just found it really strange that it was even possible

[19-Feb-19 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
I didn't try to run it yet, was just looking at the code to see where it gets confused

[19-Feb-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r where it creates the burn?

[19-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes the very first step, if you do like 5 exports at once then watch KMD debug.log. Please try it with non updated node first, then update to latest master and do it again. That will  help me a lot if its on daemon side. Not sure how the RPC stuff works, but there was a merge to bitcoin-cli.cpp that I didnt really know what it did, maybe I merged the wrong shit... All the cli stuff works tho, so not sure thats related.

[19-Feb-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
is it pressing? Would like to work on some KMD things if not

[19-Feb-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
I can't see how updating the daemon would change this behavior

[19-Feb-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah me either, I just really really wanted someon anyone. to do just 1 migrate and tell me if it does it on their system, but it seems 100% of ppl here have been too busy ðŸ˜¦

[19-Feb-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
itsd going to take me hours to setup a whole new VM just to build old commits, to test it... I have other more important things to be spending my time on... lkike the script works, it just should not be doing that, and may point to some other problem

[19-Feb-19 03:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I can give it a shot in the AM - i can afford some time for this project

[19-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm sure someone here already had everything set up to test it, and it would take them 5-10mins to do it. They just are not here atm. but if you want to do it go ahead ðŸ˜ƒ

[19-Feb-19 03:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I can walk over to my system

[19-Feb-19 03:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I just need to update

[19-Feb-19 03:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ill go sync it up and see how long it will take to sync

[19-Feb-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can give it a shot man, but Im not sure how good the docs are for those python scritps I was using. Shame I deleted all my old test VMs that did all these tests in bash... that wouuld haave ruled out whatever easily lol

[19-Feb-19 03:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ive drove over 50 hours this week....my brain is a little spent

[19-Feb-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, yeah i know what thats like

[19-Feb-19 03:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have no idea what you just said

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜‚ 

[19-Feb-19 03:53 AM] Alright#0419
I'll test it now @blackjok3r

[19-Feb-19 03:53 AM] Alright#0419
are dimxy chains working on latest master?

[19-Feb-19 03:54 AM] Alright#0419
that's all I can really test on atm

[19-Feb-19 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[19-Feb-19 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested this on those chains

[19-Feb-19 03:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Shit....please do alright ...i cant figure out which system i had it on...

[19-Feb-19 03:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ill try to keep updating when i am more awake

[19-Feb-19 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Did 500 migrates at once from DIMXY1->DIMXY2 but KMD debug.log just spammed that error, liek every RPC call was being sent to KMD and the assetchains aswell.

[19-Feb-19 04:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
is there a mobile app to update ubuntu via ssh or or whatever the fek you call it? i need to update in unusual locations and time zones

[19-Feb-19 04:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have no time to research this

[19-Feb-19 04:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
please reply with @kmdkrazy

[19-Feb-19 04:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im getting outta here - KMD is at .00025 BTC and hit 1 USD today and I am believing  .001  BTC by the end of the year and BTC will hodl at 15k in DEC

[19-Feb-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
how can we host a KMD node that allows for anyone to do `migrate_completeimporttransaction` to it?

[19-Feb-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
also need to think about if this is a security concern

[19-Feb-19 04:54 AM] Alright#0419
as far as I'm aware, none of the data would be sensitive

[19-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
What are you trying to do kmdkrazy?

[19-Feb-19 05:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe you could set me up with a cron job to update every 24 hours

[19-Feb-19 05:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
there has to be an easy script for that

[19-Feb-19 05:01 AM] Alright#0419
yea, there is

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
ðŸ˜ƒ

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats it? for your repo to?

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
along with occasional `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` and `sudo reboot`

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
AH no

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok then give me the cron script

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
thought you just meant apt things

[19-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
what is it you need to do for LABS?

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
you want to just run nodes? Didn't you give up your notary spot?

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
stay updated

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
I would say wait until after launch

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
these chains are meant to die

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i know

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
they are killing me

[19-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
why do you even want to run them?

[19-Feb-19 05:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i want to learn how to stay updated on any project I help with

[19-Feb-19 05:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
reading back 2 weeks does not work

[19-Feb-19 05:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
automated

[19-Feb-19 05:05 AM] Alright#0419
I do appreciate the effort, but things change day to day at the moment. Unless you're running a notary, there isn't really a point to running nodes right now

[19-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Alright#0419
after launch, it should be much much more stable

[19-Feb-19 05:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok...i will go back to lurking

[19-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
ðŸ˜ƒ if you want to test things, running CFEK nodes is good

[19-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
but just running them to run them doesn't make much sense atm

[19-Feb-19 05:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think i own 200000 cfek

[19-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
after launch, it definitely does help

[19-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
Maybe you should be our guinea pig "end user"

[19-Feb-19 05:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was on barterdex

[19-Feb-19 05:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
whats the diff

[19-Feb-19 05:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
1st end user to actually use it!

[19-Feb-19 05:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i might be able to give you my tx ids to prove it

[19-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
lol I believe you no worries

[19-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
but if you're asking what the difference is between LABS and barterdex.....

[19-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
what?

[19-Feb-19 05:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill be your pig any day

[19-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
ðŸ˜‰

[19-Feb-19 05:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
no.... im asking for a cron job setup to keep up

[19-Feb-19 05:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
for when im out of town

[19-Feb-19 05:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or a mobile app

[19-Feb-19 05:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
start.sh

[19-Feb-19 05:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
./

[19-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
sorry not sure

[19-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
I think simply cronning start.sh will keep you updated if you're a notary

[19-Feb-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
but we haven't put much focus on non-notary so far

[19-Feb-19 05:14 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im on bad sleep...... I will get pissed if I keep talking....im out....I love you guys.. keep up the incredible work you do

[19-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems like they are just a little old.... Like they are either being ignored by miners ... or never propagating to them.

[19-Feb-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like either something is setting the expiry height wrong.... Or they are just not propagating around as they should.

[19-Feb-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to try and make it print the whol tx because I cant get it from a node who wont accept it.

[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
My guess is not propagating properly

[19-Feb-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
