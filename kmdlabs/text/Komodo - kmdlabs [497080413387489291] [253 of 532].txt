@DavidFLX  There is no testnet for Komodo, you can compile komodo from source and either create your own chain to test or use BEER or PIZZA chain.

[28-Jan-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What do you want to do @DavidFLX

[28-Jan-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
our repos allow you to create an entire dPoW netowrk with notary nodes if thats what you want to do... not exactly cheap tho lol... its a lot of nodes

[28-Jan-19 12:06 PM] DavidFLX#2091
We want to launch an exchange soon and Komodo will be also in our portfolio

[28-Jan-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you just looking for somethign to simulate wallet functions?

[28-Jan-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
start a test chain

[28-Jan-19 12:07 PM] DavidFLX#2091
Correct

@blackjok3r each restart the tmpfile is cleared

[28-Jan-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so over time, tmp .blk stays relatively constant

[28-Jan-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. See this... Only bug left is when it starts the first time

[28-Jan-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt create the file... the first block it receives crashes it

[28-Jan-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once you restart its fine

[28-Jan-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to find where the path diverges

[28-Jan-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also wondering what happens when it fills tehj 128MB on sync... MGNX lo longer syncs with the changes to assets CC.

[28-Jan-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So have to try something else. Trying to solve crash first.

[28-Jan-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it should just keep making more tmp .blk files

[28-Jan-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[28-Jan-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be possible to use prune block code on those... so it only has 1

[28-Jan-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it just starts from 100000...

[28-Jan-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we might need to put in an exemption for MGNX

[28-Jan-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
block 20909 it stops

[28-Jan-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810

EVAL_CC for tokes fail

[28-Jan-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully not too many and we can add an MGNX height exemption for tokens CC

[28-Jan-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Got close to making a syncing chin cycle though 4 temp files...

[28-Jan-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you dont do something like this... syncing a china ther first time takes up 2x teh amount of space

[28-Jan-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Possible also to make temp file max size smaller. 😃

[28-Jan-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Any issues it might have should be the same as if the daemon is restarted and it sets the first file to null

[28-Jan-19 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might actaully be safer as it calls PruneOneBlockFile for the temp file...

[28-Jan-19 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So the index at least knows the block is no longer there

[28-Jan-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If this works fine, I think I can make it remove blocks from the index that were never included in the chain, during PruneOneBlockFile, by checking if the block is still in tempfile but not in the main chain.

[28-Jan-19 05:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesnt quite take into account notarisations... But not sure it needs to, with enough TempFile space.

[28-Jan-19 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think anyone would notice if MGNX just simply disappeared

[28-Jan-19 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You figured out how to do the PoS attack yet... I think I have a perfect fix 😃 I cant test it properly without invalid blocks.

[28-Jan-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
they abandoned it, why should we continue to spend time on it

[28-Jan-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
I cannot figure out how to hold back a block without flat out killing the network

trying to packet sniff now

[28-Jan-19 06:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I dont think we need to... I disabled some validation that shoulda llow just blocks that have a no fee tx at the end in as a valid PoS block until ConnectBlock... seems to work just fine, until someone spams heaps of fake blocks at it...

[28-Jan-19 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why should we continue to spend time on it`
because I have too many to just throw away 😡

[28-Jan-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But that shouldnt matter because it just saves invalid blocks and then doesnt add them to the main chain if it doesn pass conenct block and eventually they are over written

@blackjok3r I think if you're saving them at all, it's a problem

[28-Jan-19 06:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt keep them

[28-Jan-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It uses 4x16MB files (atm can cahnge size) and just saves all incoming block IN ONLY THESE 4 files

[28-Jan-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on connect block it adds it to the main chain

[28-Jan-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
garbage is just over written

[28-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
what about sustained attack?

CPU RAM loads

[28-Jan-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be fine

[28-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant say for sure coz this PC is reallyt fast but syncing aZEX is just as fast as without it

[28-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the more fake blocks the more file operations

[28-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could slow it down on like HDDs maybe

[28-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
I really need to get this working

[28-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
kind of going in circles

[28-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
tried like 15 dirty hacks to try to hold back a block and stay connected

[28-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you need to... just make every utxo elegible .. it will make a block evey 30s... I dont think it can go faster ... maybe use more nodes?

[28-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can make the diff liek 0 too

[28-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@LabsAssistant 
good new and bad news
Bad news, we would like to delay launch..

Good news, we think we have a much better solution to the pay per notarization problem along with the buy pressure problem.

We wish we could have seen this earlier. We got the idea while looking at OUR. We realized how cool having a dynamic coinbase based on transactions within the block is. 

The idea here is that:
The notary pay per notarization will happen in the coinbase of the block the notarization is included in. The POW/POS rewards will remain unaffected, but additional vouts(and coins) will be added to the coinbase.

the 10% or 22%, whatever is decided will solely to paid for LABS->KMD notarizations. Notarizations on fungible chains will be paid for by the creator of the chain.

We will have two new ac_params, -ac_notarypay and -ac_dead. ac_notarypay is the amount the notary will receive in the coinbase transaction for each notarization made on the chain. ac_dead is blockheight at which the chain will die. Consensus rules will dictate that any height above this is invalid. ac_dead is required because the chain creator must pre pay notarization fees for the duration of the chain. We may look into ways of being able to "refill" these funds. The proposed mechanism right now is that chain creator will burn block 1 amount *and* notarization fee amount for the duration of the chain. The amount burned for notarization fees will then slowly be recreated by each notarization on the chain. Once this amount has been fully recreated, the chain must die.(or fees refilled, but this could be complicated)

By requiring every fungible chain to have ac_notarypay, we can allow notaries to choose whether or not they will notarize a chain based on ac_notarypay amount. We hope this will lead to a free market for notarization fees for fungible chains.

If you guys are on board with this, we will solely prioritize this feature and launch as soon as we believe it's stable.

[28-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
This means we would only need a chain like PAYME for bounty payout mechanism. Notaries wouldn't have to fuck about with multisig transactions in order to be paid. Especially don't feel like building this notary payout mechanism knowing we will immediately be deprecating it for something better.

That sound very cool!

[28-Jan-19 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Is ` -ac_notarypay` presets in native chain coins?

[28-Jan-19 09:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that it's kinda PPN (pay per notarisation) model where chain paying for each notarisation event separate?

Thx

[28-Jan-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
If change `-ac_notarypay` on fly - such securing solution seems not secure for chains creators since they are slavery and notaries might stop notarisation when they want.
If `-ac_notarypay` sets only once when majority of notaries are agree and can't be reconsidered - it might be absurdly high or absurdly low depends of coins price fluctuations and not cover notaries hardware/maintaining.
But maybe I'm missing point totally because sleepy.

[28-Jan-19 09:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All chains are LABS coin....

[28-Jan-19 09:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries get % of LABS, and each notarisation on other chain pays ~0.1-0.2 Maybe a bit less per notarisation in the coinbase to the notaries who made it.

[28-Jan-19 09:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They would need to consolidate funds before migrating...

[28-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL this assumes that most chains will be short term(couple months at most)

[28-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
we can accommodate more permanent chains, but I feel we shouldn't have many

[28-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand what you mean by slavery

[28-Jan-19 10:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, now it's more clear. So it's kinda "notarisation contract" for some time

[28-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[28-Jan-19 10:13 PM] TonyL#3577
I've used this "slavery" term with long term / permanent chains in mind

[28-Jan-19 10:14 PM] TonyL#3577
With such scheme notaries may make the price very high on some point and chain will be supposed to pay to not be unprotected for some time

[28-Jan-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
this solves buying pressure issue, solves multisig for payouts issues, solves determining the "best" notaries for reelection

[28-Jan-19 10:15 PM] Alright#0419
it takes 6 notaries to notarize

[28-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
notaries overcharging will hurt the chain overall, I think it's in their best interest to keep it reasonable

[28-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
it only takes 6 reasonable notaries

[28-Jan-19 10:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Notarisations by subscription with pre-set price - it's very cool and creates open market, thank you for explanation!

[28-Jan-19 10:23 PM] TonyL#3577
With many competing market players/ notarisation clusters price should form not random and clusters will try to be cost-effective and provide best service, agree with @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 seems super huge if dPOW concept spread a lot

[28-Jan-19 10:24 PM] Alright#0419
this mechanism only really works on the assumption that the chain will only last for a given amount of blocks

[28-Jan-19 10:24 PM] Alright#0419
so only seems practical for a cluster
