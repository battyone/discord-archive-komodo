`0 NANOSEND.2910 STAKEDPERC.27490 channel.00000000 (2871) pax.1348b348 datalen.0 (-1 0) (-1 0) recv.1` this is somethign I have never seen before

[10-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume its becasuse its node 0 ...

[10-Oct-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it has extra print outs... but never seen them on even this node before

[10-Oct-18 08:22 AM] CMaurice#1685
yepyep those errors roughly doubled

[10-Oct-18 08:22 AM] CrisF#3405
What should I be looking for?

[10-Oct-18 08:22 AM] CrisF#3405
(apart from the above)

[10-Oct-18 08:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
I'm just watching debug.log

[10-Oct-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those will also be showing in iguana I think

[10-Oct-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or something similar

[10-Oct-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cris you wont see what I just posted... it should only show on my 0 node

[10-Oct-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 nodes now on newest verison ...

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
I see where the log is started in start_iguana.sh, but can't find the actual log

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt have a log

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just rpints to stdout

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you need to start it in tmux or screen

[10-Oct-18 08:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
ah, yeah, going to /dev/null I think

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah those are for the coin deamons, for notary we are not concerned with them at all, as long as they are running its fine

[10-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we only need to see iguana stdout for notary

[10-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 nodes updated, and both now refuse to notarise

[10-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to keep going as mainnet was simlar, its a hard forking change

[10-Oct-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice Is your Notary name `alrighttest1`?

[10-Oct-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( 1 && bp->myind == 0 && dispflag != 0 )
        {
            printf("%s.%d RECV.%-2d %llx (%2d %llx) %llx/%llx matches.%-2d best.%-2d %s\n",dp->symbol,bp->height,senderind,(long long)np->recvmask,(int8_t)np->bestk,(long long)np->bestmask,(long long)np->srcutxo.txid,(long long)np->destutxo.txid,matches,bestmatches,Notaries_elected[senderind][0]);
        }```
This is the print I am seeing, james only added it just in the last update, must heve been his debug for the newest change.

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] CMaurice#1685
@CrisF nope, not sure where it's named

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that is his yes

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] CMaurice#1685
oh

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think your node is 17

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or 16 becasues ti starts at 0

[10-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
theres a dupe key in there, kmdcrasy and one of mine

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Oct-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so one of my nodes identifies as him

[10-Oct-18 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice I'm seeing it in the `mask` script.

[10-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahve updated all my nodes, the node number 0 is not notariseing

[10-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how is your nodes?

[10-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you also need to update to this branch

[10-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep there we go I am notarising

[10-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need you guys to tell me what your nodes are doing please if you can ?

[10-Oct-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator if your avalible at all ?

[10-Oct-18 08:45 AM] CMaurice#1685
last notorisation at 8:44:51

[10-Oct-18 08:46 AM] CMaurice#1685
8:45:51

[10-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok what you need to do to update is :
1) cd ~/SuperNET 
2) git pull
3) git checkout staked
4) cd ~/StakedNotary; git pull
5) ./build_iguana
6) pkill -15 iguana
7) start.sh

[10-Oct-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should get your nodes working and on track.

[10-Oct-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I put all myt nodes on a broken version that only worked with each other it seems...

[10-Oct-18 08:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm 9~20 minutes ago

[10-Oct-18 08:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Seeing a few notarizations though.

[10-Oct-18 08:48 AM] CrisF#3405
updating

[10-Oct-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think we dont have enough nodes to cause what happened on mainnet... but with 2 competing veriions we can have paralell notarisations

[10-Oct-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whic is just a waste of KMD

[10-Oct-18 08:50 AM] CMaurice#1685
no need to pull StakedNotary?

[10-Oct-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to change branch, follow that step by step you cannot fail, I just did 4 nodes like that

[10-Oct-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no need to pull staked notary, but it wont hurt... there are some updates in it actually so yes do that

[10-Oct-18 08:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
Missing komodo.conf, but script continuing

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, the old version of start.sh

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will do that

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if a daemon is not running it tries to stop it

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
regardless

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or if you have never ran it,

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes notary 0 gets more prints

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lots more, but its notarising once I got 4 nodes updated

[10-Oct-18 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until 4 were updated none updated nodes worked

[10-Oct-18 08:54 AM] CMaurice#1685
seems ok, I gotta run, laters

[10-Oct-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
great

[10-Oct-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems smk is on the old version, hopefuly he shows up in a few hours time to report what his node is doing

[10-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it makes sense that the new version is a hardfork as it latches onto the first bestk, which means normally the bestk wasnt stable

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Oct-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is definatly a hard fork, but if you update all nodes fast enough, it goes very somothly

[10-Oct-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have only one node lefft on old version, it was very lucky everyone happened to be here t the right time, I would ave liked one of mine to be on old version but smk is smart, we will be able to report what is happening on his end.

great no rush man, thanks for checking in

[10-Oct-18 09:07 AM] CrisF#3405
That went very smoothly from here.

[10-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes the new start.sh is very good... It was never designed to change iguana branches, but i dont think we will ever have to again.

[10-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are a few lines of code in start.sh that are only there for backwards compatibility with the cirrent nodes, which need sudo, those will be removed at some point, once I know everyone has ran it at least once.

[10-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we can crontab it, and out nodes will be automatic updating üòÑ

[10-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at some point I need to try and get Alrights oracles assetchains.json working, but to mee it seems a bit like chicken and egg... you need a chain running before you can retreive the file from the chain üòÇ

[10-Oct-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
use a reference chain

[10-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which means we need a `master chain` of some kind

[10-Oct-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
one that you know will be around

[10-Oct-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[10-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess that would be the STAKED chain .. that wll be the `main chain`

[10-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that all other chains send their coins to for trading etc.

[10-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now I will probably store it on TROLL as thats the smallest chain, and with ondeman blocks, should grow the least.

[10-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TROLL is also extremly fast.

[10-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will never be in the cluster so likely we can keep it all the way though, unless we need to restart it for some faluire.

[10-Oct-18 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Is TROLL quite a secure chain?

[10-Oct-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hell no

[10-Oct-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it has dPOW

[10-Oct-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the same as any other dpow chain, once a notarisation has happened its secure

[10-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT its on demand blocks, and still freq=5 so blocs can happen, and notarisations not... I know how to fix that, but for now its still a test chain, unless it proves stable enough to keep.

[10-Oct-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
speaking of TROLL... i guess now I can actually go work on it, 10H after I got up this morning to work on it üòÇ

[10-Oct-18 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405
haha

[10-Oct-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm that ./checkmasks script is wikid broken

[10-Oct-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt work here at all

[10-Oct-18 09:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, mine, too.  Just using the curl.

[10-Oct-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they seem to be working on mainnet ok, will need to look into that... adding it to the trello so I dont forget

Shouldn't be too hard, I found a `How to Learn Python in Five Minutes` video üòú

Might as well get those 3 minute abs while I'm at it.

[10-Oct-18 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha yeah had a chat with TonyL this arvo about his TUI for CC's ... python is the go there.

[10-Oct-18 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For staked testing, we will be testing CC's ... a nice python TUI or even GUI will make the second stage of testing much easier
