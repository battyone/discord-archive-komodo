[02-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really... 6 nodes can just make a tx signed by 6 nodes with no OP_RETURN data and then the chain will stop

[02-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
more validation is needed before the coinbase is created... working on it

[02-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`else if ( fNotarisationBlock && ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY != 0 && pblock->vtx[1].vout.size() == 2 && pblock->vtx[1].vout[1].nValue == 0 )` makes the issue at least msotly go away

[02-Feb-19 10:05 AM] jorian#4555
so you're solving a problem that will only occur when for whatever reason 6 nodes sign a tx with no OP_RETURN? i think that would be an attack on LABS right?

[02-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... but it could happen if iguana does somethign weird

[02-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain can stop dead... that si very bad

[02-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jorian#4555
the same iguana we've been using for KMD notarisations?

[02-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
better to just not let that happen

[02-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jorian#4555
or did you change it so much you need to add safeguards? üòõ

[02-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also we can make the notarisation paymetns a linear coin emission this way... before it was random

[02-Feb-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no tis much the same... but you cant assume things wont happen.. if the outcome of them is this bad

[02-Feb-19 10:08 AM] jorian#4555
how many more of these 'things' are you going to fix before LABS goes live?

[02-Feb-19 10:08 AM] jorian#4555
and that's not meant as an insult or something

[02-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... to be fair tis not me who keeps chainging how it works

[02-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just have to amke it work

[02-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jorian#4555
who is? james?

it's better to fuck up now than after launch

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exacatly ...

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can rush a launch

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jorian#4555
how do we know we fucked up

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then jsut need to do it again if it doesnt work

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have a testnet... so we should use it

[02-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Feb-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
we saw an objectively better payout mechanism, so we weren't going to build an inferior one just to deprecate it immediately

[02-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*sick of making things that are not being used*

[02-Feb-19 10:12 AM] jorian#4555
can imagine

[02-Feb-19 10:13 AM] jorian#4555
so the first pinned message is still how it's going to be?

[02-Feb-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretyy much yes... 
the notary pay chain is working, it will just have a linear emission this way... if notaris notarise faster or slower, they will get the same amount... 
As you know a notarisation doesnt happene very 5 blocks... somtimes its longer than that for whatever reason... So now if the last ntoarisation was 10 blocks ago, you get paid 2x the amount.

[02-Feb-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If notaries try to "print coins" by notarisaing faster than freq =5 , then tehy will just get paid less per notarization

[02-Feb-19 10:18 AM] jorian#4555
notarising faster would need all these nodes having code that has freq = 2 or sth?

[02-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... The problem is, that only 6 notaries need to do that...

[02-Feb-19 10:18 AM] jorian#4555
i think you're overestimating the possibility of colluding nodes..

[02-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
6 nodes is not very many

[02-Feb-19 10:19 AM] jorian#4555
for LABS, what are the chances?

[02-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think having a set coin emission rather than one that cna chanmge is much better

[02-Feb-19 10:19 AM] jorian#4555
i think every notary here wants LABS to succeed

[02-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Making it safer and better is better than not doing that

[02-Feb-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm mostly thingking of "centralisation FUD"

[02-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jorian#4555
because it's going to be the testnet of KMD, so to say

[02-Feb-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if we can mitigate as much of that as piossible...

[02-Feb-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should do so

[02-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jorian#4555
yeah but i think you can do it too much. i don't want to say it, but i'm going to: it's just for testing

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly... the  fungible chains are... but LABS isnt

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] jorian#4555
and don't get me wrong, you're doing awesome work, not gonna shit on that

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
not at all "just for testing"

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
have a contract and don't want to start your own coin for it?

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
LABS

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] jorian#4555
LABS has an implicit description

[02-Feb-19 10:21 AM] jorian#4555
a place to fuck up

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555

trial by fire on CCs

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't mean it's all fire though

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
it could be me or did the meaning of LABS change over time?

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
LABS is there to test CC

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
for devs, new to KMD

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
It is

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] jorian#4555
so why is it not just for testing?

[02-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
but does that prevent you from using a useful CC on it?

[02-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Labs is the laboratory - sub chains are the experiments?

[02-Feb-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
We have something unique in that our CCs aren't compulsory consensus rules. Not interested in a CC? Don't sync the chain for it.

[02-Feb-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
every other chain must hard fork to add CCs, we do not

[02-Feb-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
why would we not take advantage of this @jorian

[02-Feb-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM is cool as shit... and nobody is using it... If dont do this properly... no body will ever use it... its ont thing to just do migerates and go wow cool... its a totally diffrent thing to make it acutally usedful and not full of attack vectors

[02-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once we do this first... other people will be able to use it... Not to mention Martketing can say "this actually works go use it"

[02-Feb-19 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
ok ok, keep it up then, i wasn't here üòÖ

[02-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its cool man. I understand I just want to launch it too... this has taken like a year, when ti was supposed to take a few weeks

[02-Feb-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notary test has 3 ntoarisation in the chain that failed validation lol...

And thats without anyone colluding...

[02-Feb-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with this enabled the MoMoM fix that scans 100 blocks, isnt needed either... but it might not be a great idea to revert it before launch... would need to CFEK it first to make sure. üòÑ

[02-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notarisations on NOTARYTEST are very  slow.... 10-15 blocks apart ... wonder if its because of the staker reorging too much or juast not enough nodes runnign it. ü§î

`Notary test has 3 ntoarisation in the chain that failed validation lol...

So, stop feken up the code :troll:

[02-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt...

[02-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Those are 3 notariations that iguana made

[02-Feb-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that are simply not valid

[02-Feb-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess the old validation didnt really work, as it was letting them in as valid.

[02-Feb-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not valid because they are not valid or not valid because not tx1?

[02-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not valid... Ie i found where komodod does it validation... and managed to flag a boolean to call it for a "justcheck" so I can now validate a notarisation in the miner

[02-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Basicvally... to create the coinbase that pays notaries, the notarisation must be an actaul ntoarisation that creates a check point

[02-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that notarisation isnt valid, it doesnt create any special coinbase that notarisation is just a normal trancation

[02-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The validation code uses the notarisation to create the coinbase with the exact same function, then it compares the pubkeys, and the amounts to amke sure they are the same. Doesnt seem a way to cheat it now.. EVER...

[02-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We do however need a new chain üò¶ unless I just remvoe validation on this one and height activate the new payment...

[02-Feb-19 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
im confused. Did you find a way to kill the schrodinger notarisation?

[02-Feb-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[02-Feb-19 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

How do you mean?

[02-Feb-19 12:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sounds kind of quantum. I'm scared

[02-Feb-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its wasn;t that hard... it just took a while to work out how komodod was actually validating notarisations

[02-Feb-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
good to have a solution. Love the black hat paranoia to anticipate the problem. I'm not scared anymore.

[02-Feb-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I like to make things that cant be broken... So when making it I usually try and think how I would break it as I go along

[02-Feb-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think anyone really understood what I was saying the problem was lol

Miners can not create our coinbase.... I wonder if there is a way to force them to do so....

[02-Feb-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like they can ignore the fact a notrisation exists... and just mine a normal block
