Hi, rather than `LabsAssistant`, how about just `Labs` or `KMDLabs`?
What do you think @jorian @Alright ?

[20-May-19 10:38 PM] CrisF#3405
(It just sounds a bit cooler to me, haha)

i just bootstrapped into KMD, can post a refresher if anyone needs

[21-May-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed another update to LABS, to enable it to sync PIRATE. 😃 No need to update really. 
If someone else can sync KMD from scratch with LABS komodo that would be good. I managed a sync form block 0 to 98% in about 4H or so, seems a bit faster than it has been in the past. Appears to also work fine.

[21-May-19 03:15 AM] Exile13#4458
i was trying to sync from scratch but my daemon kept stopping

[21-May-19 03:15 AM] Exile13#4458

please dont bootstrap if it doesnt sync...

[21-May-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats just bypassing some bug

[21-May-19 03:17 AM] Exile13#4458
oh, on the walkthrough it advises to bootstrap

[21-May-19 03:17 AM] Exile13#4458
my fault

[21-May-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We shouod steer clear from that now we are miving away from testnet to production.

[21-May-19 03:17 AM] Exile13#4458
should i build now

[21-May-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just sync KMD from scratch by running `./komodod` after updating.

[21-May-19 03:18 AM] Exile13#4458
ok

[21-May-19 03:18 AM] Exile13#4458
rm chainstate again

[21-May-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it yesterday and it synced fine

[21-May-19 03:18 AM] Exile13#4458
maybe its my VPS? taht was mentioned in the walkthrough

[21-May-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just wipe `~/.komodo` and start again. If possible. Just need someone else to confirm KMD syncs with the latest code

[21-May-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont know hwo to just leave this task for someone else

[21-May-19 03:19 AM] Exile13#4458
can you give the command for wipe 😅

[21-May-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`cd`
`rm -rf .komodo`

[21-May-19 03:19 AM] Exile13#4458
ty

[21-May-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my advice is probably to also remove `~/komodo`

[21-May-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and run `buildkomodo.sh` script again aswell.

[21-May-19 03:20 AM] Exile13#4458
so `rm -rf /komodo` as well

[21-May-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes otherwise I think its going to complain about missing conf files

[21-May-19 03:20 AM] Exile13#4458
ty

[21-May-19 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rm -rf ~/komodo

[21-May-19 03:22 AM] Exile13#4458
ok

[21-May-19 03:22 AM] Exile13#4458
then back to StakedNotary/install and buildkomodo.sh

[21-May-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes 😃

[21-May-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
interested also if it builds from scratch

[21-May-19 03:25 AM] Exile13#4458
i may of seen an error the first time and passed over it

[21-May-19 03:25 AM] Exile13#4458
:/

[21-May-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt really matter that mucxh, got a feeling buildkomodo.sh wont actually wrok, because KMD usually needs 3 calls to `make` toa ctualyl build... but we shall see

[21-May-19 03:26 AM] Exile13#4458
no smoke yet

[21-May-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will take a fair while

[21-May-19 03:29 AM] Exile13#4458
did you write this?

[21-May-19 03:29 AM] Exile13#4458
or help to?

[21-May-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
write what lol?

[21-May-19 03:56 AM] Exile13#4458
the komodo script

[21-May-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
running `./start.sh` and checking chians are in sync

[21-May-19 03:57 AM] Exile13#4458
KMD, CFEKORKL, LABSRCTEST, and CFEKORC are running

[21-May-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will take a while to sync, for me about 5h maybe a bit less for kmd. And yes I wrote most of the staked notary scripts, some are adapted from others work

[21-May-19 04:47 AM] Exile13#4458
WOW!!

[21-May-19 04:47 AM] Exile13#4458
im at 15% KMD

[21-May-19 04:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can kick off a resycn. is it enough to just del chainstate, blocks etc?

[21-May-19 04:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or did you want a completely fresh start?

[21-May-19 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we are at eh stage now where we should be testing full reinstall from scratch and a full sync of all chains.Dont need everyone to do this obviously. But it would be better for new people to do it, so we can fix any instructions etc.

[21-May-19 05:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
everytime i visit ~/.komodo I see about 12 OLD testchains I forgot about 😄

labs 

[21-May-19 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[21-May-19 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to suck wipeing the entire thing in next few days 😦

`[KMD] .100% 1913 of 1365077`

👀 

[21-May-19 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the % of the script compared to the % in debug.log is very diffrent

[21-May-19 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think gebug.log somehow goes by transactions, and the script goes by blocks. 
I think KMD sync time is improved quite a bit from what it was  few months ago.

[21-May-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I just checked my ZEXO and LABSRCTEST staking nodes, the wallet fix is finally working too... It still creates those phantom transactions.... but I thinkthe work arounds are finally working as expected.

`[KMD] 21.900% 299404 of 1365082`

[21-May-19 06:13 AM] Exile13#4458
started erroring after `459321 of 1365122` `error: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)`
was that a local disconnect?

[21-May-19 06:18 AM] Exile13#4458
then `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7776: Connection refused
`

[21-May-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like it crashed.

[21-May-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
check disk space,. then restart manually.

[21-May-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just `cd ~/komodo/src`

[21-May-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then `./komodod`

[21-May-19 06:25 AM] Exile13#4458
ok

[21-May-19 06:26 AM] Exile13#4458
i think i started a fork , kmd is building from 0 at 2019-5-21

[21-May-19 06:26 AM] Exile13#4458
lol

[21-May-19 06:26 AM] Exile13#4458
./stop.sh wont work lol

[21-May-19 06:27 AM] Exile13#4458
