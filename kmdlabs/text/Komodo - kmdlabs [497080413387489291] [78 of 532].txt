OK, I'll mix them up.

[10-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking maybe to make a random amount for each migrate coin ... but Im not 100% sure thats realy needed... we already know that having too many utxo's in a single tx will stop the export from working... As long as every export that happens, results in a confirmed import, then everything is good... burns MUST result in imports every time...

[10-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will at some stage, need a proper script/GUI for migrates that tells the user what is happening, and saves the hex from each step so that they can recover the process if it fails for some reason (daemon crash, chain fork etc)

I am using those... right now and htey appear working/... the stdout is a little annoying.. I really dont like how it floods momom-check-fails on every single migrate, even if its works üòÇ

[10-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ALthough I am really not sure how to deal with that apart form removing the error al together ...

[10-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess the JSON return can have the error instead only if the import fails ... Will try and figure somehting out there later on... massiv storm just rolled in here, not sure If I should turn all computers off lol

[10-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes difinatly... lights dimming ü§£

[10-Nov-18 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Figure it's a good idea to do random amount loops.  Not something I'm able to code atm though.

[10-Nov-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Assuming you have a crazy amount of balance on each chain:
```
 amount=$(( RANDOM % 1000 + 1 ))```

[10-Nov-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
random amount between 1 and 1000

[10-Nov-18 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I guess @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator's `balance script would have somewhat random amounts  being sent.

[10-Nov-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... It should do too ... I never really got to use those... So just stuck with mine

[10-Nov-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it gathered the data I needed to fix the bugs .. there is ikely much better way to test now, as we need to test all kinds of things if possible.

[10-Nov-18 08:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I'll give a few regular one's a go then try random.

[10-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We are now up to the part of testing where we need to try and break it

[10-Nov-18 08:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I've got my nodes reset and am almost ready to go.

[10-Nov-18 08:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Want to check out whether my ING node is able to send. I'm wondering if it was due to not running `libscottFIX komodo`.

[10-Nov-18 08:36 AM] CrisF#3405
It's now up on the send and receive nodes.

[10-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all chains incuding KMD should be on master

[10-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from StakedChain/komodo

[10-Nov-18 08:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I'll have to change that then.  I was doing that before.  Started with `staked/komdod/...` this time.

[10-Nov-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked/komodo/master/komodod should be the right binary

[10-Nov-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing `./start.sh CFEK`

[10-Nov-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will build it

[10-Nov-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The staked repo does need some work, but I am not sure exactly how to go about it

[10-Nov-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll start do that.

[10-Nov-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the migrates need to be much eaier to use.

[10-Nov-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
They are a really important feature for sure.

[10-Nov-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly what sets staked apart from any other coin üòâ

[10-Nov-18 08:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, and some amazing powers will come from that eh.

@blackjok3r if you make wallet ignore 0 sat coinbase vouts, please don't make it ignore all 0 sat vouts

[10-Nov-18 09:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure my more eccentric migrate scripts are up to date, but I have a simple TUI for single migrates between a selected pair of whatever user input value which works

[10-Nov-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( tx.IsCoinBase() && tx.vout[0].nValue == 0 )
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "ZERO sat coinbase, ignored!\n");
            return false;
        }``` 
This should do it I think... will test shortly.

struggling to optimise gps hardware battery consumption. Should be able to make unit sleep for some time, but it doesnt want to publish when it wakes up. not sure yet why, got some work to do debugging that. Decided to switch over to front end and finish porting to py3

I'm intrigued by the competitive "Notary as a Service" ecosystem. I'm wondering if delegated proof of stake could become a factor? Good bearing and strong winds towards the decentralislands! :pirate:

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[10-Nov-18 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure I'm using the right term... I mean in an ocean of possible notaries, there could be shifting alliances, or overlaps of territory? and those seeking notarisation would be motivated by both cost and reputation, so the election cycle could be perpetual. Essentially the notary's stake is delegated by those subscribed to it's services..

[10-Nov-18 09:29 AM] Alright#0419
I was considering splitting the notaries into two arbitrary groups that would compete against each other for an extra % of the payout

[10-Nov-18 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or am I just a little too long in the sun and delirious?

[10-Nov-18 09:29 AM] Alright#0419
along with encouraging more groups to form

[10-Nov-18 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
logistics of additional groups would be very annoying, but two competing groups would work fine with current setup

[10-Nov-18 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so it's more competing unions than nation states politics?

[10-Nov-18 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Was it NutellaLicka who was talking about creating a notary service?

[10-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure ... but staked will be able to provide that ... I dont think we cna have 1 cluster notarised by two groups though

[10-Nov-18 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
don't see why not

[10-Nov-18 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
you just *say* their in different groups and determine the payouts based on that

[10-Nov-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just trying to figure out how the code works... like areyou keeping the same set of pubkeys, and all notries on the same iguana port.... or using a diff iguana port, and diffretn pubkeys ... you cant have 2 diff gropus of pubkeys notarising the same chain...

[10-Nov-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either in komodod or in staked.jsn

[10-Nov-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
no code üòõ

[10-Nov-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
literally just change the payouts based on it

[10-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
Group A has more notarizations this week, so they got 10% extra and group B got 10% less

[10-Nov-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Welll.... I have 2 notries in this testnet ... 1 has 24 CPU cores nad 64GB of ram, but is in Perth WA ... and th eother is a $20 VULTR 2 core 4Gb VPS ... and the VULTR has 2x the amaount of notarisations ...

[10-Nov-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you amke it too competetive ... every single notary will be on the same provider, in the same DC.

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, was just an idea

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
competition is a good thing though

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe a geographic handicap should be applied?

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
hard to enforce

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
if not impossible

[10-Nov-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its just how iguana works ... fixing it to make the notarisations more reliabel ... made the probelm even worse üò¶

[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but i would rather have it working properly, than having more distributed nodes ... at least for now.

[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you mean everyone will sppof ip to pretend to be in the best handicap zone ? :yassinheartbroken:

[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to change how iguana makes the notriastions so that distance between nodes is less of an issue ... but tis really really ahrd to do

[10-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
I would üòà

[10-Nov-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean if we had 100 chains ... thats where y large srver would over take smaller ones... as a smaller VPS would need to choose the best/most profitable chains to notarise... where as I can just take all fo them, not caring about what they are or fuck all... my monthly cost is $0, as it shares a KMD notary server.

[10-Nov-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so there are things like tat to consider too ...

[10-Nov-18 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
So other options to incentivize NNs that won't make things overly competitive are needed.

[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well we are already making it per notarisation... which will encorage people to chase the highest counts as it is, it might be better to say if you have over x% of notarisations you get y% capped at z% ... so nodes who are up and notarising get equal share

[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or something

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like make it so that nodes under a certain threshold of notarisations get paid per, if over that threshold, its a fixed payment.

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then everyone is shooting for average

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Alright#0419
so punish good ops?

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its got nothing to do wit ops

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
over a certain % all it is is node location

[10-Nov-18 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
so find best location üòõ

[10-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then all the nodes end up there

[10-Nov-18 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
so?

[10-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the counts end up all the average

[10-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and if that on DC goes down so doe the whoe network

[10-Nov-18 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
if hetzner(for example) DCs *goes down*, there will be much worse things than our notaries not notarizing

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all im saying is if you want the netowrk to be decerntalised/distributed and safe ... you cant have all the nodes in the same DC. .. which is exactly what will happen if you make it too comeptitive wothotut some rule stopping them all being in the same DC

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
I doubt people will truly bother to shop around for DCs

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
perhaps, we cna group nodes who are NOT sharing a DC

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] CrisF#3405
So a system that incentivizes, but takes into account what's best for the network.

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and make those comepte with each other for extra %

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
how to enforce?

[10-Nov-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can form a group ... as long as your not in the same DC

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
vpn tho

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
vpn will slow it down so much you would throw awya all advantage

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
not necessarily

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
vpn can speed things up in some situations

[10-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are talking 10ms here

[10-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one thing ive been thinking about ... but it dost seem easy to acomplish .. .that is each node would ping the others periodically... and i UNDER some ms avergae respose time, refuse to conenct

[10-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so noces litterally cant be too close...

[10-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they have to be placed far apart

[10-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt matter where ... as long as they are far enough from some percentage of nodes
