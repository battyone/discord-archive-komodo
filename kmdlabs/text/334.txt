copyt pasted some code around to make iguana fetch its init JSON on each dPoW round. 
Seems to work. Might slow it down a tiny bit, but now we no longer need to restart iguana to change era. The daemon just needs updating before the timestamp and it will just do undefined shit around era change over. 
Which is fine, as long as it doesnt crash ...

[15-Mar-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So @Mylo  we need to add you and change era to test this.

might have just solved the iguana memory leak ... but not 100% sure. I removed all the other loops that dpow doesnt need and put it into its own loop. So now iguana ONLY does dPoW 
this will be a good start. There was possible that it was creating a new dp block every single round, and that was never freed...

[15-Mar-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well to understand it, its best to just start commenting out everything that looks not relevent and then seeing if it still works

[15-Mar-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like im making some progress

[15-Mar-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man when you start it now. there is liek 10 prints of thing that start instead of liek 30 of them that did nothing

[15-Mar-19 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have NN_CONNECT so its a good start

[15-Mar-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likey iguana just for dPoW would be a few thousand lines... 80% of it seems not requred for dPoW

how should I know  if it imporves anything. It will take an entire week to know anything

[15-Mar-19 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I kind of understand whats happening with the memleak too. I think it will require more changes still .

[15-Mar-19 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it jsut doesnt free anything. for sure

[15-Mar-19 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the thing that does it litterally doesnt work at all

its broken, totally 100% broken

[15-Mar-19 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as in does not do anything or work at all

[15-Mar-19 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing it to use a new finished falg does nothing, beacause it never even enters that code path ever

`its broken, totally 100% broken` 游녣游낗 stop doing that :troll:

[15-Mar-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know if I can fix it, but I can try... I know Im supposed to be doing other thigns, but this seems more important to me as its breaking notary nodes ability to do their job atm

[15-Mar-19 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I can see, the mempory is being allocated in multiple places

[15-Mar-19 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so maybe to free it, we need to allocate less of it in the same place as when it gets let go

[15-Mar-19 07:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Is that the mempool fix?  I'm making quite a few notarizations with the new iguana.

[15-Mar-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No mempool fix is extra, new iguana I just removed maybe 80% of the running code

[15-Mar-19 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wow no wonder its broken ... 
Its using an arrray of memory with the block height as the index and just skipping every array index that does not ahve a notarization. 
Not even sure ti can be fixed

[15-Mar-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when it gets to a higher block than it has, it just allocates another 10,000 array spots 游땍

[15-Mar-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why would it need to do it that way I wonder 游뱂

[15-Mar-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure I cna just re write this to use an array of 100 and loop back to 0...

[15-Mar-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should amke it use a few hundred megs of ram instead of GBs

[15-Mar-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
10,000 ptrs is 80kb

[15-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
are you sure that is what is eating the memory?

[15-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
10 million blocks -> 80MB

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
1 billion blocks -> 8GB

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not freeing what the pointers point to

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt work at all...

[15-Mar-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the array of pointers is not the problem, not freeing the contents is

[15-Mar-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think I worked that out already, array of pointers seems ok ... but not sure why it needs to be there in the first place

[15-Mar-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant it just allocate a block and free it when its finished?

[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it could, but then there would need to be a way to find it

[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i use the array of pointers for instant search ability

[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bp = calloc(1,sizeof(*bp)); 
is in dpowstatemachinstart

[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so that thread needs to ffree it

[15-Mar-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
struct dpow_block *dpow_heightfind(struct supernet_info *myinfo,struct dpow_info *dp,int32_t height)

[15-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be able to find it

[15-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but does nothing ...

[15-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so Im starting with that

[15-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i used to have it there, but i had to free it from the main thread to get it to work as well as it is now

[15-Mar-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm well im just going to mess with it and see what I can come up with..

[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because whatever its doing now, even with the finished flag added never frees any memory at all

[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0

[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
