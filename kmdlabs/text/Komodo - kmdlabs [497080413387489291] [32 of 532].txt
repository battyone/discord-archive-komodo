ah ok....lol well i guess I'll give that a go

[13-Oct-18 06:03 AM] jspook16#3059
you guys are too fast ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
it'll work on any cc activated chain

[13-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
I'll test on LIZ with you if you like

[13-Oct-18 06:04 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah sure if you have time

[13-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Alright#0419
k let me sync the chain

[13-Oct-18 06:04 AM] jspook16#3059
copy

[13-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Alright#0419
I really don't think joker and I will have tons of time to devote to the chat stuff, so collaboration is welcomed

[13-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jspook16#3059
oh man i just looked through yours .....nicely done ....very few lines of code

[13-Oct-18 06:06 AM] Alright#0419
CC: make dapps with shitty bash scripts

[13-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jspook16#3059
sounds like CCs will be great.....if anything i can see alot of possibilities for oracles. Do you know what the size limit is?

[13-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
8kb per tx?

[13-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
not entirely sure tbh

[13-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
uhhh

[13-Oct-18 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
<65536 char string

[13-Oct-18 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
that's the number is oracles contract at least

[13-Oct-18 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how that works though, thought the OP_RETURN limit was 8000bytes

[13-Oct-18 06:09 AM] Alright#0419
building latest dev branch, and I'll start syncing

[13-Oct-18 06:09 AM] jspook16#3059
ok

[13-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jspook16#3059
I'll look into it for later

[13-Oct-18 06:10 AM] Alright#0419
I want to test both implementations

[13-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jspook16#3059
how do i know if an asset chain has cc enabled?

[13-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
it'll have -ac_cc=x in startup params

[13-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
or ac_ccactivate

[13-Oct-18 06:11 AM] jspook16#3059
oh darn.....you can't just add that to an existing chain right?

[13-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
do you control all the nodes?

[13-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
you can, but it's a hard fork

[13-Oct-18 06:12 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah except for one that hollowman was running....not sure if that one is still up

[13-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Alright#0419
add -ac_ccactivate=<future block height> to all the nodes

[13-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Alright#0419
and it will activate then

[13-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Alright#0419
you want to do -txindex and -addressindex too I think

[13-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jspook16#3059
sweet. will hollowman be able to sync up later easily? im trying to keep it simple

[13-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Alright#0419
yea you just keep ac_ccactivate in the params from then on

[13-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Alright#0419
so he'll just have to restart his node

[13-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Alright#0419
and people who want to sync it from then on need ac_ccactivate

[13-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jspook16#3059
Im going to try to activate now. it will take me a few mins to stop them and restart them. Or I can wait if you want

[13-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Alright#0419
just make it a block that's going to happen by the time you're done restarting all them

[13-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Alright#0419
like make sure they're all running before it hits that block to avoid problems

[13-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jspook16#3059
Ok standby

[13-Oct-18 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
what exactly is LIZ? test coin or real project?

[13-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jspook16#3059
im kind of in between now....its real for me. If i can actually do something with it i'd like to

[13-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jspook16#3059
i made it block 30635

[13-Oct-18 06:26 AM] jspook16#3059
I think it hard forked me....im at block 1

[13-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/activate-cc-independent-chain.html

[13-Oct-18 06:32 AM] jspook16#3059
does the new fork start at block 1?

[13-Oct-18 06:32 AM] Nabob#5004
I used this script to send messages

[13-Oct-18 06:35 AM] jspook16#3059
well not sure what i did. I'll have to read throug the documentation

[13-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Alright#0419
yea I need to look at it @Nabob

[13-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Alright#0419
can you send a message then look at listtransactions

[13-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Alright#0419
and see if it's actually sending 3 or only one

[13-Oct-18 06:38 AM] jspook16#3059
i guess i dont understand forks

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe a fork starts a block one

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Alright#0419
no

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Alright#0419
it shouldn't actually fork

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Alright#0419
what block are you doing it at, I'll try it on my node?

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] jspook16#3059
30635

[13-Oct-18 06:39 AM] jspook16#3059
should i stop my nodes?

[13-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
bo

[13-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
no

[13-Oct-18 06:40 AM] jspook16#3059
ok ill leave mine running

[13-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
need a node to sync from

[13-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
the params you have on git don't have any seed nodes

[13-Oct-18 06:42 AM] jspook16#3059
I thought the nodes in the config file would do

[13-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
Ah right

[13-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
you don't need to create that before syncing

[13-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
it will create it when you run for the first time

[13-Oct-18 06:43 AM] jspook16#3059
I'll update accordingly

[13-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
can you give me one that I can sync from

[13-Oct-18 06:44 AM] jspook16#3059
i restarted those nodes with the cc activate. they are all on the first few blocks now....i can restart with the old params

[13-Oct-18 06:44 AM] jspook16#3059
hollowman's should still be on the old chain

[13-Oct-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
I pushed an update to the trollbox branch. It will now show the first 6 characters of the pubkey after the name you have set in kv. Multiple people can use the same name, so pubkey is what really matters

[13-Oct-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
can't impersonate pubkey

[13-Oct-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
it defaults to 6, but you can change it to whatever with arg3

[13-Oct-18 06:45 AM] jspook16#3059
73.201.153.236 is him

[13-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Alright#0419
him?

[13-Oct-18 06:47 AM] jspook16#3059
hollow....his should still be running the old chain. all of mine are running with the new params and started at bloc 1

[13-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
restart them with the old chain

[13-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
it shouldn't be stuck at block 1

[13-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
I couldn't sync from his

[13-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Alright#0419
@Nabob do you see me talking?

[13-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Alright#0419
```

what's your pubkey, I'll check the oracle

[13-Oct-18 06:52 AM] jspook16#3059
I tried restarting with the old params but now it only goes up to block 14 (last block on the cc activate params)

yea I'm not sure why it's sending dupes

[13-Oct-18 06:58 AM] Alright#0419
or well it's not actually sending dupes

[13-Oct-18 06:58 AM] Alright#0419
it's receive script doing it

[13-Oct-18 06:58 AM] Alright#0419
not sure why it's only happening to you
