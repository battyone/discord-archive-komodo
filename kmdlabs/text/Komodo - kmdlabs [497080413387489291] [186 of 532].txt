And if notarization happening we can test migrates

[03-Jan-19 10:21 AM] zatJUM#9924
I cannot start, not build...

[03-Jan-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It pulls the json it needs to run from komodod

[03-Jan-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe that isn't running somehow

[03-Jan-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll be home soon. I can't diagnose this on a phone

[03-Jan-19 10:23 AM] zatJUM#9924
I only have my phone for a few weeks 😒

ComputerGenie was the 6th in my mask.  Was just waiting for that.

[03-Jan-19 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, going back to work (after I get dressed) will set up miners as soon as I get new local server permissions set up for media files and other personal shit

I mined something ... but these nodes are really poor .. 0.3sol per core.

[03-Jan-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and in Perth ... so likley the block mined was too late.

[03-Jan-19 11:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, with a difficultly of just under 15 figured I'd have mined something by now.

[03-Jan-19 11:04 AM] CMaurice#1685

right, I'll try and get a core to mine with

[03-Jan-19 11:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got 2 ntx, but nothing mined yet

[03-Jan-19 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
looks like around the same time as when you did @CrisF

[03-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I think ComputerGeniw was also in the same bestmask.

[03-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Seemed when he got up we had enough notarys up.

[03-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure what happened then.

[03-Jan-19 11:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm seeing 8 in recvmask using the curl script. none in bestmask.

[03-Jan-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is clearly forks

[03-Jan-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I restarted my miners

[03-Jan-19 11:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah

[03-Jan-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they now have loads of balance

[03-Jan-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
6112 + 511 blocks

[03-Jan-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there might be two chains some how

[03-Jan-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean 4

I can see on the prints of my notary that there are 2 chains on each chain... nodes are split catn reach consensus

[03-Jan-19 11:20 AM] CMaurice#1685
think I can't read the Matrix yet

[03-Jan-19 11:20 AM] CrisF#3405
my std isn't moving

[03-Jan-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I think has hapened is that the chains were too short for this many ppl t start mining

[03-Jan-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Think it was about 300 when I started.

[03-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I started 3 nodes in Australia .... versus the seeds in EU (I think)

[03-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once I restarted my Au nodes.... they started mining heaps of blocks...

[03-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
showing equal as longest chain tho

[03-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I removed Alrights seeds from assetcains.json

[03-Jan-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try and clear all peers.dat
stop then do this:
`find . -o 'peers.dat -delete` from inside `~/.komodo`
then restart

[03-Jan-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
std moving a little now.

[03-Jan-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
When I did that :pointup: got this in terminal `>

[03-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubt thats it

[03-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need more nodes up

[03-Jan-19 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm just getting up now.  Will see.

[03-Jan-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your already showing aye

[03-Jan-19 11:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Oops, just dropped out, doh. back in a sec

[03-Jan-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a MoMoM error .. bestmask is fine

[03-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This happened before once

[03-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 notarisations hapened

[03-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it stopped

[03-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because the MoM hash's dont match

[03-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there isnt a lot we can do here ... but 🙏  for more nodes or make everyone resync KMD

[03-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
WAIT!

[03-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed fix

[03-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed is_STAKED to be faster ... but forgot that KMD needs that function to calcualte the MoMoM

[03-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😦

[03-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤦

[03-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the easiest way to fis this is to start new chains

👌🏻 

[03-Jan-19 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
./stop.sh ./start.sh?

[03-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No it wont matter

[03-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue KMD already has the wrong info

[03-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mayeb it will work if we just restart ... not likley tho

[03-Jan-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either resync KMD or start new chains

[03-Jan-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181

pretty sure this is right

[03-Jan-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as an fyi: boost needs to be added to the komodo dependencies

[03-Jan-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
boost ?

[03-Jan-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its pulled in with zcutil/build.sh and built from scratch?

[03-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  you rekon you can start some new chains ?

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Sure, will take a bit.

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just change the name by a letter or a number

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
makes it nice and easy... also the seed node IP 👍

[03-Jan-19 11:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, give it a go.

[03-Jan-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
