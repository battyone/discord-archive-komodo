@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Pushed a new staking algo to KMDLabs/master 
Any cahnge you want to test it on MGNX or some other shit coin you stake?

[16-May-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally manage to understand HOW it was actually selecting the utxos it uses...

[16-May-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
remove about 25% more code, still stakes for me without forking on LABSRCTEST

[16-May-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sure I've got just the shitcoin (or 2) to test it on

[16-May-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice... It doesnt touch consensus code, just the staking loop so its safe as long as it doesnt totally kill your staking rates

[16-May-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was looping every utxo, rather than bailing out once it found one actually elebible... so with huge numbers of utxo, it couldnt stake at all, took longer to process them than the block time 😂

[16-May-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It was looping every utxo, rather than bailing out once it found one actually elebible...`
Wasn't the idea behind that in order to find the "best" one to stake?

[16-May-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`if ( eligible < block_from_future_rejecttime ) // nothing gained by going earlier
                    break;`

[16-May-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was there but in wrong place

[16-May-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it did nothing

[16-May-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to have slowed down LABSRCTEST for me, but only just started

[16-May-19 02:44 PM] Alright#0419
If block space ever becomes a problem(not likely) and we still have a handful of KMD NNs, we can prioritize LABS notarizations in blocks they mine

[16-May-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```02ecd01c6c8c1f30a8ccae82b78f74712fc4c7a04054a4856dc943236af271b5 mined OUR block 164590!

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  looks like myt ZEXO and LABSRCTEST still staking good. Going to merge another change in. Soon. No need for you to update to it. Please just let me know if this staker afffects staked blocks in anyway.

[17-May-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181 (pinned)
@LabsAssistant 
Pushed some updates. Removed HOUND/DRAGON.
Also removed CFEKPAY as I merged payments updates in that hard fork it. No longer required I have the winners of the prize saved, and they are also in this Discord as a record. 
There are some changes that I thaught may stop some chains loading, but it didnt happen for me on either node. It would be great if anyone staking any chains could update to this version to test staker changes. I think just maybe I finally got it actually stable. Ie, it doesn't just break the wallet after a few days. *KMDLabs/komodo can stake any KMD AC, like OUR or ZEXO etc* 
Cant say for sure  though with out lots of testers. It would be good to get this stuff merged to KMD before the hard fork, as they are very good changes IMO, as long as I didnt break anything. 
Have kids this weekend so wont be around much, please DM me any bugs found directly so I dont miss them, and I will fix when I have time. 
Launch just around the corner. once again thanks to all who have helped, and congrats to all KMD NN winners. 😃

I'm only staking on one node at the moment, so would be good to spread out

There is a stats script that will also show how things are going.

In StakedNotary, `./stats`

`In the KMDLabs/StakedNotary repo, there is a script called NNvote.py. Run this(after starting the CFEKORC chain) and select NN lottery.`
i dont see how the others already posted, i may be in over my head. it looks like to me you have to be a notary to run that version of oracles?

[18-May-19 08:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
The script is in the StakedNotary repo - but should be able to be run from any install as long as you have -pubkey set correctly (easiest done with the config file using staked or stakednotary git repo's - you can use the auto start scripts).

[18-May-19 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
☑  Hi, if anyone has any questions about how to enter the NN election lottery, please ask here.

[18-May-19 04:24 PM] Exile13#4458
i need to do this?
`Now you need to copy the config file and edit it with our pubkey/Raddress and WIF key for KMD. There needs to be a space after the = sign on each line.`
but where is the info for " our pubkey/Raddress and WIF key"?
stakednotary requires this
unless i can run this through staked, which it doesnt look like i can

[18-May-19 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just stick a pubkey/wif/Raddres into the ini file?

[18-May-19 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not that hard

[18-May-19 04:27 PM] Exile13#4458
