folks, for future reference:
Alright generally worries too much, imo, but when he says it's a possibility of happening it's usually because he's seen it happen or envisioned a way that it can
So, there's a reason he makes warnings and offers best practices üòâ

[31-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[31-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
what is that in reference to?

[31-Oct-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the convo yesterday where folks seemed to think it was silly for you to tell non-experienced users that it was best to stop staking before the hf and resume after

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
Ah must have missed that

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
yea seems a lot of people still staking that fork too

[31-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
ü§∑ more for me

[31-Oct-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I suppose I should start staking one of these days

[31-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
pls no

is LABS the only chain we currently have going that has an explorer? Or are the mylo chains on their own?

[31-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
Have no idea what the purpose of those chains is

[31-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
likely don't have explorers

[31-Oct-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_puts them on the pool anyway and lets non-German folks figure out the error message on their own_

[31-Oct-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I guess I should put a disclaimer on the pool that chains other than LABS may or may not die at any given time

[31-Oct-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I never expected that people would randomly mine chains just because they were there ü§∑üèΩ

[31-Oct-19 02:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
I guess than it's time for me to pin up a new server for those chains

[31-Oct-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@CHMEX If you need some KMD kicked your way to cover the resources, just let me know

[31-Oct-19 02:08 PM] Alright#0419
@daemonfox you should replace the komodod binary with an updated one

[31-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Alright#0419
if it's not forked already, it 100% will

[31-Oct-19 02:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah its stuck at same block CMaurice just posted

[31-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Oszy#5734

did you try to go back to find the latest block it had in common with dexstats explorer?

[31-Oct-19 02:13 PM] Oszy#5734
yes, and invalidated the next, and reconsidered with correct hash

that hash is not in that chian, needs to be invalidated. Might need to invalidate a few before it as well

[31-Oct-19 02:14 PM] Alright#0419

[31-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419

[31-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419
rpc is hanging?

[31-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[31-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419
kill the node I guess

[31-Oct-19 02:16 PM] Oszy#5734
k

[31-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Oszy#5734
no joy, stuck on another block now.

[31-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Oszy#5734
should i just delete chain and re-sync instead?

[31-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Alright#0419
lol it'll work, careful with the wallet

[31-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Alright#0419
what block are you stuck on?

again, need to find latest in common with the explorer üò´

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] Alright#0419
just resync if you don't want to bother

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] Alright#0419
only takes like 15 minutes

[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah might be better to just do that

[31-Oct-19 02:22 PM] Oszy#5734
rm rf block and chainstate only? or everything except wallet.dat?

[31-Oct-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
rm -r blocks chainstate notarizations database
rm komodostate signedmasks

[31-Oct-19 02:23 PM] mrlynch#5735

I think because there were diffrent notarized heights

[31-Oct-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the random seed gets out of sync across the network

Not really... looks clean, no red lines... no warnings... seeing nota happen and calls for all hashes and heights
