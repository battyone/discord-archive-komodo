I didn't have it at first

[13-Oct-18 07:41 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright might be out of uxto.

[13-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
me?

[13-Oct-18 07:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Me, out.

[13-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Alright#0419
uhhh

[13-Oct-18 07:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I just need to fund my pubkey address right?

have you enable `setgenerate true` @CrisF

[13-Oct-18 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
@Nabob This node is mining another chain atm.  I might switch them around.  Good idea thanks!

[13-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
this channel is deded because all active people are chatting on chain

[13-Oct-18 09:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
who needs discord when you have chain chatting

[13-Oct-18 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Did you test it out @NutellaLicka ?

[13-Oct-18 09:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Naa I haven't sorry! I am working on another project at the moment

[13-Oct-18 09:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'll be interested in giving it a go at some point though

[13-Oct-18 09:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I was just wondering , I saw another pubkey there.

[13-Oct-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810

@Alright  found the dupes issue, Thanks we found the reason

[13-Oct-18 10:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it easy to unsubscribe to the oracle?

[13-Oct-18 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
don't think you can, why @CrisF

[13-Oct-18 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
if you want the coins you subscribed to yourself with back, just spam messages

[13-Oct-18 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Wondered if it would help.  There might be cases in the future where that would come in handy also.

[13-Oct-18 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
There have been a few times in the past where I would have liked to remove  a pubkey from my wallet.  Might be times where same holds for oracles etc.

[13-Oct-18 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
so subscribing is a bit different for chat

[13-Oct-18 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
you just subscribe to yourself which means you are paying yourself for each message you write

[13-Oct-18 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
if it were a real oracle for data, you'd be paying whoever publishes the data

[13-Oct-18 10:16 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not thinking of the fund necessarily.

[13-Oct-18 10:18 AM] CrisF#3405
More along the lines of unlinking.

[13-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
just only fund small amounts

[13-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
once it runs out, if you don't want to stay subscribed, don't fund it again

Was thinking more along the lines of privacy. 
A bit of forethought would prevent that.

no idea on breach point.  Exited when I went to pickup new car.

[13-Oct-18 11:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
either it can jump much higher than I've seeme him, or its climbing the  grid mesh fencing I used to fortify the initial breach point.

going from a raised ute to a hatchback feels like going from a motorbike to a scooter

Toyota Yaris, 5sp manual. If it was an auto, recon I'd almost have to be prescribed psychotropics to deal with it. At least its not pink.

I think the military grade units will be easier to tap into.  Gotta read more into it, but they're much less restricted in terms of capability. I should have known the petstore thing was a waste of $

[13-Oct-18 11:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was thinking that wifi would be a good fence zone indicator. Detecting disconection of a MAC  is an easy enough early warning system.

I dont think it has internet on the device, but wiring it to a pi/arduino should open up a way to stream the tracking.

@Alright if you have LIZ running could you stop it. Im going to try and recover it

[13-Oct-18 07:39 PM] Alright#0419

Is anyone in here able to walk me through starting a test chain?

[14-Oct-18 12:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I can try.  It's been very easy when I've done it.  Just followed the guide.

Very simple.  Just followed and took about 15 minutes (I'm slow).  Server setup is what took me the longest.

[14-Oct-18 12:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Awesome, thanks. I have the server ready to go, so shouldn't take too long

[14-Oct-18 12:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe there is a way to do it on one server now.  Haven't tried it.

[14-Oct-18 12:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Let me know if you have any troubles.  Myself or someone here will be able to help.

[14-Oct-18 12:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I may need to run it on a single server, I'll see how i go

[14-Oct-18 12:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not sure if chains will be added to STAKED, apart from 'official' test chains, but if that is possible make sure you have the correct cc address.

[14-Oct-18 12:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I would save a lot of messing around.
