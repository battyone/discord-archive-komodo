@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  tmux workflow is like start tmux, then start processes in windows and panes  in tmux, then leave them running, detach tmux, re-attach tmus when you re-connect with ssh

@CMaurice I know how it works (or more specifically, what it **can** do), just never been assed to learn how to get from nothingness to sexyness
I find my time can be better spent learning important shit

[24-Nov-18 03:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, 'spose, I spend much time re-learning stuff every decade or so

[24-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*didnt learn it*... it came with the setup I stole in a few minutes to use a mouse with it... because I was a noob

[24-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it worked ...

[24-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok ... if i luanch a terminal with std out to a screen, could i just attach those later into a tmux session to each terminal ?

[24-Nov-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@webworker01 that will not work with the tmux horseshit @blackjok3r had me add

[24-Nov-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becaue having all the stdout for all coinds print to /dev/null is  aBAD way to do this... it needs to be fixed

[24-Nov-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I like having them all in a ane in pane window

[24-Nov-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
all I see with any screen anything is a rainbow of `\[\]\[\][\[\]\u\[\]@\[\]\h \[\]\W\[\]]\[\]$ \[\]`

[24-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
althoughj ive been thinking ... most of hte prints to stdout that are impotant can just be sent to debug.log ... its not ahrd

[24-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
so you need to choose to send to a screen the stuff that will give you printouts

[24-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the PoS % is already there

[24-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
