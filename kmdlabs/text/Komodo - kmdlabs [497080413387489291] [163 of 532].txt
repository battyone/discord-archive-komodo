Different level, but same 💩

[17-Dec-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
making things somewhat work and makeing them work perfectly seems to be 100x more work,

Although I think I might have just found the fix for all the problems ith te POS64 staker ...

[17-Dec-18 09:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh nic!e

[17-Dec-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works ... It was getting stuck inside a `while  true` loop ... just looping over hte same incorrect block

[17-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
makking it so it can break out of it was one of the weridest things i've come across, but I seem to have manged to make it build and have one chain staking at least to test it.

[17-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my guess is it will either work, or just segfault and kill the daemon

[17-Dec-18 09:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Do or die.  Guess that makes testing easier.

[17-Dec-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it did neither 😂

[17-Dec-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just stopped mining

[17-Dec-18 10:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, on strike.

[17-Dec-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
must have put the exit call in the wrong place ... I think this might be the solution though...

what ?

[17-Dec-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the same txid is the error on every chain ... that is very very strange indeed.

[17-Dec-18 10:37 AM] CrisF#3405
What would cause something like that?

[17-Dec-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gremlins

[17-Dec-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im hoping that porblem is a symptom of other easier to solve problems

@blackjok3r  Let me know when you resolved that issue, I also seen  wallet.dat keys warning in some users systems

[17-Dec-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not be able to be fixed sadly ... but figuring out what is doing it may help.

[17-Dec-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Is this on staking chains ?

[17-Dec-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or juts on normal chains?

[17-Dec-18 12:10 PM] Nabob#5004
normal chain

[17-Dec-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... That messagee could happen for many reasons.

[17-Dec-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get my wallet to do this, was not easy

[17-Dec-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Each wallet has over 50,000 txs

[17-Dec-18 12:11 PM] Nabob#5004
but, am not sure how user followed procedures,  i have not seen on my PC

[17-Dec-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It means that the wallet.dat had some corrupt data on load ... what I find extremly strange is I was able to make it print what tx it was reporting as invalid ... and the same txs appears on every single chain....

[17-Dec-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the chances of that are litterally 0 ... so something very strange is happening.

[17-Dec-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Got a feeling its got something to do with the other problem I am trying to fix now, where it tries to stake blocks with transactions in them that do not exist.

[17-Dec-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully pinnign down where that happens and doing a SyncWallet call, will stop it adding txs that dont exist... as trying to clear them out afterwards does not work, it requires a zapwallet and rescan to fix it.

[17-Dec-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the same txid is the error on every chain ...`
Is there __a__ chain where that txid is valid?

[17-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[17-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks liek the hash is too long to be a valid txid

someone/something flooding the fek out of CFEK

[17-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unlikely ... are you on latest ?

[17-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
three is a function in connect block that puts txs into the mempool.. and it iterates until they are all accepted

[17-Dec-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"latest" being as of like 12 hrs ago

[17-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it has it maybe not

[17-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At some point in the last 24H I pushed a version that does not print that when its doing that ...

[17-Dec-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
normal accept to mem pool will print it ... but that particualr call wont

[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:

I'm aware that stash will fix that, but my question is what created it (I did  no manual edits)?

[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know ... that change was merged from FSM

[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just git reset --hard

[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i fixed that recently

[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a temp file that was in the repo, i added a gitignore

well it has to be a normal print then

[17-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
something/someone is sending invalid txs somehow

[17-Dec-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which is what I said to begin with 🙄

[17-Dec-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
almost verbatim

[17-Dec-18 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
welll a sometime in the last 24H it would ahve been flooding that on every block with txs in it

[17-Dec-18 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
funnythough bebause mine isnt doing it

[17-Dec-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's less/slower now, if that means anything

[17-Dec-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or was until I wrote that LOL

[17-Dec-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yours probably isn't printing it because it's probably yours doing it :trollface:

[17-Dec-18 01:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm testing dragonhound on CFEK, but it should only hit it every 5 min or so for a dozen virtual dogs

[17-Dec-18 01:03 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
retrieves 99 records each time I load the map, but only for a single hound

[17-Dec-18 01:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've also got a cronjob to create oracles, one is in progress.

[17-Dec-18 01:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
creating oracle loops some calls to check the creation tx etc have been accepted to mempool

[17-Dec-18 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The staking chains, when you ahve a lot of utxo and you are staking have a problem where the staking loop stops any RPC's being issued and it hangs for a while until the loop is finished, the only way to stop that is to use less utxos so it processes faster. I had a good look at it today trying to think thorough some solution and really couldnt. I dont know why the stakign loop is in rpcwalelt.cpp but I assume the reason it locks up RPCs is because its running in the RPC thread.

[17-Dec-18 01:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont think thats the spam vector, but will probably have to test it's scalability at some stage.

[17-Dec-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
go hard on these chains, they wont live much longer

[17-Dec-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying my hardest to keep them mining blocks.

so far site handles login etc, and schedules oracle creation for user

[17-Dec-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by this weekend, I should have at least 1 miner on every chain (for labs and komodo both)

[17-Dec-18 01:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once oracle is "funded" via detecting 1kmd sent to user R-address, it'll fund/subscribe/register to oracle

[17-Dec-18 01:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can point some resources, not mining at the moment. As I'm using cfek, I'll point there. CPU adequate?

[17-Dec-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CPU isnt enough ... ive driven the diff so high with staking

[17-Dec-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cpu is good on most chains

[17-Dec-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for CFEK at least

[17-Dec-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the others seem fine with very very low hash

[17-Dec-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0.5sol on them now and finsing blocks constantly

[17-Dec-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I'm still at odds with the lack of a throttle on PoS 😕

[17-Dec-18 01:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I started staking CFEK a few hours ago.  13M coins in that tme.  No staking trouble.

[17-Dec-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with enough weight, any dick can essentially make any dual chain 100% PoS

[17-Dec-18 01:13 PM] CrisF#3405
Will stop now.  onder if makes a difference.

[17-Dec-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its mostly that the utxos are soo incredibly large .. and at least my wallet is billions of coins and 11,000 utxos.. once I got the ram staker working on my 2700X it was just smahsing blocks, satking very one much faster than each 60s for nearly 24H

[17-Dec-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you mean even for 50% PoS chain?

[17-Dec-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and after height 3000?

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we are around 60,000 blocks now

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh....

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
100% PoS on 51% chain

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the PoW diff

[17-Dec-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When you add a GPU or Z9 it goes to 50% very fast

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the stated diff

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, a PoW chain that is CPU mined...

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.. it has no value so the hash rate is under liek 10sol

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think its a bug

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
against efficiently staking utxo, yes, likely it wont get many blocks

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not a bug
