FOR the blokes in this WA town the chance of finding love is stacked against them with four times as many men as women.

`highest ratio of young single men to women`
That they spent that much time on that truck might explain....

the rest verify just fine, having trouble with his, not sure if it's a problem on my side or a problem with the message

[28-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Alright#0419
@Old Man Phil is this the correct address `RVX3cr4J2FBDoztgF8rCuQN6vTf42XAL2U`?

[28-Oct-19 07:27 PM] Oszy#5734
`event not found` ?

[28-Oct-19 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
saw that as well, tried it in python though and get False

_lurking in the shadows_

[28-Oct-19 08:04 PM] Oszy#5734
Maybe it was pasted together with a hash or some other hex, at least it looks like it

[28-Oct-19 08:06 PM] Oszy#5734
Yes

[28-Oct-19 08:06 PM] Oszy#5734
he did copy the signed message along the tx id

[28-Oct-19 08:06 PM] Oszy#5734
signature is only `H+2JEFCwuhjjmvq0li1Vv6iHVHoRu2rvHFXgdRjr1UIwWyYY8QbKuhS2V22ZMlnIp9cvAtMwDcxreWNzQwE48CQ=`

Phil still.afk.today...

[28-Oct-19 08:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
What exactly needs doing...

[28-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Oszy#5734
@daemonfox no worries, need to verify the signed message, you copied the register TX id into the signature

[28-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Oszy#5734
and ALright couldn't verify

[28-Oct-19 08:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ok so I pasted something wrong. How did I manage that... Grabbed too much in copy and snagged the txid as well?

[28-Oct-19 08:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Oszy it returns `-bash: !]: event not found` with that, I think you can't have single quotes in double quotes

[28-Oct-19 08:20 PM] Oszy#5734
yes nnVote.py doesn't clear screen after registes tx id shown so you must have copied that as well

[28-Oct-19 08:20 PM] Oszy#5734
@PHBA2061 won't work in bash because of the `!`

@And1_89  Please provide new Key for LABS NN

[28-Oct-19 08:24 PM] Oszy#5734
I use that too but if you remove the `!` you'll see false, because it goes trough as a command in bash but not true because of the missing `!`

[28-Oct-19 08:26 PM] daemonfox#6136

since DAPP is py seems it passes the ! fine
