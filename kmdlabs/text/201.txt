üò¨ I just spent most of the day getting it up, haha.

[07-Jan-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
What issues @Deleted User ?

[07-Jan-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm  I just want it for setting up vms for nodes atm.

[07-Jan-19 01:29 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Debian runs as a 'real' VM for me??

[07-Jan-19 01:29 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lxc or VM?

[07-Jan-19 01:30 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I can't see a difference between a bare metal deb and a proxmox hosted ded

[07-Jan-19 01:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ahhh yes proxmox runs its own kernel - don't mess with that

[07-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
But then vmware isn't a real Linux eithet

[07-Jan-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for testing proxmox will be fine

[07-Jan-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im using vmware and thats closed source I think

[07-Jan-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh

[07-Jan-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt actually know that

[07-Jan-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as he can ssh into it it should be ok

[07-Jan-19 01:33 PM] gt#2812

Now I have sorted one repo of the insight explorer there are 2 more that need changing to display the info correctly. :abusedsmily:

[07-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really needs to be done properly... I would say its a change we should be pushing to Decker repo.

[07-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```is_import: true,
  inputs:
   [ { prevTxId: '114f160197bb757cbc7bb1d3e54a24670dcda1f9993528d5a735b992745964f8',
       outputIndex: null,
       script: 'import',
       scriptAsm: null,
       sequence: 4294967295,
       address: 'CFEKY',
       satoshis: 200000000 } ],
  inputSatoshis: 200000000 }
```
this hopefully is all we need.

[07-Jan-19 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Will this change eventually be needed on all explorers for coins with the ability to migrate?

[07-Jan-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.... the current exploere just say no inputs... Unparsed address of balance 0 with no links to anything and coins beign created on other side.

[07-Jan-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
While I was able to trick the information through so the source chain, and amount/value were displayed.... it broke a heap of links and things. explorer bugged out when you click onm them.

[07-Jan-19 01:41 PM] CrisF#3405
This will be a fairly important tool then.

[07-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@Deleted User my understanding was that proxmox (although running a modified deb kernal) runs Vm's using qemu/kvm - which is open source and not proxmox modified. Accepted that lxc's are a completely different matter due to their nature and the modified kernal.

[07-Jan-19 01:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Will I be needing a new ip for each vm?

[07-Jan-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the easiest way to do it

[07-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using qemu/kmv here locally... was really hard to setup even with a gui (mostly becasue most of the things I needed are not in the gui)

[07-Jan-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
super powerful though.... way more so than virtual box

@Bar_F1sh_Rel Do you need domain name to get the ssl cert for promox?  I tried one way and an error said I did.  Haven't seen that mentioned anywhere though.

[07-Jan-19 01:53 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@CrisF their implementation is bad. I left it with self signed. Only because I am behind a Nat. But yes domain name required.

[07-Jan-19 01:54 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.

[07-Jan-19 01:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, would I need that for each vm?

[07-Jan-19 02:01 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Think of them as all individual machines (even proxmox) the VMs will All appear separately on your network.

[07-Jan-19 02:02 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll have to find some very cheap domains then!

[07-Jan-19 02:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
No sub domains are fine

[07-Jan-19 02:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, that's useful!  Thank üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
One hint - set the VM Id as the ipaddress last set.

[07-Jan-19 02:06 PM] CrisF#3405
How do you mean?

[07-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
VM id 126 for 292.168.0.126

[07-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Helps find them

[07-Jan-19 02:07 PM] CrisF#3405
Ah, cool üëç

I got everything there we should need to display it properly...

[07-Jan-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only had to change bitcore repo where it fetches RPC call... rest is in website itself

[07-Jan-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
scriptSig is never and can never be 'import' so we can use that as a condition to change the links

[07-Jan-19 02:24 PM] Mylo#8306
awesome, how do i update mine?    git pull doesn't pull

[07-Jan-19 02:25 PM] Mylo#8306
just delete and run through re-installation?

[07-Jan-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hah.. to "redo it"
`rm -rf CFEKX-explorer* node_modules`
`./install-explorer.sh`

[07-Jan-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent changed the daemon at all

[07-Jan-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its like 20-30 lines of code over 3 ropos to call the source the source, so I decided to stick with using the unused address variable.

[07-Jan-19 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
really it doesnt matter I dont think. It works with minimal changes.

[07-Jan-19 02:28 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah i spent the last 30 mins or so trying to jam in a new field called transaction.vin_import wherever sapling was mentioned.   to no avail.

[07-Jan-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With this... I think it should be as simple as chaning the link when you click the address to instead of link to address 'CFEKY' to link to the `prevTxId` feild.

[07-Jan-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some how we need to be able to define the other explorers address's

[07-Jan-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
use `address.explorerdomain.xxx/tx/prevTxId`

[07-Jan-19 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if `scriptSig` == 'import'

[07-Jan-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry I lied.... I dint push the address change to the staked/komodo repo üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Mylo#8306
i can see all the imports in my explorer, but not CFEKY

[07-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Mylo#8306
haha

[07-Jan-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok should be good now sorry

[07-Jan-19 02:38 PM] Mylo#8306
line 237 & 271 in ui of public/views/transaction/tx.html i'm just dumping {{tx}} there til i see familiar rawtransaction stuff

[07-Jan-19 02:38 PM] Mylo#8306
all good.   it's a quick painless install

{Reactions}
üòé 

[07-Jan-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem I see is the html templates will like all need to be changed... like there is a link on the block page and the transaction page etc...

[07-Jan-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm maybe not

[07-Jan-19 02:43 PM] Mylo#8306
ah sorry, where is CFEKY being saved to?   address?

[07-Jan-19 02:43 PM] Mylo#8306
what field/parameter

[07-Jan-19 02:44 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm not seeing it in either tx or address

[07-Jan-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you rebuilt and restarted daemon?

[07-Jan-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be where the Raddress usually is... see screenshot above

[07-Jan-19 02:46 PM] Mylo#8306
no haven't restarted komodod

[07-Jan-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah change is in there

[07-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Mylo#8306
cool, waiting for whatever happens to ./start.sh CFEKX noconfig

don't think it recompiled though.  was pretty quick

[07-Jan-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its only the name of a var being changed should be fast

[07-Jan-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not even that... some static string

[07-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Mylo#8306
yep got it.

I dunno I'm no web dev... but I cant see how we can easily do this at all ..

[07-Jan-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like its all good apart from links...

[07-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Mylo#8306
actually what we could do is instead of `CFEKY` showing up, change it to IMPORT-CFEKY and use webserver url redirect on it.   saves stuffing around with the src files of insight

{Reactions}
üôè 

[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Mylo#8306
provided a webserver is used to proxy connections to insight...which is the way kmdexplorer works.   got nginx sitting in front

[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes these use nginx as well

[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same explorer

[07-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
alright just never figured out hwo to properly set it up

[07-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Mylo#8306
ah i'm just connecting to port 3002

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok that seems easy enough. i'll just make the daemon add import...

[07-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its `IMPORT-<source>`

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Mylo#8306
yep.   thing is on simple view, it'll go to /address/IMPORT-CFEKX
but on detailed/full view it has tx info in the ">" link.

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Mylo#8306
might be a tiny little mod.

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Mylo#8306
but it's better than doing the whole lot, just for what we want it to do

[07-Jan-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah chainging th template looks hard

[07-Jan-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what if the txid for imports was shown instead of address?

[07-Jan-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can switch thigns around

[07-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Mylo#8306
major PITA.
so where you're chucking CFEKY in, what other info from CFEKY is available?  all we need is a rough convention of putting the data in there and we can do web redirect based off the convention.  like if you can add the CFEKY address as well....so IMPORT-CFEKY-Raddr ??

[07-Jan-19 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there no address from CFEKY just a txid and the chains name
