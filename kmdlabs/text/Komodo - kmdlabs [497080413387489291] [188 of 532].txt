Notarizations are going smoothly here 😃

[04-Jan-19 01:11 AM] CrisF#3405
🔥 Thanks for the input with the Logging & Stats project!🔥 
We've gotten quite a lot of ideas and information up on the pad.

The immediate goal now is to get logging ready for the Migration Stress Test. 
The vision for this is:
```Use an oracle to record migration logs onchain and:
1) demo/practice/test oracles
2) have a central place to keep a longer term record (to prove migration stability, even after test cluster is gone)
3) be easy for busy devs and noobs to plug into a testing script (eg.migration script)```
You can see how this could be important for KMD, particularly relating to the Scaling Test. Migrations will come under a lot of scrutiny then.

Please help with the next step!
When this is clarified we can start building :)

@blackjok3r https://github.com/StakedChain/PoS_scripts/blob/master/CC_scripts/MoMoM/migratecoinNOpipe.sh is it a most recent cross-chain migration script?
Just wonder - I can migrate it to python and make simple interface also - shouldn't take much time. So will be possible to create some "migrationslib" and  be able to use migrations logic in other Python software

[04-Jan-19 04:31 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Is removing `$amount` still necessary?👆

[04-Jan-19 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so

[04-Jan-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... I set off a loop of 5000 migrates before I left my house a few hours ago, will be back there soon to check it. I can edit the script to be a bit simpler so it contains just the minimum needed to migrate. I think we can add a couple of changes to it , that saves polling rpca at a few steps. Because we have dpowconfs now we can tell if a tx has been notarised

I removed amount

[04-Jan-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because its nto requried... It already addedd up all the tx vout values... So I changed it to use that value. This makes an error impossible, Other wise the user can burn coins that cannot be imported due to a "absurd fees mempool rejection"

[04-Jan-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will look for the help part and remove export_amount before I push this update.

[04-Jan-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant seem to find that error message in the code ? @TonyL  how did you get that?

[04-Jan-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this change needs to be merged into jl777/komodo

[04-Jan-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```# 5. Wait for a confirmation on source chain.
waitforconfirm "$sentTX" "$cli_source"
echo "[$source] : Confirmed export $sentTX"
#echo "$cli_source migrate_createimporttransaction $signedhex $payouts"

# 6. Use migrate_createimporttransaction to create the import TX```
IF you wait for > 2 confirms here it removes the need for the next looping RPC poll. What it loops this comamnd for, is it loops until there has been a notarisation.  If you leverage dpowconfs you can just wait for comfirm including a notarisation.

I have done 637 migrates so far with old script appears to be working perfectly. 
Haven't got to migrate script yet, you seem to have it under contraol. Haviung it in pythong will make logging via oracles a lot easier too, thanks! :)

 I have been busy making a "fix" for corrupted wallet issue. I am able to load a 50MB corrupted CFEK wallet... on load it now removes the corrupted txs, instead of calling a full rescan, that still left the corrupted txns in the wallet, which meant that once it got some corrupted txns in it, every time you started daemon it would call a full wallet rescan. This no longer happens. It simplyt removes the corrupted data from the DB. Loading daemon a second time the error is gone.

[04-Jan-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, issue seems deep 🤕

[04-Jan-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Was not able to ever work out how wallet got this corruption, so this work around will have to do... I managed to extract the tx hash of the corrupted tx and none of these txs ever exist on chain. Not really sure how they end up there. 🤷

[04-Jan-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It only happens with nodes that stake very large amounts of utxo's

[04-Jan-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
```migrate_createimporttransaction: backnotarisation not yet confirmed (code -1)```
Is it the what about you warned me? I've waited for 1 confirmation of export transaction

[04-Jan-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes you need to either wait for more than 2 confirms

[04-Jan-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Gotcha

[04-Jan-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or just keep pollign that RPC  until the tx sends

but it cant because its being notarised ...

[04-Jan-19 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have this wallet fix down... It now does `ZapWalletTxns` only for the corrupted txs, so it removes them, then scans the chain with `GetTransaction` too see if these txs do exist, if they do it adds it back to the wallet.

How can you incorporate a payment channel every 5 blocks?

[04-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Think about that

[04-Jan-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... I dont think you can with the current state of it ... because the chain can only contain streamer txs.

[04-Jan-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there are other txs on it... then data extraction will fail...

[04-Jan-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im sure that can be fixed though.

[04-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah def

[04-Jan-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The early version was just the PoC ... it sends data and retreivs it and thats about all.

[04-Jan-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can build on top of it though.

[04-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wait... no if a tx has no OP_RETURN then it is skipped... so that wuld work. The problem is though is that the coins ona  streamer chain are worthless...

[04-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless somehow you had the chain owner sell the coins to people and they needed to burn them (or send them back) to view the data.

[04-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ha figured out what the problem is, this wallet is from a node with a longer chain. This works fine as is. Will need to restest it on a new staking chain at some point, although getting a wallet like this again will  be very hard 😅
