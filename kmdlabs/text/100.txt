in any case, should me or alright win a notary node for KMD, that will fund everyone

[23-Nov-18 09:49 AM] CrisF#3405
tipbot is a good soure of KMD to fund notaries üòâ

[23-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that too.. unitl/if we get to a large aount odf chains its not expensive.

[23-Nov-18 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice 's good idea on the tipbot.

[23-Nov-18 09:52 AM] jorian#4555
brave to have notary rewards fund kmdlabs

[23-Nov-18 09:52 AM] jorian#4555
can't you set up a fund where anyone can send in tips / gifts?

[23-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well the idea was to prve you can use a KMD notary node to have a second layer... to notarise a bnch of AC... if KMD wants to scale out really big ... this is the only way to do so.

[23-Nov-18 09:53 AM] jorian#4555
ah, the idea we had with chainmakers earlier on

[23-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each notary node spports a whole netowrk of notary nodes

[23-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they all notarise to KMD directly

[23-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using diffrent keys

[23-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 KMd notary onode can fund an insanse amount of notarisatin txs

[23-Nov-18 09:54 AM] jorian#4555
true that

[23-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not a chance that can happen from 1 server... but from a whole network of servers...

[23-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@gt  and @zatJUM

[23-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you need KMD ... or have you run `utxosplitter.sh`

[23-Nov-18 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
we don't actually have an additional layer

[23-Nov-18 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
just an additional network

[23-Nov-18 09:57 AM] zatJUM#9924
I just funded in kmd

[23-Nov-18 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
all chains notarize directly to KMD

üëå 

[23-Nov-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just the testnet here, added a fair few txs to KMD ...

[23-Nov-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a notixable increase

[23-Nov-18 09:59 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r should be ok now

[23-Nov-18 10:00 AM] gt#2812
what‚Äôs the easiest way to clean up utxo

[23-Nov-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
send the whole balance to yourself

[23-Nov-18 10:00 AM] gt#2812
left over from previous address

[23-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
take the txid

[23-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and do cleanwallettransactions <txid>

[23-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be removing the old wallet reseter from StakedNotary in the coming weeks ... dont need it any more ..

[23-Nov-18 10:02 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright @blackjok3r  I have shutdown this node: 18.224.176.46 which is one of the seeds in StakedNotary/staked.json. If you want a replacement, can add 104.248.99.160 as this will be my StakedNotary here on

[23-Nov-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool.. yeah was going to ask about that we need 8 IPs to add to both lists that are going to likely stay the same in mainnet.

[23-Nov-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
atm it works with just mine... but it takes a while for everyone to connect

[23-Nov-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its  single point of failure should something happen to my server

[23-Nov-18 10:06 AM] zatJUM#9924
Is it OK STAKED or STAKED4 still doesn't sync?

[23-Nov-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah those chains are long dead...

[23-Nov-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED4 balance will be aridropped to the new chain launched tomorrow

[23-Nov-18 10:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[23-Nov-18 10:09 AM] gt#2812
for some reason i can‚Äôt get it to send

[23-Nov-18 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be wokring on the staking scripts using that chain and my balance next week, and will share some simplfied staking scripts.

[23-Nov-18 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try and send a smaller amount

[23-Nov-18 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or try the `./dwy_mitigation.sh` script or what its called

[23-Nov-18 10:10 AM] jorian#4555
will there be a testdrop today with a test chain?

[23-Nov-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure Alright does all that .

[23-Nov-18 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think what I eeded to get working, is done... but we still are not notarising, so maybe something is wrong...

[23-Nov-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
me + alright and +tonyL are hte only nodes showing as having a mask at all... all others are either nissing utxo or some other problem.

[23-Nov-18 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
komodo-cli getinfo is giving me 
```
  "blocks": 0,
  "longestchain": 0,

[23-Nov-18 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
checking it out

[23-Nov-18 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does it have conenctions ?

[23-Nov-18 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian the testdrop is tomorrow

just simulating launch as close as possible

[23-Nov-18 10:17 AM] Alright#0419
which involves airdropping STAKED4 to this TEST chain

[23-Nov-18 10:17 AM] jorian#4555
i am missing CFEK*

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
@gcharang `getpeerinfo`

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
check that

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
Oh I see that it does have connections

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  I had a node do that yesterday ... not sure why either

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
it'll sync *eventually* if you just leave it

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was syncing ... then just started failign to join blocks

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and banning all its peers

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
have been trying to nail down that bug for weeks now üò©

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i stopped it

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cleared banned

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
waited a while

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then restarted and it worked again

[23-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no change in code ü§∑

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] gcharang#6833
all of them have `"whitelisted": false` does it matter?

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just stop it

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
delete peers.dat and try to start again

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] gcharang#6833
ok

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
I keep seeing this same thing happen, but i can't for the life of me reproduce it

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
new node not syncing

[23-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
has peers

[23-Nov-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
just doesn't sync, no prints to indicate why

[23-Nov-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
but if you just leave it, it syncs

[23-Nov-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
can take a good amount of time though

[23-Nov-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man I freeked out when it satrted banning every node ... flooding connect block failed... it was so weird ... no visible error messag... ent though the relavent vfucntions, and every single retunr -1 had a print above it ... but no prints were happening

[23-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really weird

[23-Nov-18 10:22 AM] gcharang#6833
Also `komodo-cli stop` doesn't stop the daemon too. I am having to `kill -9 <process-id of komodod>` to do it

[23-Nov-18 10:23 AM] CrisF#3405
I also had to pkill -9 komodod today.

[23-Nov-18 10:23 AM] CrisF#3405
-15 didn't stop it.

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Neither did ./stop.sh

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think there is a problem there...

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its called a deadlock

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when two threads try to lock the same part of the memory

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It shouldnt happen

[23-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but trying to work why its the case is really really hard

[23-Nov-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did put a fucntion inside connect block.... i'll go ahve a look at it. 
@Alright  that issue happens on non staked daemon too though right?

[23-Nov-18 10:28 AM] gcharang#6833
It doesn't happen for CFEK and the other assetchains it is only happening for KMD

[23-Nov-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... its only KMD issue

[23-Nov-18 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Same üëÜ

[23-Nov-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  did it happen to you only on mastertest brnach (which is now master since todays ping)

[23-Nov-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or on master aswell ?

[23-Nov-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had my momomo test VM kmd go down a few times, but it was die to chains stalling and my scripts floodin git with RPC calls until it crashed/locked up

[23-Nov-18 10:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I had that once before also. A couple of days ago.  
It happened after wallet reset that didn't complete both times.
`resetALLwallets.sh`

[23-Nov-18 10:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm waiting on an ac wallet reset now that's taking a long time(`ING`).

[23-Nov-18 10:33 AM] CrisF#3405
But it was KMD for me before and acs were ok.

[23-Nov-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt use that wallet reset any more I dont think...
