@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator when you say "tokens" in that article you mean "coins"?

[14-Jan-19 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
cos tokens are created from assetsCC, to create non-fungible and fungible tokens.

[14-Jan-19 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
good morning

[14-Jan-19 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
is rant.cryptocartography written with ghost?

[14-Jan-19 01:08 AM] Mylo#8306
sorry, it is.  it is self hosted?

[14-Jan-19 02:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yes to all of the above. easy enough to change tokens to coins if needed. Open to any feedback if something is inaccurate, and I spotted a typo I'll be fixing later (decent != descent)

Pushed massive update to po64staker repo. Tony's refactor broke a few things... Fixed those and also made `stakerlib` a module as per request of Alright. Makes code a little easier to follow. üòÉ Tested to be all working on my end. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  If you can test them aswell with the coins I sent that would be good. Once you have a staker up, I can send some more coins to someone else to test. Dont want the chain to stall out by sending too many away at once.

[14-Jan-19 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the readme is good enough, may also not be lol. Will need a few extra people to test.

I missed the early pos64 testing, so should be a good set of fresh eyes on it while I figure it out.

[14-Jan-19 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These scripts make it very easy lol

[14-Jan-19 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least as easy as it can be üòâ

[14-Jan-19 07:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just rigging up an extra camera, and I'll get into it

[14-Jan-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
withdraw script requries latest update of stakedChain/komodo master branch to work.

[14-Jan-19 07:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all my nodes use the StakedNotary repo, will it work on that?

[14-Jan-19 07:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
only one is a notary, the other two just got setup like that way back when

[14-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that will work fine

[14-Jan-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one thing maybe you will need to copu list.json to `stakedNotary/komodo/master` rather than ~/komodo/src` as the instructions say.

[14-Jan-19 08:17 AM] CMaurice#1685
so you can stake on a NN?

[14-Jan-19 08:18 AM] CMaurice#1685
(I thought not but don't remember where I read it)

[14-Jan-19 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you can now yes... Issue was before the staker basically made the daemon unusable... never responded to RPC calls

[14-Jan-19 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It wouldnt be a great idea... But I cant see any reaon why, if you can spare a single core to stake on, it would not work. Bear in mind having 64 address's on a notary node without disabling teh wallet filter will lead to all kinds of crazy unexpected results.

[14-Jan-19 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is it something we need to be easily able to enable and disable the wallet filter ? I think I can add this pretty easily. 
Also I had an idea earlier... Apparnelty PoS64 works with VerusHash ... maybe verushash has enough hash power with the daemon miner to avoid this Equiahash not having enough hash rate to stop PoS % rising to 100% over time.

[14-Jan-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be an option for the 0BR chains to use VerusHash as their hashing alg? THe Verus V1 was pretty good on GPUs and CPUs and unless some one comes in trying FPGA mine a chain with 0BR I think it should be relativly safe.

[14-Jan-19 09:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
did I use pk instead of pub?

[14-Jan-19 09:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also, the list.json, do the pks need to be imported?

[14-Jan-19 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when you run genaddress.opy it creates new address in an endlkess loop until It has one for every segid... so they are all imported unless you take that list.json to another node or delete wallet.dat.

`staker.py 6a5fd46a54df65fd46a5f46as54f654fda6f54a6sf CFEKPOS51`
not surew what you have done here... 
it should be `staker.py <blockhash> <CHAIN>`

[14-Jan-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in early tests I wasnt using blocknotify but copy pasting the block hash from stdout when It mines a block

[14-Jan-19 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thats just keyboard sham cos I'm paranoid

[14-Jan-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the path is wrong

[14-Jan-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible the isntructions are even wrong...

[14-Jan-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did `pwd` instide the directory where staker.py was and copy psted it

[14-Jan-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep... unless you mine the block it doesnt do anything üòâ

[14-Jan-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need 100 blocks before your utxos are elegible

[14-Jan-19 09:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that was manual so path is ok

[14-Jan-19 09:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, that might be it

[14-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when they are all mature... I can turn off my staker temporarily so you have a higher chance to get a block if you want.

[14-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really need to get some other ndoes staking... as the chain has stalled out using just my one PC.. its frozen on me a few times now lol

[14-Jan-19 09:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, immature.

[14-Jan-19 09:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
except the 600 I had a from mining yesterady

[14-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to speed things up a bit you can hit the chain with aGPU... ive pulled most of my PoW off teh chain not long ago

[14-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its sittinng around 80%

[14-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181

how can a chain with 1 miner be ona  fork ü§∑

[14-Jan-19 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I started gpu, then had a look, not sure  but could be the cause

[14-Jan-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe pool is on old versiona nd needs resync?

[14-Jan-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very confusing....

[14-Jan-19 09:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, could be.

[14-Jan-19 09:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
didnt update :abusedsmily:

[14-Jan-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be any consensus changes ... but I struggle to understand how ther is a fork... either way i guess a resync will either fix it... or reefuse to sync :abusedsmily:

[14-Jan-19 09:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
After start.sh I'll have to stop POS51 and start manually right?

[14-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... using the start.sh scripts isnt currently suppotred...

[14-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do listassetchain aprams and add everything manually

[14-Jan-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if a PITA ... I think I can fix that though... maybe add an input to the start.sh asking for any extra params the user can paste/write in.

[14-Jan-19 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

change pool to CFEKPOS51 and it should work

and the IP:port

[14-Jan-19 10:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
file to edit will probably be in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled folder

[14-Jan-19 10:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
then sudo service nginx restart

ok will have a look at that soon, thanks for the help. üòÉ This explored doesnt ened any special redirect filters like the cluster chains do.

Maybe it nedes to be in StakedNotary

[14-Jan-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if thats where your script starts it from

[14-Jan-19 11:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so copy staker.py to ~/StakedNotary/komodo/master?

[14-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[14-Jan-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where is the script you are using to start the chain? it needs to be there I htink

[14-Jan-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or you cna edit staker.py with the hardcoded path to it
