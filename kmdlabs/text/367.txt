ok no worries

[03-May-19 06:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
split 20

[03-May-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
wat do

[03-May-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
how win

[03-May-19 06:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol...

[03-May-19 06:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```
they are in a payments CC plan (this is what we are testing) you unlock them with the paymentsrelease RPC
any amount above 5M can be unlocked by any person once they are avalible (1460 blocks, after the last snapshot)
the first snapshot will be in like a few hours I think... because there are not may address im not sure what will happen it may even crash it. :joy:
but there are not yet any funds. those will be paid the same block the snapshot happens, and ready to be paid out in 1460 blocks, 20 blocks after the next snapshot```

[03-May-19 06:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```
That I think its mostly the game side of it. 10M coins are avalible, 20 blocks after the snapshot. However you can release only half of these effectivly locking the other half until the next snapshot (or slightly after it, as anything in payments plan is locked for 1460 blocks aftert being sent)
I think we may need some kind of rich list, you can call getsnapshot at any height youself but its a lot of data to digest in JSON format lol
especally with 3999 addresses
```

[03-May-19 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
and what's the algo for where they go?

[03-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every 1440 blocks a snapshot it triggered

[03-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it rewinds the balance in all address back toi the last notarized height

[03-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
uses that block has to generate a number below 50 and a number above

[03-May-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then chooses the address in teh middle of those percentages

`uses that block has to generate a number below 50 and a number above`

[03-May-19 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
so is there some way to predict this?

[03-May-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
where is the code for this algo that chooses address?

[03-May-19 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181

` fprintf(stderr, "bottom.%i top.%i\n",bottom,top);` when it does the snapshot it prints the range out

[03-May-19 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then there is 20 blocks before ANYONE can release it

[03-May-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
I'm getting this voting TUI finished today hopefully. I'll start the first poll for 20vs22. Leave this open for a week, then if 22 wins, pick the BTC block 1 week ahead of poll deadline for lottery

[03-May-19 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they CAN release less

[03-May-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
so 1 week to vote 20vs22

[03-May-19 07:47 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ah no - there it is - went to a KMD generated address instead of a CFEKPAY address

[03-May-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
should voting be first vote counts or last vote before deadline?

[03-May-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
ie, either you can vote once and it's definitive or you can vote as many times as you like prior to deadline

[03-May-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
and the last one is definitive

[03-May-19 10:19 PM] Alright#0419
second option means we have to wait for deadline even if >50% have selected the same option

[03-May-19 11:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think make it so u can only vote once

[03-May-19 11:59 PM] Strob#3417
So my address is in the list so what do I need to do next?

[04-May-19 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll post some scripts and instructions today :) managed to split my balance OK, but not that well. Also moving the balance between address will be the hardest part

Hi @Shinzo Abe , I believe BarterDEX is in a state of change right now.
You can find answers to your question by asking in #ask-a-question  and #talk-trading .

@LabsAssistant @PHBA2061  @Exile13  @Strob  


This repo is a good start for splitting your address balance. This can be imporved on a lot. I just havent got any free time right now. I hope this makes it easy enough to participate and understand how the game works.

Hi @ Labs game testers, 
If you are not a Labs NN, and/or not using  `StakedNotary`, it might be good if you could use `staked`(`https://github.com/KMDLabs/staked`) for the game.  Should provide some experience with Labs and maybe you could find a bug or suggest improvements.  Of course you can play with whatever you chose.
Good Luck üçÄ

[04-May-19 06:23 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thank you blackjok3r, I'll look into that repo

[04-May-19 09:02 AM] Strob#3417
How long will the game last? I just read the instructions quickly... I will have more time to play it only in 5 days, do you think I can still participate?

[04-May-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It depends how it goes over the next 2 days, I'll call when the labs will be given as prize tomorrow. It can continue after that for ever if ppl want to but there will be no prize

[04-May-19 10:18 AM] Strob#3417
Can I run this on the same node as my testnet node? My hardware can surely supports it but on the software side?

[04-May-19 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
