```graph the change in coinsupply over time between the chains in cluster``` This would be very cool!

[05-Mar-19 08:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the oracle graph wouldnt be storing hashes for debug, but might indicate if/when something went wrong.

[05-Mar-19 08:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll have a look tommorow when I have a spare moment or two and see what I can come up with.

[05-Mar-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just something to track supply... I think I can make the script more reliaable... although the easies tid to justs do 24H at a time, the restart it manually.

[05-Mar-19 08:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was thinking  hourly datapoints for each cc_id, with graph displaying last 24hrs

Having tools like that that could be used as basic templates could prove very useful for new projects joining Labs.

[05-Mar-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  thats not really possible to do, as the problem will only arise again, if a notarization on the target is lost, due to a reorg, and it not being mined again, which happens under Alrights stupid censorship attack which is a 150% attack effectivly...  I have already accounted for reorgs in MoM hash, range so that it will keep going back to the last notarized MoM height. Hoever the MoMoM itself can be seen, and then enable an import to happen, then be reorged out of the chain, making the chain not able to sync afterwards if the notarization with the matching MoMoM hash is lost. the only way to enforce the MoMoM is notarized into the chain, will be on the script/RPC side I think.

[05-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why I said 2 notarizations. when 2 deep, it cant be reorged as the notarization itself is notarized

[05-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, on the script side

[05-Mar-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes Im jsut dont know how to implement that. The fix I used was to just include notarizaed notarizations in the MoMoM hash calculation to make sure if it was lost it was then added again on the next round, combined with not letting iguana notarize a NULL MoMoM hash.

[05-Mar-19 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to work, however you cannot make iguana use notarized notarizations

[05-Mar-19 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise if KMD notarizations stop for any reason, gaps happen

[05-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as gaps means it takes longer and not lost migrates

[05-Mar-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gaps means it totally breaks

[05-Mar-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the fix to stop gaps is just to keepo increasing the range used further and further back, but how far can you go before it gets very very slow.

[05-Mar-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or starts to confuse things .

[05-Mar-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
ouch. can we have a fallback that is very very slow to be used only rarely where most of the time it uses the normal (fast) way

[05-Mar-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i just have this feeling we need to have more than a single way to validate things

[05-Mar-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really.. unfortunatly... iguana side is fetching data form KMD, which is usually reliable and doest not suffer reorgs... however... by usiung notarized height you need to use a very large range of assetchain notarizations. My first idea was to have some cut off, if there was no notarization for X blocks, just let it notarize anyway.

[05-Mar-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having a way to undo the export if it fails import is the only way to amke it perfect under all conditions.

[05-Mar-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, an undo!

[05-Mar-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can get it 99.9% reliable and then have an undo for the 0.1% case, that should be good

[05-Mar-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need to know for sure an import will fail and then use that as proof to get a refund (undo)

[05-Mar-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is the best case, with the altest fix (and maybe increasing range 1 or 2 more nota) it would only fail under a severe attack or no KMD blocks happening for extreme amounts of time.

[05-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what is "extreme" here?

[05-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
one hour, one day

[05-Mar-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
an hour or more where notarization are lost

[05-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
hour... sometimes blocks can take a long time

[05-Mar-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the issue is lsot notarizations... not sure why it happens as they have no expiry but they seems to be able to be lost with heavy reorgs.

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so under 150% attack, well all sorts of things can happen

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A few people have reported the mempool not really propagating transactions for a while now.

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is another bug needs to be fixed

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Any way to detect those situations and somehow halt migrations?

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
can you determine for sure if a migrate will fail?

[05-Mar-19 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on the RPC/script side you just ait for notarizations... issue only ahppens if already exported during the attackl.

[05-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
from the original chain side

[05-Mar-19 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubtful

[05-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
how to prevent a double refund, ie. they migrate and also refund

[05-Mar-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to verify the MoMoM hash has failed... maybe KMD could detect it somehow with some magical maths and its notarization DB.

[05-Mar-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but how then does KMD tell the source chain to refund?

[05-Mar-19 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
current implemntation makes it very difficult to make an undo.

[05-Mar-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the source chain would submit a refund tx that somehow needs to be verified as valid and not migrated

[05-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe some speical reverse migrate would be needed?

[05-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
we might need an entirely new dataset for this...

[05-Mar-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We were just going to build into the bounty fund and claim for lsot migrates... but that only works for LABS.

[05-Mar-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
or... what if there was a special notary opreturn that marks a specific migrate as valid, regardess of MoMoM validation. it wouldnt have any effect if it was also validated as you can only use the burntxid once

[05-Mar-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so the MoMoM validation would check for a special notary approval. this punts the detection of failed migrates to the notaries, but at least there would be a way to handle the rare edge cases

[05-Mar-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
seems better than refunding, which is quite difficult to do

[05-Mar-19 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works, as its pretty much what we were going to do, but have the OPs manually check the migrate was invalid before paying out.

[05-Mar-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt have any effect if it was valid (needs to be tested) so there is no need to validate it. in fact, the notaries could just validate all the migrates they see and it wouldnt affect anything other than allow the edge cases to confirm

[05-Mar-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so all that needs to be done by notaries is to verify that it was a valid burn

[05-Mar-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î  I wonder if its possible for notaries to check for missing MoMoM hash and just do an extra notarization containing it later on?

[05-Mar-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as its within 100 blocks, everything still works

[05-Mar-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like they need to track X notarization txids, and if it is never confirmed, jsut make it again. Couldnt use the same tx as the inputs may have been spent, just use the same OP_RETURN

[05-Mar-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
why is there a 100 blocks limit?

[05-Mar-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just how far it sledehammmer scans the notarizations DB for MoMoM hash

[05-Mar-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so it could be made a longer period?

[05-Mar-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can be increased.... it was only put there for rare case of notarization confirmed out of order

[05-Mar-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only real downside to it, seems to be that it goes backwards then scan forwards, so it checks all the old incorrest not matchin MoMoM first...

[05-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
well if the error can be automatically scanned for and corrected, that seems to solve the issue!

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so an edge case detector that corrects things by resubmitting

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it should only use this sledgehammer scan if the check for where the MoMoM is suppsoed to be fails.

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the scan can be 1000 blocks no problem even more

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
then it can be made a much bigger than 100 blocks window

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so how reliable can the edge case detector be?

[05-Mar-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% sure, but it would need to be in iguana

[05-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and can all notaries reach consensus about this

[05-Mar-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would think so yes. Becaus they all have the same chain.

[05-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is the solution.

[05-Mar-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all iguana needs to do, is spawn a thread that checks the last sent txid until the next notarization is confirmed.

[05-Mar-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once the txid is notarized...

[05-Mar-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it kills the thread...

[05-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and if it doesnt, it adds to the list of edge cases

[05-Mar-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so once per hour the edge cases can be dealt with

[05-Mar-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a list of edge cases is proposed, and if agreed to, the list is published onchain

[05-Mar-19 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how hard that would be to implement, it sound simple enough... but it does require all notaries to create the same exact notarization again, but with new inputs.

[05-Mar-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
will be a bit tricky...

[05-Mar-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the approval of a specific burn txid via oracles  will be easier to implement as it wont need much interaction between notaries, they can independently post agreement to the claim

[05-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and a CC would require M such approvals to import the burntxid without MoMoM

[05-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
or...

[05-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I think we are overcomplicating things!

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[05-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
based on what you know, most of the time things should work pretty smoothly, right?

[05-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so we just need a way to solve the edge cases, which we assume will be rare

[05-Mar-19 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
99.9999% I think. But I need plentyt of time and maybe some attacks to make sure.

[05-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so why not to directly post a txproof for the burn txid

[05-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if M notaries sign a txproof for a specific chain/burntx, then it is usable as proof of burn in the importcoins.

[05-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
just requires a bit of alternate validation code, but @dimxy is already doing very similar things

[05-Mar-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it just needs to set the same tombstone as the normal import process

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then a double import cant be done. so all the notaries would need to do is post a txproof from the burn chain onto the import chain

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does this need to be done for every burn though? That could be a LOT of extra tx...

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or only if it fails?

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say, the one who wants to import has to post the txproof. now we get a txproof txid and the notaries can just independently post approval

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
this is only on failures

[05-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the backup mechanism

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in case of MoMoM failure

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
just use a txproof for each tx

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh like a CC? independant of iguana?
