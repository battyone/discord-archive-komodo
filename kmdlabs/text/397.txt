Hi @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 , Should we be in era 3 already?

[24-May-19 11:39 PM] CrisF#3405
```LABS is a STAKED chain in era 3```

[25-May-19 12:03 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@CrisF where do you see that?

[25-May-19 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
What jackwagon came up with the idea of 8 vouts in coinbase? 游땪
```                    if (result.response.vout[1]) {
                        emitLog("fek 'em, they can get paid by stakers");
                    }```

Gosh.  A lot to catch up on.
Seems there is much excitement.   I haven't seen excitement of this level since VRSC launch.  ARRR was similar but different.

Yeah, wiped it and reinstalling.

Hmm, reinstall but iguana tv still seems pretty dead.  Nothing scrolling.

[25-May-19 03:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Have connections, but I'm in a totally different mask than everyone.

[25-May-19 03:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Wonder if I screwed up my pub key.

[25-May-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah check pubkey, and if ANY weird behaviour, just fresh clone and build... we had some git issues.

[25-May-19 04:50 AM] CrisF#3405
I've got some movement in std now.

[25-May-19 04:51 AM] CrisF#3405
did a total rm -rf job

[25-May-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  I would advise using disablecb for LABS, the block reward for notary nodes is dynamic and constantly changes.

[25-May-19 04:51 AM] CrisF#3405
getting `0000000`s , but looking like it's sorting itself out.

[25-May-19 05:15 AM] CrisF#3405
pubkey in `https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.h` is same as in my wallet. `ismine` `isvalid` true

[25-May-19 05:16 AM] CrisF#3405
For some reason I'm in a totally different mask.

[25-May-19 05:16 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Staking definately not working for me. 100's invalid blocks.

This script isnt working btw... Going to push hacky fix... Something in getinfo is broken.

[25-May-19 05:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I had a `validate` error at one point.

[25-May-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Not sure why I'm in my own mask.

[25-May-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really not sure man. iguana is on the `staked` branch?

[25-May-19 05:32 AM] CrisF#3405
installed through StakedNotary, checking

[25-May-19 05:33 AM] CrisF#3405
```git status

[25-May-19 05:33 AM] CrisF#3405
will wipe SuperNet and see if that helps.

[25-May-19 05:34 AM] Exile13#4458
~/komodo git pull?

[25-May-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont help

[25-May-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

~/komodo make clean?

[25-May-19 05:59 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - First to notarise, last on the performance list - typical.

[25-May-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.... Just pushed fix to getinfo so that the stats script works without crashing.. Not important, I just broken it at some stage... although may change how it works not sure yet. in any case its just display issue and now its working.

[25-May-19 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL if you look at block 1 amount compared to ac_supply amount, I think that's the difference

not the exact number you have though 游뱂

[25-May-19 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, anyway quite little amount - can be included in the confidence interval 游땎

[25-May-19 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
`not the exact number you have though :thinking:`
Difference from 3rd digit after comma

[25-May-19 06:33 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I paid tx fees to myself in block 3, that might be why

[25-May-19 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
My script might count not precise

[25-May-19 06:34 AM] TonyL#3577
In spot of supply such amount as txfees are negligible
