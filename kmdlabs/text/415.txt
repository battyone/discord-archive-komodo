I'm putting together a FAQ for LABS. If you have any confusion as to what it is, what it sets out to accomplish or how it works, please let me know.

[31-May-19 11:21 PM] Oszy#5734
Is this the repo for LABS? https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo

[31-May-19 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
depends on what you're trying to accomplish @Oszy

[31-May-19 11:30 PM] phm87#7395
komodo binary (the KMDLabs repo can be fine, I'm not sure ... other ppl will confirm or infirm)
```komodod -ac_cclib=labs -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=80.240.17.222 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_supply=350689 -ac_staked=51 -ac_name=LABS -ac_reward=0,0,800000000 -ac_end=128,10080,0 -ac_notarypay=64,100000000,1000000000 -ac_eras=3 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_cc=101 -ac_halving=129,1 -ac_decay=0,100000000,100000000```
To launch LABS assetchain

[31-May-19 11:31 PM] Oszy#5734
just to access the wallet

[31-May-19 11:31 PM] Oszy#5734
thanks

[31-May-19 11:32 PM] Alright#0419
CLI, you can use the params phm posted above. You can use either our KMDLabs/komodo repo or jl777's komodo repo's beta branch

[31-May-19 11:32 PM] Oszy#5734
great thank you

[31-May-19 11:34 PM] Alright#0419
Agama release is here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/ labelled 
"test version - DO NOT USE!" can't recommend using it until qa team gives final approval though

Hi, my `TUIstaker.py` is only showing 6 ( +exit) options under `LABS`.  There should be more.  This is after a fresh git pull.
Where should I be pulling from?

[01-Jun-19 01:31 AM] CrisF#3405
(`https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker.git`)

[01-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
`git checkout restart`

Just delete staker.conf for now

[01-Jun-19 02:21 AM] Alright#0419
Just need to make the script create an empty conf instead of including empty conf in repo

[01-Jun-19 07:14 AM] CrisF#3405
CFEKFEK seems a bit ded.

[01-Jun-19 07:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was mining it and stopped, mightve slowed it down. anyone else mining?

[01-Jun-19 08:20 AM] CrisF#3405
My miner went down.  See how it goes now.

[01-Jun-19 09:07 AM] jorian#4555
blocks are slow

[01-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Oszy#5734

[01-Jun-19 12:14 PM] jorian#4555
at least we have staking, that keeps the chain going somewhat

[01-Jun-19 12:14 PM] jorian#4555
i call this rollercoaster mining üòÑ

[01-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator what "difficulty" is that based on?

[01-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
might just be how pos64 chains look, could you try the same on ZEXO or OUR?

[01-Jun-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Meanwhile CFEKBET1 matured for bets and there is Ubuntu portable GUI / daemon for those who want to try open some positions: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/releases/tag/0.0.1 üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
why does the web server need sudo?

[01-Jun-19 05:34 PM] TonyL#3577
My bundle issue

[01-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean?

[01-Jun-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Without sudo it throwing `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied` at the moment, because I've packaged it under sudo (I think)

[01-Jun-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
But when I'm packaging not under sudo it by some reason setting my machine PYTHONPATH

[01-Jun-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
On Ubuntu 16.04, but if I package on Ubuntu 18 PYTHONPATH is fine

[01-Jun-19 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
As an alternative you can use sources for sure: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python
additional Dash framework (over slickrpc and etc) pip deps can be found in readme

[01-Jun-19 05:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, also please note that webinterace starting on 0.0.0.0:777, not 127.0.0.1, so if you have external IP and port 777 is open somebody can open in browser: yourip:777 and place bets from you
From other side it opening opportunities to place bets from mobile lets say (start stuff on your server and open it address:777 on mobile)

[01-Jun-19 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
But it solvable if connect to current code some authentification

[01-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
yes it's cool, can maybe host from docker containers for noobs who just want to toy around with it

[01-Jun-19 05:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yeah, webinterface allows to use it on any machine which have browser

[01-Jun-19 05:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Better than TUI üòÇ

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
any chance you feel like adding exports to the UI?

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Docker containers will work yeah, I can make such scalable infrastructure on AWS if it is a business idea üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
It saving a lot of stuff locally in CSV files

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
so let's say we do host instances for noobs

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
them being able to export back to main chain would be nice

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
without them having to hassle us to do it

[01-Jun-19 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, exports not of data üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
momom exports

[01-Jun-19 05:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually I think anything is possible to add üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
so let's say we go "we have 10 instances loaded with 10 LABS each. Come and try it" 
we then unfirewall the instance to their specific IP and they have 10 LABS to play around with

[01-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
what do they do when they want to get those 10 LABS back to the main chain?

[01-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
or 1 LABS when they get rekt üòõ

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe there is a gatewayCC on LABS chain

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Which accepting LABSEX and giving LABS

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
why?

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] TonyL#3577
So noob will need just to send coins to address üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`why does the web server need sudo`
not sure if it's related to the question, but while testting CHIPS, I also noticed that any modification under `/var/www/html ` requires sudo as well

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
the import/export process is pretty simple now

[01-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
a command on source, a command on KMD, a command on target after some waiting

[01-Jun-19 05:52 PM] TonyL#3577
I never tried it tbh since rewrote this bash script into python üòÇ

[01-Jun-19 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
which reminds me, I have to get that outlined for @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[01-Jun-19 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
told me he'd make a derpy windows GUI for exports

[01-Jun-19 05:53 PM] TonyL#3577
@PHBA2061 Maybe in your configuration owner of files in /var/www/html is root

[01-Jun-19 05:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
thanks for the hint, I'll check it

[01-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
is 5 LABS enough to get a sense of it you think?

[01-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
I can try to host 20 instances with 5 LABS each, do you think that'd help?

[01-Jun-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it is an interesting idea in general

[01-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
without some kind of auth in the app, I'll have to do it via firewall rules

[01-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
only let specific IP connect to each instance

[01-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
should work as long as user's IP isn't changing

[01-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
maybe I can do some docker routing voodoo, not sure

[01-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User teach me some docker routing voodoo? üòÖ

[01-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
ok so he has this webserver with no auth, requires a LABS daemon behind it as well. I'd like to figure out some way to host maybe 20 instances or this via docker without having to do a bunch of firewall BS to let each user only access the instance they're meant to access

[01-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
The getting the servers running is not the problem, just wondering how best to handle the routing of it

[01-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
so the simplest way would be user gives me IP they'll access it from and I whitelist that IP to the port of their instance

[01-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
it's a web server UI for prices CC

[01-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
so I'm thinking we can rope in some noobs if it's as simple as "give me your IP then go to <this> link" üòÑ

[01-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
I have 20 webservers running on a single host, each in a docker container. I want to make sure only 1 user can access each.

[01-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
the webserver itself doesn't have any auth

[01-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
what is the best way to do that?

[01-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[01-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[01-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
ok and what about auth, just firewall rules?

[01-Jun-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
This app using flask as webserver. I think we can make something like a:
```if request.remote_addr != '192.168.1.1':
        abort(403)  # Forbidden```

[01-Jun-19 06:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So this way traffic is kinda "stateless"  
Or we can just add login/passowrd üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 06:28 PM] TonyL#3577
On each such instance you can put some pre-generated secret phrase in `secretphrase.txt` and instance purchaser getting it and have to input when opening `ipaddress:777`  - if user input match file content he become able to issue RPC calls and etc

[01-Jun-19 06:29 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks insecure but will not allow any noob to bet your funds üòÉ

[01-Jun-19 06:34 PM] TonyL#3577
For production system we can orchestrate few containers - some auth as microservice, komodod as microservice, web-app as microservice

[01-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
don't think it's a longterm thing, just a "try it and if you like it, run it on your own machine" thing

[01-Jun-19 06:35 PM] TonyL#3577
But from other side looks not good to build complex web-app for single user

[01-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
I'll try to set it up with current webserver

[01-Jun-19 06:36 PM] TonyL#3577
More interesting if it will be single webapp but different users can login yeah

[01-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
I mean, do you feel like making the webserver do what Emman just said?

[01-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
think it would be better to focus on user running it themselves

[01-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
and just have this as a way to let them try it

[01-Jun-19 06:37 PM] TonyL#3577
For plays/testing anything what work is good

[01-Jun-19 06:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually portable webinterface noob friendly enough
