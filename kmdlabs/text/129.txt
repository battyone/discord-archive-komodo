Does someone know if API has to be enabled on insight.is explorers?

[25-Nov-18 08:57 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have tried to make some calls to the explorer pinned but it's always  => "Cannot GET" answer

[25-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM don't think so

[25-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
can you show me an example of what you're trying

[25-Nov-18 08:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
```curl http://140.82.3.117:3002/api/peer```

[25-Nov-18 08:59 PM] zatJUM#9924

üëç  Thanks a lot, I'll take a look when I have time!

[25-Nov-18 10:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Question for you all... is moving Notary nodes as easy as putting up a new one with the same key, WIF and Raddr? Minus the IP change of course...

[25-Nov-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
Yes, but changing IP can knock you out of notarizing for a day or two

[25-Nov-18 10:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
k

[25-Nov-18 10:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
also...

[25-Nov-18 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
I used the stop.sh script... waited like 5 mins

[25-Nov-18 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
shut everything down and rebooted...

[25-Nov-18 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
Node was FEKKED

[25-Nov-18 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
all CFEK chains refused to start except DUCKS

[25-Nov-18 10:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
lots of help humans!

[25-Nov-18 10:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
i ended up removing all of their folders, then restarting and it is resyncing now

[25-Nov-18 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
need their debug.log s or how to reproduce it

[26-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - not complaining, cause it's saving me KMD - but I am being selected for like 2% of Lameduck notarisations.
Is there anywhere I can check which metrics I am low on?

[26-Nov-18 06:25 AM] Nabob#5004
Do walletreset on that chain.....and utxosplit script and check diference @Bar_F1sh_Rel

[26-Nov-18 08:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi@Bar_F1sh_Rel, Thanks for making the list of notarizations you posted yesterday.  Very cool!

[26-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Mylo#8306
I‚Äôm lame duck!   But I got a new laptop so I‚Äôll just lurk and give my professional unwanted opinion on topics.  This channel will no doubt be a source of tech Tuesday articles!
Congratulations on Lab Notaries!

The main thing required for heavy counts is a very very fast internet connection... Like insane fast, most vps providers are good enough, but a home connection or a small data centre like where my sever is, can have very low counts... Especially because we are not enforcing regions, there will likely end up a small group of nodes who are all very close together that will dominate counts... I've said this would be an issue fro. the start, and alright just said to move node to where it preforms better... I guess we all end up in the same data centre that way, u leas we split the group in half and use 2 dcs lol...

[26-Nov-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I take it we have a top 20 list by now and everything is running smoothly?

[26-Nov-18 12:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Notarizations seem to be going smoothly.

[26-Nov-18 12:03 PM] CrisF#3405
I haven't had a chance yet, but try some migrations.

[26-Nov-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Great, with that many nodes it should be perfect, the issue I saw with early not as being out of line, isn't an issue, but we need to add a chain to the ducks cluster and stress teat migrates on it.

[26-Nov-18 12:03 PM] CrisF#3405
There should be enough people around to really give it a beating.

[26-Nov-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... Mist nodes are notaries, so maybe not...

[26-Nov-18 12:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Maybe we could organize a stress test of sorts.  Or 2...

[26-Nov-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I have some ideas for a new.script that can really push it hard

[26-Nov-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Won't have it down for a few days at least though, there's a few things I still need to solve to make it actually work.

[26-Nov-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is enough people around and you guys can, remove some chains from the old cluster and add a few to the new one, we need to get pos and low on ducks, at the correct % and then migrate over it heavily.

[26-Nov-18 12:07 PM] CrisF#3405
True, but figure CMaurice, greentea, Bar_ F1sh_Rel, kmdkrazy & SMK at least might be up for it if we set a good time üòÉ

[26-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries, no rush on it, but I think that's the main thing we need to test, to make 100% sure nothing has been broken.

[26-Nov-18 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, no rush is good.  Getting a suitable time is important.

[26-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as things are working smoothly its fine, if anyone has anything strange, even if you think its something you did, please ping me about it. This will likely be the version of komodod we launch the main chain with, needs to be working perfectly.

[26-Nov-18 01:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have some overhead spare on my cluster - already have a non-notary staked ready for stress tests.

[26-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Need to read up on difficulty algos for hybrid pos/pow to understand why we can't decouple.

[26-Nov-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel decouple?

[26-Nov-18 03:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep, I'm up for anything

[26-Nov-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool guys. I will try to spend some time on my script tomorow.. I think that by combining the wallet cleaner RPC and creation of exports,  we can send lots and lots of exports consitstently.. its dealing with them all without crashig the daemons thats the problem.. The current method of polling MoMoM RPCs until they work has far too much overhead.

[26-Nov-18 03:16 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@Alright - it seems that high pos difficulty gives high pow difficulty, at least that is how I have read past posts in here about needing a mini to counter high pos and re-balance?

[26-Nov-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... kind of

[26-Nov-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How it works... is something like this, (this is my understanding anyway)
PoS ... it calculates if it can win, if it cant then it does not try... as time passes, the calculation becomes easier, until a utxo can stake and tries.
PoW ... is PoW BUT ... if the PoS % is too low the PoW difficulty  increases exponentially really really fast until the PoW cannot find a block.

[26-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This means without enough hash rate, the PoS can just over take the PoW because it gets an easier difficulty after 384s passes since the last block, PoS will always find a block, has upsides nad down sides, upside is chain can never stall, and hash attacks dont happen.

[26-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Down side is blocks can be a little inconsitant ... although not as bad as BTC is. üòÉ

[26-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am really looking foward to the main chain, to see what happens with a high hash rate and a long enough time period, if the inconsitent blocks stop happening.

[26-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is purely based on blocktimes

[26-Nov-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but the PoW needs to solve a recalculated diff based on whether recent percentage if above or below the target

{Reactions}
üëç 

[26-Nov-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the PoW diff adjustment is very steep. it needs to handle ASIC arriving and disappearing

[26-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue we see, is at very low hash rates (CPU mining) the actual base diff is too high for them to find blocks.

[26-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really dont think its a problem, as a single GPU is usally enough to fix it.

[26-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or many CPUs

[26-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Alright#0419
Verushash merged into KMD, so if you want a CPU mined chain, don't use equihash

`Verushash ....CPU mined chain...`
I only 1/2 joke; that there now exists GPU miner and equihash ASICs, kinda makes something like verushash an attractive option for the gajillion dust-collecting GPUs

[26-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Vega64 with good undervolt is actually quite good at verus hash

[26-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Almost equal to ryzen

[26-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Per watt

[26-Nov-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Waiting for even better Linux drivers coming months might even beat CPU

[26-Nov-18 05:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
Is the riser vs MB slots hashrate loss still an issue for verushash?

[26-Nov-18 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
Don't think so @daemonfox

[26-Nov-18 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
Was a limitation of the first GPU miner implementation as far as I know

[26-Nov-18 05:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
hmmm...

[26-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - Sorry, I tried running some migrates - ED & ING ran OK, DUCKS failed on the three I ran, So... I thought it was a DUCKS thing - but just spotted LF failed on one of three.

[26-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
could be a slow chain thing

Have you not run any cross-chain coin migrates yet?

where are the instructions to  run cross-chain coin migrations?

this is the only thing im trying to figure out

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you need to create a logs dir and change the script to reflect wherever you make it

[26-Nov-18 09:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
missed the s onl logs

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you can use the oneshot instead of the sequence to test out first

Create import transaction sucessful!
Sign import transaction on KMD complete!

[26-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
or at least reduce the 2000

havent tried the loop yet

[26-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
one more step I think - confirm import

[26-Nov-18 09:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
makes sense - just read the rest of the script  ---  - how long does it take to finish?

[26-Nov-18 09:09 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
mine takes around 1050 seconds

[26-Nov-18 09:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how many can I run at the same time?

[26-Nov-18 09:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have 4 running same coins

[26-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
no idea - many I expect.

[26-Nov-18 09:12 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I mucked around with the scripts and loops - made it send random amounts to each chain in turn for a few loops

[26-Nov-18 09:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
sleep $(( RANDOM % 90 + 30 ))

[26-Nov-18 09:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like loopmigrate loops 10 times

[26-Nov-18 09:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and sleeps random length of time in between loops

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill have to start learning these scripts better

[26-Nov-18 09:16 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have a script for each chain and then a separate loop script

[26-Nov-18 09:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
like migrateduck.sh ect.

[26-Nov-18 09:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
yeah - with ``amount=$(( RANDOM % 300 + 1 ))``

[26-Nov-18 09:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
between 1 and 300  im guessing that means

[26-Nov-18 09:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
wasnt there an auto level funds script somewhere

[26-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
so many I get lost - and some only work on a 'iguana' activated install (unlike my staked one I use for the migrates - no iguana there)
