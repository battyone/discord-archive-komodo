sounds like good feedback man, I went out of my way to make it all sit in the staked folder, so leaving it as komodo-cli seems a bit silly now you mention it

[11-Oct-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you change name, be sure to change calls to it too

[11-Oct-18 02:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think there are problems even calling for komodod - im not sure why I had issues - I am trying to think what way I  made it work --- and where is the new asset launching from ? what komodod was it looking for? just a little confused

[11-Oct-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kmdkrazy `what komodod was it looking for` will be relitive to if you used `./` or not

[11-Oct-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./` = in this dir
no `./` = in bin dir

[11-Oct-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
search replace should do the trick ... I htink I left it as komodo-cli because of all the calls ... it got really late last night fast and I was rushing it a bit at the end.

[11-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`start.sh` should do everything ...

[11-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should build the komodod and komodo-cli

[11-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
them move them to a folder

[11-Oct-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it referances where that folder is, from a parmeter in assetchains.json

[11-Oct-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to do it that way, so that we can have multiple forks of komodo

[11-Oct-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for diffrent chains.

[11-Oct-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without confusing the shit out of everyone

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
why not change the name of komodod?

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it might have bugs as anything

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that makes it even harder ..

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its far easier to just have a folder $1

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
if I have 10 assets

[11-Oct-18 02:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have to kill an asset named komodod

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Then maybe instead of changing cli name, just put it in daemon dir instead of bin dir?

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to access the particular chain you use `asset-cli STKDTROLL <command> `

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and its really stakedMUTHAFUCKA

[11-Oct-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and that asset-cli usies the assetchains.sjon to find which komodo-cli its supposed to use

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as new branhces with new CC RPCs will use a diffrent komodo-cli

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but the main scitps all use the masterbranch, as all those RPC calls are backwards and forwards compatible

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sjon` well, that's the problem, right htere :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its no issue to change master branch to stakedd and staked-cli

[11-Oct-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then it can be used on any system, if komodo is already installed

[11-Oct-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry rushing typeing need to get backto finishing it

go to work

[11-Oct-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wqill be back soon

[11-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
git er done

[11-Oct-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its got to mine to block 128 its at 117 now

[11-Oct-18 02:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i will let you know the noob mistakes as they happen - when you update

[11-Oct-18 02:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
special characters are the biggest problem ATM

[11-Oct-18 02:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think the ./komodod problem is in the code looking for the correct one.

[11-Oct-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodod` will only look in the dir you run it from

[11-Oct-18 02:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
his dApp is confused

[11-Oct-18 02:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
there is a small problem when his app looks for his chain

[11-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it can't be confused with `./`, either it's there or it isn't

[11-Oct-18 02:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how do i explain this

[11-Oct-18 02:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
his start.sh

[11-Oct-18 02:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
finding komodod running when its not the one for TROLL

[11-Oct-18 02:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think that covers the statement

[11-Oct-18 02:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
10 if komodod = real komodo then go to 20

[11-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that file uses the cli that's in the bin dir and has not to do with komodod location

[11-Oct-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cli communicates with running daemon irrelevant to daemon location

[11-Oct-18 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[11-Oct-18 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I had errors and I am reporting my noob errors

[11-Oct-18 02:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i got it running

[11-Oct-18 02:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but I had to back track and restart because of komodod already running

[11-Oct-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`10 if komodod = real komodo then go to 20`
fek, you're about as old as I am 😛

he set the chip up to change games when u hit the reset button once --- had 6 games on one chip

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_does not miss ROM cartridges for text based games :P_

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I probably could name all 6 if I thought about it

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found the problem you speak of

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it ws killing komodod

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or trying to

[11-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just fixed it

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
nice

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👍🏼

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I copy pasted code from all diffrent places to make this repo ... and missed a few things that were incorrect.

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just started start.sh

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and its building kvtroll branch now

[11-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
changing komodo-cli symlink to staked-cli

[11-Oct-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was easy as pie... it only has liek 3 calls to komodo-cli in the whole repo 😂

pacman, asteroids, donkeykong, centepede, fuck what were the other 2

Since I will not need a new vm, I'm going for breakfast; tag when you push and I'll play with new version

yeah - I should try to work on company shit too

[11-Oct-18 02:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
see you guys on the break

[11-Oct-18 03:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I was just wondering how many ones and zeros that could go threw this system and at what rate of speed and time?

[11-Oct-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This chain is so freeking fast

[11-Oct-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know what would happen if you tried to fill its blocks though

[11-Oct-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume it would reorg like crazy

[11-Oct-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we should definatly try and test it at asome point ...it wont be easy... likey need 10 TxBlaster all pointed to it at once

[11-Oct-18 03:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so ..could you stream TV?

[11-Oct-18 03:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how fast?

[11-Oct-18 03:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

or stop it

[11-Oct-18 03:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ip addresses wouldnt matter

[11-Oct-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The minimally more decentralized that a chain would be over torrents isn't worth bringing more undue criticism, imo
"See, we told you only criminals use it"

[11-Oct-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem with filling all the blocks, is just how big the chain would get

[11-Oct-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the problem with filling all the blocks, is just how big the chain would get`
The real reason Core limits block size 😉
