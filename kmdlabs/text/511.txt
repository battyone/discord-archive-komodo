My wallet is ok now. Use native mode to it sync complete. Then import seed from old wallet.

I staked a block, using staker.py, and the reward went to an address I do not own (not in my list.json, ismine:false), in addition to that, my 8 labs that was on my address got combined and sent to the address that I do not own, how is this possible? @Alright
My balance is -8 LABS than it was before.

[05-Nov-19 11:41 AM] phm87#7395
Be careful about pubkey used @Oszy

[05-Nov-19 11:43 AM] Oszy#5734
I use the same as always to start daemon, don't know if staker.py changes that while running, my guess that it does.

[05-Nov-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the script cannot change pubkey if set on launch

[05-Nov-19 12:07 PM] Oszy#5734
even more interesting then

[05-Nov-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
why use pubkey on staker anymore?

[05-Nov-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
Most of us had awesome results just letting the 8 coin UTXOs land randomly... and they stake like crazy

I can list more reasons to *not* use pubkey for staking than I can for using it 😛

[05-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
still have best results with staker myself

[05-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
look at all your 8 LABS utxos, any of them older than 30 days?

[05-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
if so, losing staking potential

[05-Nov-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`any of them older than 30 days?`
There's only so many I *can* stake in 3 days :troll:

[05-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
if a 8 coin UTXO stakes within 3 days, my staking nodes are probably down

[05-Nov-19 01:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
If playing the game to its fullest potential, I would say there is a calculable point where a UTXO amount is most efficient per total coin weight of the network.

[05-Nov-19 01:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
So yes with that much oversight... staker might be more effective.

[05-Nov-19 01:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
But setgenerate true 0 and walk away also has its appeal

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `the script cannot change pubkey if set on launch`
```How the staker.py works
on block arrival:
getinfo for -pubkey
setpubkey for R address <<<<<<<<<<<
check coinbase -> R address```

So it does change pubkey?

[05-Nov-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "3 days" thing is because I've only been back staking for 3 days, hence I cannot stake all 5126 UTXOs in the last 3 days

`Can only set pubkey once, to change it you need to restart your daemon.`

👍 

[05-Nov-19 01:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just to be sure... you did import that pubkey address... you can validate it on that daemon and ismine is true?

[05-Nov-19 01:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
I sw you posted the block went to an address where ismine is false

[05-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Oszy#5734
yes it's mine, looks like that block went orphan but still don't understand why it would go to an addy that isn't mine

[05-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Oszy#5734
running a reindex now as per Alrights request

[05-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Alright#0419
someone created a block at the same height and their's was accepted as real

[05-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Alright#0419
didn't lose anything other than that block reward, it's as if it never existed in the first place

does anyone else's start script always fail?
```[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...
 Starting KMD Failed: help human!```
need to do it manually all the time

[05-Nov-19 02:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
I get that each time

[05-Nov-19 02:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
Reboot does the trick

[05-Nov-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`does anyone else's start script always fail?`
it doesn't for me
It *sometimes* fails when branch switching (usually due to a dependency change)and *sometimes* fails with a "missing" bit that isn't missing but seems to be a compiler issue

[05-Nov-19 02:35 PM] SHossain#0007
@jorian yes, it always fails for me. i have same issue as you and need manual start all the time

[05-Nov-19 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007
i posted multiple times here. used to happen on my old VPS. i have a new VPS with fresh installation of everything, still same

[05-Nov-19 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
i'm too lazy to fix the (darn long) script

[05-Nov-19 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
so i made a script that starts kmd and then calls the start script :abusedsmily:

[05-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Oszy#5734
what could cause `connect() to xxx.yyy.zzz failed after select(): Connection refused (111)`
for every single node it tries to connect to?(dns seeds and fixed seed nodes) 
it only happens with one chain, and only on one of my machines. other pc on the same network can connect
previously it was connected and synced the chain just fine

[05-Nov-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
you can ignore those prints @Oszy

[05-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Oszy#5734
but it's every node and chain don't sync or move anymore 😄 if it would be a couple of these i'd ignore

[05-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Oszy#5734
getpeerinfo 0

[05-Nov-19 03:21 PM] Oszy#5734
everything was fine until I imported a list of private keys, then it stopped, and was never able to connect back to the peers.

[05-Nov-19 03:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
I also run into that restart issue after an update... but a reboot always fixes it... and if not, a manual KMD start and sync, a ./stop.sh and the ./start.sh kicks it in.

[05-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Oszy#5734
it's not on my NN btw

[05-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Oszy#5734
just a chain daemon, manual start, suddenly getting refused from all nodes

[05-Nov-19 03:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sorry that was meant towards jorian...

[05-Nov-19 03:39 PM] SHossain#0007
which chain you are trying to sync?

[05-Nov-19 03:39 PM] Oszy#5734
THC

[05-Nov-19 03:40 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have valid peer ip on addnodes?

[05-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Oszy#5734
yes, with same launch command on my windows pc connects

[05-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Oszy#5734
but not on my linux

[05-Nov-19 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
check that there isn't something in the logs about wrong/bad magic

[05-Nov-19 03:44 PM] Oszy#5734
no, just these refused connections straight after loading blocks

[05-Nov-19 03:45 PM] Oszy#5734
also ` No route to host (113)` sometimes

[05-Nov-19 03:47 PM] Oszy#5734
there are 4 other chains working fine on this machine, can't start this one for some reason..

why would it even care about 5 months ago? did you resync?

[06-Nov-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Oszy  I think I know what this is, and I ran into it already, I will fix it when I have time... For now I think LABS does not sync from scratch possibly... changing min sigs to 7 needs to be height activated,

[06-Nov-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a simple "fix" is to change LABSMINSIGS to return numSN/5  rather than 7.

5.9-2, use "setgenerate true 0"

i need to stake with native?

[07-Nov-19 06:26 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I believe so yes, there is a bootstrap so you dont have to download the whole chain
