Like üëÜ What do you think of 'break & make' in latin?  (et conteram facere (?) )

[09-May-19 04:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, looking at it actually like 'libertas ad conteram' much better.

[09-May-19 04:15 AM] Draeth#3300
I gotta find my Latin expert and make sure that's the proper way to write it

[09-May-19 04:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

These are the address'es I have, the ones with 2 posted here did NOT split. This leaves:
@zatJUM @PHBA2061 @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  @CrisF  @gcharang  @gt  @Bar_F1sh_Rel  @CMaurice 
As elegible for prize. If smk762 wins and shares with top 3, this means the rest wil be paid 1000 LABS each for participating.

```Looks like someone broke it :smile:```
Something very bad happening it seems
I have only one sample in oracle:```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclessamples 68c78190c91f45d7dacff72281226a075a9a14f0ea60efd4edda15c6edea947a 8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0 3

while changing vote, my vote  result changing to `'Nabob': 'FIXME oraclessamples bug or registered but did not vote yet',`

[09-May-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did say to him before that I would add a NEW RPC for this vote thing... maybe also its better to use totally new CC contract also. I dont know enough about oracles to really say for sure.

[09-May-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a voting CC seems very useful.. I guess if oracles can be used, then thats good, but I dont like batontxids they are horribly in efficiant to validate.

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
hey guys, said it was rough

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
can filter out any votes that don't match the options no problem

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Would it not be better to enforce a single vote on chain?

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks like oracle is broken in general

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
joker I need your help on that oraclessamples bug

[09-May-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[09-May-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Id rather not touch a CC I dont understand

[09-May-19 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
if you register over and over from same pubkey, oraclessamples won't return anything

[09-May-19 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
hence `'FIXME oraclessamples bug or registered but did not vote yet`

[09-May-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
I have other problem - I had one sample, published one more sample and second overwrited first

[09-May-19 12:18 PM] Nabob#5004
but that is changing whole result to unknown on TUI, may be we can handle this error in py

[09-May-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
Ah that's a bounty claim if you changed your vote and TUI shows new value üòÉ

[09-May-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
I'll check it out

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean Nabob?

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
the oraclessamples bug is not something that can be fixed in TUI

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] Nabob#5004
regarding `'FIXME oraclessamples bug or registered but did not vote yet`

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
I need to quantify the problem and explain it to a CC dev

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need a dev who wrote oracles to fix that, otherwie your just going to waste stupid amounts of hours working out why its the case

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
the results thing will be touched up for sure

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Try to create oracle, register, subscribe once, then send one `oraclesdata`, check oraclessamples, then send another `oraclesdata`, check oraclessamples

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
that was literally the first iteration of it, just wanted to start the poll ASAP

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
it should fail, Tony

[09-May-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
if you're registering via TUI that is

[09-May-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
It assumes that position 0 or -1 (forget which) is the first vote

[09-May-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
`oraclessamples <oracle txid> < baton txid> 0` now returns all values

[09-May-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
that oraclessamples bug existed prior to my changes, still trying to figure out why it happens

[09-May-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Case is:
First I published this text:
``` 'CrisF': '22',
 'Nabob': '22',
 'SHossain': '20',
 'TonyL': 'I want 777 nodes',
 'alright': '22',
 'blackjok3r': '22',
 'computergenie': '22',    ```

[09-May-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Then I published other text: 
``` 'CrisF': '22',
 'Nabob': '20',
 'SHossain': '20',
 'TonyL': 'I want 666 nodes',
 'alright': '22',
 'blackjok3r': '22',
 'computergenie': '22',```

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
So I thought it's a problem in TUI (thought it's displaying not last sample)
