My NN got passed block 46 once before after rm -rf  all but wallet.dat & .conf.
Then died on 1795.
restart has it back stuck on 46.

[04-Jun-19 09:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Other node couldn't get passed 46.

[04-Jun-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will check this out shortly. Hard to know why without checking myself.

[04-Jun-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  Try to sync without mining and see what happens

[04-Jun-19 10:04 AM] CrisF#3405
I been trying from komodo/master so shouldn't be mining.

[04-Jun-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  
CFEKFEK only works on pricescomp branch of LABS/komodo

[04-Jun-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The ac_blocktime for VerusHash11 had to be confirmed to be correct before I merged it down to master or to KMD.

[04-Jun-19 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, ok, I'll run it from there.  Thanks.

[04-Jun-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```block   200: 1559157257
block: 1750: 1559625546

468289 / 1500 = 312s ```
12s off isnt bad, due to integer rounding errors I doubt we will get much closer than this... maybe its time to merge to master.

LABS chain gettinng crashed suddenly, no logs genereated. After i split utxos using TUI script. It works for some time. Suddenely chain got feked. any one experience the same. anyway, if i do restart it works.

[04-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Nabob#5004
Any one have idea how to debug this error....

[04-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
a backtrace or logs prior to it crashing would help

[04-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Alright#0419
should be *something* in stdout or debug.log, even if there is no error, the logs prior to it crashing can give us some idea of when it crashed

[04-Jun-19 06:23 PM] Nabob#5004
There are so many connection refused errors i can see

LABS gets a cpl mentions about testing.   Not too heavy on labs content, but it's a start - @Alright i took some of the bits out of that doc you posted to me, i'll review more for a future update, cos no doubt there'll be updates on this margin trading thing.   @TonyL  i took most of your doc

```
The notary network of the LABS (which is different to the Komodo Notary Network) pays bounties at a maximum of 1008 LABS coin per 10080 blocks (approx 7 days).  The bounties can be for any bug hunting and testing to do with any part of the application – cosmetic or mathematical.   Testing is open access for anyone to participate, payments run through automated funds management and voting.  More information to come in coming weeks.```
Btw actually it became a little bit different now -  by these 1008 LABS will be funded "house" and bug hunting  rewards will be distirbuted usual kmdlabs platform way

[04-Jun-19 06:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Usual way it is when user who found the bug saying: I fond bug A, I want B LABS for it

[04-Jun-19 06:38 PM] TonyL#3577
And then NN voting on does he deserve such a generous reward or not

[04-Jun-19 06:40 PM] TonyL#3577
But this allocation it's like a funding/scholarship from kmdlabs community which I can use additionally (in our case as house funding) :labs: 🔥

@TonyL  @dimxy 
https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/70105f56a7b54befdc9d4bceba856ef57a9615c7
Fixed CFEKBET1 syncing issue. I think it syncs slower, but at least it syncs every time now. 
Problem is that putting the opreturn validate where it was in check transaction, it could try to validate before the previous block was there and would just fail. 
I moved it to connect Tip so that it always has all information. It seems to sync very fast up until about block 1800 then slows right down. Dont know enough about how it works to know why this is the case. It may just be that people palces bets or something.

my NN is down-ish while I sweep my chains with my master wallets

[05-Jun-19 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright said this was the most important thing to fix. It is fixed. Anything else LABS requires?

[05-Jun-19 07:27 AM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r that is, previndex param in komodo_opretvalidate could have been null?

[05-Jun-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... 
couldnot get pricebits 😃 
I alctually fixed this a long time ago ont he very first chain, but the problem was something else there and I ended up just discarding the chaanges. Lucky I remebered how I did it and managed to do it again in only a few hours.

[05-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
oops haha

[05-Jun-19 05:43 PM] jorian#4555
well 1 KMD won't be swept away by the hackers again, i think

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
actually among all addresses that I use for testing, I thought the one I used for LABS is safe and send most my testing KMD there, about 84 KMD were swept as a result 😅

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] jorian#4555
that's 28 hours of easy NN mining

yeah man cant change key until next era.

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we should probably remove you8r key from iguana to be safe tbh. @PHBA2061

[05-Jun-19 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
if you're gonna remove it, why not replace it immediately?

[05-Jun-19 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
or doesn't that have the same effect

[05-Jun-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we cant remove it from komodod but iguana pubkeys are fluid and can chnage, as long as there is min sigs in demon of the ones it sees

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so if the pubkey in iguana change, but the address in komodod does not, my node will still notarize or it won't ?

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if key comprimised, the only way to isolate it is to remove from iguana.

[05-Jun-19 06:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so may be you guys should do it asap ?

[05-Jun-19 07:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem that important atm... is LABS being notarzed lo

[05-Jun-19 07:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is that a question ? yes it is still notarizing normally

[05-Jun-19 07:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181

our radio is working if you want

[06-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Alright#0419
the only thing a bad actor can do with a key is make notarization rounds fail

[06-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
and this can easily be prevented by removing the key from the iguana json on all notaries

[06-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
how many compromised? Just one?
