told me it was impossible @blackjok3r

[28-Oct-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
2 weeks later, "does this sound useful?"

[28-Oct-19 09:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Man it cirtanly wasnt easy,,,

[28-Oct-19 09:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Oct-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
that's reassuring

[28-Oct-19 09:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get it to be possible it needs checks in about 5 places in the code.. .that are totally serperate...

`Does this sound useful for PoS64?`
It sounds perfectly useful for throwing away a year of my life and hardcoding options for noobs that we've developed privately :troll:

[28-Oct-19 09:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was a side effect of what Alright asked me to do... I was looking at it yesteray like wait... this can be a vairable and still work.

[28-Oct-19 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
on a serious note:
I think that the more options there are for folks is the more appealing it will be as a whole

[28-Oct-19 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... I really hope this time its actually good...  I fixed just about every known bug I think... better start syncing some chains to amke sure I didnt break it

[28-Oct-19 09:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`[LABS:119] isPoS but meets PoW diff nBits.537580063 < target.537857807` 
This one was a prick... I think if anyone can break my fix it will be you... I hope we will be able to test it soon

[28-Oct-19 09:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I madew het PoW Target like a switch.... under it is PoS (so PoS blocks with better hashes are invalid)

[28-Oct-19 09:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and PoW blocks over the target with stakign tx in them are invalid

[28-Oct-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
tbh, I haven't tried to break any of it since james split it into different sections
but maybe I should have a go at it

[28-Oct-19 09:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now its pretty broken... I wouldnt lol

[28-Oct-19 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[28-Oct-19 09:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also factored all the hard codede numbers into defines so we can easily try diffrent values and se what happens

350Mbps down / 35Mbps up here
there is a company who provides 1Gbps down/up....but, they don't provide connection to houses only on large apartment buildings. would get them if they would

[28-Oct-19 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if I had 1000/1000 at home, I'd have 0 server bills and be using a bulldozer to move my cash

but i do know a handful of countries that are classed as "shitholes" that had 100mb fiber in 2004 and now they're rocking 1000 up/down for like $10/month
