removed all sleeps... I dont want to push it too far... need to keep an eye on disk space.

[15-Oct-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will do a controlled test to see how fast its going next.

[15-Oct-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but mempool drains fast...

[15-Oct-18 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
üòÇ 
26MB/s uplaod bandwidth

[15-Oct-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I feel increasing minimum block size might actaully help, theres a fair few orphans

[15-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
MB/sec?

[15-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean minute?

[15-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
512kb/sec is fantastic

[15-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
nice video quality can be achieved

[15-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no thats the sender

[15-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It  doenst spend much time sending üòÇ  
only sends when mempool is under 40MB

[15-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
waiting for test to finish 
sent 468.75 MB in OP_RETURN

[15-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to average about 250-300 kb/s confirmed

[15-Oct-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only rough estimate

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so even the confrmed throughput is good enough!

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
any idea what the mempool bandwidth is?

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you can do 26MB/sec of sending it sure seems sending is not any bottleneck at all

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
can be doing 10 broadcasts at once, even 100

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would need to login to another node and see if they are keeping up with each other, the node sending is getting orphans so the other notaries are mining blocks

[15-Oct-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
what if only the sending node is mining?

[15-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The fist node, was just a bad connection .

[15-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that might even increase it .. butI need a new chain to test that, all notaries are set to mine this chain by default

[15-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i think having a dedicated miner is a good improvement as it will eliminate orphans

[15-Oct-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I had to do that on scaletest aswell

[15-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
since you changed it to be low diff all the time, orphans are expected

üëç 

[15-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
what might be better is to make the chain only mineable by a specific pubkey

[15-Oct-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if each streamer is starting a new chain, they just create the whole supply, and mine it...

[15-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a broadcast from that node after all and the p2p network serves as uncensorable broadcasting

[15-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it should end up pretty close to hw/net limits as what can be pushed through

[15-Oct-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so even orphan type of setup is achieving sufficient confirmed bandwidth, it is clearly a definite yes that this can be done

[15-Oct-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can make the ac_pubkey the only miner ... infact this chain already does this.

[15-Oct-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just hardedcoded it into komodod ... it can be set as command line option.

[15-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes a dedicated pubkey miner chain would be useful

[15-Oct-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for this specific purpose it makes sense

[15-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_live=1 could trigger this mode

[15-Oct-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, i think most of the changes can be made into a ac  param .. need to double check that, this branch in aprticular got a big messed up over time with me playing with things

[15-Oct-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I was thinking for an actual coin, this is combined with a pay for launching a chain with the coin, so this payment gets the chain created and the broadcast can start. the main coin lives on, but the livestream chain is just temporary, or at least until the last node goes offline

[15-Oct-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sent 468MB in 27mins whilest never allowing mempool to get over 100MB or under 40MB.

[15-Oct-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like a good idea... this chain got really big really fast

[15-Oct-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and i assume since it was getting into the mempool that it could have been extracted from the mempool at 468/27 speed

[15-Oct-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
200MB to 650MB in half an hour

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
a bit over 256kb, well the orphans didnt help things and probably you could tuned the mempool to get bigger

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
700 MB final size mempool empty.

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so 256kb to 1MB/sec are the practical bandwidths

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
with one stream chain

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
~40MB overhead .. not bad at all

[15-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
do 8 in parallel and you can get realtime 3D visualizations

[15-Oct-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Single miner with enough hash rate would be even faster again.

[15-Oct-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
less overhead

[15-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, I was thinking we can do a 20% airdrop of this coin to KMD holders, and make it mineable (the main coin)

[15-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the the details about how best to spawn chains and how many coins it costs, can be worked out over time

[15-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
very cool outcome!

[15-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make a pull request with the appropriate -ac option(s) and required internal changes. I might tweak it a bit, but try to get it as clean as possible relative to FSM

[15-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
what is a good name ?

[15-Oct-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for the ac options ?

[15-Oct-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or the main chain ?

[15-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
need both, so the support for this is in place

[15-Oct-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
after i see the required changes, maybe I will generalized it or change it about

[15-Oct-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really fussed tbh .. First need to get it working where it can be compatible with komodo.

[15-Oct-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to lose the ability for this mode of operation, so lets get it into  a proposed pull request and I can make it play nice, so dont worry if it is a bit hackish

[15-Oct-18 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No problem I will get that done asap, befor eI forget how I did it .. A fair bit of changes were only for the KV chat and can be discarded ... I ill merge current FSM down to a new branch and por the code over manually then test with just 1 mining node .

[15-Oct-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and i guess a little documentation on how to do this to get the good result

hardest thing I see is gettig the data chunks into marketmaker ...

[15-Oct-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was unable to do it any other way than a hardcoded string

[15-Oct-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
that is trivial if we have code that is already sampling the webcam

[15-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it just makes a binary file

[15-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
fread, convert to hex

[15-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
literally 10 lines of code

[15-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so any webcam streaming that creates a file will be enough

{Reactions}

[15-Oct-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
I can make it so that the exact same file is recreated on all nodes that are "watching"

[15-Oct-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems the best way to do it ... doesnt even need to be a video stream that way ... can use it to quickly transmit any data p2p .

[15-Oct-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with dPoW any copy saved anythere can be verified to be origional sent.

[15-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[15-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess a realtime file streamer

[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
do these webcam displays record to a single file that is just growing?

[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine does

[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if so I can add a parameter to txblaster that is the filename

[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I just use ffmpeg ..

[15-Oct-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how the windows stuff would work

[15-Oct-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need some os independent webcam format

[15-Oct-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but really for now it can be any file that is streamed. so as the file grows it is sent out into the blockchain
