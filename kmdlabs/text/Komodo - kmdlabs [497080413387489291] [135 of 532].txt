Has migrate from `*` to `DUCKS` been disabled in any way?

[28-Nov-18 08:02 AM] CrisF#3405
If not I also had 2 failed migrates at the start in that direction.  Rushing to get things done and assumed it was intentional, moved on and forgot.

[28-Nov-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
DUCKS is a differnt cluster

[28-Nov-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant migrate to it

[28-Nov-18 08:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, that's why.

[28-Nov-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
smk added a change to his TUI script to stop ppl migrating to it., but I guess you guys are using my old one, or some other version

[28-Nov-18 08:04 AM] CrisF#3405
I hadn't seen that error before.
@Bar_F1sh_Rel message jogged my memory.

[28-Nov-18 08:04 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, that was right at the start before the new script was out.

[28-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I need to refresh all my scripts - and is staked repo = notary repo for komodod?

[28-Nov-18 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo comes from StakedChain/komodo

[28-Nov-18 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are both the same, as they just pull that repo and build it

[28-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool - not that then

[28-Nov-18 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to merging in sapling... I hjave a few long days coming up, as we use KMD, we need sapling before the hardfork... I wanted to avoid doign that... but we have no choice now

[28-Nov-18 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will probably make a wholoe new org on git caklled KMDLabs and redo a heap of stuff 😦

[28-Nov-18 08:07 AM] CrisF#3405
That's a big job man!

[28-Nov-18 08:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Worth the effort in the end though.

[28-Nov-18 08:08 AM] CrisF#3405
No real rush, right?

[28-Nov-18 08:08 AM] CrisF#3405
(don't kill yourself with lack of sleep over this I mean😃 )

[28-Nov-18 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar ive had a few good days of rest... .and have lots of new stuff to help speed things up... no longer working off 15" laptop lol

[28-Nov-18 08:10 AM] CrisF#3405
haha, big improvement.

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll start on my big job when this reboot is finished.

[28-Nov-18 08:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Will be more than a few days in my case, due to speed issues, haha.

[28-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  Please update all staking/minign nodes to latest master

[28-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and plese ping me if anything locks up again

[28-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently testing something.. please dont update anything at the moment ... I realised the check that makes notarisations top priorty is horribly inneficiant... figured out fix to amke it a lot faster. just need to get ti working lol.

👌 

[28-Nov-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL not only was it slowing thigs down, it aso wasn't working at minsigs =5

[28-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to increase min sigs

[28-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[28-Nov-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Something still isnt right here

[28-Nov-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181

However the dpow notarisation detection never kciked in here

[28-Nov-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is definatly only 1 notarisaion in this block, so both of them should have detected and activated here...

[28-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait ..

[28-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe they are out of order

[28-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  can you point me to where your notarisations code rejects notarisaions that were picked up out of order and rejects them?
I would like to add this to libscotts code aswell, so that its 100% that both notarisation DB are the same, as the MoM depth is taken from dPoW but the MoMoM hash is in libscotts DB, and I am sure that with a mismatch there can be a chance of a faliure.

[28-Nov-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
while small, it is happening, as we are getting fails on migtrates again. under perect conditions they work great, but start getting in consistent block times and its plays up.

[28-Nov-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
void komodo_notarized_update(struct komodo_state *sp,int32_t nHeight,int32_t notarized_height,uint256 notarized_hash,uint256 notarized_desttxid,uint256 MoM,int32_t MoMdepth)
{
    struct notarized_checkpoint *np;
    if ( notarized_height >= nHeight )
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"komodo_notarized_update REJECT notarized_height %d > %d nHeight\n",notarized_height,nHeight);
        return;
    }

[28-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks 😄

[28-Nov-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait im not sure that is it 😦

[28-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured out a way to do it... But I dont think its optimal (neither is it a permenant fix for all chains)

[28-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Instead of adding the notarisations inside ConnectBlock in main.cpp for staked chains,
I can just add every chain that is not a staked chain there. 
and then move the call to that function to inside `komodo.h`, specifically where the notarisation is already validdated by dPoW

[28-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This means that notrisations that are valid by dPoW are added to libscotts DB

[28-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however that block is skipped by his DB if, the notarisation inside it is invalid... need to sleep on this,a s there is likely a better solution

[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure why he didnt just do this in the first place

[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe compile issues ... although I solved those and can add anything I liek to komodo*.h files

[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Needed a `#ifdef` and make file flag  to exclude things from`bitcoin-cli.o`

[28-Nov-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Had another look at this before sleeping ... the way his function works is a bit silly ... and scans everythig in a block... while for the target this is probably fine, in the source its not right... So i will create another function that takes the validated notarisation as a whole tx, and just adds it to the DB.
This should make it so that the dPoW database matches exactly with the MoMoM data base ... and then maybe even the sledgehammer code fix cna be reveresed, and every MoMoM willl then be in order.

[28-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The fact that this was working at all is astounding .. and likely only did so, because every notarisation is added to his DB valid or not, and it had multiple copies of the same MoMoM's

[28-Nov-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What I dont understand is how a valid notarisaion with min sigs5 is not a valid notarisaion by the dPoW code

[28-Nov-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basically need to totally change how the whole thing works ... This might be a fucking mission

[28-Nov-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😦

[28-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if it is mostly working now, be careful before making wholesale changes

[29-Nov-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I contacted libscott, mostly working is not working though

[29-Nov-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Before I do anything drastic I will do some more tests, just getting really annoyed doing the same things over and over and have something test working then break with no code changes

[29-Nov-18 01:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it only a single reported failure atm?

[29-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, but one is too many

[29-Nov-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
unrecoverable migrate failure is completely unacceptable

[29-Nov-18 01:42 AM] Alright#0419
imagine sending KMD and it having some (small)chance of being burned instead

[29-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
Think we know why

[29-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
or well joker has a theory at least

[29-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
need some people to update in a bit

[29-Nov-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code is pushed... just testing it

[29-Nov-18 01:43 AM] CrisF#3405
I also think it's too many. Real $ are $$

[29-Nov-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully this is all it is

[29-Nov-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
redoing the notariations DB is kind of crazy ... but if we have to do that, we have to do it

[29-Nov-18 01:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Wondering if any other reports.

[29-Nov-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bar fish has 2 both on LF

[29-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after this change I will get some huge loops happening

[29-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with proper logs

[29-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its possible that his setup has some corruption issue

[29-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but ulikely

[29-Nov-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have the raw hexes ... to check on other nodes.. but never go there yesteray as a-team broke totally after sapling update somehow and I am only now able to get it running again

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However having the notarisations DBs not matching has other issues .. even if migrates are working.

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
can you send me anything you have for them

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
soon

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
nothing look weird about the actual txs?

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing a bunch fo things at once

[29-Nov-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent looked yet

[29-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
while fixing something else ... I noticed that there are notarisations that are not out of order that are being skipped by dPoW but added by MoMoM

[29-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is mostllikely where the issue lies at a very low level

[29-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it can still mostly work with this condition, as it means there is just multiple copies of the same data

[29-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but before, it couldnt find the right ones ... with sledgehammer it *should* always find the MoMoM

[29-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless its been sent by iguana on every node... and then orphaned by the netowrk.

[29-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which I have never seen happen anywayer at all

[29-Nov-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but is possible

This is what I mean

[29-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats 4 notarisations in a row, that are not recognised by jl's dPoW code on LF

[29-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but are added to the MoMoM DB .

[29-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully this i just a minsigs issue .. as the `<<<<<< notarised` isnt even happening here...

[29-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and all thats checking is, the exact same thing as libscotts and that is there are 5 sigs of valid notries.

[29-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is its looking for 6 some random % of the time.

[29-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so increaseing to 6 might fix it.

[29-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other option is to let jls code check the notarisation, and ONLY add theTX to the MoMoM DB IF his code has already validated it.

[29-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF all my miners and stakers seems fixed since the update.

[29-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If yours are also OK ...  we have a mandatory update ready.

[29-Nov-18 07:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll check in an hour or so.

[29-Nov-18 07:29 AM] gcharang#6833
Do we need to update?

[29-Nov-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can update now, but you wont notarise until 5 others have... Its better to get people updateed though
