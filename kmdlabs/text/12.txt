Your node is the only one not on `staked` branch of SuperNET

[10-Oct-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please check what iguana is saying and run your stats script

[10-Oct-18 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think we have `last noarisation` in outr stats script, really needs to be there, it helps with debuging them a LOT.

[10-Oct-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically your looking for errors flooding in iguana stdout .... or iguana staight not notarising.

what do I need to tail for iguana?

[10-Oct-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you have stdout in tmux or a screen?

[10-Oct-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just watch it for a little bit, if its working/errors

[10-Oct-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my nodes seem ok after update which was a hardfork

[10-Oct-18 09:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nothing up at the moment, connection reset so lost screen

[10-Oct-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so technically your node should not be working at all

[10-Oct-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries...

[10-Oct-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1) cd ~/SuperNET 
2) git pull
3) git checkout staked
4) cd ~/StakedNotary; git pull
5) ./build_iguana
6) pkill -15 iguana
7) start.sh

[10-Oct-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181

seems ok, there... without iguana stdout you cant really get any useful info, so just update

[10-Oct-18 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, will do, back in 5

how does iguana start in start.sh or however it's done with staked notaries?

[10-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Mylo#8306
found it

[10-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Mylo#8306
start_iguana

[10-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it starts automatically

[10-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from start.sh

[10-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but to manually rebuild, you can just call build_iguana

[10-Oct-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then start_iguana

[10-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, but i wanted to find where to comment out so i could have a log file üòÉ  `  iguana/iguana staked.json & #> iguana.log 2> error.log &`

[10-Oct-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use tmux ?

[10-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm old school and like a paper-trail

[10-Oct-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can have a log if you like at lieast it prints less usless information

[10-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Mylo#8306
i wonder if with log i can `tail -f` in multiple tmux with a different grep pattern ü§î

[10-Oct-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
of course you can

[10-Oct-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been thinkign about that... instead of pipeing most things to /dev/null to pipe to a log then use tail-f in tmux to read everything.

[10-Oct-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
st first I didnt care about it, just wanted it to be noob freindly, but as its gone on, you kind of need some debug prints.

[10-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the printouts that are annoying to non-devs are critical for devs to troubleshoot/isolate/debug and fix problems

the block height prints are just useless.

[10-Oct-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I left most of the rest in, as they are needed to see if your node its working

[10-Oct-18 11:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll have to test drive tmux this weekend, connection reliability here sucks.

that makes it a lot easier to use

[10-Oct-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resize panes with mouse etc.

[10-Oct-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but to copy paste text you need to do ctrl + a/b  z on a pane, and then crtl+a/b m to didable mouse

took me so long to work that out

ah cool.   with some guidance, these utilities can be GUI-ized.   look forward to it üòõ

we thaught of a few ways around that ... but they are all a bit convoluted.

only need workable guis, nothing production.  not in quick community sprints

[10-Oct-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
decided to focuse on channels CC testing and oracles instead as they seem more useful ... even though a dice is the darmn coolest one we have so far ...

oh ok cool, i new there was an oracle/gateway/now-channels in progress and wondered if dice was just forgotten.

[10-Oct-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one chain can be fast over run with dice... if you gamble very irresposibly

[10-Oct-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but load balancing it over multiple chains in a cluster worked well

do you know how many oracles a chain can have?

not sure ... Alright tested one only, but im am yet to continue on his work, been too busy on toher things

[10-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant see why you cant just make heaps of them

[10-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dice I think is the only one that seems to lock up under load as its workin in real time

[10-Oct-18 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't the purpose of dice to test the RNG?

cheers @Mylo , I got a handful of VPS to play on at the moment. One has stakednotary + scaling metrics vis, and has a bit of grunt. The other two are weaker for testing stuff, one for KMD and the other for GIS. The KMD one has the Staked Pool (which I'll update now), though ther was talk of moving the pool to Hetzner. All mine are on Bultr.

I think if you guys want to make something wth dice... you should just make it ... IMO its the coolest CC that people will use ...

[10-Oct-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if just test chain on staked cluster, it doesnt really matter people cannot withdraw.

[10-Oct-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could always make it on TROLL ...

If its possible to faucetize dice without mad C++ skillz, it'd be a cool free to play demo.

not sure can you think of one ... for TROLL I wanted to make supply static, so when ever TX fees are use they reappear in the faucet
