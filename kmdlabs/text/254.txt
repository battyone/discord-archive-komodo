```c

        FlushBlockFile(!fKnown);
        fprintf(stderr, "nFile = %i size.%li\n",nFile,tmpBlockFiles.size());

sounds awesome about delay.  ❤ the code 😃

[28-Jan-19 11:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blocks nVersion is an int32 ... 
So we can flag blocks above nversion 7,000,000 with the verison = 7M + vout location of notarisation in the block.

[29-Jan-19 02:07 AM] ca333#0118
i like the idea of re-utilizing the nVersion field as a sort of "onchain notarization-pointer"!

[29-Jan-19 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I got it to kind of work. At leat I think its possible

`VALID NOTARISATION connect block.40004 tx.1`

[29-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At the very last step of conenct block ... if the `nVersion-7M != tx`  then the block can be invalid.

[29-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the commission just needs to check the one tx flagged by nVersion

[29-Jan-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the actual notaristion is invalid... Then it can be rejected later

[29-Jan-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should allow block validation to contain a coinbase based on the notarisation tx without having to check if the notarisraion is valid before the data is calcualted

[29-Jan-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lots more work to do, but I think creating the block is the easy part. Code to check comission of block should be the same as what creates it.

[29-Jan-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the tx used to calculate the comission (notary payout) matches the valid notarisation, then it seems fine..

[29-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This one is going to be hard to test... Need to make invalid notarisations lol

I just read @Alright's statement. 

I don't understand the full scope, but my initial impression is that this is very intriguing!

[29-Jan-19 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One of these days, one of us needs to write a script that looks at each notarization and looks back at each user's percentage of notarization of available opportunity to notarize, because the numbers (especially %) in stats reset on a wallet reset

[29-Jan-19 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
beyond that, it looks good to me @CHMEX

[29-Jan-19 05:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
Thanks

[29-Jan-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
not a good idea to be using blockversion

[29-Jan-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of code relies on specific block version and will reject non-standard ones

[29-Jan-19 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks to be just > 4 ?

[29-Jan-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
put any such data in the coinbase vin (past block height)

[29-Jan-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
explorers, SPV servers, wallets, who knows what else might be using blockversion field.

[29-Jan-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
test scripts, there is no way to know

[29-Jan-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
block version should be for changes in block serialization format

[29-Jan-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think mike said he used this to determine which was a verus PoS block or not... will have to see how he did that

[29-Jan-19 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is that the notarisation is determined as valid or not as the very last thing that happens on connect block...

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, he changed the block format, so the block version was changed

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where as we need that data to calculate the coinbase

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we need someway of doing that...

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing is depending on the data at the end of vin0 scriptSig

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
or opreturn

[29-Jan-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
dont use blockversion

[29-Jan-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where it can then be valid or invald upon notarisation and discarded if invalid.

[29-Jan-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand. the block needs to be valid but maybe invalid, even though it is a valid block?

[29-Jan-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... it is maybe valid, as long as the notarisation is all notary vins meeting minsigs....

[29-Jan-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but notarization happens later...

[29-Jan-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if the actual notariation is invalid (wrong block hash etc) then it needs to be rejected

[29-Jan-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
there is deadlock

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to do it any other way I would need to know if a notarisation was valid befroe it was valid

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization cant determine the notarized block until some confirmations

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you are saying no confirmations until notarized

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
wont work

[29-Jan-19 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the coinbase is paid in the block the notarisation is included in

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im rpetty sure it will work

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if you could tell a block will be notarized before it is notarized, there is no need to notarize

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the same as AC_PERC but based on who made the tx rather than the toal of all txns

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it can be for a past block

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[29-Jan-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and you assume only one notarization per block

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
then that is your validation

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am counting any notarisation that is matched and notarised

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am ignoring the check if it happens out of order

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure only one notarization tx per block and that it is valid

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and yes it can only pay once per block

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
why mess with blockformat?

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
just use those constraints directly

[29-Jan-19 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was just an idea to get the data where it needs to be...

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is a new notarization, valid and the only one in a block, with a single payout, it is valid

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
else invalid

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can put it somewhere else... but I want it to be fast... dont want to be going GetTransaction all over the place in block validation

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
blockvalidation already does GetTransaction all over the place

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly ... need to uise whats already there

[29-Jan-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
make context verify set number of notarizations, valid notarization, etc.

[29-Jan-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
its already in RAM, iterating through again for a specific pattern match will be a few milliseconds

[29-Jan-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still makes little sense to call the entire code (code that I dnt really understand) twice... and who knows if it valid earlier than ConnectBlock....

[29-Jan-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I got working earlier should work fine... just need the notarisation flagged somwhere.

[29-Jan-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but dont use block version

[29-Jan-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We aready havbe code in the miner that sets a notarisation as max prioroty so it can easily skip any notarisations after it adds 1. Then it flags where this notarisation is (could even force it to be tx.1, which would solve many issues.)

[29-Jan-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then the consensus code can validate that the miner logic was used

[29-Jan-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[29-Jan-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to search if it is constrained

[29-Jan-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
similar to how CC works

[29-Jan-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was the plan... as a back up if the noarisation is invalid then the block can be rejected.

[29-Jan-19 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but not "invalid" as in out of order, as I dont see that really possible to enforce

[29-Jan-19 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as `notarized =1` and `matched =1`

[29-Jan-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the tricky part is chaging how ERA's activate to use something liek the sapling code... so that its accurate enough to determine coinabases.

[29-Jan-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it all boils down to a single fuinction I dont see this being super difficult

[29-Jan-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
why cant an increasing height order of notarization be enforced?

[29-Jan-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess it could... but it would need to be decoded in the miner and checked... and I am not sure how to do that

[29-Jan-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
height > NOTARIZED_HEIGHT

[29-Jan-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
getinfo displays the notarized height

[29-Jan-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[29-Jan-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so it has code that gets the current notarized height

[29-Jan-19 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think getting the current height is the problem... its the notariation itself...

[29-Jan-19 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would need to decode it

[29-Jan-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by dooing that also, it makes the code for MoMoM that scans 100 blocks for MoMoM hash no longer requiored

[29-Jan-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as all notarisation are now in order with max 1 every block

[29-Jan-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
height is the first 4 bytes

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Jan-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
just verify height is > NOTARIZED_HEIGHT

[29-Jan-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then if anything else is wrong block validation will reject it

[29-Jan-19 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is also working,,, on validation side... 
The inly thing I am concerned with is, that if you make a notarisation invlaid in a block then a MoMoM hash will be missing... So I dont think enforcing the height is a great idea...
