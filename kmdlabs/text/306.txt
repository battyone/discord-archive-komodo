@cipi probably is interested too

[21-Feb-19 01:11 PM] 0x03#8822
first dumb idea: iguana doesn't know how to talk socks by itself, does it?

[21-Feb-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no. its uses nanomsg like barterdex

[21-Feb-19 01:13 PM] 0x03#8822
i think you're trying to do something similar than i am doing here, setting up a raspi to route all tor traffic... at least my whole project would be the whole basics to yours 😄

[21-Feb-19 01:13 PM] 0x03#8822
only that you're routing select traffic

[21-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hah, we only need iguana traffic, and there is no way for her to listen on tor, as it binds to OS level TCP socket for each connection.

[21-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tricked that, via iptables to rout out though tor, but seems packet loss is close to 100% or 100% not really sure how to check these things though.

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] 0x03#8822
yea sadly theres no ICMP 😐

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] 0x03#8822
or... UDP

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`...increasing hops to random times,...The theory was to even out ndoes distances apart.`
why in the fek would you want to *intentionally* slow down the network? I might be lost, but that notion seems the most anti-P2P idea you could come up with. 😕

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"random ping times" is the most importnat thing here

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
slowing it down, is fine as long as it still works.

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] 0x03#8822
yea genie may be right in asking wether tor is the right path at all

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wasnt my idea....

[21-Feb-19 01:15 PM] 0x03#8822
albeit asking very differently 😛

[21-Feb-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seemd to be easy enough to test it, so I did it.

[21-Feb-19 01:16 PM] 0x03#8822
noooo judgement

i'm playing a lot with tor anyways

[21-Feb-19 01:16 PM] 0x03#8822
so.... yay, more ideas

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] 0x03#8822
newest developments in local 'police conferences' kind of seem to make a proper tor knowledge mandatory soon around here

{Reactions}
😮 

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would have been quite lucky if it worked... I didnt realyl expect it to. early results were ok but it was a catastropic faliure really.

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`slowing it down, is fine as long as it still works.`
So, I get punished for optimizations and people that don't do them get rewarded 🙄

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] 0x03#8822
well what you're trying to do is to have equal opportunities for all notaries

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] 0x03#8822
to try and phrase it like an idiot

[21-Feb-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[21-Feb-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`well what you're trying to do is to have equal opportunities for all notaries`
equal opportunity and forced equal outcomes are not the same thing

[21-Feb-19 01:18 PM] 0x03#8822
..... just a random thought. if iguana knew socks and a notary became a very limited entry node (minimal bandwidth obviously), that would maybe MAKE sense

[21-Feb-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not about optimizations.... if genie has something that can get 3x the counts of everyone else, then he should be sharingh it just like I did with main net. IMO... the only optmisation left was either trying to flood the network with 10x the packets (which i think works) or colluding with others to palce nodes very close together.

[21-Feb-19 01:19 PM] 0x03#8822
haha... why not have a notary-only tor ...ok i'll show myself out

[21-Feb-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if genie has something that can get 3x the counts of everyone else, then he should be sharingh it just like I did with main net. `
It's called: 'active monitoring and utilization of the tools you and alright wrote for us'

[21-Feb-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I do that on mine and i am dead last... Look at my mainnet one.,.. its using half the optimizations as this node and the same server same lcoation same size VM ....

[21-Feb-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, take tor back out, I'll set up a node in Sydney and we can judge if it's location or something else

[21-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe your personal server just sucks 🐐 🍆 ?

[21-Feb-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can put your node on my server if you like 😛

[21-Feb-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my server is old... I dont deny it... but its been top in SH a few times.... Dont think hardward plays a large aprt myself, as long as you use all the optimizations properly, faster hardware means you can be lazy thats a bout it.

[21-Feb-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its all about response time.... network is the slowest peic of the puzzle. By making ping times random lengths, you even it up... having soteware optimizations, will still mean your better than someone not using them properly.

[21-Feb-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can assure you that 1 single cable or physical RJ socket that has an issue can create notable decline in speed, and it could be something just that simple

[21-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I donty think so, as my mainnet ntoary has been preforming the best it has ever done in the last 2 weeks

[21-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same hardware

[21-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same size VM

[21-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
although its on a diffrent RAID array 🤔

[21-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
RAID itself adds delay

[21-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i was told to use 1...

[21-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as it had faster reads

[21-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whoich is all that matters

[21-Feb-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless you literally only have RAID on 1 disk, it will never make reads faster; it can't (unless there's some new advancement in RAID that I don't know of)

[21-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... maybe its just the amount it can read at ocne that is more... not sure... I was told to use RAID1

[21-Feb-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I did... if I dont need to... then I have 2x the space next year

[21-Feb-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no system that I have ever seen or heard of adds redundancy **and** decreases latency

[21-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well tor is a dead end anyway. Lets revert that shit and increase min sigs to 6, and i'll see if I can optimized this thing even further.

[21-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😃

[21-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know I can definatly do it better than I was, but didnt expect to be that far down.....

[21-Feb-19 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meanwhile, I'll set up a server in Sydney and see if there's a notable difference between that and the current Dallas location

[21-Feb-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
assuming webs server was in the same place, just you moving from there will make a noticable diffrence to everyone.

[21-Feb-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Sorry but tor was a failed excersise. To remove the iptables rule use the followng command. 
`sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9997 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9050`
Then restart. There should be updates to iguana and komodod that disable the patches required to make it work, and also increase minsigs to 6.

{Reactions}
😉 

[21-Feb-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also dont foget to `sudo apt-get remove tor`

[21-Feb-19 01:46 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
In old hack theory - based loosely on spinning platters - raid 1 showed an improvement in reads due to being able to cycle through the pre-fetch buffers on each copy disk. This is now all but redundant on ssd and especially nvme.

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-Feb-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in that case I think I will drop the RAID on my 512GB SSDs... and move my nodes to those lol

[21-Feb-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have 2 512Gb and 2 1TB drives there being wasted... who cares abnotu data redundancy with blockchains, you can jsut resync. 😂

@blackjok3r how can i merge 2 different branch from 2 different repos locally?

[21-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can add the `"branch": "notarypay_new"` to assetchains.json

[21-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for example... LABS only has master atm though

[21-Feb-19 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
what i want is cloning https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/tree/rogue_nocurses
and merge update from jl777's FSM branch

this is not LABS  related though

[21-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not sure exactly, but cant you just do git clone -b <branch>

[21-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stright on top of it.

[21-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it will just merge it in ?

[21-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like: 
`git clone URL -b branch`

[21-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should merge it directly on top of it, but hopefully there are no conflicts

[21-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then its much ahrder

[21-Feb-19 01:58 PM] SHossain#0007
i tried web version and couldn't get that working

[21-Feb-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sometimes thats not great ive found it to do thing sbackwards at times, due to conflicts....

[21-Feb-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like git website is down atm, and I have to do the same thing 😄 thanks @webworker01

[21-Feb-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

hahaa that looks liek ti would work... but it unenforcable. It just is how it is and we need to deal with it. 😄

[21-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Mylo#8306
VPN address?

[21-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Mylo#8306
Adds a whole bunch of overhead

[21-Feb-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think same as mainnet, it will be down to perfecting the tools I supplied in nthe correct rotations to make wallet/iguana as fast a possible. Likel what genie has probably already done.

[21-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can even imporve a-team from where it is.

[21-Feb-19 02:17 PM] Mylo#8306

[21-Feb-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
do believe joker talked about blacklisting chains

[21-Feb-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
ie you can only transfer coins off of it

[21-Feb-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
in general, anything you can coherently describe precisely can be implemented

[21-Feb-19 02:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I was thinking to keep value on one chain, transfer into "fun tokens" to be used in the closed chain
