[04-Aug-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes we should be on latest supernet commit. Also make sure komodo is up to date. Start.sh should handle it, at least it did on my node. Bit if a clusterfuck sorry, but notas are working so everything is OK. Getting the delay right may take a few iterations. I hope you don't all freek out over a few dollars worth of labs, its worth it to get the notary nodes working correctly.

[04-Aug-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say doing a wallet reset with the utxo cache is very dangerous and is probably expected to crash tbh.

[04-Aug-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@phm87

[04-Aug-19 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really font have any time to spend on this for at least another 24h. For the time being please just make sure all nodes are up to date, and anyone that can please DM any ops we don't know about, if they don't respond we will need to change port.

[04-Aug-19 04:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is it the `cleanwallettransactions` which doesnt play nice with utxocache? I also noticed a crash

[04-Aug-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It may do.... iok i'll push a fix for this now.

https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/2103b55efadfc77a9b71dc89f4a44066cf47f2cb
This *should* work. After using sendtoaddress it will reset the cache. Still quite limited fix, but it should at least prevent sendtoaddress crashing the daemon, or making iguana use spent utxos. 
Again with cache wallet reset and merge of mined funds isnt really required untl you have vast numbers of utxos.,

My node may have something wrong with it, I will try to sort it out tomorrow. Ther may need to be some changes to how you guys run things with this new method so that we know everything is equal.

wow IDK wtf is happening to my node after those pulls but I had to chmod the src folder manually after, then chmod the .ccache manually... werent issues before not sure what made that an issue.

[04-Aug-19 11:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
then it finally built

[04-Aug-19 11:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
restarting NN now

[04-Aug-19 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems to be up

[04-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Had to ./start.sh twice - but otherwise no issues.

[04-Aug-19 01:32 PM] CMaurice#1685
it was only an iguana rebuild i think

[04-Aug-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I dont think he updated to the first delay and utxo cache version. We may need to deploy another entire network with just a hand full of us to make sure the right code is being run. One thing I have learnt so far is that any node who is not running it, will get mroe notarizations.. Its not working as I expected it to work 游땭

[04-Aug-19 01:36 PM] CMaurice#1685
uh, wonder if I updated but skipped the komodo by not doing it manually

[04-Aug-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to have a think about it. Maybe we should focus on utxo cache being stable as thats an extremly good qualiy of life improvement for all nodes, makes them much easier to manage.

[04-Aug-19 01:36 PM] CMaurice#1685
_goes to check_

[04-Aug-19 01:36 PM] CMaurice#1685
nope

[04-Aug-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can check what version you have by looking at the iguana TV and seeing the print that tells you which utxo its using. should alwasy show 0 of 1.

[04-Aug-19 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
For the update ./stop.sh and ./start.sh is enough?

[04-Aug-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, as far as I know its all working as expected still.

[04-Aug-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah that branch doesnt have it.. maybe it should be removed.... So we ONLY notarize LABS for a little bit.. Once this test is either over, or we make a new controlled network to test with we can add a new CFEK cluster to try and blast crosschain tx.

[04-Aug-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would like to get the MoMoM stuff working with nSPV though... so you dont need a KMD full node to do crosschain

[04-Aug-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I remeber it was all working ok, but its missing some validation so you can easily cheat, and little bit of a mission to fix.

[04-Aug-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so, shut down the cfek miners?

[04-Aug-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can really yes. Should try to isolate things... If we can get 1 chain notarizing close to evenly  it should be fine for the rest.

[04-Aug-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant see much of a reason to keep those chains with ridiiculous block rewwards running.

ok, still working on OOT for main NN, but as soon as I get that back up I'll load up the pool server and kill those 2 nodes

[04-Aug-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah i'll pull it out from assetchains.json... It may be a good way to detect who has updated, track who is still sending packets for the removed chains 游뱂

[04-Aug-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Changeing port on LABS could be dangerous.. It may stop it working for a while.

updating my node now.. Added a print for CFEK chains that tells everyone when a node sends a CFEK packet... but I have a feeling it will spame litterally millions of them. So will test first.

[04-Aug-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_lets you keep that print all to yourself :troll:_

[04-Aug-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not fool proof... as someone can run the old version and just not notarize CFEK... but there seems to be OPs that are MIA, this wil help detect that at least.

[04-Aug-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... if it spams to everyone then they will get very mad at ppl who didnt update :troll:

2 is just too low... somehow that must be a variable and start at a high number and increment down over time until it reaches the same number on all nodes.

[04-Aug-19 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that determines how many nodes need the same recvmask before bestmask is calculated... Currently it is half the nodes. This seems reasonable, but most of the time 80% + of nodes are actually working.... I think after one block passes on KMD if 80% of nodes cannot agree it drops back to 50%

[04-Aug-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ONly issue I see is that if a bunch of nodes see the KMD block at a diffrent time, they all cannot agree at all for a while
