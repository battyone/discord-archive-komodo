[06-May-19 12:20 AM] CrisF#3405
same.input all fields

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
what are you inputting?

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
for name

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
too long?

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
```When is the best time period to launch LABS, with regard to KMD?```

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
there is _VOTET appended to it atm, so has to be relatively short

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
will try shorter

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
name field is short

[06-May-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
question field can be as long as you need

[06-May-19 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
so like name `launch date`, question `When is the best time period to launch LABS, with regard to KMD?`

[06-May-19 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
I'll put an error check for length

[06-May-19 12:23 AM] CrisF#3405
yeah name too long

[06-May-19 12:23 AM] CrisF#3405
now consolidatein utxos

[06-May-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
I'm more worried about debugging the actual voting than creating polls atm

[06-May-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
just want voting working so we can open the 20vs22 poll

[06-May-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
and have it run for a week

[06-May-19 12:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, just trying different polls, not counting on results

[06-May-19 12:25 AM] Alright#0419
please do create a poll though

[06-May-19 12:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, am trying a few.

[06-May-19 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
I know the consolidate thing is annoying, but it'll take me a bit of time to fix it

[06-May-19 12:26 AM] CrisF#3405
try to make them a bit interesting to get more input

[06-May-19 12:26 AM] CrisF#3405
np

[06-May-19 12:26 AM] Alright#0419

[06-May-19 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
using it to debug tallies

[06-May-19 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
just found a bug in oracles I have to work around for now üò´

[06-May-19 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
if you register too many times, it just breaks oraclessamples entirely

[06-May-19 12:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, you got that up fast.

[06-May-19 12:32 AM] CrisF#3405
How is that?
I'm still consolidating utxos

[06-May-19 12:39 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright How are you able to create polls so fast?  I'm still getting consolidate utxo

[06-May-19 12:42 AM] Alright#0419
don't worry about that for now, I just need a poll that multiple people have voted on so I can finish this results func

[06-May-19 12:42 AM] Alright#0419
I'll fix that thing afterwards, seems it will be a bigger problem than I thought

[06-May-19 12:42 AM] Alright#0419
just vote on the when launch poll

[06-May-19 12:43 AM] CrisF#3405

yea I'll make it prettier

[06-May-19 01:31 AM] CrisF#3405
very cool

[06-May-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF fixed the oraclescreate thing

[06-May-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
had to change the format of oraclescreate description, so it's not going to show the old polls

[06-May-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
do you know there is a second "CrisF" account here btw? @CrisF

[06-May-19 02:05 AM] CrisF#3405

haha, np

[06-May-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419

[06-May-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
what I just did is a pretty bad hack

[06-May-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
it puts the pubkey it's signing from in the signed message itself then checks against that

[06-May-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
if we didn't have a static list of NN pubkeys, that would be a very bad problem
