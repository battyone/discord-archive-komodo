[11-Nov-19 04:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
the fee is simply a mechanism to provide the checks

[11-Nov-19 04:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
and pay for the NN and daemons to push their TXes nothing more

[11-Nov-19 04:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
the idea is... i own a company

[11-Nov-19 04:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have 2 dozen facilities world wide

[11-Nov-19 04:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
Pit 2 nodes in each

[11-Nov-19 04:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
create a NN network and launch chains to send data entry for supply chain and retail sales data

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
This creates a live replicated network... a consensus mechanism across all locations and a live data feed for new inputs without needing other databases... just UIs and reporting.

[11-Nov-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if it's solely "in-house" then why would you even want/need notarization?

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
sanity

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
garbage in garbage out

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
a notary says a few mins ago... dozens of nodes came to consensus and you can work off this data with 100% confidence

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
Supply chain doesnt have this right now

[11-Nov-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
at least not in as real time as KMD can

[11-Nov-19 04:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
DB replication is a crap shoot

[11-Nov-19 04:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
and prone to latency and issues... and cost a FORTUNE

[11-Nov-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`dozens of nodes came to consensus`
and what's the incentive for "dozens of nodes" to even care about it?

[11-Nov-19 04:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
there isnt... except.... i own them and configured them to

[11-Nov-19 04:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
serves dual purpose

[11-Nov-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
the onsite nodes create the input and output points for daily operations

[11-Nov-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
and the NN portion keep them all in live consensus

[11-Nov-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so, other than the cost of $100 every 10 years, what would be your technical objection to empty blocks?

[11-Nov-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
space

[11-Nov-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
and i/o

[11-Nov-19 04:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
any empty block is worthless inthis deployment

[11-Nov-19 04:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
it brngs no value to mine a block and not move data

[11-Nov-19 04:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
as the owner footing the bill

[11-Nov-19 04:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
to use this tech as an ERP

[11-Nov-19 04:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
an empty block is a paid i/o consumption with no output

[11-Nov-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so, in that deployment, why not use 0 fees and 0 block reward? then there would be 0 incentive for any external miner to ever pick up the chain

[11-Nov-19 04:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
unless a reasonable use case could be made for it

[11-Nov-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
the fee is the easiest way i could think of using existing code to create a check that a block should be allowed to mint

[11-Nov-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
if there is no tx in mempool... then there wouldnt be a fee...

[11-Nov-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
and if one enters without a fee... its garbage

[11-Nov-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the tx would carry your data, when you put it in the pool
so it would be in the pool to create need

[11-Nov-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
your nodes own 100% of the supply so it's not like there's anyone else getting any or creating any

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
correct... but just like you put it... t doesnt matter what we do... some ahole is going to try and fuck with it

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
so whitelist nodes

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
whitelist addresses

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
I would only allow the nodes access over the secured VPN subnets  between the facilities

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
100% PoS when you own 100% of the supply = 0% of txes and blocks that isn't yours

[11-Nov-19 04:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
no need to allow public internet

[11-Nov-19 04:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
that is a super valid point

[11-Nov-19 04:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
how did the 100% PoS test go... i dont recall...

[11-Nov-19 04:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill brb

[11-Nov-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
now, if 100% PoS can exist with on-demand, I don't know...

[11-Nov-19 08:11 PM] daemonfox#6136

@SHossain  
I know why listunpsent says fail... I wanted a way to filter listunspent, because my node returns over 80,000 utxos and it take 5mins to do a splitfund 游땍 
Seems it causes issues, so will revert.

[12-Nov-19 02:28 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks

[12-Nov-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have deleted the many_iguana branch of StakedNotary
You guys should be on master branch, 99% of reported issues here last few weeks seem to be caused by using old scripts

[12-Nov-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some is my fault, there are too many branches, havent had any time to clean them up yet.. Getting to it slowly.

yeah, I got tired of mining COMMOD just to prove a point

Kevin will be displeased.

sucks to be him, I guess

[12-Nov-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
So... why wont CFEKMYLO notarize? its had 16 blocks found since yesterday

[12-Nov-19 01:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh... looks like it dd get one sometime recently...

[12-Nov-19 01:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
or not lol... blocks on the pool credited... without a notarizaton?

[12-Nov-19 01:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
trying to find the block and who... but the stats scropt doesnt work on assets

[12-Nov-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
OH! 111046 WAS a notarized block??? Thats what it was stuck at all night until I mined a few this morning.

[12-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Oszy#5734
I had 1 nota on MYLO 14 hours ago after not having any for a day

[12-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
OK... the block finder of that notarized block WAS NOT one of the NN that was in the block...

[12-Nov-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
Is that by design... any miner can mine the notarized block?

[12-Nov-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`any miner can mine the notarized block?`
Yes, the notarization takes the form of data in the transaction

[12-Nov-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_still doesn't understand why the CFEKMYLO chain is a topic 游땟_

[12-Nov-19 02:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
because this is definitely a point of failure and needs some way to address miner abandonment on non staked assets

[12-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Oszy#5734
it's not a production chain is it, so it doesn't matter

[12-Nov-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's the problem of the use developer, not the network or LABS (unless they also pay to have it mined)

[12-Nov-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
maybe @Mylo  doesn't want it mined or is just currently too busy to work on whatever project spawned the chain, that's also a possibility 游뱡游낗

[12-Nov-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
one has to allow for the notion that a dev pays for the services, begins work, has other commitments, and puts that chain on hold for a time
that is a likely scenario and will likely be the case of several chains at any given time, after adoption of LABS

[12-Nov-19 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
and wasnt that what you said was being tested on this chain... or someone said something about MYLO  having or testing on demand blocks

[12-Nov-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I have no clue what mylo was testing, not sure I ever did 游뱡游낗

[12-Nov-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`or someone said something about MYLO having or testing on demand blocks`
I had said that, as far as I know, on-demand is a default thing (and maybe applies to that chain)

[12-Nov-19 02:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
I guess im still not following...  how would i make an on demand block on a MYLO chan?

[12-Nov-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`how would i make an on demand block on a MYLO chan?`
if the chain is, in fact, on-demand
step 1) set generate to true
step 2) create a transaction
step 3) wait for your node to hash a block
step 4) if someone else creates a block, repeat from 2) on

[12-Nov-19 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
on-demand cannot be CPU mined from within the wallet without step 2

[12-Nov-19 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
on-demand = mining begins *on* the *demand*/need of a block being created based *on* the *demand* of a transaction needing to be entered into a block
