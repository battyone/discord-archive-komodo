ok, but why would other nodes validate that block?

[28-Dec-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they wouldnt

[28-Dec-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it would be in their mempool as valid for a second... unless each tx cc's create check the prev vin

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but at some point it needs to get validated across all nodes as a valid block

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think then its ok.

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this could only happen if it was like 2 node

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
even then the other node would reject the block with invalid tx

[28-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as the tioming cant allow it with a large amoutn... they would fork

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you might fork your own node by accepting an invalid block

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but i still dont see how the invalid tx gets confirmed

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool seems bulet proof then.

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
well BTC guys optimized performance and removed a check for double spend

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright sauid he managed that I think...

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I miss read it

[28-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
lets make sure we are not doing the same!

[28-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my only thing I could think of, is if you receive an invalid block its invalided .. but your node already added it to its mempool as valid

[28-Dec-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the performance code is for mempool and not the actual block validation, i think we can rely on the actual block validation to catch illegal tx

[28-Dec-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks dont go into mempool

[28-Dec-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks are blocks

[28-Dec-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if you accepted an invalid block to the chain, now you are forked on an invalid chain

[28-Dec-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every tx in them does, but onyl to 1 node... I think you just taught me somethiugn fundamental I didnt understand yet

[28-Dec-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I've just been really worried about it and going over it in every way I can think of hwo to break it

[28-Dec-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it all depends on all invalid tx being detected during block validation

[28-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it is every time

[28-Dec-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least once

[28-Dec-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there might be a better way to actually do it than I did... to create a new default to false boolean

[28-Dec-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and find the very first time the block is accepted

[28-Dec-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then do the checks there

[28-Dec-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and skip them at later checks

[28-Dec-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
currently just checks it when it checks PoW

[28-Dec-18 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats further down the line than the first time though

[28-Dec-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
PoW with slowflag?

[28-Dec-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
checkPoW with slowflag 0 is early

[28-Dec-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
with slowflag 1 is the actual block validation

[28-Dec-18 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it does it with slowflag at this time... but I see normal blocks to their tx validation without slowflag

[28-Dec-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for CC chains, we do it at slowflag

[28-Dec-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that isnt a problem its fine, however I think fixing that is very easy.

[28-Dec-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```CAmount burnAmount = AmountFromValue(params[2]);
    if (burnAmount <= 0)
        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_TYPE_ERROR, "Invalid amount for export");
    if (burnAmount > 1000000LL*COIN)
        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_TYPE_ERROR, "Invalid amount for export, cannot export more than 1 million coins per export.");
    {
        CAmount needed = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<tx.vout.size(); i++) needed += tx.vout[i].nValue;
        if (burnAmount < needed)
            throw runtime_error("export_amount too small");
    }```

[28-Dec-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this?

[28-Dec-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I see the problem but its not a consensus rule?

[28-Dec-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
would not the transaction created be invalid?

[28-Dec-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the consensus code as the same logic

[28-Dec-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So then export amount should be removed? and just use vout++

[28-Dec-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wqhy does export amount exist?

[28-Dec-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure

[28-Dec-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[28-Dec-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
easter egg!

export amount is 10 here ... see what happens

[28-Dec-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
export confirmed

[28-Dec-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the import amount is 10.... we have a uuuuggeeee problem

[28-Dec-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
create import happened

[28-Dec-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
export 10 and import 10 seems ok?

[28-Dec-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what it does

[28-Dec-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it did export 10

[28-Dec-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I think its ok

[28-Dec-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
def export was just the amount... so its a silly limitation

[28-Dec-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the tx has been made becauz the hash will change right?

[28-Dec-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[28-Dec-18 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry if u change the amout after the tx has been made?

[28-Dec-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is how it is checked. just not familiar with the import code

[28-Dec-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah need to make a cuatom tx here

[28-Dec-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got it

[28-Dec-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sleep will be needede tho

that's it, cheers thanks mate, just looking for your dragon hound tweet etc.

just whacking the tweet and some stuff into next week's TT about syncing issues bug squashing coming out of more #kmdlabs testing service.

[29-Dec-18 06:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it's functional for multiuser signup (moved from cherrypy to django), but lacking a bit of polish. Working on some 3rd party requests at the moment as a kind of white label capability for tracking other things

[29-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Mylo#8306
nice

[29-Dec-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  Migrates are broken on Sapling

[29-Dec-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cannot import

[29-Dec-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tx-overwinter-active

[29-Dec-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
needs to have tx version 4

[29-Dec-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
then normal signing should sign it properly

[29-Dec-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looking at it catn quite work out where to change it...

[29-Dec-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
export is fine

[29-Dec-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its on the createion of import,

[29-Dec-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also that check for < than you mentioned... I'm not sure what that's even there for, expect maybe to make sure the burn amount is more than the txfee. As the tx has not been funded at that stage.

[29-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
burn amount is litterally the only place where the export amount it set.

[29-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing iot to 10, just burt 10. Checked script.

[29-Dec-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will look at it

[29-Dec-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[29-Dec-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[29-Dec-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt build... hiving problems with linker 😦 Will play with it see if I cna get it to work.

komodod builds now

[29-Dec-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo-tx still has some issues. fixing that, but at least you can test

[29-Dec-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[29-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for komodo-tx

[29-Dec-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol just finsihed disabling it in my Makefiel to update te4st nodes

[29-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
np..

[29-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks again

[29-Dec-18 01:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had same overwinter error, thought it was due to older install on  pool node.

[29-Dec-18 01:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
set it to update, but got busy with other stuff

[29-Dec-18 01:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pls let me know when to test again
