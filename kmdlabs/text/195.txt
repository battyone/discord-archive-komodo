@TonyL 
Can you change this line:
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/main.cpp#L4701
to this:
`LOCK2(cs_main,mempool.cs);`
And then re test it?

shouldnt be too much hassle to add KMD to it... but I didnt really see the point as it has no complicated args to pass to it.

[06-Jan-19 11:03 AM] Mylo#8306
it's cool.   i'll keep it separate.  even different `-datadir` to keep it neat.

I've been running KMD komodod in staked - made an add on for start.sh called startall.sh
Doesn't seem to have had any issues so far....
```#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/staked

if [ -z $1 ] || [[ $1 = "config" ]]; then
  config=1
elif [[ $1 == "noconfig" ]]; then
  config=0
fi

ac_json=$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json 2>/dev/null)
echo $ac_json | jq .[] > /dev/null 2>&1
outcome=$(echo $?)
if [[ $outcome != 0 ]]; then
  echo -e "\033[1;31m ABORTING!!! assetchains.json is invalid, Help Human! \033[0m"
  exit
fi
echo $ac_json > assetchains.json

./listassetchains.py | while read chain; do
  if [[ $config == 1 ]]; then
    ./start.sh "$chain" "config" "skipfetchac"
  elif [[ $config == 0 ]]; then
    ./start.sh "$chain" "noconfig" "skipfetchac"
  fi
done
  sleep 5
  if [ ! -f $HOME/.komodo/komodod.pid ]; then
    echo "Starting KMD" > /dev/tty
    $HOME/staked/komodo/master/komodod > $HOME/staked/logs_chains/KMD.log 2>&1
  else
    echo "Komodo Running!" > /dev/tty
  fi```

hmm lstest build synced CFEKX just fine here. Trying Y now.

Hello there. Just a question. Did anyone here try to use remote servers for coin daemons.

[06-Jan-19 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wondering if it is possible at all

[06-Jan-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not with iguana... @Deleted User had a way of doing it.

[06-Jan-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
required changes to iguana though

[06-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Cause maybe that s a bad idea but wouldn t a finetuning of port forwarding work ?

[06-Jan-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if we needed to do it... we can jsut change iguana... rather than mess with OS configs... might be too ahrd for some people to do.

[06-Jan-19 11:17 AM] Mylo#8306
ssh tunnel?

[06-Jan-19 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. Tuning via forward can be tricky... but at first it could offload NN servers

[06-Jan-19 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I really fear that hdd and ram usage explode

[06-Jan-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ive done it with a tunnel before ... seems stable enough. I had chips LN node over SSH tunnel for weeks

[06-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Mylo#8306
or you can use `stunnel`

[06-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will try it on my side when barterlly let me the time then

[06-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Mylo#8306

There is a fork out there... its not the daemon.. Make sure you sync from a known good node @CMaurice  was it haveing issues?

Keeping main NN for kmd and ac and porting external to vm or big server

[06-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been thinking about the same.... but unless they have a diffrent pubkey... then it reallty does not matter... I'm still running 2 copies of every coin node apart from BTC (3 of KMD)  and have pleny of server left...

[06-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems going with a quad CPU older server was a great way to go lol.

DC rental is a bit steep... might need to see of I can move it before next year.

[06-Jan-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
let me try @blackjok3r

[06-Jan-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure thats the problem... I reverted that in some commit that was merged... Havent noticed our lock up bug since changing it back.

[06-Jan-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah I'm pretty sure it hangs because of some changes because before I've spammed a dozens of same txs with same scenarios and daemon never hanged

[06-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah pretty sure its that... It was a stupid change I wasnt thinking when I made it...

[06-Jan-19 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without lock main, it can lock the mempool from 2 places and then cant get out of the lock.

[06-Jan-19 11:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r Should I use daemon with these changes on broadcasting node only or on all nodes I have on chain?

[06-Jan-19 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you may need it on all nodes...

Oh its not

[06-Jan-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have you called a `stop` RPC to it ?

[06-Jan-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems to be wherer its stuck.

Usually it's hangs on 2)

[06-Jan-19 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
But in very rare cases on 1

[06-Jan-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
