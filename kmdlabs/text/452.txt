@zatJUM usually, I delete the chain (or backup it), resync with fresh nodes. If it is not enough, I use Peers page of yiimp to choose which are good peers (you can do with rpc calls). It happens that we had to ban one IP but it is rare

[26-Jul-19 05:47 PM] phm87#7395
Good nodes can be found on dxplorers and some exchanges

[26-Jul-19 05:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530
CFEKLOTTO1 is stucked at block 5809 & doesn't seem to move on anyway

[26-Jul-19 05:57 PM] zatJUM#9924
What is your IP @PHBA2061 ? Is your p2pport open?

[26-Jul-19 06:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
try replacing IP in  the assetchains.json file with this one 109.11.129.80

Good day. Tell me, is it possible to mine KMD directly without pools?

@King Arthur no, bitcoin core dev team made that impossible when they let slush make strautm a main-stream thing

[26-Jul-19 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at least for any coin that has a diff greater than reasonable for CPU

[26-Jul-19 06:10 PM] King Arthur#6068
Sir, what do you think is profitable?

[26-Jul-19 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
making more than what it costs you to mine

[26-Jul-19 06:11 PM] King Arthur#6068
If possible, please share as much as possible

what to do?

[26-Jul-19 07:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
@PHBA2061 I only used your IP with addnode and fresh sync and still have the same problem.
I'm stopping CFEKLOTTO1 for now, sorry.

[26-Jul-19 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CMaurice find the fork block and invalidate the 1st block different, then reconsider the next legit block

[26-Jul-19 07:36 PM] CMaurice#1685

maybe

[26-Jul-19 07:57 PM] CMaurice#1685
ok tries that, had caught up to explorer but now behind again: `"errors": "Warning: We do not appear to fully agree with our peers!`

[26-Jul-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just do the same with whatever fork you're now on

[26-Jul-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just replace the block hashes

[26-Jul-19 07:59 PM] CMaurice#1685
um, does it take a while to do its thing? buncha `sendrawtransaction: 16: bad-txns-inputs-missing (code -26)
sendrawtransaction: 16: bad-txns-inputs-missing (code -26)`

[26-Jul-19 08:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
oh, definitely behind again, how do you definitively which block it forked at?

[26-Jul-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't try to send while you're on a fork
after you're on the right chain, just do a rescan and it should fix the wallet (it might need a zap if scan doesn't help)

[26-Jul-19 08:01 PM] CMaurice#1685
oh, right, well, that might've been pos64staker

[26-Jul-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how do you definitively which block it forked at?`
find a block that you have in common, then find the next one that's different
the 1st one that's different is the 1st one that's wrong

[26-Jul-19 08:02 PM] CMaurice#1685
why not choose some arbitrary block from yesterday?

[26-Jul-19 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you could end up on the same bad fork
you want to permanently bar the bad block from your chain

[26-Jul-19 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, stop generating while you're trying to get on the right chain

[26-Jul-19 08:10 PM] CMaurice#1685
thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 but I'm going to have to leave this for a bit

[26-Jul-19 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
added dedicated 1 core each mining cfek chains to pool server

[26-Jul-19 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly because I'm tired of wallet reset locking up 😛

@PHBA2061 `just wondering, is there a way to prevent people from using multiple clone accs to maximize their chance of winning ?` if you think someone entering the lottery is sock puppet, make a notary poll to remove them

[27-Jul-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
They do have to provide a signed message on discord and github, so a brand new identity probably should get ousted from the NN lottery until they have made some contributions here or at least >50% of current NNs don't think they're a sock puppet

[27-Jul-19 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
maybe we should default to assuming every new participant is a sock puppet and >50% must vote that they aren't for their "ticket" to be valid?

[27-Jul-19 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
right now it's the opposite

[27-Jul-19 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
valid unless voted sock puppet

Hm, tried to start LABS from scratch but `Maximum number of retries exceeded!` and can't get past block 0, dunno if anyone has another IP, back later

[27-Jul-19 07:25 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Alright sounds good to me, we probably won't be facing sock puppets until LABS's value becomes significant , just better to be prepared.

[27-Jul-19 07:59 AM] CMaurice#1685
something kickstarted bu already ` "blocks": 61696,
  "longestchain": 86294,` which appears to be ahead of explorer

[27-Jul-19 08:01 AM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, one peer on fork seeme to me

[27-Jul-19 08:03 AM] CMaurice#1685
rather 2/4, how could I ban these and start from scratch?

[27-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@CMaurice - have you tried deleting the ``./.komodod/LABS/peers.dat`` to try and force using the seed node chain?

[27-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
might be quicker than invalidating on a chain this young.

[27-Jul-19 08:45 AM] CMaurice#1685
Thanks, but started from scratch, will try deleting after start later

[27-Jul-19 09:00 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Deleting peers.dat would only work on a non-synced node I think - otherwise an invalidate would still be needed.

[27-Jul-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How can it even fork is what I'm very worried about, the only thing I can think of is the oracle hard fork, and the vote was opened and some nodes were not updated and mined a different chain

[27-Jul-19 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if that's the case, then the non-updated became the "good" chain 🤷🏽

[27-Jul-19 11:38 AM] PHBA2061#2530
my notary node is on the good one but my staking node is on the bad one, I try to re-sync my staking node from scratch by adding only my notary node as peer but it keeps discovering bad peers & ends up on the bad chain, using `invalidateblock` & `reconsiderblock` doesn't help either 😑

[27-Jul-19 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
delete peers.dat and use `connect` to the nn (or some other known good peer) until you get it on the right chain

[27-Jul-19 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
once you're on the right chain and synced, then you can re-run it "normally" and it will add the rest of the good peers

[27-Jul-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
Please check mining or staking nodes, found a few that are stuck on forks due to not updating since launch
