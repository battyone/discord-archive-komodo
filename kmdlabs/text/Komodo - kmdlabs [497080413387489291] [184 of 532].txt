cool - ok goal is just to get the stats out for your own review.  as chuck d proclaims in the song _harder than you think_ "So you too can review what we do"

[03-Jan-19 04:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes. For reviewing test results.  Logging will be a basic service (tool) KMDLabs provides.  Stats is for monitoring chains and clusters.

[03-Jan-19 04:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
How much data are we intending to store in a single oracle sample? I'm using 'S' at the moment and its much more than needed for basic json strings

[03-Jan-19 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
For bulk scale test data, I'd intended to just write aggregated summary per 5sec interval

[03-Jan-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thinking about it, s is probably for most things.

[03-Jan-19 04:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had a script early on that wrote same data to oracle on every chain

[03-Jan-19 04:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Call it DDLT

[03-Jan-19 04:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Or CCCCDLT

[03-Jan-19 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Also, why not write every ntx to oracle. I scanned chat logs but at work so might have missed the reason

[03-Jan-19 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Gps is pushed evey 5 min, so 10min for ntx should be easy enough?

[03-Jan-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure either I think its because of overhead

[03-Jan-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to have more of a think about how it should work.

[03-Jan-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the notarizations were to labs chain itself then the data is already there, so maybe we just need to send the notarization to labs as well as kmd.

[03-Jan-19 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder if the block hash can be verified with MoMoM hash ðŸ¤”

[03-Jan-19 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
dont see how

[03-Jan-19 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
MoMoM is the merkle roots, not the blockhashes

[03-Jan-19 04:47 AM] gt#2812
i'm getting starting kmd fails

[03-Jan-19 04:50 AM] CrisF#3405
For me it's `-bash: ./zctuil/build.sh: No such file or directory
`

[03-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its spelt wrong

[03-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Zcutil

[03-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh

[03-Jan-19 04:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, thanks

[03-Jan-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Shit
I forgot to push validate address change

[03-Jan-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Damn it

[03-Jan-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Inside validateaddreas it checks if outcome equals 1, that needs to be -1 now for some reason

[03-Jan-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry guys

[03-Jan-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hell rushing, I will try to edit it on phone through git website

Stuck in car on 2h drive

[03-Jan-19 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember any validateaddress changes?

[03-Jan-19 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@gt can u try now?

[03-Jan-19 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No its a script we use on start, it checks for error returns in bash.. Something must have changed

[03-Jan-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, in scripts.

[03-Jan-19 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its called validate address, what it does is poll validate address until the daemon starts, then imports the privkey if its not imported to automate adding chains.

[03-Jan-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The error return for a chain that never started changed from 1 to -1

[03-Jan-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At least changing it to -1 allowed my notary to atart

[03-Jan-19 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it is outside the core, so not inside komodod

[03-Jan-19 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
you had to make the rawproof read in for the non-0xffffffff path to get the imports to work?

[03-Jan-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs to always use raw proof

[03-Jan-19 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or it can't read the op return

[03-Jan-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
thought so. i will update FSM

[03-Jan-19 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We hard forked and discarded the cluster

[03-Jan-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a good change to have, kind of magical the MoMoM didnt need the source chain info

[03-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes haha, lucky the breaking cha he u made was needed anyway haha.

[03-Jan-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I knew it didn't need it, but didn't realise until we started trying to gather stats and track coin movement.

[03-Jan-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That it was kind of needed

[03-Jan-19 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Up and running here.

[03-Jan-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sweet

[03-Jan-19 05:39 AM] gt#2812
yep seems to be good now

[03-Jan-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool I'll double check it when I get home, hopefully a few others have updated by then.

[03-Jan-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still 4-5h I guess till I get back

[03-Jan-19 06:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
NN up, pool/DH updating

Hmm, made UTXOs after few tries

[03-Jan-19 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I updated the splitter a few days back. Haven't noticed any issues. Let me know if it happe s again please.

[03-Jan-19 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can someone ping me if we start notarizing again please.

[03-Jan-19 08:54 AM] zatJUM#9924

ping 127.0.0.1 is ok, haven't changed anything in firewall rules

[03-Jan-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Updated and started ~1 hour ago - no notarisations so far

[03-Jan-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That means iguana didn't start

[03-Jan-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Try start_iguana.sh

[03-Jan-19 09:00 AM] zatJUM#9924
Fails with same error

[03-Jan-19 09:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
anyone got a tip as to what's wrong?

[03-Jan-19 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah my mining node was mining incorrect blocks with the daemon when I left too

[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope we didn't fork the chains

[03-Jan-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll check it out in a while just got back to town

[03-Jan-19 09:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any chance I can get some CFEKC to get dragonhound's orcles back online?

[03-Jan-19 09:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've modified code to use CFEKC instead of CFEK, but have no coins to creat oracles ðŸ˜¦

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are no coins we can only get them by mining

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
d'oh

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah lol

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might rob my NN... :p

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only option is to launch another chain... I tried to keep cfek but it wasn't able to sync

[03-Jan-19 09:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah it was pretty abused

[03-Jan-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The change to burn tx made all the old ones invalid

[03-Jan-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We actually had to add the new data otherwise James up stream changes could never be merged down

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might just send 10 CFEKC from NN ot DH and see if that works

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that wont break anything?

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If blocks are happening it will send

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chains r forked then it wont

[03-Jan-19 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Won't break anything

[03-Jan-19 09:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mastercard and youtube/patreon done gone goofed. the IDW is starting to notice the free speech protections of crypto via bitbacker and dlive ðŸ˜ƒ

[03-Jan-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
abuse power, and lose it. we live in a beautiful age

[03-Jan-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fortnight game added monero payments

[03-Jan-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can't help but thinking these huge companies are driving customers away purposely

[03-Jan-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the next gen isnt gonna put up with the shit we do when they get to our age

[03-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No chance

[03-Jan-19 09:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the dinosaurs were big, but starved of prey they went extinct. same will happen to the giants of last millenium

[03-Jan-19 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
banks, insurance, govenments... all on death row and they just dont understand thier mortaility. Thought they were invunerable. biggest falls hardest

old quote "fascism is capitalism in decline"

[03-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well the entire system was designed to fail.. So I don't this k they really care... There is some greater plan.

[03-Jan-19 09:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once the powerful start to feel it slip they get nasty, but it just delays the inevitable

[03-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep... Its obvious now to most people with half a brain... That there is serving wrong...

[03-Jan-19 09:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
they can only stop this by shutting off the internet, but that's a kamikaze tactic

[03-Jan-19 09:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
too adicted to the intel and cash it generates

[03-Jan-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes and no..
 The internet was originally designed so that if a point was nuked or whatever it would still work, it hasn't been that way for a while now, lots of central points of failure

[03-Jan-19 09:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
at worst it'll be fragmented, but that might be a good thing
