[24-Nov-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the problem is... is that if I change it noone will see you at all

[24-Nov-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until they all update

[24-Nov-18 04:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
deleted and remade a few times, kept seeing a bad address being referenced and RPC failing.

[24-Nov-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They should need to update at chain launch though... if there is achange in master branch it will build.

[24-Nov-18 04:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll gen anew set and try again

[24-Nov-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless they are dwy who didnt use stakednotary lol

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Do all have to update, or just 3 or 4 that are required to notariaze?

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone needs to update or the any node who isnt updated

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wont see the noarisaitons smk makes a svalid

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] CrisF#3405
ahhh.

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not really an issue

[24-Nov-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as they do update

[24-Nov-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will regognise the firs tone it sees

[24-Nov-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they will start notarising again

[24-Nov-18 04:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[24-Nov-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405
The only one who reported sync troubleand couldn't fix it through `connect` seems to be CMaurice.

[24-Nov-18 04:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got stuck on CFEKD at 96,

[24-Nov-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 04:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[24-Nov-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man I dont think everyone is in the staker role lol

[24-Nov-18 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can all update ... but it likely wont work at first until more people show up...

[24-Nov-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not that it matters, everyone is expected to be here for the test launch some time today anyway

[24-Nov-18 04:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah everyone should update today.

[24-Nov-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as start.sh doesnt bug out... it will build the new komodod

[24-Nov-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and iguana should be killed and restarted if staked.json changes in any way...

[24-Nov-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

New HARD walletreset done.

[24-Nov-18 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./walletreset.sh <coin>`
Will send all utxo to self, wait confirm, then remove all txs that are not that tx from wallet. if you ahev lots of dust, this is the one to use. 
To do a soft reset:
`komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions`

[24-Nov-18 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
works for all chains on master branch of StakedChain/komodo
