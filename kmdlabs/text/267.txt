No I mean.. there are blocks in NOTARYTEST where a ntoarisation happesn that valid.. but the coinbase that pays notaries isnt there

[02-Feb-19 12:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
why not simply build a miner :troll:

[02-Feb-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So miners can just create normal blocks....

[02-Feb-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The notary pay coinbase tx is extra on top of... not required to be there

[02-Feb-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because I used the comission model to build this...

[02-Feb-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`like they can ignore the fact a notrisation exists... and just mine a normal block`
yes, alright has done that on several of the test chains we've done #IgnoreTheMempool

[02-Feb-19 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... they can not mine the notarisation... thats fine, as any miner can do that it onyl take one honest miner to  stop that happening...

[02-Feb-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But to keep emissions linear oif a notarisation exists iun a blcok.. it MUST have the notary pay coinbse .. that seems to sometimes not happen... like 0.1% of the time lol... there is one block in the whoile chain so far that this happened on...

[02-Feb-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just happened to be watching it when it happened. 😂

[02-Feb-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing you could do to force that is add a consensus rule that the local node rejects and doesn't broadcast

[02-Feb-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah curerntly it detemines what a notrisation block is by the number of vouts int he coinbase ... That was a very lazy and easy way to do it to get it working.. but it seems not really good enough.

[02-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that moment when you're notarizing too much for `./walletreset.sh KMD` to work: ☹

[02-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need to actaully do that

[02-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just call `cleanwallettransactions`

[02-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tyhink we can change that script too... so it uses z_mergetoaddress instead of just sending balance to self

[02-Feb-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
incase there is too many utxos to send in 1 tx

[02-Feb-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Feb-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```JSON

both my notaris cron that RPC every 6H 😂

[02-Feb-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I moved to a different server (running a test on the effect of different RAM and no swap)

[02-Feb-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice..

[02-Feb-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
be wary of using a new IP.... You might need to get it added to the peer_ips.txt in StakedNotary repo.

[02-Feb-19 02:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
```$ komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions
{
  "total_transactons": 26213,
  "remaining_transactons": 1136,
  "removed_transactions": 25077
}``` 😉

[02-Feb-19 02:54 PM] CrisF#3405
I'd like to change my IP too.  How can I get it added to peer_ips.txt?

[02-Feb-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`be wary of using a new IP.... `
No one seems to have noticed or cared, so if there's supposed to be an IP enforcement, you might wanna check into that

[02-Feb-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not that

[02-Feb-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the code itself.. maybe its ok now.. but when ppl changed ip on main net they lost conenctivity and couldnt enter recvmask

[02-Feb-19 02:56 PM] SHossain#0007
```
komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions
{
  "total_transactons": 30282,
  "remaining_transactons": 11494,
  "removed_transactions": 18788
}
```
still KMD wallet.dat size 107MB

[02-Feb-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
walelt size doesnt change

[02-Feb-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it zeros out space

[02-Feb-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and reuses it

[02-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you reset it with deckers method then use the RPC it stays small

[02-Feb-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
shall i run it again? still 11k txs left

[02-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to make it work 100% you need some external script sending all funds older than X blcoks to yourself

[02-Feb-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahve not provided this.. .as if you just fund 1 utxo .. .the split scirpt will do this for you

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe z_mergetoaddress in dwy_mitigation script would also do it...

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its ontly working on NOTARYTEST branch right now

[02-Feb-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Very close here to a working notary pay chain 😄

[02-Feb-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
been a long day lol

[02-Feb-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is abuot 10 tx in the current chain that dont pass validation.. I just disabled that, and made it sleep for 30s when ti happens so I could see the debugf prints during sync.

[02-Feb-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we need a new chain with validation though.... and maybe not using VerusHash11 becasue maybe that staker is consantly reorging the chain, notarisations are like 10-15 block apart, taking 2-3x longer then they should.

[02-Feb-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Could also be due to just not enough nodes, or not enough nodes iwth open ports too.

[02-Feb-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c 
Is there a safer way to do this math?
```
    AmountToPay = ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY*n;
    ret = AmountToPay / numnotaries;
  ```

[02-Feb-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its in sats

[02-Feb-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ASSETCHAINS_NOTARY_PAY is the total amount reserver for ntoaries per block

[02-Feb-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
n is how many blocks since the last notarisation

[02-Feb-19 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all are `uint64_t`

[02-Feb-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems pretty safe as long as numnotaries is > 0

[02-Feb-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its always over 0, but will add sanity check

[02-Feb-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks

[02-Feb-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lel.... Validation was pretty broken

[02-Feb-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty broken > ugly broken

[02-Feb-19 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha

[02-Feb-19 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well it was fatally flawed... it wa litterally checking the wrong tx 🤦

[02-Feb-19 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and overflowing its return... so it always passed

[02-Feb-19 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my "simple solution" is now hundreds of lines of code 🤣

[02-Feb-19 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my "simple solution" is now hundreds of lines of code`
Welcome to the magical world of production code 😛

[02-Feb-19 06:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright is sleeping so I will do the same. Pushing update to NotaryTest branch... uit cannot sync NOTARYTEST chain... which will be killed as soon as we are both online at the same time again and replaced with a new chain. I think there migh be some bugs in the miner, but nto sure... Validation seems to be working well. So hopefully I can just try to mine blocks myself and track the miner bugs down, on the new chain.

[02-Feb-19 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👍🏽 💤

[02-Feb-19 06:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL aswell at the first notartisation... it pays such a large amount... eveyone will want to be first to ntoarise 😄

very cool stuff

[02-Feb-19 11:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be interesting to re-launch BTCH with -ac_notarypay

[03-Feb-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  For what reason? Well I guess its cool... and it shows it off lol... but thats a LOT of work to get this into komodo, it cahnged how a heaps of stuff works... I'm pretty sure its all backward compatible... But at this stage that is untested and its still on a diffrent branch.

[03-Feb-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For now... I need to get this tested and try to rework my ERA activation.... I think it actually might be ok, as it relies on tiome stamps of each block, and a gap of longer then the max time a block can be in the future.

[03-Feb-19 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
if anyone is around, please do `./stop.sh`, `git pull`, `./start.sh`

[03-Feb-19 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
we need 2 other people. We don't want to ping everyone until we know at least 1 notarization works

unless the bootstrap is from yourself or someone you dearly trust

right now, obviously this isn't vital

[03-Feb-19 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
but in the future(mainnet), please shy away from bootstrapping your notary

[03-Feb-19 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have a good copy tar and compress a chain every 100k bvlocks... then save it
