THAT is the rule

[15-Oct-18 05:16 AM] jl777c#5810
in a realtime system, you cant have any part of the system not keep up. even if it is slower by 1%, eventually it just lags and lags until all falls apart

[15-Oct-18 05:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so use the method you got to get very fast continuous blocks for the chat

[15-Oct-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
add 8kb opreturns and see what bandwidth can be sustained on a single chain

[15-Oct-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
this is the critical number

[15-Oct-18 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it will be limited by the node sending it tbh ... but we need to check that

[15-Oct-18 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I got distracted trying to fix oraclesinfo ... but I cant fix it

[15-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
a webcam sampler making transactions might indeed have a difficult time to sustain 256kb/sec

[15-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is 32 8kb transactions per second, so not crazy

[15-Oct-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although we could use something like TxBlaster, as the chat chain has basically unlimited free coins

[15-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, I assumed you would modify txblaster so it added an 8kb opreturn

[15-Oct-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh yeah, using wallet in daemon its just nt possible at all.

[15-Oct-18 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin wallet is pretty slow, yes

[15-Oct-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok well, i guess I stop trying to fix oraclesinfo and hope theo other guy you pinged can work it out. Need to go do some tohter stuff, when I get back tonight I will try and add 8kb opreturn to txbalster.. .we cn jsut se the TROLL chain.. and if we break it or make it too big, can just delete it and start a new one.

[15-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
Where does he 8kb limit come from? Is that the amount of data a single OP_RETURN can store or the amount of data a tx can store in OP_RETURN?

[15-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
basically wondering if we can have multiple OP_RETURN outputs with 8kb each

[15-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
as long as it's below tx limit

[15-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
which is what like 100kb?

[15-Oct-18 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
yea so apparently it's possible to mine txs with multiple OP_RETURN outputs in them, but they will be RejectFromMemoryPool'd by vanilla nodes

[15-Oct-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That really doesnt matter, as this chain breaks consensus rules as it is, just change that?

[15-Oct-18 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if using a really massive TX with multiple op_return it will be easier to keep the stream at max badnwidth on the sending side

[15-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Alright#0419
Ah so apparently 100kb is just the max for a "standard" tx

[15-Oct-18 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
meaning you can mine txs up to the block size, but again they'd be RejectFromMemoryPool'd by vanilla nodes

[15-Oct-18 05:31 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c what do you think is best route to take? Many smaller transactions or smaller amount of massive txs?

[15-Oct-18 05:32 AM] Alright#0419
current oracles wouldn't support many OP_RETURNS in one tx

[15-Oct-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes true .... we shoud probably just use it as is ... rather than try and change it ?

[15-Oct-18 05:32 AM] Alright#0419
maybe we just change the limit on a single OP_RETURN?

[15-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can you point me to where txblaster builds txs?

[15-Oct-18 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never looked at it ... wil find now and DM

[15-Oct-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
ty

[15-Oct-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
Also I was thinking that OP_RETURN data can be pruned

[15-Oct-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe we don't need a new chain for each stream

[15-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just use one opreturn

[15-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
8kb

[15-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
dont need to make any changes

[15-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
other than fast blocks

[15-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why i suggested the method i suggested

[15-Oct-18 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can slam a bunch of 8kb opreturn and get 256kb/sec bandwidth, we can do decentralized streaming

[15-Oct-18 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
getting the right data into the 8kb and reassembling it becomes a dapp level issue

[15-Oct-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the webcam video will have some logical size per opreturn and it might be a bit more or less than 8kb, that is ok. there is some leeway

[15-Oct-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and it doesnt really give you more bandwidth to have 8kb single opreturns or 100kb multiple opreturns

[15-Oct-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
what matters is how fast the blocks can confirm (assuming the blocks are full)

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
because if the block is full of data, how much does it matter if it is in 8kb increments or 80kb or 800kb?

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact, you should get slightly higher throughput with the smaller one due to more fitting into a block

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
bandwidth stuff doesnt work exactly like other things

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] Alright#0419
the way it's set up now, it will mine a block as soon as there's a single tx in mempool

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
fine

[15-Oct-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lesss transactions = more payment though, or does that not apply to op_rteturn?

[15-Oct-18 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i assume coins costs is not an issue

[15-Oct-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coins are free

[15-Oct-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well a fauct mine

[15-Oct-18 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is no issue

[15-Oct-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as amny faucet mines as you need ... just need to mine them.

[15-Oct-18 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what faucet has to do with streaming

[15-Oct-18 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i think just txblast with 8kb opreturn and see what happens

[15-Oct-18 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
looking at txblast script now

[15-Oct-18 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just where it makes the tx, add an opreturn to it

[15-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Alright#0419
tried to decipher the code for txblaster, but I'm not getting anywhere. I see that withdraw method supports OP_RETURN, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that to work with txblast method

[15-Oct-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just add "opreturn":"hexstr" at the top of the JSON

[15-Oct-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
let me check

[15-Oct-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"withdraw\",\"coin\":\"CHIPS\",\"outputs\":[{\"RHV2As4rox97BuE3LK96vMeNY8VsGRTmBj\":0.0001}],\"opreturn\":\"deadbeef\"}"

[15-Oct-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so the opreturn string just needs to be 8kb worth of hex

[15-Oct-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, its a bit more tricky

[15-Oct-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
I will add it

[15-Oct-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, in the create txblaster function there are two variables:     int32_t origspendlen; char *passphrase = 0,*opretstr = "deadbeef";

[15-Oct-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
opretstr needs to be hex and it will end up in the opreturn (i think)

[15-Oct-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if that was 8kb worth of hex, then the opreturn will be much bigger, but all you should have to change is the deadbeef

[15-Oct-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
verify it works with deadbeef first, then change it and make sure it adapts

[15-Oct-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the passphrase is disabled via set to 0, but if there is a string then that string would be needed to decrypt it on display of the opreturn

[15-Oct-18 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so to make this work for a live stream, there is a webcam -> (seqid + 8kb) packetizers that then is retrieved from a fifo in the create txblaster, but this is more a tonyL thing

[15-Oct-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont take much time to feed in the right data. the important think is what level of bandwidth we can achieve

[15-Oct-18 07:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
@Alright ./start.sh'd but `{"result":"coin already there","tag":"11612409106504870123"}

back in 45 mins

[15-Oct-18 07:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
^that's for 8 chains

[15-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
that's expected

[15-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
did it print something about rebuilding blockjok3r branch?

[15-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
and stop and restart STAKEDED?

[15-Oct-18 07:52 AM] Mylo#8306
Off topic a little but FYI:  Although a dApp level issue, the smallest chunks I could do with ffmpeg was 160kB from 7MB mp4 vid yesterday.  Have found JavaScript/browser FileAPI which can chunkify stuff for streaming still to test but someon3 commented on being able to split/transmit a 3GB file like this.

[15-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
unix has utilities to split files, it isnt hard to do via C either

[15-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
just a matter to read 8kb, transmit it, repeat till done

[15-Oct-18 08:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
yep, looks like all good@Alright

[15-Oct-18 08:25 AM] Alright#0419
pushed an update to trollbox branch, chatsend will now put unix timestamp as first part of the message then chatreceive can convert it back however the user wants to see it

[15-Oct-18 08:26 AM] Alright#0419
default looks like this right now 
`10:22:02-CEST[AlrightðŸ˜„-02ba508228]:echoechoecho`
but if you change arg4 of the chatreceive script it will change the date format to whatever you set

[15-Oct-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
going to use it as the basis for sorting chat history ðŸ¤ž

[15-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok @jl777c  going to have a go at this txblaster with opreturn now.

[15-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch

[15-Oct-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
should be easy for you to put in whatever hardcoded hex into the opreturn

[15-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so its just hardcoded into the marketmaker and will send the same opreturn for every vout ?

[15-Oct-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
creating an external feed will be a matter to have some set of files, maybe numbered, that you load and convert to hexstr

[15-Oct-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is txblaster

[15-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume I need to use a whole bunch of vouts to get enough bandwidth to  fill blocks.

[15-Oct-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
why?

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
100 output tx filled block pretty fast and 8kb is a lot of space

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe run more than one txblaster at once ... will try with 1 vout first go and see what happens.

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you want to fill it with opreturns, not vouts

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the bandwidth is measured in number of opreturns

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ¤”

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
any datastream will be encoded into the opreturns

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so can only have 1 opreturn per vout, and 1 vout per blaster

[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
everything else is overhead
