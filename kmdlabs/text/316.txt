thats what ALL build.sh uses... except the DIMXTY branch where i changed it to use makecclib

[01-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
my understanding is that libcc.so does not need to be there unless you're using a chain that uses CCs from it

[01-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
not sure about it building without it though

[01-Mar-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to be there Im pretty sure

[01-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
delete it

[01-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
and restart it

[01-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
Oh wait

[01-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
it's statically linked right now

[01-Mar-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no to build komodod it must be there

[01-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
deleting it won't do shit

[01-Mar-19 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im 99% sure the fix I just pushed out works... but not sure why it fails on some systems though. Maybe someone can give me access to one of them to debug it on the weekend ? Im going out for tea soon and wont ab back tonight I dont think.

[01-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
testing a build with latest CFEKDIMXY right now

[01-Mar-19 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r it just worked?

[01-Mar-19 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
not sure man, I really need to dig into how start.sh works and emulate it's behavior

[01-Mar-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it built on my server simply using start.sh with master and CFEK daemons deleted (forces it to build even if no update found)

[01-Mar-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I think it works... Like I siad before. github is bein shit, and not propagating commits to everyone at the same time somehow. This is most liley the problem

[01-Mar-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or a fail make, needs to havce make clean done... which you cant do until you run build.sh first

[01-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
how can I be sure the daemon built with correct commit?

[01-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
and was started with correct commit?

[01-Mar-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant...

[01-Mar-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
I was thinking we will eventually need a way to force notaries to update

[01-Mar-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
say a dev pushes a fix to their branch, we need to push notaries to actually want to update in a timely matter

[01-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
right now if there are more notaries not updated, it's in the notaries best interest not to update as they will get more notarizations

[01-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
we could try to compensate notaries for updates 😈

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
it does make sense

[01-Mar-19 10:54 AM] Alright#0419
maybe instead of compensation for updating, some negative impact if they don't

[01-Mar-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```I dont think we need to chagne iguana for this, just return an error to it instead of null to that it will not create the notarization. If there are changes needed for iguana
I can do that
So what it needs to do is:
1) check that there is more than 2 notarizations on a chain
2) if there is more than 2, refuse to submit null
3) if there are less than 2 submit null.
the issue is comming from a notarization not yet being confirmed on KMD when iguana makes the notarization. It must wait until the last notarization has been confirmed.
this is why when we increased notarization frequency number to 15 blocks everything ALWAYS works 100% of the time.```

[01-Mar-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally know what the problem is guys 😄

[01-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now we just need to fix it. dimxy is going to see what he can do, otherwise I'll try to fix it over the weekend.

[01-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`the issue is comming from a notarization not yet being confirmed on KMD when iguana makes the notarization. It must wait until the last notarization has been confirmed.` libscott said this right from day 1, that iguana not waiting for notas being confirmed would be a problem.

[01-Mar-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least we can now fix it.

[01-Mar-19 10:59 AM] CMaurice#1685
`failed to update please build manually`

[01-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jorian#4555
updating fast will boost your stats in the beginning, since you'll be among the few that updated

[01-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jorian#4555
so if notarizations is a metric i think that should be covered

[01-Mar-19 11:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`failed to boot, please rebuild with new hard drives`

[01-Mar-19 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
done, now I can put the screwdriver down...

[01-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian if the chain doesn't fork, non-updated nodes will continue to notarize if there is enough of them

[01-Mar-19 11:38 AM] jorian#4555
ohh. i get it, didn't read lol

[01-Mar-19 11:38 AM] jorian#4555
yes that happens

[01-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Alright#0419

labs 

[01-Mar-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so some idiot thought it would be a good idea to run a reindex on komodo with 2 cores and 4G of RAM
after 2 days, he says "don't be an idiot like me; just don't do that"...

[01-Mar-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.... cores doesnt matter. I ran it ona  24 core VM and it took 18H to finish

[01-Mar-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not time issue, it crashed 😛

[01-Mar-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol, yeah RAM is important... Notary nodes need boat loads of it

[01-Mar-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it used up all the RAM and swap

[01-Mar-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using 32GB for LABS, only uses like 3GB most of the time though

[01-Mar-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
16GB is probably needed if you want to build daemons and stuff while notary is stil running

[01-Mar-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
8Gb + 8GB swap would suffice

[01-Mar-19 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in my experience 4 works, but 4 *free* works better

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Mar-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is there much ram savings with the current master?

[01-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I removed a large amount of data from the runtime memory stucture

[01-Mar-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think I have that one running on the remote, I think I have the build just before that one

[01-Mar-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. Yeah I didnt notrice a lot of diffrence tbh which was surprising... Only guess is it wasnt actually using all the paths I removed.

[01-Mar-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not seeing a difference on local komodo right at usual 3.9

[01-Mar-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Actually I know it wasnt using them... Likely the savings would be under 100MB

[01-Mar-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At least I know what the problem with MoMoM is now... and the sledgehammer code we thaught fixed it actaully didnt.... What fixed it last time, was the face I added a supress of notarizations unless 3KMD blocks ahd happened. Now with more txns on KMD and the sapling stuff, 3 blocks isnt enough to guarentee that the previous notarization has confirmed. 
This isnt all bad, as just adding mroe and more delay was only covering up the problem.

[01-Mar-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really needs to be fixed properly.

[01-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ironicly, the bug causing the gaps is caused by another bug fix added at the very start of STAKED MoMoM tests lol

[01-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said, the bug fix propably uncovered this bug ... rather than causing it directly

[01-Mar-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I forget, is there any special daemon/build needed to run your pool code?

[01-Mar-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no the getblocktemplate change should be in everything apart from master, could be there also

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[01-Mar-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent checked

[01-Mar-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Someone asked me last night about soloing rogue with a GPU and I couldn't remember

[01-Mar-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol why mine rogue 😆

[01-Mar-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
feked if I know, all I know is that without work yours is the only pool that will likely work

[01-Mar-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that pool is the only pool that works for nearly all AC params I think... Very useful in the end... I knew what I was doing it for.

[01-Mar-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wouldn't even know where to start with_ `OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION` ☹

[01-Mar-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[01-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is what I was trying to say the whole time

[01-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once that was made possible lots and lots of things are going to use it.

[01-Mar-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wasn't ever saying yours didn't work, I was saying that "someone" should make one that would (more specifically that we need a tx lib that covers all the komodo txes)

[01-Mar-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we do, but they change so fast nobody is going to be able to maintain it

[01-Mar-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so for now until things are set in stone and stable, there is no reason to make it

[01-Mar-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`they change so fast nobody is going to be able to maintain it`
exactly why I haven't touched mine in almost a month ☹

[01-Mar-19 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep. We need to work with what we have, if something can be hacked that makes it easy to use and it works. That seems to be the way to go IMO. If they stuff is very popular and useful then those extra thigns that can be built on top will come.

[01-Mar-19 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My original resistance to your pool was "someone" needed to code the payments, but with all the crazy shit james keeps throwing in, it's about going to be faster to recode payments than to finish the "old" new ac stuff, much less the new-new stuff

[01-Mar-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_kinda misses the free-spirt days when he had free time_

[01-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
hey while you're at it, I'm going to need a payment processor for a staking pool :troll:

[01-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
please and thank you

[01-Mar-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's 3rd on my list, mostly because it involves accounts and I haven't time to learn how to secure accounts atm

[01-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
accounts?

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
ah sorry thought you meant the deprecated thing in the daemon

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
yes user accounts

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
gateway?

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no decent way to do a staking pool without user accounts ☹

[01-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
repurposing that might be a cool way to do it

[01-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
deposit coins in gateway, get 1:1 in return, gateway stakes coins then distributes "shares" on 1:1 chain

[01-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
withdraw whenever via gateway

[01-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
Ah wait

[01-Mar-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really... My plan from before, to somehow add mupltiple wallets is probably the way to go.. Combined with Alrights idea for each walelt to just use a diffren RPC interface/port.

[01-Mar-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so easy that even you can write it, right? :troll:

[01-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
multisig staking probably not viable 😂

[01-Mar-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for each user, you track their adddress

[01-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
the gateways thing would work but it would be 1 signer gateway

[01-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise the coins can't be staked on the real chain

[01-Mar-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a staking pool ... what is the goal of it? to combine smaller utxos into larger ones? Or just to make it so that a user doen tneed his/her own full daemon online 24/7 ?

[01-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I could likely get the staking aspect of it working and distributing shares aspect working

[01-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
no idea about the gateway aspect of it though

[01-Mar-19 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
yes, user pays % so they don't have to manage it
