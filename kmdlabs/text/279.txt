did that fix it at all?

[06-Feb-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure tis the LWMA difficulty algo on verushash waswell.. got equihash working now...  leaving my test chain runnign here for a day or so to see.. We can relaunch the 0BR at a later time

[06-Feb-19 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
It fixed, but not in the way I had hoped
Now I'm in the same boat as you (no UTXOs for PoS and diff too high for PoW) üòï

[06-Feb-19 04:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... LABST3/4 I wouldnt worry about... as long as the 2 chain is working well I am hapy... VerusHash is still FEKED

[06-Feb-19 04:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one day I will get it to work üòÖ

[06-Feb-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`VerusHash is still FEKED`
Well, that's all your fault, you were going to learn that a yr ago and "fix" CHIPS :troll:

[06-Feb-19 04:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... its not really that... I guess if we used VerusPoS then it would work fine... but Im not sure withdrawing all the stake off a chain using that would make it stop dead forever

[06-Feb-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it would if the PoW wall was hit, I'd think anyway

[06-Feb-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VerusPoS doesnt ahve a diff wall I dont think.. its uses 2 compeltely diffrent block types/versions and diofficulty algos for PoW and poS

[06-Feb-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that just using equihash diff for it is somewhat fiixing it

[06-Feb-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but every block is like 10s atm so far at block 200... but I think thats the cahin aprams I used

[06-Feb-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1% PoS LOL

[06-Feb-19 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_is all good with making everything in the world 200,9 equihash :troll:_

feka PoS üòõ

[06-Feb-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I know but for 0BR chains all it does is introduce massive attack vectors... Look what 1 mini did to LABSTPAY in 10 minutes

[06-Feb-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
killed it dead

[06-Feb-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it's not just 0br, it's any br that isn't "profitable" to folks
there's a few komodo assets that have gotten locked as interest in the chain waxes and wains

[06-Feb-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
DEX, REVS, and SN spring instantly to mind

[06-Feb-19 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes true that

[06-Feb-19 08:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Well, tried over and over to get LABST2 to sync on my two standard nodes, always got stuck at 522.
Rebuilds and deleting chains made no difference.
Copied chain from my NN, now they seem happy, or at least on par with the NN.

everything stuck or is it just me?

[07-Feb-19 12:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess is stuck, 3/4 are def died, will check out 2 soon and try to get some chains up. @Bar_F1sh_Rel  can u upload the compiled komodpd that won't sync somewhere? Which os ? I can't reproduce this... It synced for me a bunch of times so far...

[07-Feb-19 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I this k alrights seed node forked too, somehow üòÇ co consensus code has been changed so that's concerning... My guess is that it included 2 notarizations in a block because of the mining bug...

[07-Feb-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes accidently left my LABST2 node on PoW.... was switching between them as PoS go too high.... Just mined about 50 blocks in a few minutes.. üòÑ should be working again

[07-Feb-19 01:33 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r will take a look at them in a minute

[07-Feb-19 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You 230 LABST2 node is forked

[07-Feb-19 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kill the 3/4 they are totally fucked... sorry my fault.. Didnt have time to test them enough.. I think I have something working now... Just used equihash difficulty algo for VerusHash with PoS64... already working 100x better, but still ahve the occasional 500s block... Not really sure why it does that. did only use 2000 supply though

[07-Feb-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with a 6700 minign reward staking on verus has worked fine.. So it litterally just the small suipply I think... Its not so bad, but not great either... For test chains we do really need a reasonable block time, can t have ppl sitting around waiting for 500s for a block to confirm üò¶

[07-Feb-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Other option is to remove the diff wall on VerusHash ... So that if the PoS has no elegible utxo's the PoW can just go over the target % for  a few blocks to make one elegible.

[07-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't it cap at 382s?

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] Alright#0419
Not sure I've ever seen 500

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not a cap... but rather a N*N after  480s

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I reduced this to 128s

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and still get 500s blocks üò¶

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless im missing how it works, but I thiaght doing it this way worked in the past

[07-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its possible to make it do 128s

[07-Feb-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then do N*N*N*N when it gets to 480s ... wich should cap it even lower...

[07-Feb-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but doing so many multiplcations....

[07-Feb-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will end up with nearlky all utxo able to stake on chain for some blocks

[07-Feb-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its a safer option to allow PoW diff wall move at least a small bit ...like it can go 5% over withuot really increasing much at all... and then ramp up to 500x the diff

[07-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
safer option is not playing with this right now

[07-Feb-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont get you... we need 0BR to work

[07-Feb-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not touching it for equihash

[07-Feb-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
main chain seems working just fine

[07-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, thought you were playing with main chain algo

[07-Feb-19 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[07-Feb-19 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works as good as it wil work...

[07-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Alright#0419
so what is it you're trying to fix? long block times on 0BR chains?

[07-Feb-19 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with enough hash rate its fine

[07-Feb-19 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... the blocks just get stuck... becaus the hash rate is so ridiculous on verushash even with just 1 cpou core... the difficulty rises so high no utxo is elegible... Going to try one more change and see,,, maybe N * N * N * N over 300s will do the trick.. Dont wwant to waste too much more time on it... Its a long process to test a small change.

[07-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
need a peer for 2

[07-Feb-19 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
103.6.12.112 seems to be on main cahin

[07-Feb-19 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also i think its important that notaries have open ports... this will help a lot with an potental forks... and stuff... The main thing for ppls sync issues seems to be that a seed node has ended up forking... due to a abug or unintended code change

[07-Feb-19 02:26 AM] gt#2812
what height is the main chain

[07-Feb-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait wtf

[07-Feb-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no my notary is not on main chain... 800 blocks there my node here is on 970 üòÇ

[07-Feb-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fark... this is very bad

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] gt#2812
i‚Äôm still notarizing at height 970

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to forward port for this node at my house and sync notary to it... the chain is being notarized

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so there are nodes on it

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the fact it can fork so easliy is really not good

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is isguana

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
don't host from your house

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It doesnt wait for a notarisation to be confirmed before fireing another one out there

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
especially if you say publicly that it's your house before hand :abusedsmily:

[07-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just need to sync the chain to notary

[07-Feb-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im no0t letting you guys sync to it

[07-Feb-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[07-Feb-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ive found the bug thats making it do this I think.... just need to wrk out why it does it

[07-Feb-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
103.6.12.112 is now on main chain

[07-Feb-19 05:32 AM] CrisF#3405
For LABST2 I'm here ```BASH
"blocks": 1101,
  "longestchain": 1101,```
with a notarization 2 minutes ago.  Does that sound correct?

[07-Feb-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
enough that its notarizing... Which atm is all I need to rewrite the miner

üëç 

[07-Feb-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If this doesnt work... then we will need to change iguana ... I dont think its impossible, as longa s igfuana can check it created a valid ntoarisation, the it can just wait for a confrirm. Aleady got a function that can check notarisation, shouldnt be hard to make an RPC that takes raw transaction as input and extracts notarisaiton and returns true or false

[07-Feb-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Without this as a saftey check. if it creates an invalid ntoarisation (for any reason) then it can just make a new one, if its valid, then it waits for 1 confirm before making another one.

[07-Feb-19 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if someone else trys to mine, they hdecide on a diffrent chain to each other and it forks
