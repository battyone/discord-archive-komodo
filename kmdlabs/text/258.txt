[29-Jan-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
why?

[29-Jan-19 06:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure its just stuck on 2619

[29-Jan-19 06:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tx sends fine... import worked... dont ahve any payme so needed to migrate there first to go back.. chains are both hell slow atm

[29-Jan-19 06:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Jan-19 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got 2619 too, so either you totally feked it or it's just not moving

[29-Jan-19 07:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Notary payment chain

[30-Jan-19 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It has most validation removed atm.. so you can make pretty much any sized coinabse yuo want

[30-Jan-19 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
New updates pushed to staked repo. StakedNotary,  LABS/komodo.
We have a new chain `NOTARYTEST` which I need being notarised as soon as possible. 
I found many bugs in `start.sh`, something along the line got messed up, surprised it was even working. There are now more prints so it doesn't just appear to hang, and you know a bit more about what is going on. Also more info for error prints, along with possible solutions. 
Once again, if build fails, use build.sh first to get it back on track. If any chains fail to start, resync or reindex. These bugs should be well and truly squashed now, no problems here on many chains for a few days.

👍 (5) 💯 

[30-Jan-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also a trick to reindex all assetchains (dont want to do that to KMD, get the bootstrap from 0x03) 
`./assetchains -reindex`
You would need to run start.sh first, if it fails to start chains you can use the above command to start all LABS chains with reindex.

Check the coinbase tx and the tx number 1 of that block? The tx number 1 should be a notarization, and the coinbase should print free coins to everyone who notarized... If it works

[30-Jan-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is an attack veector with the current code if you mine a notarization you can make almost unlimited coins to the included notaries

[30-Jan-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is on purpose... So that notaries can validate mistakes

I have 200 vouts with negative amounts + 200 with positive

[30-Jan-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How its supposed to work is:
1) notarization happenes
2) its included in a block
3) it's made automatically tx number 1.
4) the miner creates a coinbase that pays a vput to each vin of the notarisation

[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For block validation it takes that tx number 1 and recreates the coinbase and the. Checks its the same as expected... But validation is disabled atm

[30-Jan-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If its creating negative vouts something overflowed

@Alright I had a thought about determining the "top" notaries
Use the percentage of notarizations they performed out of the possible notarizations they *could have performed*
If you've notarized 6 times out of the 100 notarizations since you became a notary then your "rank" is higher than someone that got 11 out of 200 and lower than someone that got 50 of 100 (or 25 out of 50)

when all else fails, throw math at it 😛

Just worked out a much better solution to temp file fix.. 
Once again testing it will be the hard part, but I think I can get most of the way there, just by putting blocks  in the wrong file or flaging blocks with the wrong info, to test the code logic.
Have 2 temp files, that start at 16MB in size, and it moves from one file to the other. 
If the temp file contains  blocks in the main chain newer than the last notarised height it increases the max file size of thje other file by another 16MB... 
Just keeps increaseing one file, until the other file is able to be cleared then switches to that file. 
I think using this I can clear the ophaned blocks from the index also, as if its not in the main chain, and that has been notarised it can never be in the chain. Not sure how the index works 100% but I think the cause of the last "fix" was because of get chain tips giving me data I didnt expect it to, and it was removing blocks it should not have.

Nice idea Genie btw! 😄

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it's still very similar to pure notarization count

[31-Jan-19 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
Except that your count from previous era affects current era

[31-Jan-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, the percentage can be done from any given point
if era started last friday, then all active have equal ground, but the key difference is if one drops out and a newcomer takes their place, then %age is the only "real" comparison

[31-Jan-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
You're saying if someone drops out mid era?

Does ranking based on only LABS->KMD count make sense? Do you think the incentive to notarize fungible chains will be large enough for notaries to bother?

[31-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Alright#0419
LABS->KMD count is a solid metric because all notaries must do it

[31-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
LABS->KMD count * (some metric to determine how well you notarized chains you agreed to notarize)

[31-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
This is what I was roughly thinking
