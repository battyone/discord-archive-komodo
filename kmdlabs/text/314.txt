Tip dont save VM state with komodods running they dont like it 😃

[28-Feb-19 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, saving open db handles is definitely not a working thing ☹

[28-Feb-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

hell easy

[28-Feb-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to copy text from terminal. do `ctrl+z` to zoom then `ctrl+m` to toggle mouse on and off.

[28-Feb-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it increases productivty a lot if you use it even resonably well ... took a while to learn but Im glad I started with it.

Still got fails on CFEK, they all came at once from 4-5am my time, and has been working perfectly since. My mum is visiting tonight, might have a few hours to get some logging sorted out this arvo. Got some ideas of what to try. Definatly a missing MoMoM hash same problem as we experanced the first time we tested and debugged these.

[01-Mar-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wondering if its possible to just poll KMD for the missing hash 😂

[01-Mar-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess not practical at all though as everyone would need a full KMD node to run all cliuster chains lol

[01-Mar-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what changed

[01-Mar-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
man we need better version control, this kind of shit can't happen again

[01-Mar-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
debugged a feature for months, got it solid and starting working on other things

[01-Mar-19 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
~2 months later we come back to it and realize we broke it along the way

[01-Mar-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
only way is to retest with each update and when it breaks to fix it

[01-Mar-19 06:18 AM] Alright#0419
This is what I wanted to try, but joker is convinced it's impractical

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
or weekly

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I debugged this before, and I have a fairly good idea of what is happening

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that before it wasnt 100% fixed

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
yes idea was to do 8 chains, 2 per week for the last month

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
if that doesn't work, move another month back

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it fixed some, but not all the cases

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
likely

[01-Mar-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure why buyt every failed import has the exact same payouts hash ... this seems very strange

[01-Mar-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
same payouts hash? those should be unique, shouldnt they? maybe the migrate script is broken?

[01-Mar-19 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking something like that, very weird that the payouts hash is the same for litterally evey single one... even more strange is that it gets all the way to the import stage before failing... It specidically checks payouts hash is valid many steps before this

[01-Mar-19 06:22 AM] Alright#0419
What does payouts represent?

[01-Mar-19 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I actually am not sure what it is, going to have a read of more code now and try to understand hwo this can happen. I dont think its actually a missing MoMoM hash ... Trying to work out how to loop the wentire chains notarizations and print out evey MoMoM hash on the chain to see if the hash its looking for is there, but will investigate theis payouts thing first. I need to print the payouts hash for migrates that are working and see if every migrate is using the same payouts, or its just the ones that fail that have this `0100e1f505000000001976a914ffe823a6ff0f3eca049e2964f7758c668862bc6388ac` as payout hash.

[01-Mar-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Something seems broken for payouts, it appears that the same hash is being generated on litterally all exports.

[01-Mar-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if this is the problem causing them to fail though 😦

[01-Mar-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`ret.push_back(Pair("payouts", HexStr(E_MARSHAL(ss << tx.vout))));`

[01-Mar-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how is it possible that this is producing the same hash every time ?

[01-Mar-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[01-Mar-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the tx.vout is the same for all your tx?

[01-Mar-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
dimxy is familiar with that code

[01-Mar-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool will work with him on this. I dont quite understand what the MARSHAL does yet. not sure how tx.vout is the same for everything....

[01-Mar-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810

@LabsAssistant 
Please update, we are switching CFEKDIMXY cluster to its own branch for development of tokens. I think I have fixed the build issues so it will now build with start.sh. Please let me know if this doesnt work for you. Appears to be working for me here. But getting the cclib stuff to play nice with automation scripts isnt easy.

[01-Mar-19 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
git pull StakedNotary and do `start.sh` then let me know if that does not work.

makecclib relies on user running it from src/cc I think

[01-Mar-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does... I ran it manuyally and it worked, when I changed build.sh to use it instead of makerogue it seems to have broken it. Fixing, just wait a few mins
