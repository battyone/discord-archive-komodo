` Running verushash11 miner with 845 transactions in block`

[05-May-19 02:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure I fully get the rules... but seems top 4000 addresses are in the running? and getsnapshot doesnt even see 4000 addresses total....

[05-May-19 02:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so why ot create 4000 addresses :troll:

[05-May-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of., the maximum tx size is 1 input 3999 outputs, so the range saved cannot be higher than that, because the tx would never be able to be sent, effectivly burning the coins

[05-May-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems the release worked as expected. Yes ifd nobodyt else is going to split their balacen, just creating 4000 address would be the easiest way to victory.

There are really n0o rules, the whoel thing is blockchain enforced, you will figure out the ruiles just by playing it. üòâ

[05-May-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly need to add a few things I think, playing with the currently avalible data set is a bit difficult

[05-May-19 02:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
seems goal is to have as many addresses as possible clustered around #2000 on richlist yeah?

[05-May-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say that is a very good stategy

[05-May-19 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the centre address will alwyas get something... its just cutting off the list top and bottom randomly

nice! if you do `getsnapshot -1` it gives the snapshot that is used for the `paymentsrelease` RPC

[05-May-19 02:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had to teak the splittoaddress script tho, it was spamming utxos beyond capability of those number

[05-May-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to add the range paid to something... As currently its only avalible in a print out when snapshot happens... and I missed that and dont have enough bash isitory to scroll back on this node.

[05-May-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes those wscripts were extremly rushed out, just needed to get something working before the snapshot happened. Seems most players never split anyway

thought I'd not be greedy, and leave a gap of 762 other addresses for the rest of the 4K

[05-May-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I expect once we have some scripts to manage this, there will be a shit tonne of tx for peopel constantly fighting to be in the range..

[05-May-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of this will need to be automated to have any chance... This si definatly a game bots will dominate

[05-May-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im thinking it may be best to have 1 address with most of your balance maybe, and then every few blocks, do a snapshot calculate your ranks and then send some of this balance to addresses that neec extra to get them back in the range or something... Still many details to work out.

[05-May-19 02:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
each address in range gets equal  payout?

[05-May-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, the balance is relevant only for rich list rank, each address paid receives equal shares

[05-May-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only for this mode of operation... normal airdrop would allocvate based on balance % of total

[05-May-19 02:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe generate 1,00,000,000 addresses, then you can push average to your preferred range at any time :troll:

[05-May-19 02:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
set 4k to be in range, and fill/empty the rest to fudge the average

[05-May-19 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL.... it would be a good test of the current back end stuff to generate a absolutly stupid number of address/utxos... at some point the DB it scans each day would be so large it could take munites to do the snapshot. I already worked out how to have real time balance tracking, even after a node restart, but I wanted to get everything working with the current system first.

[05-May-19 02:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`getrawmempool | jq length == 100,000,000`

[05-May-19 02:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, trick is `will tx be accepted before snapshot?`

[05-May-19 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... I wanted to make longer block times to stop people making crazy amounts of tx every minute... but verushash doesn t work with ac_blocktime... 
The snapshot height is actually an unknown variable until it happens, well within about 10 blocks... but notarizations dont always happen every 10 blocks either so it could be 20 or even 30 blocks before the 1440 multiple each day.

[05-May-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok now we can get the range paid before doing the release. Once the snapshot happens, you can call payments info to see what range was chosen. Then getsnapshot to find your address ranks. You cant move the coins to get them into the range, but you can issue a release to your advantage. ie, if you have many address i the range release as much as possible, if you have very few try to release the smallest amount (5M) before someone else releases it all.

[05-May-19 03:38 AM] gcharang#6833
> before someone else releases it all.

Not nitpicking, but isn't this kinda un enforceable? who ever mines the block can control which transaction will get through(if there are any competing release transactions)

[05-May-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure, but then that person has to mine a longer chain also, or it will be rorged  üòâ

[05-May-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something like, make release you want, then hitting the chain with 100 CPUS at once to make sure your release is the one included in the chain would be a stragegy one could use üòÜ

There are many zero balances addresses when `getsnapshot`. Does your algo take them into account when determining the range?

[05-May-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should filter them I think, if u update those should stop displaying.

[05-May-19 08:02 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[05-May-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The daily snapshot defiantly filters 0 balance address... The RPC didn't for a short time, due to a bug. I'm 99% sure its now fixed.

[05-May-19 08:03 AM] zatJUM#9924
So there are only 1747 addresses actually.

[05-May-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most people are yet to even split. I guess they are waiting for more clear instructions or they just are not playing. I'll spend some time on this the next day or 2, hopefully finish it all off.

[05-May-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-May-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did 128, bnut I think I stuffed it up later on. Going to consolidate them back at some point soon.

[05-May-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
