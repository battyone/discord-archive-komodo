I can check for things like that and will ask you.

[24-Feb-19 12:31 PM] CrisF#3405
`rpetty hard to get all that down in a logical order`  Yeah, that's why no one wanted/could do it, haha.

[24-Feb-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah im really happy i wrote so many comments in my code when making it... or I dont think that would ahve been possible üòÜ

[24-Feb-19 12:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, good habit.

Hey man, I changed the style/wording on the NN page a fair bit. No change to details I think.
Is this ok?

`Komodo seeds are disabled for staked chains` what does this mean on tech page?

[24-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
good work @blackjok3r @CrisF

Hi @Alright, If you have a chance could you have a quick look through the webpage?  It still needed some checking for technical accuracy etc.  The FAQ page in particular is very outdated.  Still info from September, haha.  There  are still areas that could use some more content too, if anything comes to mind.

will look at the rest when I have a moment

[24-Feb-19 09:13 PM] CrisF#3405
Great, thanks üòÉ  Just saw your message.

[24-Feb-19 09:15 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll change the wording a bit on Technical today and start on others.

[25-Feb-19 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
New chain added `LABSTH0` its a zero block reward. In the same cluster as LABSTH. For testing migrates. No worries if you cant test migrate, just add the chain so its being notarized please.

Restarted - komodo will take a while but should be up in 15 or so. I will check when I'm out of the car. Should be able to run some migrates but not for 12 hours.

[25-Feb-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries. not 100% if the python script actaull logs fails... I need to check that should be done by 12H

will need a PR for whatever changes are needed to make the crosschain imports work

[25-Feb-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I will be working on  very large PR, I was goign to do that today but the musig took up most of my time.

[25-Feb-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
upstream has most of the needed changes, but I think I found a and fixed a few bugs afteer sapling that are not pushed yet.

[25-Feb-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the only way to know for sure it to use mainstream komodo to run some chains? or just a version with only the notary difference

[25-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just to change the pubkeys and nothing else, is in itself a large change

[25-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to MoMoM that is

[25-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for dpow it was a few line of code

[25-Feb-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I;m still not exactly sure how to merge all our bug fixes down. Will have a think about it.

[25-Feb-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing a git diff will be a good start and going through that.

[25-Feb-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a totally free day tomorrow, will work in this then

[25-Feb-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly want to get everything you need down before LABS launches. And ac_notarypay cant really be merged down, being the largest change we have. I might ba able to get a master commit before I started on that.

[25-Feb-19 10:17 AM] zatJUM#9924
I still have ```rpc/misc.cpp: In function ‚Äòint32_t getera(int)‚Äô:

[25-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its 100% definatly pushed

[25-Feb-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just tried to push it again... maybe git is playing up

[25-Feb-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
git pull maybe? manually try it?

[25-Feb-19 10:24 AM] zatJUM#9924
```$ git pull
Already up to date.```

[25-Feb-19 10:25 AM] zatJUM#9924
Deleted ~/komodo to use ~/StakedNotary/install/buildkomodo.sh script, but still fails at same point

[25-Feb-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think that needs to be run 3 times to build

[25-Feb-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats from upstream, nothing I cna do to fix it. Once you get it to build the first time, it then works

[25-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if the `buildkomodo.sh` script ahs failed

[25-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`cd ~/komodo`
`./zcutil/build.sh`

[25-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then keep doing build.sh until it passes

[25-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless something else has been broken that is

[25-Feb-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also pushed update to start.sh for the `KMD failed to start` Pretty sure it wasnt detecting that it stopped first.

[25-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Updated OK here - but I did run a make clean and a manual build.sh

@CHMEX that was for LABSTH0 and I hadn't even had it running at that time, so 0 is accurate

I'll be mostly offline for the next day or 2, I have 3 projects I need to finalize so I can stop being torn in so many directions
if anything urgent pops up, just ignore my node/results
will check in once a day or so, to be sure I'm not too far behind...

And komodod has compiled, at last

[26-Feb-19 12:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds like you faced a git issue, unles someone else fixed it Buecause I just got home and have not been here for 12H+ üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
joker and I started notarizing LABSTH0 at the exact same time, basically have an identical setup

[26-Feb-19 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
I have more than twice as many notarizations seemingly from location alone

[26-Feb-19 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
:/

[26-Feb-19 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep. It does that... The solution is move all nodes to EU, or move some nodes out of EU. Either one will achaeive the same result.

[26-Feb-19 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wont be moving my node unless its clear im under 25% of average.

[26-Feb-19 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the more chains we get and the more nodes there are, the less of an issue it should be.

[26-Feb-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent had any nota on DIXMY2 for liike 22h ? I see blocks comming just fine though anyone else seeing this, or has my node killed itself ?

[26-Feb-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like its ok actually... just my node.. wonder whats up with it... very strange

[26-Feb-19 07:38 AM] dimxy#2587
Hi,
I'm now receiving 'connect() to 195.201.137.5:62104 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)' on my CFEKDIMXY1
And seems do not receive notas

[26-Feb-19 07:38 AM] dimxy#2587
could it be because of my node ip add has changed?

[26-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those connect refused are generally nothing to worry about...

[26-Feb-19 07:39 AM] dimxy#2587
ok

[26-Feb-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is as i was told, is that nodes are defult to listen=1 but are behind NAT and so advertise their IP but it is unreachable

[26-Feb-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it can also mena the node banned you or is down.

[26-Feb-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will check out your chains now I see a couple of very strange things on my end here.

[26-Feb-19 07:41 AM] dimxy#2587
ok I ve just received a nota, seems it is okay now

[26-Feb-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I think maybe mine is notary related.. its reporting notarized chain but iguana seems to think its never been notarized lol

Will try each chain individually.

[26-Feb-19 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
i've had those troubles too; seems you can't import privkey properly with fiat-cli or assets-cli

[26-Feb-19 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
someone posted a solution once, but i forgot what it was

[26-Feb-19 10:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, thanks @jorian.  Didn't see that.  I'll do a search if importing manually doesn't work.

[26-Feb-19 10:57 AM] jorian#4555
yes, just use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME importprivkey`

{Reactions}

[26-Feb-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh should import the key unless something broke. Will check this after im finished what Im doing.

[26-Feb-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Possible solution to notarizatio gap is to to not enforce any notarization sorting... Just pick whatever it sees. Due to the PR to upstream I will have alot to mess with here just focusing on getting that merged then merge it back down and check everything still works, then we will all need to update before I test migrates again. There was definatly a MoMoM hash simply missing from the LABSTH0 chain. I really hope this isn't something worse than what I think it is. It seems if notarization is in mempool for too long it just never gets mined. I tried to scan up to 150 blocks for this MoMoM hash and it returned nothing.

[26-Feb-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
its the silly expiration time field. maybe we should default to set that to expire after many hours?

[26-Feb-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for ntoarizations it does need to be set for sure for a long time.
