so does everything smk made

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs another url that pulls form oracle

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never got onto that... got distracted

[23-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
Yea meant to work on that also, will add to trello

[23-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
I'd rather have a bootstrap from chain option

[23-Oct-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need both man... NEED

[23-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
pushing new assetchains.json won't work if it throws errors over it when you git pull

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
will just break every script that does git pull

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well the only way to force this to get fixed it to remove the assetchains.json from git

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will break like 50% of the scrips but

[23-Oct-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
can just ignore it

[23-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
how does that break *any* script if we have a script that grabs latest assetchains.json before doing anything else

[23-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man ... every script smk made curls the json from git into a variable.. it doesnt load it locally

[23-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can change that .. but need to go through evey one and fix it

[23-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
does it do that while STAKEDB1 isn't running at some point

[23-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they just always use this command:
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json 2>/dev/null`

[23-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
it can grab it locally instead maybe?

[23-Oct-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
or directly from oraclesdata calls

[23-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can grab it locally... but I need to change them ALL

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I dot have access to his repos

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like the pool and such

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
I don't mind doing it

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
adding to trello

[23-Oct-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool... I still have lots fo work on streamer to do

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can sort it... just remove it from git, then search all the scripts in every repo

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you need a backup source incase STAKEDB! isnt runing where ever he script is

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for notary nodes, just have it `cat assetchains.json`

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
bootstrap script

[23-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
sync STAKEDB1, grab latest, stop daemon

[23-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
B1 is the largest chain we have ... maybe we need to actually lauch STAKED

[23-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and just not add any chains to its cluster until momom is fixed

[23-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
keep testnet in seperate cluster for testing ...

[23-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and use STAKED for all the oracels n shit

[23-Oct-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
STAKED would eventually become the largest chain though

[23-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
can always just change where we grab info from

[23-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it would... bu by then we would have url fetch done, and posibly other ways

[23-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just for random things, likely 90% of the time, it would be grabbed from the chain

[23-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
I'm down to spin up STAKED relatively soon

{Reactions}
👍 

[23-Oct-18 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
in it's own cluster for the time being

[23-Oct-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, if we start it... there is so many people keep asking lol

[23-Oct-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just cannot have clusters until we figure out momom

[23-Oct-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least on that chain anwyay...

[23-Oct-18 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
atill pay staked to start chains not n cluster and have dpow

[23-Oct-18 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[23-Oct-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when I ran stop.sh first, blackjok3r branch compiled

[23-Oct-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder what it was.

[23-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana is not started

[23-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
I realize

[23-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[23-Oct-18 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
start.sh should start it, no

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Alright#0419
?

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
go to the

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try just running `./start_iguana.sh`

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and doing crtl+c just after it starts

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see if it says anyhting

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana does not pipe to /dev/null

[23-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should say something

[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] CMaurice#1685
We good to oraclefetch?

[23-Oct-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah man... I also put the json into git

[23-Oct-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can `./oraclefetch.sh` 
`./stop.sh`

[23-Oct-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./start.sh`

[23-Oct-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont oracle fetch it should still work, we need to get that oracle fixed.

[23-Oct-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now it works, but its not intergrated with everything else

[23-Oct-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
annoying ...

👌 

[23-Oct-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no hurry the new chains are notarising already.

[23-Oct-18 07:39 AM] CMaurice#1685
Righty ho, thanks

[23-Oct-18 07:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
Looks to be good, might be an idea to give admin an option to `git stash`, or not

[23-Oct-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm if there is anything there it would fail git pull on StakedNotary (which is only did to fetch assetchains.json) so that will be removed when the oracle is intergrated.

[23-Oct-18 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
updating now

[23-Oct-18 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can easil;y change where assetchains.json comes from. Set it up like that early on so if on wrong branch all good. now that branch management is coded in, no longer need to be that way

[23-Oct-18 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
one thing tho. is assetchains.json in the StakedNotary repo? Will non notarie s have to clone that too?

[23-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its stored in STAKEDB1

[23-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in an oracle

{Reactions}
🙀 (2) 

[23-Oct-18 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cos pool failed without it. I'm still tryna get it up

[23-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which makes it difficult

[23-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I keep telling alright we need a mirror copy somehwer else that cna be fetched via URL

[23-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So far once he pushes it, I have been pushign ti to git where it was before .. just so that everyting else works

[23-Oct-18 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can oracle curl post is to somewhere? or is an rpc call able to read it?

[23-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look at `oraclefetch.sh` in the StakedNotary repo

[23-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i am not 100% sure how it fetches it

[23-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What we need is a or a few notary nodes to push it somehere

[23-Oct-18 09:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
great work on the stream btw :rum:

[23-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
othersie you need to sync a blockchain to get the params for a blockchain 🤣

[23-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT we are thinking on launching the staked chain (main chain) soon ... so we cna get more community intrest.

[23-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if momom isnt ready we just dont add any chains to its cluster until it is

[23-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think then, we have a permanant chain, and the staked assetchains.json cna e put in that.

and just pull again

[23-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I uploaded the correct json into git repo

[23-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
earlier on, to get it into my momom test VM

[23-Oct-18 09:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
i hate when git give me the `I'm sorry Dave...` messages

[23-Oct-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha

[23-Oct-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only way to fix all that, is to remove assetchains.json from git all together... but htat breaks my momom testing VM and the pool

[23-Oct-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its not really an option iuntil we have somethig else set up

[23-Oct-18 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant script in telling git to do as it's told?
