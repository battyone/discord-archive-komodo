If you're the 21st, you'll have first dibs on a spot if someone is removed for not notarizing in testnet

[14-Nov-18 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need community members for rest of the nodes?
may be reserve some for dev nodes like there are some in kmd notary network?

[14-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Alright#0419
Joker and I will be running for KMD notary election and pledging 50% of mining rewards to STAKED dev fund/notarizations

[14-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Alright#0419
I believe smk and Cris said they would run and pledge some % as well

to be clear, the 20 notary cap may change in the future. The reason it's 20 is because everything 5th notary added adds an additional sig to min sigs

OK - completely daft question.
Been running CFEK et al on one server from the Staked repo and have coins on all CFEK*** chains.
Just started my Stakednotary server start.sh with the pub/wif/Radd in the config.ini
Should the script import the address and so show balances on the notary server?

@Bar_F1sh_Rel start will import it to all chains

[14-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
@IndieBlock We had a little basic write up of what STAKED actually is, let me try to find it

[14-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
but to oversimplify it, it's just lab for incentivizing people to test contracts

[14-Nov-18 09:57 PM] Alright#0419
we have a fungible cluster(one coin, many blockchains) so a dev can spin up a new asset chain with new contract, if there's a problem in the contract, no need to hard fork, just kill the chain and start another

[14-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@Alright - Thats what I figured - and why I was confused when the notary node addresses are empty (but look synced).

[14-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean empty?

[14-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
```StakedNotary$ ./massets-cli getbalance

[14-Nov-18 10:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
of all the KMD things going on, that are not directly spear-headed by jl777, STAKED is the most technically interesting. It's solving really interesting things, and many features of STAKED end up improving KMD and all asset chains

[14-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel you likely never got funded

Sorry, what's the problem?

[14-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Staked is my non-notary playground - has balance, Stakednotary is my notary VPS - one full one empty, both same address

[14-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
Ahh

[14-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
can you check that you aren't forked?

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
it sounds more like the address isn't imported

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
./stop.sh then ./start.sh might fix it

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
wait a bit after ./stop.sh

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
like keep running ./stop.sh until all daemons don't respond

[14-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK

[14-Nov-18 10:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
sorted - All CFEK### chains have a balance
How much do I need in KMD to keep me going for a while?

[14-Nov-18 10:49 PM] CrisF#3405
Not much KMD needed @Bar_F1sh_Rel .

[14-Nov-18 10:50 PM] CrisF#3405
I recently added 1 from my tipbot account and expect it to last fo a while.

[14-Nov-18 10:50 PM] CrisF#3405
A coupke of weeks anyhow.

[14-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I just tried that - but for some odd reason the amount is not arriving - need to troubleshoot a bit!

[14-Nov-18 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
check the debug.log of one of the chains and post latest block hash

[14-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
like this? ```komodo-cli getbestblockhash
08bab6eec0210cf02ea7d2db1e6e9bee027e43a2dfd9a29f1f25bf10e41cb241```

[14-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
yea that'll work

[14-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
do that on one of the CFEK chains and post here

[14-Nov-18 11:04 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
```./asset-cli CFEK getbestblockhash
0093275cc4575fa8903dcaf04cc72182d62bc2ebf74ece1a87efaf1143dfe820```

[14-Nov-18 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
one moment

[14-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
yea you're on the correct chain

[14-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
you must not have address imported

[14-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
try `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK importprivkey <WIF>`

[14-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
does balance show up?

[14-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
it'll reindex first

[14-Nov-18 11:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have balances on CFEK et al now - it's kMD I have issues with

```0093275cc4575fa8903dcaf04cc72182d62bc2ebf74ece1a87efaf1143dfe820```

[14-Nov-18 11:09 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I also know the address is imported - as it will dump the privkey

[14-Nov-18 11:10 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
and the address has a balance on the explorer

he was just up for like 24 hours straight, told him to worry about it tomorrow

Just trying to make sure I don't miss the testnet notarisation.

[14-Nov-18 11:24 PM] CrisF#3405
I think that was only for currently registered people  who haven't made a notarization.  Did you send your pubkey to Alright, @Bar_F1sh_Rel ?

[14-Nov-18 11:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
All sent and in .cpp as far as I am aware - but this is the first time firing up the node and iguana, so no notarisations as yet

[14-Nov-18 11:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Blackjok3r should be around in a while.  He often wakes up with a solution.

[14-Nov-18 11:41 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

Cool.. There is definatly porblema and bugs in master lol

[15-Nov-18 12:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to keep track of things that go wrong and put them down on the trello

[15-Nov-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It sounds like the validate address script wasn't working normally

[15-Nov-18 12:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was messing with that weeks ago to try and male it not reacan the whole chain, maybe I didn't revert it right

[15-Nov-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Importing a used noraty private key takes an eternity

[15-Nov-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a fairly good idea of how to fix it, but I think its best to recommend that new nodes sync kmd from scratch with start.sh that way the piv key is imported before the chain syncs.

[15-Nov-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once synced the wallet cleaner can handle it...

[15-Nov-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which hopefully I get time to recode today, I know exactly how to do it now, worked it out yesterday just needs to be written

[15-Nov-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sadly I'm heading to the city tomorrow night so won't get anything done this weekend

[15-Nov-18 12:18 AM] CMaurice#1685
Oh, I imported a privkey earlier with scan, went out, came back... it errored but validateaddress fine

[15-Nov-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will usually give a timeout

[15-Nov-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To the CLI

[15-Nov-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To track progress you need to watch debug.log

[15-Nov-18 12:20 AM] CMaurice#1685
Yeah, that was it
