same for dust, pixy, ded and ccp. Perc never worked cos it was too perky.

[25-Oct-18 09:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
B1, W1 and ARB are ok.

[25-Oct-18 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
using `staked-cli getblocktemplate` returns same error on same coins

[25-Oct-18 09:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
other cli calls I've tried work for all chains

3 seperate streams each of 2MB of data repeated 11 times each

[25-Oct-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`getdatafromblock` RPC is working just about perfectly.

you can even call it out of order on any block. The function got complicated after adding onto it for a couple of days.

[25-Oct-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I saved having to track things on sync...

[25-Oct-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 1 RPC call dos everything

Last thing to verify is the 3 lots of data I sent are received exactly as sent... I cant see why they wont be, as early tests on the splitting algos etc all lined up and data cannot get lost in a blockchain.

[25-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mate just called me, hes in town for his bday so will be heading out ... 
Not aure whats up with that pool. the errors look like the RPC info is wrong maybe ?

[25-Oct-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
example output of RPC using `false` so there is no hex string:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST2 getdatafromblock 140 false
{
  "streamid": "test2",
  "firsttxid": "fb0d0daa13dfb481a4018fe74137ca513eb5b2e52e0b154d66b1baee6fd7e4aa",
  "firstblockheight": 137,
  "firstseqid": 718,
  "lastseqid": 956
}
```

[25-Oct-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess next step here is to make a python dAPP to tie it all together so you can send a file and reassemble it back into a file as its being received via blocknotify.

[25-Oct-18 10:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well I got 3 acs up to mine, can migrate from there as needed. will dig into the rest later

[25-Oct-18 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, all good with notarizations?  Seems I haven't been getting any for the last 10 hours and only see s others in recvmask.

[25-Oct-18 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright @blackjok3r  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  @CMaurice

[25-Oct-18 12:21 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll re-start and see how that goes.

[25-Oct-18 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Almost immediately after restart got o KMD and ARB notarization.

[25-Oct-18 12:42 PM] CMaurice#1685
Notarizing here

[25-Oct-18 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks @CMaurice .  I've had a couple more.  re-start seems to have sorted things out.

[25-Oct-18 12:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
Doesn't say to which chains on my output, out of interest which scripts are you using @CrisF ?

[25-Oct-18 01:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I have a couple.  Sent in dm.

[25-Oct-18 01:17 PM] CMaurice#1685
Useful, thanks

[25-Oct-18 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I'd like to use the streamer to write full block hexs of each notarized chain to specific chain

[25-Oct-18 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
this way, we won't end up in a situation where we cannot find a chain because no one has a copy of it

[25-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
need to figure out how large that chain would get though

[25-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
good news is that hardly anyone would need to run a node for it

[26-Oct-18 12:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
Trying to catch up on all the things ive missed...

[26-Oct-18 12:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
@Alright i saw you asked about a use case for a chain with on demand blocks and no rewards... I brought this up before one night

[26-Oct-18 12:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
Using multiple chains to store single records sets of specfic data to a unique chain like how a database is structured in tables for certain record types.

[26-Oct-18 12:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
Example is Point of Sale retail data

[26-Oct-18 12:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
its transactional

[26-Oct-18 12:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
One write command of multiple tables/chains of data like CUSTINFO, ITEMINFO, REQUESTEDDELIVERYDATE, ACCOUNTRECEIVABLES, PURCHASEORDERDETAILS etc etc

[26-Oct-18 12:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
When our system writes a sale it touches no less than 12 MSSQL tables and then at least 8 tables in an older parent DB that maintains Accounting Ledgers

[26-Oct-18 12:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
The use case would be a super lightweight hardware footprint that could be placed in every store to cache and relay the singular purchase transactions to the different chains so other services could run their own node anywhere they want and with proper keys to decrypt the data, parse it and use it for whatever other tasks or 3rd party service providers

[26-Oct-18 12:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
Making it a super light weight way to replicate and distribute the data and have a guaranteed backup of that data

[26-Oct-18 12:58 AM] daemonfox#6136
It would also make it super compatible to any frontend just passing the needed JSON and on demand block creation features

[26-Oct-18 01:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
and this method could utilize CCs to accomplish most if not all of the work like a set of stored procedures in MSSQL.

[26-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you could use the streamer for that

[26-Oct-18 01:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
i dont understand the streamer stuff yet ive been gone to long...

[26-Oct-18 01:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
too*

[26-Oct-18 01:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
but im trying to catch up

[26-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically its a chain that uses acpubkey

[26-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And only the acpubkey can mine it

[26-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
On demand blocks

[26-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Block time can be a low as a couple of seconds

[26-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can put any data as a hexsyring into it and fetch all the data per block

[26-Oct-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty mad

[26-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what do you think of a streamer chain that saves all block data from every STAKED chain

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[26-Oct-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
so we don't have to worry about backing up chains after we've stopped using them

[26-Oct-18 01:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
@blackjok3r ok that sounds EXACTLY like what id be looking for

[26-Oct-18 01:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
the hex data can only be read in plain text by the privkey holder correct?

[26-Oct-18 01:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
thats the lynch pin for this idea in my scope

[26-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
if you encrypt it sure

[26-Oct-18 01:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
keeping the data private if someone stumbles on the chains

[26-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
not encrypted by default

[26-Oct-18 01:23 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok but the option is there and in RPC calls the frontend UI can enforce it

[26-Oct-18 01:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
i need to brush up on java and make a slick app UI to capture the data I know I want and see streams handles it

[26-Oct-18 01:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
I have the data model

[26-Oct-18 01:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
I know what I want the end result to be so its a matter of tweaking what is here

[26-Oct-18 01:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
Has anyone here tried using ClearLinux for any nodes?

[26-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK the only issiue I see is the way that the data is saved

[26-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a TxBlaster that has a setable timout

[26-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently you can only stream 1 file at a time using it

[26-Oct-18 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
how fast can you stream data?

[26-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2MB every couple of seconds

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe faster if you sent it in larger chunks

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
well that 2mb includes the block and txs

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
yes?

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you send 2MB to the marketmaker

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
so why 2mb a second?

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it floods tx

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just what I tried so far

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
every couple of*

[26-Oct-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try 10MB a second today and see if it works

[26-Oct-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It has a sleep, of 1s every 1s until it sees data then it sends it

[26-Oct-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each time you send data RPC to add to queue

[26-Oct-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as its added it sends the whole lot

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the limitation is, that you can only send 1 stream at a time

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ts single threaded

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
saving each chain in real time, would simply not work

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
so if what you're streaming is larger than block size, it streams it all at once then 2mb is confirmed at a time?

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will just stay in mempool

[26-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each block has 241 txs

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with 8kb chunk in each

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But pulling all the txs was too slow

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
is it confirmed in order?

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So I made an rpc that connects all the data togeter in a block and returns it as 1 peice

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each tx takes the change of the last tx

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so they have to be in order

[26-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so far nothig has been out of order

[26-Oct-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is an error check for that

[26-Oct-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its never activated so far
