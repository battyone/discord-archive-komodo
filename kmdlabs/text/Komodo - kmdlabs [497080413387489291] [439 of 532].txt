FYI, warning about using Graviex in PIRATE channel. `https://discordapp.com/channels/512188534111862784/512188534111862786/593781079945510942` ```Please do not use Graviex for ARRR deposit or withdrawal until they fix their issues with their internal system. In the past few days we received many reports from our pirates, that Graviex has not credited their deposits, or has not sent out withdrawals, claiming they did, but there is "no way to check it." Latter is not true, but we can not help them with their internal system, they received all the technical help they need from us to resolve the issues. Until further notice, refrain using Graviex for trading ARRR.```

[27-Jun-19 01:03 PM] CrisF#3405
They list LABS also.

[27-Jun-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, it's isolated to pirate because it seems almost no exchange wants to properly use the infrastructure they actually need for z txes

[27-Jun-19 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
one idea was to create a T-Only chain something like ARRRT ( tether)
with which it will be possible to exchange for the real ARRR whenever you want. the stores and CEX who have problem with z_support can implement that ARRRT

[27-Jun-19 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
but it's also not ideal

[27-Jun-19 01:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes sure and with sapling pirate now even was fullviewing keys irc  which are more useful than incoming viewingkeys 
I think the main problem they have is that a trx can have several notes and somehow they don't process that correctly. also the more deposits you get the longer it takes to process even on a powerfull machine

[27-Jun-19 01:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
oups yes qwertz keyboard

[27-Jun-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`better deposit/withdrawal mechanism must be developed`
It takes the resources that it takes; sapling made it measurably better than sprout, but physical limitations are real 🤷🏽

[27-Jun-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't stuff 12 pounds of shit into a 2 pound sack

[27-Jun-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, when you figure out how to make z txes take less physical resources to process, be sure to let the rest of us in on your secret...

[28-Jun-19 06:49 PM] phm87#7395
I was searching to know the notarization stats of KMDLabs main cluster. On the website https://kmdlabs.com/statistics/ there is a link to http://oracle.earth/ntx_graph/ and if clic on it, error is displayed:
```A server error occurred.  Please contact the administrator.```

Thanks, @phm87  and @zatJUM 👍 
I don't actually have any statistic to put up so I'll take the page down for now.  IF you have any suggestions on what to put there I'll see about getting it up.
Please let me know if you find anything else.

[28-Jun-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
I have a suggestion/question : recently, on this channel, someone posted the nb of notarization for each KMDLabs NN (and mylo node that I am using had began to notarize), can you tell me what is the command or script to get this output ? Later, we can display it on the website maybe (or another website if it is better)

[28-Jun-19 11:12 PM] phm87#7395
maybe it was CHMEX who posted these nb of notas per kmdlabs NN

[28-Jun-19 11:13 PM] phm87#7395

How do you launch it ? I had to stop the script

[28-Jun-19 11:17 PM] phm87#7395
just stats.py without parameters ?

[28-Jun-19 11:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it will as a few questions then.

[28-Jun-19 11:18 PM] CrisF#3405
It only has data for LABS at the moment.

[28-Jun-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
It takes a little time from block zero.

[28-Jun-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
It is working though.

I put 30 LABS at the beginning but now, there are 421 LABS ... do you know if these LABS are rewards for the notarizations that I did ? Or is it something else ?

[29-Jun-19 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes you are paid per notrization

{Reactions}
👌 labs1 (2) 

[29-Jun-19 01:20 AM] phm87#7395
but 1 LABS per nota it seems, I didn't expect so many coins, that's generous

[29-Jun-19 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not really that much, its just that min sigs is still quite low.

[29-Jun-19 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As more nodes are added, the amount per nota will be shared over more nodes and it will go down.

[29-Jun-19 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was a tough balance to get right, we need notaries to be more profitable than staking, otherwise they have no incentive to do their job

[29-Jun-19 01:24 AM] phm87#7395
``notaries to be more profitable than staking``
I think that it is difficult to compare ... staking is buying or mining coins then stake them while operate KMDLabs setup is different. If the notarization rewards pay the server where it run, it is good I think

[29-Jun-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we got it pretty close, no changing it now in any case lol

[29-Jun-19 01:25 AM] phm87#7395
I mean that the KMDLabs NN op doesn't need to invest funds into buying sth (and price can drop) while a server can be rented

[29-Jun-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes notary has pretty low costs for now... As we have only 3 chains, and I htink 2 of them are totally broken. I really hope we can sort this out after the KMD fork is over.

[29-Jun-19 01:32 AM] phm87#7395
For future "marketing" purposes, can we try to have some data and create charts (I don't ask you to create script to create data but if you extract some data for any purposes, try to keep it, we can make charts that can be way more readable than numbers). About data, I mean everything : nota per AC, nota per KMDLabs NN node, staking over time, difficulty, price, geoloc of KMDLabs NN nodes, ask each op to execute mrlynch ping's script - thank you @mrlynch  btw - , rich list evolution over time, ...

[29-Jun-19 01:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, we have discussed various stats that we can add.  Things have gotten quite busy so nothing passed the disscusion phase yet.

[29-Jun-19 01:37 AM] CrisF#3405
At some point I'd like to create a `stats module` (stats chain, oracle, charts, etc) that projects can plug into their project and use/mod as they need.

[29-Jun-19 01:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Would make the same for Labs to test and use as a POC and marketting.

[29-Jun-19 02:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Thanks  for the pings about oracle.earth
I've had to change some stuff due to changes in the way oracles work, and updates are not completed yet. Been ultra busy since Agama situation and prep for hardfork and other KMD updates so haven't had much time for oracle.earth over the last few weeks 😦

[29-Jun-19 02:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[29-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just checking - the current transaction fee (default) in LABS is 0.00005 
Can someone point me to the  code or option where the LABS dust level is set??

[29-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel what do you mean dust level?

[29-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
`-minrelaytxfee=<amount in coins>` as a startup param will make your node accept and relay <0.00005 tx fee txes

[29-Jun-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the lowest tx fee is whateve number individual nodes will take

[29-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
so `-minrelaytxfee=0.00000001` for 1 sat

[29-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Not sure if it is the same for KMD and asset chains - but in other zcash derivatives there is a hard-coded mintxfee that sets the dust level
Anything below the dust level is considered to be 'free' (ie the same as setting zero fee) - then there is a limit in kB transactions per block that can have zero fee (and so below dust level).
I can't see ``-minrelaytxfee`` in the LABS startup params - so it has to be hardcoded somewhere?

[29-Jun-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a hard-coded mintxfee that sets the dust level`
it's coded as an either/or if/then thing
if not set then use default 
default = whatever is coded
however, you can make it whatever you want

[29-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Sure - it's the `whatever is coded` that I am interested in as *most* (maybe) node operators can't be bothered or know about it to set it (apart from pool ops that is)

[29-Jun-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Jun-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`weird, no notas since 3 blocks ...`
It's almost as if someone wanted to mine the chain 😮

[29-Jun-19 03:53 PM] phm87#7395
Do you know if the walletfilter of blackjok3r was merged to KMDLabs/komodo ?

[29-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Alright#0419

5 blocks not natorized now in a row

[29-Jun-19 03:54 PM] phm87#7395
thank you Alright

[29-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
`5 blocks not natorized now in a row` why is this significant?

[29-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
don't understand

[29-Jun-19 03:56 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if it is significant. But I noticed that all blocks are notarized on http://35.188.117.96:40268/blocks except few last ones

[29-Jun-19 03:56 PM] phm87#7395
but maybe it is normal, I don't know

[29-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel you can change that with `-minrelaytxfee=<amount in coins>` as a startup param

[29-Jun-19 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if your filter shows that there is a notarization tx in every block ever, then your filter is bad

[29-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
iguana will not attempt to create a notarization tx until 5 blocks have past

[29-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
then there is a delay as it's not instantly created

[29-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
10 blocks for every coins besides LABS

[29-Jun-19 03:57 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I thought that when someone mine the chain, the KMDLabs NN still notarize all blocks (regarless of POW, POS) but I don't know exactly

[29-Jun-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, all blocks would be a waste of funds

[29-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
height % 5, iguana will begin to attempt to create a notarization

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] phm87#7395
then why all blocks seems notarized on http://35.188.117.96:40268/blocks except the few last ones ?

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
height % 10 for everything besides LABS chains

[29-Jun-19 03:59 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you Alright, I dodn't know about these rules

[29-Jun-19 05:10 PM] gcharang#6833
@phm87 when a block "is notarized", it means either it or atleast one block above it has been checkpointed into KMD/BTC 
every block will eventually be notarised, but on an average 1 in 10 blocks are checkpointed

[29-Jun-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
it explains the behavior observed thank you @gcharang 
But then, how dpow can protect a chain to have blocks between 2 notas being reverted (before the second nota of course) ? The incentive for the attacher can seems inexisting (because exchanges checks notarisations and confirmations and no deposit should be accepter on an exchange if there is no nota) except for CHIPS where the funding of a channel does not take into account notarizations

[29-Jun-19 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how dpow can protect a chain to have blocks between 2 notas being reverted (before the second nota of course) ?`
the searchbox above will help with confirmations vs rawconfirmations

[29-Jun-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
I understand. I read the difference between confirmations and rawconfirmations. But I think that to fund LN channels chips does not take into account dpow but only normal confirmations

[29-Jun-19 10:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LN channels are off-chain, so what is it that you imagine dpow has to do with that?

[29-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
he's talking about opening a channel, and he has a good point

[29-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
basically, you can't trust anything that is not notarized unless the chain has enough hashrate to secure itself

[29-Jun-19 11:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
guess that's LNs 3rd party job to figure out 😛 :troll:

[29-Jun-19 11:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
may be only allow a peer to establish channels if its deposit transaction is already notarized

[30-Jun-19 03:18 AM] Exile13#4458
i was notarizing, but not in 2 days, i haven't changed anything
