Ducks has a different ccid

[26-Nov-18 11:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Your just burning coins

[26-Nov-18 11:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didn't think that would even let u export. Nice find. Will look I tot this today. More info on failed LF please?

@Bar_F1sh_Rel

[26-Nov-18 11:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It should not be letting you export to a chain with a diff ccid, although the script is probably just assuming that its the same, so is lost likely an issue with the script rather than the migrations them self. The daemon defiantly checks the ccid on export.

[26-Nov-18 11:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Oops

[26-Nov-18 11:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I lost a few coins

[26-Nov-18 11:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
Should just set up a bot for the next test and let Discord run wild with it to help get some bandwidth testing done

[26-Nov-18 11:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
i mean at this point... how hard is a bot to make to do 1:1 MM txes?

[26-Nov-18 11:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doubtful not would keep up, bit never know.. Not sure how it works. The migrates are a special case

[26-Nov-18 11:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
what do i message the bot

[26-Nov-18 11:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
the phrase !kmdtip

[26-Nov-18 11:43 PM] daemonfox#6136

@blackjok3r is the Discord kmdbot code posted somewhere?

[26-Nov-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure

[26-Nov-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@sclear

[26-Nov-18 11:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Migrates work differently though they are a complex process.

[26-Nov-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently we have it working by polling each step until it works... Not the ideal situation if we want to make huge amounts of txs

[26-Nov-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a few ideas there and hopefully get time yo have a play today.

[26-Nov-18 11:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@daemonfox - What you're talking about is in development I think.

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ask @sclear directly.   His bot code is not open source.

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hes a good dude though.

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] daemonfox#6136

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] Exile13#4458
whooo hooo

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Like an Escrow Bot?

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is that what you're asking.

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
kinda yes

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
OTC trade bot / auto escrow situation.

[26-Nov-18 11:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats what MM does right... trustless migrations of funds

[26-Nov-18 11:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He's working on it for Discord. ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Nov-18 11:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats all im asking for!

[26-Nov-18 11:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Someone else in Pirate is working on it as a third party site.

[26-Nov-18 11:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
been playing with the bot and googling as well as combing git and found only the older public bot code

[26-Nov-18 11:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Basically, a trustless swap interface.. I dunno... like an Ebay or Cragslist for coins.

[26-Nov-18 11:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Im not into that too much I just know it's being worked on.

[26-Nov-18 11:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
even more basic than that...

[26-Nov-18 11:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
We wanna trade 2 assets... the bot should be able to handle the same calls as any other UI or CLI

[26-Nov-18 11:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It could be.  Im not sure of all the ins and outs.

[26-Nov-18 11:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are two diff devs working on two diff options of what you speak tho... I believe.

[26-Nov-18 11:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I am understanding right.

[27-Nov-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted Users project is solving that problem if I'm not mistaken.

Nice, I wouldn't have bothered with ETH, but having it handle every coin is really cool

[27-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
the problem is

[27-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
for ERC

[27-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
you need to pay ETH fees

[27-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
and that s an issue
