Yeah much the same... however testing with random verions, isnt much of a conclusive test tbhh

[03-May-19 06:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[03-May-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure what you are using. generally `./start.sh` would be the thing to use

[03-May-19 06:26 AM] Exile13#4458

Bit later I will make a github issue or something for people to sumbmit their address for the game to. Still need to try and describe the rules so they make enough sense for people to actually play.

[03-May-19 06:39 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool - be about 12 hours before I'm on again - damn real-world work.

Setting up now, sry for delay.

[03-May-19 07:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Exile13  üëã
Here art some basic ommands that you can use.

```To start StakedNotary and all its chains:  `./start.sh`

To issue commands to a coin: asset-cli <COINS_NAME> <COMMAND>  eg,  `./asset-cli CFEKORC getinfo` or `./asset-cli CFEKORC help`
 
To issue commands to all assetchains: assets-cli <COMMAND> eg, `./assets-cli getinfo` or `./assets-cli getbalance`

To kill everything: ./stop.sh``` :labs:

[03-May-19 07:43 AM] Exile13#4458
Thank you

[03-May-19 07:43 AM] Exile13#4458
Idk if I'm able yet

[03-May-19 07:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Able to what?

[03-May-19 07:44 AM] Exile13#4458
Run staked notary, don't I have to be chosen from the lottery

[03-May-19 07:47 AM] Exile13#4458
I sent alright my Radd and pubkey

[03-May-19 07:48 AM] Exile13#4458
But he said wait I think

[03-May-19 07:48 AM] CrisF#3405
What was said before?  By Alright or Blackjok3r?

[03-May-19 07:48 AM] Exile13#4458
Ya "we have some prep to do before we can add you"

[03-May-19 07:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, ok.

[03-May-19 07:48 AM] Exile13#4458
If you scroll up alright proposed a lottery

[03-May-19 07:49 AM] Exile13#4458
To add more NN

[03-May-19 07:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, saw that.

[03-May-19 07:49 AM] Exile13#4458
Im excited

[03-May-19 07:49 AM] Exile13#4458
Thinking about making a chain to test oracles

[03-May-19 07:49 AM] Exile13#4458
In the meantime

[03-May-19 07:50 AM] Exile13#4458
Need use case for thc

[03-May-19 07:54 AM] CrisF#3405
I have a few usecases that you could practice with if you like.

[03-May-19 07:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe start with a smaller part of a larger project.

[03-May-19 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
For example, start with making the chain.
Since it's for using oracles, find what params are needed.

[03-May-19 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
(smk762's guide, KMD docs)

[03-May-19 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Here's a use case I put up before.

[03-May-19 07:59 AM] CrisF#3405
*‚É£ *‚É£ *‚É£ *‚É£ *‚É£ *‚É£ *‚É£ 
Test case
 -------------------
 Weight change tracker where a person or group can monitor weight change ‚öñ
 People would post info to an oracle and monitor progress
Betting options available 
Thinking office pool kind of scenario, or friends/community 
Simple oracle to start 
Possibly building towards marketing to smart scale companies with an app

Break it into steps and practice on each one.

[03-May-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not too late guys, some time tonight I expect the first payment to go through. It will snapshot, but that doesn't matter as the first payment can't be released until the next day. Plenty of time. If someone can keep track of the ppl submitting address Herr and DM them to me or something so they are not lost that would be great

[03-May-19 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I had trouble `8d1583de80568a3175d628768e47d47439e20a73` not starting ith `start.sh`.
`rm *.so` in src and cc, make clean in komodo & src, nad `./makecclib` has worked here.

Thanks cris :)

[03-May-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe ask some of the notary testnet guys as well? This will work better the more people play. Even if they don't know what they are doing.

[03-May-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have 3 or 4 address at home, few more hours and kids be asleep then I can have a look.

[03-May-19 12:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool, I've got 5 addresses including mine.  I can mention we'll be doing the game in a few places to get some more people who might be interested.

[03-May-19 12:34 PM] CrisF#3405
When will it be starting? (approximately)

[03-May-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I expected it to get to 1440 block by now but its still on 1275

[03-May-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until 1440 I dont even know if it works or not. Pretty sure it willl work, IU checked what I could.

ZatJUM and exile13 are doubles.

[03-May-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 7 total then, plus myself to add, although I would rather not play seems I am putting up the prize for winning.

[03-May-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats enough, but more is better. WQith 7, everyone is going to need to somehow manage hundreds of addresses, no easy task, even I would struuggle with that.

[03-May-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can always take a tar of the chain after the first payment and we can postpone it... wouldnt be easy to do though

[03-May-19 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll put out a few messages and see if we can get a few more people.

[03-May-19 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Could you pin the info/instruction?

[03-May-19 12:48 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll refer people to that.

- Chain starts with 10B supply. I have this and will distribute it evenly to all participants. 
    - Payments plan will be funded via founders reward 10M coins every 1440 blocks.
    - The range of addresses paid is determined by the last notarized block hash before the snapshot height, which is every 1440 blocks. the top and the bottom(3999th) address cannot be paid. 
    - snapshot = 1440, notarised freq = 10. ~ 144 notarizations between snapshots. 
    - The object of the game is to have balance in the range when the payment is released. 
    - Anyone can release half or more of the  the payment, 20 blocks after the snapshot. 
    - The balance of your addresses at the notarized height will deternmine what rank on the rich list you are. 
    - If you move coins after this, you still get paid the same amount. All you can do is release the previous days mined coins to the set range. 
    - You can release half the funds, locking the other half until the next snapshot.
    - I guess you could fund the plan with extra coins but they would be locked there for 1460 blocks, so the next snapshot would have happened by then, changeing the range.
    - I guess the goal is to not have the address with the most funds in it, but also have enough so that your somewhere in the top 3998.

[03-May-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is what I have but no doubt its no good, as its just random notes

[03-May-19 12:53 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, probably need a bit more specific instructions telling people what (how) to exactly do to play.

[03-May-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I dont even really know how to play it...

[03-May-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that was kind of the idea.... to see  how people do like the postests were, but maybe this is too complicated for that ü§î

[03-May-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not really that complicated... I need to do some @Hollowman9000  paint

[03-May-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wish I had MS paint..... this GIMP thing is too complicated cant even draw a line for some reason üòÇ
