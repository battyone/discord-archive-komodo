if poss I'd like to too, the one I just gave @Alright was from my txblasted wallet

[01-Nov-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah new ones is good idea, will probably keep mine, and also I would like to maybe just have the 1 notary this time, as 3 just costs too much... one is on Alrights VULTR and he has one on my account, this seems a good time to fix that too.

[01-Nov-18 07:29 AM] Alright#0419
Yea, we should test setup from scratch

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Alright#0419
testing something for KMDICE atm, getting back to starting chains after

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Alright#0419
sorry for hold up

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah thats imporant, no rush on this

[01-Nov-18 07:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll make a new pubkey also.

[01-Nov-18 07:38 AM] gcharang#6833
Is AWS a good provider to run STAKED notary, what are the recommended RAM and SSD requirements?

[01-Nov-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For the thing we are about to start, Alright has been using a 4GB ram VULTR VPS without worries

[01-Nov-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will probably keep an 8GB one, but reduce from 3 of them to 1, as we have enough people now.

[01-Nov-18 07:41 AM] gcharang#6833
Ok and recommended diskspace?

[01-Nov-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont see any more than 50GB being needed at this stage ... main net will need more for sure

[01-Nov-18 07:42 AM] gcharang#6833
Cool. Got it

[01-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Throwing an extra 16GB ram and a 500GB spinner in my machine tomorrow - hoping I can be considered for mainnet.

[01-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, we were planning on lettin gjust about anyone have a go the first time...

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Requirements will be small

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
adding heaps and heaps of chains off the bat will only make things really hard .

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cna work our way up to that, as we improve the code

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
Plan is to make the CLTV amount more than what a notary would make in 2 months after the first 2 months

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
fair warning

[01-Nov-18 07:47 AM] Alright#0419
you'll have to accumulate some STAKED otherwise to remain a notary pretty much

[01-Nov-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think as long as you mine a it then stake, everyone should be ok

[01-Nov-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of helps to get people who know how to do such things

[01-Nov-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having any noob being a notary is ok, as long as ther eis nt 20 of them to teach all at once üòÖ

[01-Nov-18 07:48 AM] gt#2812
sounds good

[01-Nov-18 07:49 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Fine with me - hopefully a couple of cpu cores will be enough to mine at first.

[01-Nov-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
lol nooooo

[01-Nov-18 07:49 AM] Alright#0419
üòà

[01-Nov-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very doubtful.... but there will be a public pool at launch

[01-Nov-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so renting hash is fine

[01-Nov-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
couple CPU cores is enough to stake üòâ

[01-Nov-18 07:50 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I can only set aside 2 rx480 to begin with

[01-Nov-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
I have a couple thousand $ set aside for NH

[01-Nov-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well if I ever get time, to make sure the BR % can be paid by a pool .... so far 2 days since I started it with no progress, but one thing at a time.

[01-Nov-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
fair warning

[01-Nov-18 07:51 AM] Alright#0419
I can do pool side of it

[01-Nov-18 07:51 AM] Alright#0419
needs to be the correct vout type though

[01-Nov-18 07:51 AM] Alright#0419
like daemon needs to accept the vout nomp will give

[01-Nov-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, to pay a multisig address, it needs to pay to an address ...

[01-Nov-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have to do that in the daemon

[01-Nov-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know how to, just need to add it and make it actually work.

[01-Nov-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migrated my PC and VMs to linux host this morning, so once this testnet is up I can start on it.

[01-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r freq 10 for main chain and freq 5 for everything else?

[01-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure that works I guess... 5 on everything and 1 of the 0BR at 10 is preobably better

[01-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only need one at 10, as a control

[01-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
so...

[01-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
main chain at 10 or 5

[01-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5

[01-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its onyl a test chain anyway... if it still fails at 5, we know there is still an issue with out of order confirmed notarisations on target chains

[01-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we know what the issues is exactly

?

[01-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
ok and era was changed?

[01-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
will start them now

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
era is set all 4 2 years from today

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
FSM branch is üëå ?

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wiat will check era on it

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one sec

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i think its good,

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
did we just talk about changing era to 1-2 days for first then a week for second?

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
and now we're doing 2 year eras?

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
a bit confused

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no ..

[01-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When you change the pubkeys

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you change the era that those pubkeys activate then

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the era timestamp

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the limit of the last one

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, so whenever we're ready we cut the first era short?

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so whenit gets to it, it changes to that era

[01-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r sorry, I know you're doing 10 things at once, but FSM_mempooltest isn't building

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
broken ztx in FSM seems to be the priority?

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I need to fix that first ..

[01-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just built that branch before üòï

[01-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I definatly have a built xopy of it

[01-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just worry about one thing at a time

[01-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on lates pull

[01-Nov-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
hard enough to do things correctly one at a time, start juggling things and guaranteed bugs will creep in from one area to another.

I already did that and it wsa working for me... if it defuses to build just use master until later

[01-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, got the branch to build, just needed a fresh clone for some reason

Will need to merge this in before we start testing shit ..

dumb question incoming:
on my staked node, killl it all, reclone and then sit tight waiting?

[01-Nov-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just stop it if you have a node yes.... ive been taken off this onto DICE fix atm, waiting on stuff to build.... likley be a while until we can launch this now... unless Alright can do it wihtout me. will be going offline soon.

[01-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
Might be able to, but I'd rather wait

[01-Nov-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... this z-tx problem is much harder than we thaught ... as the code I added, allowed the KMDICE chain to sync, because this problem was there already... now to find out why üòÖ

[01-Nov-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the most recent FSM githash that works with ztx?

[01-Nov-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a week ago?

[01-Nov-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to find out ... thats what I am going to do now

[01-Nov-18 11:25 AM] Mylo#8306
cool no dramas.

[01-Nov-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As STAKED is usually level with FSM, we will need to wait intil the z-tx fix is found before launching the new testnet üò¶

Hey! Some insights üòÉ 
Got a little progress with oracles chat GUI:

Now it can grab a list of rooms by params with which it's creating by Alright's trollbox, getting messages from selected room (rooms are clickable buttons in the left part)  in realtime and displaying it (checking for a new message every 0.5 secs)  in messages window.

Just room/nickname creating and message sending implementation left and will be possible to test for very #kmdlabs conversations üòÉ

Would be great if @Alright  re-write these ones: `room/nickname creating and message sending` as a functions so I'll just use it and represent output in GUI üòÉ
