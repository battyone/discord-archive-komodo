so, remind me again.... what's wrong with chmex's bootstrap that a resync is needed?

[02-Apr-19 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ... I changed the blockindex

[02-Apr-19 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has an extra 2 variables in it

[02-Apr-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whcih means that the deamon cannot load the old type says its corrupted

[02-Apr-19 06:38 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
ahhh k

[02-Apr-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I put up my own bootstrap... but my bandwidth isnt great ...

[02-Apr-19 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If this all works, I will try and work out how to do it better so that at least KMD still works with the old format I think.

Pinned a message.

[02-Apr-19 06:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
` but my bandwidth isnt great ...`
so should I dl it or resync?

[02-Apr-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
D/L it it gets about 5MB/s

[02-Apr-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
30mins vs 6H

[02-Apr-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
legacy devs said there was no speed difference, they couldnt have been wrong? could they?

[02-Apr-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
funniest aprils fool joke was the one where it said legacy devs proposed to do something that made sense

I would agree that at 1.5M DSL there's no difference, because of scan/verify time
but in 2019 that makes me 游뱎

Well its still me and zatJUM  only. Im going for a few hours. hopefully there is enough of us when I get back. 游땎

This is a bootstrap for LABS
it has blocks/ chainstate/

[02-Apr-19 07:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks you, @CHMEX !!  That's awesome 游땎

woke up to `== response_dpow CFEKORKL ==
{'error': 'cant dPoW an inactive coin',`

[02-Apr-19 07:37 AM] CMaurice#1685
a short while after all chains sync'd and adding of notaries

[02-Apr-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
hmm, I got this ```CFEKDIMXY5 is a STAKED chain and is in an ERA GAP.```

[02-Apr-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Can't check ORKL now, but maybe related?

[02-Apr-19 07:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Blackjok3r will be back soon to get this update underway.

[02-Apr-19 07:39 AM] CMaurice#1685
righty ho... reading back...

[02-Apr-19 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
CFEKNK is the only one that doesn't have
`Failed: help human!`

[02-Apr-19 07:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Is just a git pull and `start.sh` enough of an update for this on?? ( Besides re-symc?)

[02-Apr-19 07:41 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
looks like assets need resync too

[02-Apr-19 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm redoing that now.

[02-Apr-19 07:46 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice @blackjok3r I did in fact have ```CFEKORKL is a STAKED chain and is in an ERA GAP.``` showing on std.

[02-Apr-19 07:47 AM] CrisF#3405
This was `CFEKNK` ```[CFEKDIMXY6] ABORTING no blocks or longest chain found, Help Human! 
[CFEKNK] Synced on block: 989
 Something went wrong, please check error messages above requiring human help and manually rectify them before starting iguana! ```

well, I did scp the data dirs

[02-Apr-19 07:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I should have done that to.  Will do it.

scp is from server to server

[02-Apr-19 08:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool.  I was wondering if that was the error message for the era change window?
Originally I think it was 10 min but think it changed to a bit longer.

[02-Apr-19 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like its working @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 
When the era changes that should automatiacally disappear.

[02-Apr-19 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the block index format has changed so EVERY chain will need resync using LABS komodod

[02-Apr-19 08:11 AM] CrisF#3405
80% on ORKL

[02-Apr-19 08:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Be a litlle longer.

[02-Apr-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that  quityel litterally means every chain, you will need to sync any chain you want to use again.. I will investigate how to fix this issue, but we just need to get this PoC tested to amke sure its viable first... before I mess with C++ classes and thigns for a week chasing my tail and hitting my head againsta a wall. 游땥

[02-Apr-19 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there was no part of me that could be assed to mess with it for the longest time
fek me I got tired of having 50+ tabs open for the simplest of shit

[02-Apr-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think I could have ran my notary without it tbh ...

[02-Apr-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or to be more specific, work out "how a notary works"

[02-Apr-19 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
just takes 6 tabs instead of 1 window 游땥

[02-Apr-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah maybe... but having all the stuff on a single screen to watch how it realtes to each other.... like when CPU spikes, when network spikes,etc...

[02-Apr-19 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
indeed

[02-Apr-19 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
nothing more annoying than tabbing to issue a command and then tabbing back to see the result
