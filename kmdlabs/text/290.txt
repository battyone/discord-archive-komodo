yes. Chains are live on my notary and it all worked with `stop.sh` then `./start.sh`

```[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...

``` this happens way too often

[14-Feb-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah just run it again

[14-Feb-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont get why it returns an error .. I think maybe it just needs to sleep a little longer

[14-Feb-19 10:23 AM] jorian#4555
yeah the help hooman comes right after the Waiting for line

[14-Feb-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it doesnt see it as started right away, will push possible fix rn, keep forgetting about it

so staking only on my -ac_staked=99 isnt enough, I need a miner node too?

[14-Feb-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should stake provided the balance is split enough and there are 2 nodes...

[14-Feb-19 10:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
two staking nodes?

[14-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will stop if there are no utxos elegible...

[14-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 means you can split more utxos

[14-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
20,000 + should ensuire tis always going to work

[14-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but 5000 is likely also fine...

[14-Feb-19 10:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`CFEKDEAD` lol

[14-Feb-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm 99% sure it wil end up dead... Unless I mine it myself., while he tries toa ttack it, and out hash him

[14-Feb-19 10:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might setup CFEKORKL this weekend for general oracle testing

[14-Feb-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries. We can do that, hopefully these chains work 🤞  and CFEKDEAD actaully lives 😄

[14-Feb-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
I asked dimxy to make direct rpc calls for crosschain transfer and also for nonfungible assets. plz help him get synced on at least 2 appropriate chains

[14-Feb-19 10:45 AM] dimxy#2587
Hi all in this group,
I'm issued a task by JL to improve cross chain import rpc.
I need two notarized dev chains for this.
Could anyone point out me to the chains?

[14-Feb-19 10:46 AM] dimxy#2587
ha I just was writing the same question 😀

👋 

[14-Feb-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also they use their own sourcecode fork for kmdlabs chains, but i think the rpc level will be fully compatible

[14-Feb-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes ... there are 2 chains up, but they are for a test., RPC is the same. but to test the RPCs you will need our fork.

[14-Feb-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can launch 2 normal fungible chains right now.  That you can use just for this. 😃

[14-Feb-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol first bug already happened 😄 fixing lol

[14-Feb-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
think it might be hardfork lol... I couldnt test this without a notarization

[14-Feb-19 11:01 AM] dimxy#2587
great, I'll use this fork too

sapling isnt active yet so the script cant work...

[14-Feb-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just wait until 61 blocks...

[14-Feb-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its good it cant anyway because you all need to update again in a minute or you will fork.

[14-Feb-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Please update to latest. Stupid bug on my part.

😁 (2) 👌 

[14-Feb-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
poushed another update I think it will be ok without update as long as you are not mining. But if you can please update it.

[14-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We have had a payment notarization and it looks like eras are working, at least the first one

[14-Feb-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
aeems working @dimxy  Did you just want to use these 2 chains for your tests? We will let you know in advance before we terst the attack on them, and make sure a replacement thas been launched.

[14-Feb-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there are some small changes to import/export in our  fork to jl777s repo. I will be making a PR to there once we have launched, just havennt goit time atm.

Please post address to send coins or just mine some CFEKDEAD.

[14-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😃

[14-Feb-19 12:49 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes, for import test
Thank you  very much!

[14-Feb-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries if you need any help with it please let me know.

merged sorry I missed it

[14-Feb-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems like the miner code isnt perfect yet either, will push another fix soon.

[14-Feb-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol no rush
it's not going to really change anything for anyone but me and even then will only matter the next time you guys change it

[14-Feb-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  if you can can you please thorw 1 CPU core onto LABST6, my notary node without AVX instrictions is having a hard time blockig it even with 10 cores 😂

[14-Feb-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I could use the 5 cores I've been throwing at 5

[14-Feb-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. I think with a decent hash rate on the % chain, Alrights atttack is just about impossible to carry out... So the defense will be to make sure he cant get enough hash rate 😂 
The recent changes are 99% better than before, which was prone to forks... but the attack is still possible. It affects all dPoW, but in out case could also fork the chain. I may have to increase the amount of delay, but hopefully thats not required.

I think my NN is on strike
100 blocks deep and I've got 2 notarizations 😭

[14-Feb-19 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think that many have happned at all...

[14-Feb-19 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i screwed up the notary payment on CFEKDEAD .... I'g getting paid so much lol

[14-Feb-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I dont think that many have happned at all...`
9 or 10, I think

[14-Feb-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I think i screwed up the notary payment on CFEKDEAD .... I'g getting paid so much lol`
I got 95 total and 5 notarizations

[14-Feb-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
620 here lol

[14-Feb-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its paying about 18-20 coins per nota. Might have added an extra 0 😂

[14-Feb-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
doops

[14-Feb-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only test chain, doesnt matter at all... as long as its paying

[14-Feb-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whch it seems that it does

[14-Feb-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to try force a few notarisation into mempool... just to test something then going to 💤

[14-Feb-19 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
found possible issue. Will fix tomorrow.

[14-Feb-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed fix. As long as the chain isnt attacked the fix/unfixed wont fork.

[14-Feb-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Think I broke it... 😅

[14-Feb-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep I definatly broke it... CFEKDEAD ... cant figure thos out atm. going to bed

[14-Feb-19 05:37 PM] jorian#4555
alright didn't even have to attack it? 😛

[14-Feb-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no I did it myself

[14-Feb-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as I was the only miner... trying to code artound his attack just made the code buyggy as hell...

[14-Feb-19 05:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getting too complicated... need to sleep on this... probably going to revert a whole bunch of shit. to make it more simple... Thats the onmly thing thats going to properly work.

[14-Feb-19 05:39 PM] jorian#4555
