the address are ranked from highest balance down to the lowest balance, to a maximum of 3999 addresses. 
The range paid is randomly chosen based on the last notarized height before each multiple of 1440 blocks. 
Anyone can release halkf the 10 million coins allocated each day 1460 blocks after they were last paid.

[03-May-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so if your addresses are not in a good rank for you it would be a race to unlock exactly half the coins as soon as possible...

[03-May-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Depends how many days it goes for though, I didnt want to make it more than once a day because that would take up too much of peoples time... I was going to say maybe 5-7 days and it can continue of people wish to. Need a cut off for the 10k LABS prize for first though.

[03-May-19 01:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Ah, randomly chosen.

```Anyone can release halkf the 10 million coins allocated each day 1460 blocks after they were last paid.

[03-May-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That I think its mostly the game side of it. 10M coins are avalible, 20 blocks after the snapshot. However you can release only half of these effectivly locking the other half until the next snapshot (or slightly after it, as anything in payments plan is locked for 1460 blocks aftert being sent)

[03-May-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we may need some kind of rich list, you can call `getsnapshot` at any height youself but its a lot of data to digest in JSON format lol

[03-May-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
especally with 3999 addresses

[03-May-19 01:25 PM] zatJUM#9924
Where are those `10M coins are avalible, 20 blocks after the snapshot`? In which address? Are they airdropped?

[03-May-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are in a payments CC plan (this is what we are testing) you unlock them with the `paymentsrelease` RPC

[03-May-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any amount above 5M can be unlocked by any person once they are avalible (1460 blocks, after the last snapshot)

[03-May-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the first snapshot will be in like a few hours I think... because there are not may address im not sure what will happen it may even crash it. 😂

[03-May-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but there are not yet any funds. those will be paid the same block the snapshot happens, and ready to be paid out in 1460 blocks, 20 blocks after the next snapshot

Oh I never got to ask, how is the range derived from the blockhash?  Random(blockhash) ?

havenmt missed it... it cant be released for another 1460 blocks

[03-May-19 03:54 PM] jorian#4555
but the snapshot was done

[03-May-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it happens again in 1440 blocks... 20 blocks after the funds can be released

[03-May-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this snapshot isnt used.... but if it didnt happen then the chain was broken... its not 😄

[03-May-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess though we need to decide when to cut off people enterning.. and distribute the coins, cant leave it to the last minute

[03-May-19 04:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Wonder if @TonyL if has time to play?
Just need an R address to start 😉

[03-May-19 04:02 PM] jorian#4555

ok, so now 1460 blocks until the coins go out

[03-May-19 04:06 PM] jorian#4555
