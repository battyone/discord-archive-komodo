@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 you have any ideas on how I could tell nomp to stop mining without killing it?

[08-Feb-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
like if I could not let it get blocktemplate

[08-Feb-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
I want it to mine like 2 blocks then stop

[08-Feb-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
scripted

[08-Feb-19 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if it's a proper nomp, then run 2 coins and script a coinswitch to the cli
beyond that, I don't see how you could stop it while not stopping it because words 游땥

[08-Feb-19 06:37 PM] ca333#0118
maybe script it via iptables rule @Alright - you should be able to lock the ports nomp is using for blocknotify and rpc reqs. so preventing it from getting block notifications and work update.

I think by having 5 notarizations in mempool it confused it, the miner may not handle more than 2, looking at this later today.

[09-Feb-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Appears the code to use previous worked but not 100% sure
