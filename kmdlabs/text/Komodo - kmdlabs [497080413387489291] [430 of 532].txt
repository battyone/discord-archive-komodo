I have scripts to seed a chain with random amounts to X address... it could eb adapted for this job, but I dont really ahve time, maybe someone else can work out how to do it?

There is enough code in here to do exactly what you need to do.

basically you need to use genaddress to gen the address on one daemon, then copy list.json (or stop and move wallet.dat) thej use the the splittoaddress to make txns, to amke more than 3999 you may need to speak to smk762 he added some code in there that does this I think.

[14-Jun-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can make an AC with 90nbillion coins. 😉 That should make this quite trivial to do.

[14-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jorian#4555
who needs 90 billion

:abusedsmily:

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having such a large balance makes it easuier to just randomly generate amounts, otherwise you may end yup with no balance to send quite fast

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
why do we need `seed a chain with random amounts to X address`?

[14-Jun-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wsa using it for snapshot testing, but it should do what @Deleted User  is asking for.

[14-Jun-19 09:32 AM] jorian#4555
ah

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If that doesnt contain the right code, I have another branch here that I didnt publish that may be better. I think @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 's srapnel.py is the one you need

[14-Jun-19 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm keen to help out @Deleted User.

[14-Jun-19 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Will need to know what to do.

[14-Jun-19 10:25 AM] phm87#7395
Go to sleep ^^ you should sleep at least few hours per week (or per day I don't remember details)

[14-Jun-19 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll be on and of for the next day and a half.

[14-Jun-19 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, get some sleep and dream up something big!

[14-Jun-19 10:27 AM] phm87#7395
for 1000 000 BTC, I can do what you want (wash your car, go back in time or teleport inanimated bodies)

[14-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
xD

[14-Jun-19 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if this is any help, but @gcharang was working with explorers a little while ago.

[14-Jun-19 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
You might be able to raise enough  funds from people who `don't` want to see that...

[14-Jun-19 10:29 AM] gcharang#6833
I am semi aware of whats going on here
I can help with setup of explorer and  modifications to the insight-api if needed

what if he sends dust to the top 100 in the richlist that are actively collecting rewards?

[14-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but wouldnt the contaminated dust contaminate all descendants?

[14-Jun-19 10:36 AM] phm87#7395
if I receive dirty inputs on any address, I heard that it is possible to choosen which inputs to spend (and avoid to touch/use the dirty coins). I'll ask the guy the rpc commands (or rawtx) to do this (weedcoder of cryptofr)

[14-Jun-19 10:37 AM] phm87#7395
But on Lightning Network with Sphinx, they are not able to refuse payments right now and it is an accounting problem/risk for companies (all inputs/outputs of money must have a reason/invoice)

[14-Jun-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
A new chain will be required for this right?

[14-Jun-19 10:50 AM] phm87#7395
yes I think

I still don't understand why my KMDLabs NN doesn't work. I'm using mylo key, I reinstalled everything (on the same machine) according to StakeNotary Readme, port 9333 is opened, I tried to reindex chains but it didn't help. How to troubleshot it ?

[14-Jun-19 10:53 AM] phm87#7395
experienced old NN operator helped me in private, we tested stuff but it still doesn't work

[14-Jun-19 10:56 AM] PHBA2061#2530
what is your ip ?

[14-Jun-19 10:56 AM] phm87#7395
I didn't add my IP anywhere

[14-Jun-19 10:56 AM] phm87#7395

[14-Jun-19 10:57 AM] phm87#7395
thank you

[14-Jun-19 10:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
are you running litecoin daemon on your node by any chance ? 😅

[14-Jun-19 11:00 AM] phm87#7395
no

[14-Jun-19 11:00 AM] phm87#7395
but on the same server I have other VM with other coin daemons (but unrelated to komodo). it is not impossible that a coin use the same p2p port of LTC (not a good idea though)

[14-Jun-19 11:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I tried  to `nmap -p 9333 79.137.112.66` and it returned `9333/tcp open  litecoin`

[14-Jun-19 11:01 AM] phm87#7395
weird

[14-Jun-19 11:01 AM] phm87#7395
thank you for the help, i'll dig on my side a little bit

{Reactions}
👌 

[14-Jun-19 11:04 AM] PHBA2061#2530
79.137.112.66 is the public IP of your server, and inside there are several VM ? it seems to me that traffic through 9333 got forward to the one that has litecoin running. But I'm not entirely sure

[14-Jun-19 11:06 AM] phm87#7395
yes, inside there are several VM (for the pool) but in theory, no coins (but as we copy paste config, maybe a servicename remains named as litecoin). I'll check that but it is weird

[14-Jun-19 11:18 AM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061  i tried your nmap command on the IP of zatJUM and I received no reply. It is very weird because litecoin is not running on any VM of this server.
What is the expected reply for a running KMDLabs NN op ?

[14-Jun-19 11:29 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@phm87  you can either try `nmap -p 9333  94.23.1.95` or `nc -zv 94.23.1.95 9333` ,  1 of them should succeed

[14-Jun-19 11:30 AM] phm87#7395
I think that I will flush the VM and rebigin everything again

with `nc -zv 94.23.1.95 9333` the result should be `Connection to 94.23.1.95 9333 port [tcp/*] succeeded!`

[14-Jun-19 11:55 AM] phm87#7395
so maybe it is normal

[14-Jun-19 11:55 AM] zatJUM#9924
Try nmap with sudo

Otherwise it doesn't return right result

I am using KMDLabs/StakedNotary and I followed the readme (with mylo's key)

[14-Jun-19 01:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
Why don't you have any value in "LAST"?

[14-Jun-19 01:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
Chains are in sync with pubkey?

[14-Jun-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
they should, I'll check

[14-Jun-19 01:59 PM] zatJUM#9924
Were they ran with komodod from KMDLABS?

[14-Jun-19 02:00 PM] phm87#7395
everything was launched with ./start.sh of KMDLabs/StakedNotary

[14-Jun-19 02:00 PM] phm87#7395

it matches mylo pubkey

[14-Jun-19 02:01 PM] phm87#7395
AC doesn't have the ``-stakednotary=1`` : only KMD have it as I see

[14-Jun-19 02:02 PM] phm87#7395
I think that LAST is about the last notarization and as I was not able to notarize yet

[14-Jun-19 02:02 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't open p2p ports of KMD and AC : only iguana port is opened

[14-Jun-19 02:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
oh sorry, I confused with "blox"  because I changed columns in my stats 😉

Do you have the privkey imported to match the pubkey being used?

[14-Jun-19 02:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
start.sh does it for you

[14-Jun-19 02:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
and what is "TXN" column?

[14-Jun-19 02:07 PM] phm87#7395
the total number of transactions performed for this wallet I think

[14-Jun-19 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
in wallet

[14-Jun-19 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
if you clean it goes to 1

`it matches mylo pubkey`
unless it also matches mylo's privkey, it needs to be changed

[14-Jun-19 02:08 PM] phm87#7395
CG : mylo didn't had the time to do the KMDLabs NN so he gave me his passphrase, privkey and I calculated the pubkey

[14-Jun-19 02:08 PM] phm87#7395
that matches the pubkey that is into komodo code

[14-Jun-19 02:08 PM] phm87#7395
so I think that the key things should be fine

{Reactions}
👍🏽

All seems ok, perhaps iguana just needs time now

[14-Jun-19 02:10 PM] phm87#7395
It is running since 18 days but I'll continue to try. I can try to reboot or reinstall everything elsewhere (I tried to reindex all AC and KMD yesterday)

[14-Jun-19 02:10 PM] phm87#7395
I read that iguana needs few hours to begin to work when it is started/stopped so I'll wait
