1.5 million transactions in that address. one does not want to importaddress that

[17-Jan-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man that would be basically impossible

[17-Jan-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with - resan üòÇ

[17-Jan-19 04:14 PM] jorian#4555
so how does LABS mining work again?

[17-Jan-19 04:14 PM] jorian#4555
all rewards go to a multisig?

[17-Jan-19 04:15 PM] jorian#4555
and then daily 33% is split?

[17-Jan-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no. 51% PoS

[17-Jan-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
49% PoW

[17-Jan-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and 33% ( it was 10% I increased it a lot) of the total BR of 10 is sent in one transaction to the multi sig address every 1440 blocks

[17-Jan-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BR is 10 LABS ...

[17-Jan-19 04:16 PM] jorian#4555
ahh. so that means 3.33 LABS per day go to the multisig

[17-Jan-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... with 33% ... it was 10% but this was far too low IMO

[17-Jan-19 04:17 PM] jorian#4555
what is the multisig good for?

[17-Jan-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the multi sig is to pay notaries... I really couldnt figure out a way to make it pay them automatically. So we decided on a semi decentralised trust model of 15 ppl in a multi sig say 8/9 singers, that agree on a tally of notarisations (Alright has a py script that tallies them already)

[17-Jan-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then each node is paid realtive to it preformance

[17-Jan-19 04:19 PM] jorian#4555
ah of course, i was confused with easy mining from official notaries

[17-Jan-19 04:19 PM] jorian#4555
not all labs notaries will mine

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they can stake I think... but it will hurt their ntoarisation counts

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless use diffrent node

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] jorian#4555
yes, different node

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] jorian#4555
any ETA? üòõ

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is just about ready

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant find any more bugs

[17-Jan-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe a test launch for 1 week ü§∑

[17-Jan-19 04:21 PM] jorian#4555
let's make a KMDLABS-lab

[17-Jan-19 04:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r I guess ~1 KMD/month/node is good for current LABS NN. (based on my LABS node count currently) . for 20 nodes it would be 20 KMD/month. I can provide 100 KMD which should last 4-5 months? (i'm not the best guy for math)

[17-Jan-19 04:21 PM] jorian#4555
i'd be happy to provide some KMD as well

[17-Jan-19 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I will throw in some too, as will Alrght he said

[17-Jan-19 04:22 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, if more NN ops come forward wtih some donation, that can cover the KMD costs

[17-Jan-19 04:22 PM] SHossain#0007
let me know which address you want the KMD to be sent

[17-Jan-19 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we wil use teh multisig for ntoaries

[17-Jan-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and make a sendmany to fund them

[17-Jan-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The people who get multi sig at the start Im sure were already sorted. Need to confirm with @Alright  though.

[17-Jan-19 04:24 PM] jorian#4555
can't we make (probably james) a cc-faucet that can only send a certain amount of LABS to one of the LABS notaries per day?

[17-Jan-19 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea was to pay it based on notariations... if you just pay a flat fee... thats probly possible to pay a faucet instead of a multisig.

[17-Jan-19 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that delays things

[17-Jan-19 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
While the change later will mean a hardfork... its a hard problem to solve and Id rather use the cluster itself to test such things than on the main chain. üòâ

[17-Jan-19 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
ok

[17-Jan-19 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if we make the multi sige number to high one person can withhold our pay üò≠

[17-Jan-19 04:27 PM] jorian#4555
a group of persons

[17-Jan-19 04:27 PM] jorian#4555
what is the M of N now?

[17-Jan-19 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
15 of 19 to be multisig, and then M to be decided

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
cant . have 19

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
19 is more than 15

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jorian#4555
that's what he said

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is total 19, 15 of those

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ah, ok

{Reactions}
rum 

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jorian#4555
8 of 15? too many? then there is at least a majority

[17-Jan-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah 8 is what I wrote in the proposal I think

[17-Jan-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as majorty it should be good

[17-Jan-19 04:29 PM] jorian#4555
oh haha

[17-Jan-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe make it 5?

[17-Jan-19 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5? to decide who gets paid what out of 33% of all mined coins?

[17-Jan-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking about attrition and losing coins

[17-Jan-19 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully this is ony temporary and it onyl happens once every 2 months...

[17-Jan-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
will there be 5 evil notaries

[17-Jan-19 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
surley we can get majority of notaries

[17-Jan-19 04:31 PM] jorian#4555
```Definition of attrition - sorrow for one's sins that arises from a motive other than that of the love of God``` sounds about right

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5 ... it depnds how they are chosen.. I think with who we ahve now 5 is ok... its not something easily changed once done this.

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
well

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
how do elections work?

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
every 3 months?

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are no elections

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
do the 9 worst notaries drop out?

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
oh

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the top nodes are kept

[17-Jan-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and teh bottom goes to a lottery

[17-Jan-19 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
doing what exactly?

[17-Jan-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe in this model 5 is a good idea ü§î

It's OK - that will add to my. 0.2 balance

[17-Jan-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure binance can take a coin like this for a fair while... while we have tried to break the tech as much as we can, there may still be flaws yet to be discovered.

is LABS going to be notarized btw?

{Reactions}
ü§¶ 

[17-Jan-19 04:46 PM] TonyL#3577
What will be a block reward and total supply of LABS?

[17-Jan-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS is notarised ... to KMD already by its own notaries

[17-Jan-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BR is 10 .. divided PoS /PoW and notary nodes... total supply is uncapped 10 BR forever...

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But chain in th cluster that die will burn supply

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Asking because there is `These chains due to their PoS compenent require ~20,000-50,000 LABS` specific sum specified
