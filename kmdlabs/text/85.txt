only needs to be liek 1% of blocks

[12-Nov-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but instead of PoS whitch dirves the PoW difficulty up... it can just be PoW with a speical exception

[12-Nov-18 08:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Did't you have a way to privately mine?  (Only the pubkeyholder?)

[12-Nov-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes there is private miner

[12-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its tied into streamer... which enforces ondeamnd blocks ... maybe the ondemand part can be turned on and off with another command line arg... but they are already getting really confusing as it is.

[12-Nov-18 08:59 AM] CrisF#3405
haha, I bet!

@blackjok3r the problem with private mining is that someone could create a chain, get people to migrate a bunch of coins to it then stop mining

[12-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
and coins are stuck

[12-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
so we need a way anyone can create block easily ~once/minute

[12-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
there's actually an easy fix for that situation, but best to avoid it

[12-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
snapshot/airdrop

[12-Nov-18 09:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Is theere a way to make more than one private miners?

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems quite difficult ... maybe we can reject all blocks that are not 60s after the one befor eit

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So its kind of like how the notary nodes wait to  submit their block, but its also consensus enforeced

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
that will allow timewarp attacks

[12-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
a snapshot/airdrop would take days to do because we need to be 100% certain that the chain won't be notarized again

[12-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
so that'd be pretty annoying situation

[12-Nov-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah .. private mining isnt a good solution for very much at all, apart form the streamer tbh

[12-Nov-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe there is something it can be used for, but this doesnt seem it

[12-Nov-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1% PoS but you cant stake balances under 1 or over 2 ?

[12-Nov-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mayebe that will be enough to stop dofficulty rising over CPU mineable stage

[12-Nov-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it is, these chains are sitting on about 6-10% PoS when they are supposed to be 1% ... and thats with 20sol on CFEKED

[12-Nov-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we just need a diffrent difficulty algo as an option ?

[12-Nov-18 09:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh, on demand blocks would be useful for sensor data being written to oracle. at the moment I get a few errors if blocks move slower than data refresh rate. I can work around it by storing in buffer until last oraclesdatatx block is confirmed, which would mostly work unless chains get real slow for too long.

[12-Nov-18 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it adds a delay to data publication, which is fine for data  which is not time sensitive

[12-Nov-18 09:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but if dog goes missing and I have to wait 1hr  to get latest GPS coords, the lag makes the data much less useful.

I was on a roll over the weekend. meant to clean the house and finish building new chook coop, but kept breaking on thru to the next bit so kicked on.

still haven't optimised battery use, but that can wait. gets about 26hrs at current spec which is enough for now, but would like to make it a week if posible

I'm yet to do the bounty properly too, hope to do it this weekend alongside demo release.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator oraclesdata is limited by how many times you did oraclesubscribe

[12-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
if you subscribe 10 times, you can do 10 oraclessamples per block

[12-Nov-18 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm sending every 5 min or so when not in safe zone, so it's a rare issue, but that solves it nicely

[12-Nov-18 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can foresee other sensor data streams being closer to continuous though. But not on 3G. Will have to use wifi for that or it's stupidly expensive

[12-Nov-18 09:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
GPS needs 3G cos the sensor is oscar mike. Something like soil moisture or aquarium pH would work on wifi, though both are bad examples of data streams needing near continuous readings....  but there are process plant sensors which need to react quickly and adjust things for optimal conditions (heat, flow rate etc) for whatever chemical process being done

[12-Nov-18 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
What is being used now to upload the data (not to blockchain)?

[12-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah any monitoring @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator in the case of perishable goods delivery, temperature drops below a threshold can be used to calculate % discount as per contract condition, e.g. < 1hr (60 blocks) continuously below 5 degrees = 5% credit on next order, >1hr <4h = 8%, >4hr <24hr 12% etc.

oracles uses mempool, so that shouldn;t be much issue ... just fund 1000 utxos üòÇ

[12-Nov-18 10:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the hardware is a particle.io kit, which comes with a sim and a portal to get events.  The portal can be accessed by browser, and offers a url to curl events from

[12-Nov-18 10:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I have a listener on the curl stream, which encrypts gps data with aes and then writes to the oracle.

[12-Nov-18 10:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a sepearate script queries oracle on demand, triggered by browser reload. It decrypts oracle data back into gps string, and generates the HTML from a template with a few variables in it so track is shown and map zooms over it.

so I think I've been paranoid enough, but that always seems a careless attitude

[12-Nov-18 10:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
later down the track I'll see if I can code out the particle.io part of it and speak directly to the server

end goal is to have something that uses purely opensource assets with no potential for 3rd party tracking via cookies etc.
host everything on my own hardware.

[12-Nov-18 10:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
using google maps WMS would effectively tell google what tiles I'm loading and bypass any attempt at location security

[12-Nov-18 10:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I 'm playing with OSM at the moment. Eventually I can host the tiles myself too, so no external entity able to monitor that... except the browser...

[12-Nov-18 10:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
might have to build a browser... :trollface:

I have a change I want to comit to it ... but its in the stratum-node part

[12-Nov-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I need the StakedChain repo equal to yours to get it all working, ten yo ucan sync back ... it should be fully backwards comaptible

[12-Nov-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
added an extra optional parameter to the coin.json file

[12-Nov-18 10:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can do. not sure it's perfect for fresh vps at the moment, until I test it. I recall it relies on having StakedNotary installed too which I was trying to avoid. I might have fixed that but I forget.

[12-Nov-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok ... I just need any changes to the pool, so when you pull the update down it doesnt break anything

[12-Nov-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a fairly easy mod, as all my changes are in a diffrent repo... its just changing a dependancy inisalled by npm install

[12-Nov-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think also I should try and merge StakedNotary and staked together some more, so that staked cna start all chains... then the pool can use the staked repo.. we should avoid stakednotary being used for anythign but notaries.

[12-Nov-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also fixing StakedNotary atm ... its broke my notary node with its god damn symlinks ... lol

[12-Nov-18 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least I know that StakedChain/komodo can sync all AC's

[12-Nov-18 10:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just cleaned up a bit of stuff with .gitignore, loading pool to confirm it's still all good and will push in 5

can you use DDR3?

[12-Nov-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using DDR3 on the current server yes

[12-Nov-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but he new chips are all DDR4

[12-Nov-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and my Quad CPU's are just too old ... I think .. after using this RYZEN 2700X, over the quads in the server... no comparison... 8 cores vs 48 and the 8 beats it hands down üòÆ
