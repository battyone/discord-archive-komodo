[03-Feb-19 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Using scp from another node I have, like Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834 suggested, worked really well.

[03-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jorian#4555
yes, that's what i used too

[03-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jorian#4555
but that failed for me, all daemons started reindexing

[03-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jorian#4555
probably an index flag or sth

[03-Feb-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... that commit that was pushed... brok many ndoes.. the longer it was running the mroe likey it brok it.. and the update to get that commit was labeled mandatory abut the fix wasnt announced üòï

[03-Feb-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i I dont know how a-team got that high... but iguana is already using 7GB of ram... so it will likely crash and stop working soon

[03-Feb-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
no matter what, just keep denying that it's happening

@Alright  please watch that mining node for the first notarisation

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
looks like we're good

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
just waiting for them to agreee

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we can leave it a few hours

[03-Feb-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll check it out after that once I have som data... not sitting hre watching it for hours if I dont need to

[03-Feb-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think worst that can happen is the miner may mine invlid blocks some times... but it will reject them ... and mine again

[03-Feb-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
in mempool I think

[03-Feb-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
miner has plenty of prints

[03-Feb-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or should

[03-Feb-19 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
oh nope

[03-Feb-19 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
that's a split

[03-Feb-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will print like `txid  is notarisataions max priotpty` or something

[03-Feb-19 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
`2019-02-03 09:15:28 priority 125132555.7 fee 0.00000000 KMD/kB txid efc7c54123a44695c1ca93ce9a5b04a2c1882912bbac0d7cec89ab26ae5673b4

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might need 6 nodes until the timestmap passes

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
what are these numbers

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just -printpriority in the miner set to enable as default

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
left it there for debug purpouse

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
it will print for all txs?

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[03-Feb-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the print for notarisation is to stdout

[03-Feb-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is wstill min sigs 6 until the timestamp....

[03-Feb-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana needs restarting after timestamp passes

[03-Feb-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh should restart iguana automatically... going to cron it here.

oh well nice tst for era chaige anyway

[03-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
the first block that includes a notatization will include coins for all unnotarized blocks

[03-Feb-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you really want o add chains on time now üòÑ

[03-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
the amount of blocks between notarizations is directly correlated to how much you are paid

[03-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
so a race to notarize first üòÑ

[03-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the first 4 to restart at the timestamp ... will probably get a mega pay out too

[03-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe4 no as big at the very first one tho

[03-Feb-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just cron start.sh every 15mins here... not sure if it will work or not... the code is there but I never tested it I dont think

@blackjok3r what is vout 0 in that cb tx

[03-Feb-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
vout 0 is the payment to the miner

[03-Feb-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be 0 coins

[03-Feb-19 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
