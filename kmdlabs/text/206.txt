becasuse any change I make ... miners can just revert at any time

[08-Jan-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait... this isnt too hard

[08-Jan-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The way the code works above its taking the total value to calc the priority and you were importing such a small amount you have no priority. 
I have a fix, I think.... 
I made the export 0.0001 flat tx fee, and changing the code that does it to calc its actual ytx fee. I think if this works., we need to bring back export_amount but copy the same check the mempool usues to check for absurd tx fees there. 😃

@TonyL

[08-Jan-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r Sounds cool 😃

[08-Jan-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems harder tahn that... just going to set imports to max and see if that helps first

[08-Jan-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem is my nodes mempool isnt fillingh here .. I ahev a node who is full, but if I restart it then ti may empty again.... mempool seems a little weird

[08-Jan-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKY getrawmempool | jq length
1763```
My mempool reduced 110 txs for 2 hours 🚀

[08-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its limiting 2 per block for some reason... never been noticed befrore lol

[08-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we always used 1 coin or more

[08-Jan-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0.001 is whats done it... I think

[08-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
treating it as 0 fee

[08-Jan-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Bottleneck, cool 😃

[08-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks for finding it

👍 

[08-Jan-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
No problem, sure. As soon as we avoid this limitation I think more edge cases finding is possible (let's say interesting what will happen if we'll fill blocks)
Btw could you pls merge: https://github.com/StakedChain/PoS_scripts/pull/3 ?

[08-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got 2 tx in mempool so far, might get a drink... this is taking a while 😅

[08-Jan-19 03:04 PM] TonyL#3577
If you need to fill a mempool - my latest script should do it ez

[08-Jan-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem is that the mempool on one node is stuck there and not sending

[08-Jan-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can fill another ...

[08-Jan-19 03:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Tony has a MigrationBlaster 😀

[08-Jan-19 03:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm

[08-Jan-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but not sure thats the best wayt here

I've tried to blast on one node only (which is my notary), so can't advice much on it :/

[08-Jan-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed change...

[08-Jan-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to get code to oother node...

[08-Jan-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
shoudl be safe... adds flat 0.0001 fee to all imports, and sets the dPriority to the same as a notarisation, for imports

[08-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if this helps we can go from there

[08-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did migrate of 1 coin, and went through instantly

[08-Jan-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so this is the issue.

[08-Jan-19 03:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Not txs quantity but tx amount?

[08-Jan-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the nValue

[08-Jan-19 03:11 PM] TonyL#3577
From which repo/branch possible to take these changes for test?

[08-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its setting its priority as a flat multipler of of the tx nValue (yours was very small)... combined with the code I made to prevent imports from having a fee (not that they used one before) this has the effect of making all your imports treated as a free tx... only 1-2 tx per block allowed

[08-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
master

[08-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure a miner just ahs to run new code and mempool will clear fast... not a proper solution though, miner doesnt liek getting no fees and will just change the code.

[08-Jan-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can allow fees, but prevent absurd... might make stress test more interesting... more fees means tx confirmed faster 😄

[08-Jan-19 03:15 PM] CrisF#3405
I'd better save up some coins if I'm going to be paying 99.999% fees.

[08-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant

[08-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont let you.... that was the entire reson I prevented anyone playing fees

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Fee is 0.0001

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it is now

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
flat fee

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fast fix

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be user settable

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I dont think that somebody will want to transfer 1 satoshi or so between chains

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, up to 99.999 😉

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Not much business cases 😃

[08-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the idea was even liek 1 or 2 wasnt to be done... which is why the code is like it is

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no matter we can fix it

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want to send a tiny amount, jsut use a fee

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like inverse banks

[08-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
restarted remote node.... mempool is empty

[08-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems mempool is got a bunch of orphaned tx in it maybe

[08-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does your script reboradcast constantly? Like mine?

[08-Jan-19 03:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Depends of part

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Usaully it's just trying to broadcast one tx from the list

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
particularly important on the last tx I think.

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
And in case of error sleep

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
To be as gentle as possible

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this could also be the problem... not sure though just thinking

[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Rebuilding node - will try to blast again then

[08-Jan-19 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just did 1000 1 per second

[08-Jan-19 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
see what happens

I see them flying by in explorer 😃

[08-Jan-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahd to start a mining node ... the constant rebroadcast every second was starting to break things 😂

[08-Jan-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
320 in

[08-Jan-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
damn these VMs on a single 600GB HDD ... so slow ... kkmd wasnt running takes liek 10 minutes to load lol

[08-Jan-19 03:29 PM] CrisF#3405
The `value out` is different on the transactions.

[08-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
change

[08-Jan-19 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
seeeing between 6000 and 9999

[08-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
value out includes change

[08-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
itys jsut the size of the input utxo - txfee I think

[08-Jan-19 03:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh..

[08-Jan-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOl whgen my kmd loads they are all going to end up on import at the same time

[08-Jan-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
600

[08-Jan-19 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
This would look ver good in that visualization smk posted earlier.

Wait till we get 20+ people spamming with Tony's blaster, haha.  TBe interesting to see the explorer trying to keepup.

[08-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a great idea for a blaster.... but with oracles loggin it wont work

[08-Jan-19 03:39 PM] CrisF#3405
That's easy, you just need 2 blasters.  First one for the oracle, hehe

[08-Jan-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if oracle is a seperate chain or 2 ... might still work

[08-Jan-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Idea is to leverage `cleanwallettransactions` and have exactly 1000 utxo... create raw tx with each of them... migrate...
Then on other chain when receive send them back.

pretty sure using createraw we can choose our inputs that make creating exports heaps faster.

[08-Jan-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as import arrives send it back

[08-Jan-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whole utxo .. .no change no bloat wallet

[08-Jan-19 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Started migrations, let's see what happens now 😃

[08-Jan-19 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
The biggest time consumer in migrations is notarizations, right?

[08-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes...

[08-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however ... which your waiting you can have an entire block of tx waiting fdor a notarisation

[08-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just can hit the daemon with rpc all at the same time

[08-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need random sleeps

[08-Jan-19 03:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I've reduced all sleeps time in my script btw

[08-Jan-19 03:45 PM] TonyL#3577
From 60 seconds to 10-15
