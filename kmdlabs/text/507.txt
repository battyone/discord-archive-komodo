yea hold on genie, I'll fix it

[31-Oct-19 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
is because bad fork is longer

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 just restart your node with `-testnode=1` in params please

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you'll want to remove -testnode=1 when blocks == longestchain in getinfo

leaving that is dangerous, will just keep mining away at a fork if it gets on one somehow

So good news... sorry if I caused or helped cause the fork issues... IDK... what I do know is I chose not to update my node early... I only did just now.

[31-Oct-19 01:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
First start it hung at forked block and wouldnt sync past on LABS

[31-Oct-19 01:26 PM] daemonfox#6136

hmmm, you'll need to find the point at which it forked. Invalidate the block after that then reconsider the block from the real chain

[31-Oct-19 01:37 PM] Alright#0419
once you find latest common block, invalidate the block after that on your node

[31-Oct-19 01:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
what you can do is sync the chain with -connect=95.216.150.177   wait till it's syced stop and restart without -connect
