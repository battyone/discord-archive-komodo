so the diff adjustment does what it does and adjusts the diff based on the blocks found

[12-Dec-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
but it takes longer than the usual 100 blocks because the PoW diff adjusts relative to the -ac_staked percentage

[12-Dec-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and hashrate could be a few CPU cores or a bunch of minis, and from genesis there is absolutely no way to know how much hashrate there will be, nor does it know how many coins there are, let alone how they are distributed

[12-Dec-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all of this combined means until height 2000 to 3000, likely blocks wont be 60 second apart and PoS percentage wont be at ac_staked

[12-Dec-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
further, depending on actual hashrate vs. coins and its allocations, some ac_staked percentages at the extremes close to 1 and 99 wont be precisely achieved

if you can improve its behavior, submit a pull request

@blackjok3r do you remember any other verus merge bugs than the null pubkey one?

[12-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are some issues with set generate,  although I'm not sure I fixed them or exactly what I did to fix it

[12-Dec-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i think just default values, so specifically calling setgenerate true N would overcome whatever defaults

[12-Dec-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not true, u must do set generate false first, I did figure out how to fix that, will have a look at code later and let u know

Ah, same issue as before

[12-Dec-18 12:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, not sure about that @CMaurice .  Will have to wait for one of the other guys.

[12-Dec-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Old bug

[12-Dec-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Generally has been laow ram.will pay 500 kmd if u can reproduce it

[12-Dec-18 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It that happens every time u start it don't do anything

[12-Dec-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i think a workaround is to launch with -disablewallet and get it to sync. stop and start normally

[12-Dec-18 02:58 PM] CMaurice#1685
this worked only after I removed the chain directory, so I don't know if just doing that might have worked

[12-Dec-18 03:01 PM] CMaurice#1685
errored after restart,  worked after removed dirstory

[12-Dec-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is indicative that the wallet is in an inconsistent state

[12-Dec-18 03:04 PM] CMaurice#1685
right, thanks

[12-Dec-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to usually be the wallet'

I have the same... chains are preobably stalled

[14-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at this point we arte just waiting for sapl;ing to activate and see what happens

[14-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if chains are staleld they are stalled.

[14-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[14-Dec-18 09:07 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[14-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as some chains are working

[14-Dec-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its fine

[14-Dec-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if none ... then problem

[14-Dec-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, not much effort is going into maintaining existing chains other than CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[14-Dec-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
they're all likely to be scrapped very soon

[14-Dec-18 09:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok, thanks !

[14-Dec-18 09:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What are the details for the LABS test chain? (so I can sync it and mine it)

[14-Dec-18 09:09 AM] jorian#4555
it doesn't exist yet

[14-Dec-18 09:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
the test chain?

[14-Dec-18 09:09 AM] jorian#4555
CFEkLAMEDUCKS is the test

[14-Dec-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
DUCKS is the closest chain

[14-Dec-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its still not exact as we added ac_period which it will also yuse.

[14-Dec-18 09:10 AM] jorian#4555
WTS 80k CFEKLAMEDUCKS

{Reactions}
😄 

[14-Dec-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a chain was meant to be strarted to test that, but everyone has been too busy. I am making PR to FSM for ac_period now as Alright tested it and said it was totalyl fine.

[14-Dec-18 09:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are the notaries the only ones mining CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[14-Dec-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries dont mine

[14-Dec-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or they shouldnt be

[14-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jorian#4555
i am notary and am mining on a different machine

[14-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jorian#4555
but apart from this channel no-one mines these test chains

[14-Dec-18 09:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Oh, so unlike KMD notaries, LABS notaries are only for notarisation?>

[14-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
not sure how that works

[14-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
master jok3r would know

[14-Dec-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... our notaries have all this extra stuff to preotect them from theretical attacks, and also maintin them selvs in as close to optimal state as possible without operator intervention

[14-Dec-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using them as a normal node is not reccomended

[14-Dec-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and might not even work in some cases.

[14-Dec-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is something we might need to look at, as the 0 BR chains need something to mine them...

[14-Dec-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it might be possible to amke notaries do that, and just burn all tx fees and never add the coinbase to the wallet... or make every 0BR chain mine all funds to some burn address no matter who mines it.

[14-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka LABS notaries are significantly more powerful over LABS than KMD notaries are over KMD or any other chain they notarize

[14-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
They need to verify momom data for cross chain transactions. Means enough of them could print coins from thin air. 🤐

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay, so who mines all the chains that get spawned then?

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
whoever spawns them

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
it's their chain

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
or whoever uses them rather

[14-Dec-18 09:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I suppose that makes sense. As they're the ones wanting to test the CC;s

[14-Dec-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to think of a way around that ... liek every node just mines, but receives notrhing or something.

[14-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka or just use them

[14-Dec-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only for 0BR

[14-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
it's not *only* for testing

[14-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r we'd need static diff but steady block time

[14-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
static diff would be very bad if block time isn't steady

[14-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
put a single GPU on that chain and it'll shit out blocks non-stop

[14-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
any way to limit it to 1 minute?

[14-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make the blocktime static (is blocktime > lastblocktime+60) dont mine it yet ... but any node can just timewarp ait and mine what they like.

[14-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would not gain them a single thing though

[14-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as there is no blcok reward

[14-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that also means we need to burn allk fees

[14-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oir there can be a tiny BR

[14-Dec-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would mean we dont need staking to stoip hash attacks aswell...

[14-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
I think POS is enough to move chains

[14-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
if you have an interest in seeing a chain survive, simply stake a tiny amount of coins

👌 

[14-Dec-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah same ... these ones have 0 PoS logic applied... I am stakign them all froma  single segid 😂  with wallets with 10,000+ utxo that are corrupted

[14-Dec-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its no doubt they are stalling... I went out of my way to break it

[14-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I cant fix it... so its best to just make it so that nodes never get into this condition

need to figure out how to make that as noob friendly as possible

[14-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
any feedback appreciated

[14-Dec-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should we add a staking chain with ac_period ?

[14-Dec-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
100% PoS

[14-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
why ac_period

[14-Dec-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to test it

[14-Dec-18 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
I tried it on 51 POS

[14-Dec-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant see why it would ever not work .. but I dont like that we are usign it at launch never testing it with a large number of nodes

[14-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
I still have the chain running, just never added it to notary network

[14-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
moment

[14-Dec-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, don't have it still

[14-Dec-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
If you want another chain, I'll start it

[14-Dec-18 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
just let me know what

[14-Dec-18 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
ac_period -> BLOODYCHAIN
