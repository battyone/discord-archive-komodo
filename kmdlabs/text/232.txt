It was actaully quite tricky to get it all working... That said, once I do it properly most of those tricky things will go away.

[20-Jan-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
By using V2 of verushash I can change the actual min diff in the chain params... rather than set diffrent difficulty multipliers in diffrent places of the code.

[20-Jan-19 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not sure what, but something is "off"
getmininginfo returns "difficulty": 5.277936732893012 for CFEKPOS51
and my 9900k can't crack a block even with 16 threads using new build
meanwhile
CFEKX running an older build returns 27 diff on server with 1/2 the GHz shits out blocks all day long with 4 threads

[20-Jan-19 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
woot woot, finally got a block
I'm thinking that the info return is what's off

[20-Jan-19 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
i.e. it's actually higher than 5.2

[20-Jan-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is a little strange... If it still playing up in a few hours ping me... I'll restart my staker and minre up and take a look.

[20-Jan-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think anything was pushed to master branch at all... So if there is a problem.. its because I forked the chain with the other branch

[20-Jan-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but notarisations were happening the entire time...so I doubt thats the case

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
20-50k LABS is more like a deposit

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
it's just to keep the chain moving it

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
not sure it's the best way to do it though

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You could slowly withdraw it back off over time I think

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain stops some labs will be lost.

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
will 100% POW work?

[20-Jan-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so... but who is buying LABS?

[20-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what gives it buy presure?

[20-Jan-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
How do we transfer all coins off of a chain if it requires staking coins to produce blocks

[20-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need a chain to cost *something* this was the best way I could think of to do that.

[20-Jan-19 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think it's a fork issue in any way, I think that it's more of an issue of not showing the correct diff in dual-mode because of the moving calculations when the % is close to target %

[20-Jan-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant recover all of them...

[20-Jan-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
don't think we should just make costs for the sake of making costs

[20-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why... I didnt work for an entire year to make a coin no body buys

[20-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just make the cost reasonable

[20-Jan-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
usefulness was always my main priority

[20-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can calibrate it to any amount by the % fo PoS

[20-Jan-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
>we make costs 
>it gets popular 
>someone forks with costs removed

[20-Jan-19 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`20-50k LABS is more like a deposit`
Mainly, my question was about the context of the amount
if supply = 200 gajillion then 20-50k LABS = less than if supply = 20 million

[20-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Someone is going to make an entire notary network for the sake of saving a few hundred bucks?

[20-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doubtful

[20-Jan-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
you did :trollface:

[20-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I made a notary network that couldnt do what the other one does

[20-Jan-19 09:35 AM] Alright#0419
lol just fucking with ya

[20-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
ok let's say we make this artificial costs, what stops someone from removing it?

[20-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
I do like the idea of a deposit kind of thing

[20-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What do you mean remove it... The chain params will have a % PoS that must be used or notaries wont add them.

[20-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
and if notaries do?

[20-Jan-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to have some cost... or ppl will just amke billion of chains and notaries will have 0 way to host them all

[20-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
🤔

[20-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not saying no costs whatsoever

[20-Jan-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the bounty fund is big enough and a chain needs to die... You maybe can pay the lost coins on that chain back via bounty fund...

[20-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
but the point was to give devs a place to have things tested for relatively cheap

[20-Jan-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So that its a deposit... not a constant cost... Our inflation is pretty low in th schheme of things... dont want to go burnign heaps of it.

[20-Jan-19 09:39 AM] Alright#0419
Who would be burning coins?

[20-Jan-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to make sure the thing can keep itself running... You cant expect LABS to just be accumulated for no reason... There has to be a revenue model .. notaries get paid iN LABS someone has to buy that.

[20-Jan-19 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Who would be burning coins?`
Some moron making raw txes for the wrong platform? :trollface:

[20-Jan-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
The inspiration for STAKED came from pos64 tests. We saw that jl was paying out *lots* of KMD to get a single feature tested. This made me realize this was a huge barrier of entry

[20-Jan-19 09:40 AM] Alright#0419
not every dev has the same resources as he, but they may be just as capable of making useful things

[20-Jan-19 09:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This made me realize this was a huge barrier of entry`
That was my main thing about the context of a 20-50k cost

[20-Jan-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was  anunber I pulled out of my ass, from what I had been testing with a chain that was wrking... It says in the propsal that it needs to be adjusted

[20-Jan-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In perspective there are only 350k cons in existance...

[20-Jan-19 09:42 AM] CrisF#3405
What would be a reasonable cost to make a chain and have it notarized?

[20-Jan-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So at this time... the cost cnat be anywhere near that much

[20-Jan-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Considering we are also wearing the dPoW KMD fees I'm not sure...

[20-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe % of supply must be locked for duration of the chain?

[20-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
that's essentially the same thing, but the price will grow steadily with supply

[20-Jan-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why make it more complicated than i needs to be... make the chain a % POS as a requirment... then it cost money

[20-Jan-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fuck making more things that couldbreak... this has taken an imense amount of time to get working stable... chaning it now is suicide

[20-Jan-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can always change the cost as time goes on... In fact I think we will need to... It wil be agreed by notaries who are the ones who need to provide the service... You dont want a situation where nobody wants to be a notary...

[20-Jan-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you end up with min sigs 3 or something... project dead at that point.

[20-Jan-19 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that's essentially the same thing, but the price will grow steadily with supply`
Isn't that disproportionately unfair to people that find out about it later, over "early adopters"?
imo, this is a close parallel to my largest issue with MNs; early adopters get in for 15 cents and someone that just finds out about its existence a year later pays $50-250k

[20-Jan-19 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
Need to look at my old notes and think this over

[20-Jan-19 09:47 AM] Alright#0419
we've had this conversation about 10 times already

[20-Jan-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The "cost" to make a chain should be static... but in what denomination of currency... The only thing I want to void is notaries having to pay to keep the network alive out of their own pockets.

[20-Jan-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as they are making some money... Then people should want to do it. Most people at the start will probably want to be in it just because we are doing soething now... but the novelty wil wear off after a while.

[20-Jan-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean we can run for a bunch of KMD notaries and offfload the cost to the market of KMD... but that seems quite unfair.

[20-Jan-19 09:52 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder this cost here not to earn money but to avoid any kind of spamming

[20-Jan-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS notaries should pay for them selvs the same was KMD notaries do.

[20-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its both... I dont want to make any money.. I just dont want this thing i spent so much of my time on dieing because it doesnt ahve any revenue.

[20-Jan-19 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577
If determine exact goal - it'll be easier to choose the amount

[20-Jan-19 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I mean we can run for a bunch of KMD notaries and offfload the cost to the market of KMD... but that seems quite unfair.`
The only "real" problem with that idea is that it presupposes our being elected 😛

[20-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is true also

[20-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt KMD voters would be happy with that situation.

[20-Jan-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, I *am* running this year

[20-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be avoided... One node for notariations fees seems plenty, as nearly all the KMD goes back to notaries and the CRYTPO holders via notarieation and transaction fees.

[20-Jan-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we start dumping it to pay for servers costs and things... Thats not really going to fly IMO.

[20-Jan-19 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think that's another context thing
atm "dumping" isn't an amount of KMD that would even be noticeable in any context and costs would have to rise significantly in order to be measurable

[20-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you let chain in the cluster be free or liek $10 we will be alrger than KMD notaries in a matter of months.

[20-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its simply free infrustructure .... We cant provide that unless the LABS coin has buying presure.

[20-Jan-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
But there is no BTC hashrate protection so price is fair

[20-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is BTC

[20-Jan-19 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If any KMD NN is taking "months" to make $10, they are doing something afu

[20-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we notarise to KMD

[20-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats not what I meant... I mean if you dont make the chains cost *something* then we will have more chains than KMD notary nodes in no time.

[20-Jan-19 10:00 AM] CrisF#3405
What is a reasonable cost for a chain?  $300 (in LABS) + NN fee.  Get $100 back when stop chain (deposit)?

[20-Jan-19 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
$300 in LABS is subjective

[20-Jan-19 10:01 AM] CrisF#3405
For example.

[20-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Again, definign it in $ is no good either... becasue diffrent places a $ is worth diffrent amoutns.

[20-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It ahs to be priced in LABS .... and the market will decide what LABS is worth.

[20-Jan-19 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
Joker, I do see your point now, and I think it's the best way to continue

[20-Jan-19 10:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Use some of that $ to fund  projects? NNs vote?

[20-Jan-19 10:02 AM] Alright#0419
we may have to tweak it after we see it in action though

[20-Jan-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great ... I thaught about this for a fair while... And this was the simplest solution i could come up with.

[20-Jan-19 10:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, in LABS.

[20-Jan-19 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the *something* is the defining "issue"
how much *something* and how to keep *something* from being inherently unfair to someone that finds out about LABS a year + from start vs someone that adopts a month in

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
what if someone wants to test something that is dependent on 100% POW chain?

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They can use LAB

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
What is this LAB

[20-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just chains that are not fungible
