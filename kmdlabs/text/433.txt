`help` shows```sendtoaddress "LABS_address" amount ( "comment" "comment-to" subtractfeefromamount )
```

[17-Jun-19 11:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
comments are optional, can be neglected

[17-Jun-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, fees appears optional to.

[17-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jorian#4555
how did that happen

{Reactions}
😬 

[17-Jun-19 11:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
whatever remains from your utxo - send_amount will be used as fee, normally there is a fee check & the cli won't create the transaction if the fee is too high

[17-Jun-19 11:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
but I never tried to send a high fee tx on LABS though

[17-Jun-19 11:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Is this the case with all `send*`?

[17-Jun-19 11:13 AM] jorian#4555
no, it wasn't a fee

[17-Jun-19 11:13 AM] jorian#4555
block reward stayed 8

[17-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jorian#4555
you just sent to a change address

[17-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jorian#4555

[17-Jun-19 11:14 AM] CrisF#3405
It looked like that also, but sent from my NN.

[17-Jun-19 11:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Pubkey set.

[17-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jorian#4555
REGmiJNT9HxYbpjr8bNfgJojTyxjy4vvru seems a mining addy

[17-Jun-19 11:15 AM] jorian#4555
that addy isn't yours?

komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS validataddress? make sure you didn't forget the ac_name

[17-Jun-19 11:16 AM] jorian#4555
otherwise you somehow set a pubkey for an address that isn't yours

[17-Jun-19 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
It's sent from my NN so pubkey is set.

[17-Jun-19 11:17 AM] jorian#4555
then you didn't import the privkey

[17-Jun-19 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I'm looking for the pubkey now.

[17-Jun-19 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Doesn't the pubkey have to be in the wallet for change to be sent to it though?

[17-Jun-19 11:19 AM] jorian#4555
no

[17-Jun-19 11:20 AM] jorian#4555
you'll get a warning though, when you set a pubkey that isn't in your wallet

[17-Jun-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Sorry, not following.
The pubkey is set for the address that sent the funds.

[17-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
`Doesn't the pubkey have to be in the wallet for change to be sent to it though?` no

[17-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
when you do this, you get a warning

[17-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
to prevent situations like these

[17-Jun-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I'm sorry I miss-wrote that.
Doesn't the `address` have to be in the wallet for change to be sent to it?

[17-Jun-19 11:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if pubkey set, but pubkey's address not in wallet, funds can end up in pubkey address outside wallet

[17-Jun-19 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I didn't import pubkey manually.  `start.sh` should have done that.  Notarizing fees are being deposited in the wallet so the sending pubkey should be imported.

[17-Jun-19 11:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
in config ini, if you validate the address does it match the pubkey?

[17-Jun-19 11:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and wif?

[17-Jun-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
address returns is valid and is mine true.

[17-Jun-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The wif is in the config.ini

[17-Jun-19 11:51 AM] CrisF#3405
(pubkey from validateaddress is the same as is in config.ini)

[17-Jun-19 12:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is this pubkey `027aeab0bc820845ad4a6eb0fbf7f4e8de39c56f544caf651b2c01230ebf0e96a4` and the pubkey returned by validated address the same ?

[17-Jun-19 12:07 PM] CrisF#3405
No, they are different.

[17-Jun-19 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
```validateaddress RNhYJAaPHJCVXGWNVEJeP3TfepEPdhjrRr```gives `03745656c8991c4597828aad2820760c43c00ff2e3b381fef3b5c040f32a7b3a34`

[17-Jun-19 12:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
can you try this command`pgrep -u phba2061 -a | grep LABS` , replace my username with yours, then look for the -pubkey in the output, does it match yours ?

[17-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just my 2 cents - check the address in the wallet you created the pubkey from (possibly KMD)

[17-Jun-19 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
username is the LABS username?
If so, ```pgrep: invalid user name: crisf
```

[17-Jun-19 12:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no your linux's username

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-Jun-19 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
@Bar_F1sh_Rel I created this address/pubkey using Decker's php script.

[17-Jun-19 12:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
this should work `pgrep -u $USER -a | grep LABS`

[17-Jun-19 12:23 PM] CrisF#3405

[17-Jun-19 12:23 PM] CrisF#3405
There is the pubkey you posted 😃

[17-Jun-19 12:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that is the pubkey of `REGmiJNT9HxYbpjr8bNfgJojTyxjy4vvru `

[17-Jun-19 12:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
and it's not yours ? 😂

[17-Jun-19 12:26 PM] CrisF#3405
So what has happened here?

[17-Jun-19 12:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the pubkey in your config.ini is `03745656c8991c4597828aad2820760c43c00ff2e3b381fef3b5c040f32a7b3a34`, not `027aeab0bc820845ad4a6eb0fbf7f4e8de39c56f544caf651b2c01230ebf0e96a4` ?

you did that with a pure `sendtoaddress`? 😕

[17-Jun-19 12:31 PM] jorian#4555
he set a pubkey that wasn't his. supposedly

[17-Jun-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh

[17-Jun-19 12:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
somehow his LABS daemon was launched with someone's pubkey set

[17-Jun-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
its a feature

[17-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jorian#4555
still it's weird that although his config.ini shows a 03 pubkey, the daemon was started with a 02 pubkey

[17-Jun-19 12:35 PM] jorian#4555
you must've done something wrong

[17-Jun-19 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, found that pubkey.  It was the pubkey to my old staking node.

[17-Jun-19 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Yes, it was just a `sendtoaddress`.

[17-Jun-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, on the good side, you own the key somewhere 😛

[17-Jun-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[17-Jun-19 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Well, it is possible I have it.  Hope so, it'll mean I might still have the receiving address wif (RXfJXXfUjtK9qRdqVtPFQxwdwNViH8bssT)...

[17-Jun-19 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405

@zatJUM

[17-Jun-19 12:53 PM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r How is this possible? Where could a btcpubkey of a previous installation have been copied elsewhere than config.ini?

[17-Jun-19 12:55 PM] zatJUM#9924
And why doesn't iguana take this key from config.ini only?

[17-Jun-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless you edited something, it does
both start and iguanastart (which is called by start) pull the pubkey from printkey.py which pulls it from config.ini

[17-Jun-19 01:34 PM] zatJUM#9924
I know that, but CrisF and phm87 seem to have iguana running a btcpubkey that is not (no more) in their config.ini, that's why I ask 😉

[17-Jun-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
still running from an earlier start that was never stopped?

[17-Jun-19 01:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
phm87 killed -15 iguana and restarted several times I believe

`but CrisF and phm87 seem to have iguana running a btcpubkey that is not (no more) in their config.ini`
 CrisF's problem is his LABS daemon was running with a different pubkey than the one in config.ini

if the only place it exists on your system is in log files, then it's 99% likely that you're still running the daemon from before and it should right itself when you stop the daemon and restart it with new key
