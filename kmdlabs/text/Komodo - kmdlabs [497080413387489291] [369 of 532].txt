[05-May-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-May-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weird...

[05-May-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I have that too.

[05-May-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
was looking at StakedNotary/komodo before

[05-May-19 01:29 PM] CrisF#3405
~/ is same as zatJUM

[05-May-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing I can see that isnt working here, is that there is a bunch of blocks around height 2700 that lock the daemon for ages, and take crazy amounts of time to process.,

Istarted it from StakedNotary/komodo/master though.

[05-May-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
That's the older commit I was looking at.

[05-May-19 01:32 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is this normal?```2019-05-05 13:24:13 DNS seeding disabled```

[05-May-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-May-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without that our debug.lkofg is usless... it floods connection refused constantly

[05-May-19 01:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
@CrisF  `after cleaning out .komodo` What did you clean exactly?

[05-May-19 01:37 PM] CrisF#3405
blocks chainstate komodostate* peers.dat notarisations

[05-May-19 01:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
I discovered I didn't have ~/komodo/src/komodod, so I `make` and now it syncs

sweet glad that was just a mistake on my part and not an actual bug lol...

[05-May-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still very strange why it gets stuck on those blocks around 2700-3000

Well, snapshot was done, 20 blocks more have been computed, and... and I believe I failed again üò¶

[05-May-19 06:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think I misunderstood the rules. Have to read them again

[05-May-19 07:04 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is this the RPC to know which are the addresses which have won? ```paymentsinfo '["5bbc56201b1a61bdba4f708dc64928ad7a854f2e5137c93eba309f95756d02d4"]'```

hey dudes, sorry for the hold up on this voting dapp. I realize I'm holding up launch with it

[05-May-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
problem I'm having is that we planned to use a 30 minute block time chain, but oraclesdata won't allow mempool spending of oraclessubscribe UTXOs. You'll have to register, wait for a block then vote for now ü§∑

[05-May-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
trying to figure out how to enable mempool spending for oraclesdata

[05-May-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
had to make a couple changes the oraclessamples rpc as well

[05-May-19 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool spending used to work

[05-May-19 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it ever did, I think you might be thinking of something else. When i first designed trollbox, it required a confirmed oraclessubscribe(or change from data) UTXOs in order to do oraclesdata

[05-May-19 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
so like if you wanted to be able to send 10 messages per block, you had to subscribe 10 times

[05-May-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
working around it for now, people can just wait for a conf for now, spent too much time already trying to figure out the mempool spending thing

[05-May-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
I added something to that PR btw, `oraclessamples <oracle_txid> <publisher_pubkey> 0` will now return all samples ever made

[05-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant please do `./start.sh` on your notary. Added a chain we'll be using for long term oracles. 30 minute block times

[05-May-19 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
Also pushed unfinished voting dapp, will be adding stuff to it throughout the day. If you have a minute, could use some testers

Updating now.  It's taking it's time.

[05-May-19 10:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Quite a bit added to lib.py üëç

[05-May-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
there's those two dummy polls up right now, would appreciate voting on them

[05-May-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
will make it easier to do the tallies if I have multiple notaries voted on them

[05-May-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419

where did you get that?

[05-May-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
after running what?

[05-May-19 10:34 PM] CrisF#3405
std, after `./start.sh`

[05-May-19 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
seems unrelated to what I just did I think

[05-May-19 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
can you ping me when you get the dapp running

[05-May-19 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
vote on those 2 polls, create a new poll

[05-May-19 10:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Good just stop spamming and now continuing.

[05-May-19 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
the results option is just a dummy btw

[05-May-19 10:40 PM] Alright#0419

[05-May-19 10:42 PM] Alright#0419

[05-May-19 10:42 PM] Alright#0419

[05-May-19 10:42 PM] Alright#0419

[05-May-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
yea I have some messed up nodes on the network i think

[05-May-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
it's fine

[05-May-19 10:43 PM] Alright#0419
just register to both polls and create a new one

[05-May-19 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
takes 1 conf after registering before you can vote

[05-May-19 10:44 PM] Alright#0419

(fyi)

[05-May-19 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
yea that's a bit of an edge case

[05-May-19 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
if the oraclescreate tx doesn't have a change output, I can't tell who created it

[05-May-19 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
I figured people won't be creating polls all that often, so it's not that big of an issue

[05-May-19 11:14 PM] Alright#0419

it can't have 2 0.0001 UTXOs atm

[05-May-19 11:16 PM] Alright#0419
I think I can just add address to the oraclescreate data so this doesn't matter

[05-May-19 11:17 PM] Alright#0419
it's a signed message so impersonation isn't an issue anyway
