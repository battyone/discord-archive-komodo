first year is probably better off renting 128GB ram and 1.5TB of SSD is the only req

[28-Oct-18 08:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
howd you get that much ram so cheap?

[28-Oct-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
DDR3 ? got lucky üòÖ

[28-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was looking at getting some more... and another 128gb is more than the server was lol

[28-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
monthly rate for the server I am using for my notary is $20

[28-Oct-18 08:48 AM] Alright#0419
there will be ~10080 STAKED each week divided between notaries based on % of notarizations done if we go with my proposal

[28-Oct-18 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
Anyone who says they want to be a notary before launch can be a notary. After that we will require notaries to lock x% of the total circulating supply to remain a notary

[28-Oct-18 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
changing every 2 months

[28-Oct-18 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
according to my proposal, none of this is canon

How does a week for proposals, a week for deciding on them then launch asap sound?

Who do you rent server from @Alright  ?

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
vultr

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
*would not* recommend

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been using them a while

[28-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
They allocate more ram than they have

[28-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
If anyone wants to run a notary and does not want to pay up front costs of the server, please contact me. We can make a deal for a % of STAKED paid to your notary for a 2 month period.

[28-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw my vultr accout is down to $5

[28-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[28-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
mine might be negative again

[28-Oct-18 09:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Mines down 30. been a busy month...

[28-Oct-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I left one turned off for weeks lol... $15 for nothing

would love to learn

[28-Oct-18 10:20 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r - just interested - what is the basic (use) breakdown of the 128GB / 1.5TB requirement?

[28-Oct-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is for KMD notary node not staked

[28-Oct-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED notaries are currently on VULTR 4 core 8GB ram VPS which are $20 a month

[28-Oct-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
VPS makes sense as you can increase size, however with the staked system deploying a new node is no problem as it basically all automated.

[28-Oct-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  has offered to host some VPS for people if they dont want to risk the costs and want to have a go btw üòÉ

[28-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool, I have a proxmox setup at home (natted ipv4 and ipv6 tunnel) with some spare room I was looking for a new project for.

[28-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I can spin up various linux quick for tests

[28-Oct-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes you can run StakedNotary behind NAT .. only a single port needs to be open

[28-Oct-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very fast internet helps a lot, but 100mbit would work just fine... I think my main net notary is around that.

[28-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Yeah - I have the fibre 100mbit stuff

[28-Oct-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not for the bandwidth but more ping

[28-Oct-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
perfect

[28-Oct-18 10:27 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool - count me in for the vote then - I'll start looking at the setups

all values for datafee except 1 cause error. why is that?

[28-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont acutally know, but is not data fee set some other place ?

[28-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and do you have balance to pay for it... that got me on the first chat room

datafee is mentioned twice, but the second time it's to fund the oracle

[28-Oct-18 11:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got  over 100, though it does drop while testing...

[28-Oct-18 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe something in the StakedChain/troll box repo can give an eample ? its python but easy to read

[28-Oct-18 11:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well, now it wont work with 1 either...

[28-Oct-18 11:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

How do I stake KMD?

[28-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is staked, the chain will be 51% PoS it is not KMD, but built with KMD tech.

[28-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Diffrent coin

[28-Oct-18 12:23 PM] 9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ±#1533
KMD does not allow staking? @blackjok3r

[28-Oct-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD gives you 5.1% rewards

[28-Oct-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need to stake it

[28-Oct-18 01:11 PM] daemonfox#6136

[28-Oct-18 01:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
Id like to run a notary if I can figure it out lol

[28-Oct-18 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
@Deleted User @Alright id be interested in some upfront hosting or an easy node to get familiar... I have KMD and need to consolidate my STAKED but should have ~25K

[28-Oct-18 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
Airdrops on staked chains kept rolling even if I didnt get a chance to keep staking correct? I have all my keys

[28-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED1 keys are valid on STAKED4 and STAKED4 snapshot will be airdropped to STAKED

[28-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
2 and 3 also

[28-Oct-18 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ok I will load it up, import and consolidate for the final drop

[28-Oct-18 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
I figured keys would stay valid no reason for them to have deviated per chain

[28-Oct-18 01:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
If you DM me details on your node hosting, ill get back to you today after I finish cleaning this nasty PC

Starting fresh with staked and staked notary (noob - no coins) I have both installed, but not started (webpage for staked shows startstring from Sept - is this still the correct chain? and notary instruction is asking to edit  config.ini with keys .....) ???

[28-Oct-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Both repos require you to make a config.ini

[28-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staked will start a single chain and build the correct branch for you

[28-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
StakedNotary will build and start everything

[28-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing will work without config.ini

[28-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
