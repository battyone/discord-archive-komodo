for the above rpc calls, can you add lastnotarizedheight to the response?

i would actually give that Notarized button a different color

@LabsAssistant
Dear #kmdlabs NNs and community testers, I'm proud to propose you testing of pricesCC consensus module on kmdlabs platform.

I want to request 1% of weekly emission (1008 LABS) for next week (as a start, actually I think testing will take much more time). As I know it's a maximum which can be allocated for a single bounty campaign.

I don't have a clear understanding yet how exactly distribute it between bug-finders but will work on it.

A raw version of this module mechanics description can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5hJ_ZeBWK-xP3f3RM48ruG3mOlsPbbLcXjyqtn0Oew/edit

Actually, CFEKBET0 chain already live few days and matured for betting (running on such daemon https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/tree/pricescomp)

Also, I've prepared portable bundles for Ubuntu and OSX: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/releases/tag/0.0.1

Hope such form of proposal is fine. Looking forward to feedback üòÉ

I will be making a bountycc chain that doors bounty payments after the kmd hard fork. Until such time we would need to do some work around using in chain vote dapp and creating fungible chain with premine that can be used to pay the  recipients

@gcharang  
Pushed version of LABS and StyakedNotary that sets global "LABS_FLAG"="ENABLE_LABS.
I changed the exception in`db.h` so that ROGUE only uses it, and added exit to cclib if LABS falg has been set. 
Also added those 2 RPC changes you wanted. If there are no reported problem with this I will merge to jls repo ready for hard fork.

If this works, LABS and KMD will be equal at hard fork.

Next few days I will be busy testing KMD hard fork code. Will need some help, also poseted in #notarynode  earlier today. May take a fwe days to get orginised for that, but it will be a good test to make sure it all works.
