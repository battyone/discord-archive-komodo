[23-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

[23-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[23-Nov-18 03:26 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Nice - added the time-offset oand connections

[23-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I didnt add shit ... I grabbe the main net script by @webworker01  and ripped out al the main net parts

[23-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
took 5mins

[23-Nov-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You will find most of the stakednotary repo is built on top of other people scripts

[23-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
start.sh is mostly all I added...

[23-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
talking of which - what is the danger (if any) of running start.sh on a running notary?

[23-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no danger

[23-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its designed to do that

[23-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can even put it on cron tab

[23-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it will just stay up to date

[23-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I find its not always working perfectly... and can end up with node down

[23-Nov-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will imporve over time though as we find the issues with it and fix them

[23-Nov-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`[KMD] Error: couldnt create duplicates tx` <- what's the min funding for the splitter?

[23-Nov-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
generally that means only a copule of things:
1) there is no utxo that is unspent
2) the utxo is the worng type (this is not well defined) if this is the case, send he entire balance to youself
3) you dont have any coins

[23-Nov-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`1) there is no utxo that is unspent` that addy has 0 UTXOs, that's why I'm asking about min I need 游땥

0.1 is enough ... what coin is this on KMD ?

[23-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@CMaurice  did you use connect=103.6.12.112

[23-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that can be needed to get it past some blocks, not sure why proptocol isnt banning properly

[23-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
not currently. as there are only a few notaries up - time between notarisations is sitting around 100seconds.
So 0.2 would last around 2 days?

[23-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
although maught its somehting else

[23-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can fund KMD if needed ?

[23-Nov-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User  I added that today only, as making the json manually every time led to human error and things breaking...

[23-Nov-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they always use the same keys

[23-Nov-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
