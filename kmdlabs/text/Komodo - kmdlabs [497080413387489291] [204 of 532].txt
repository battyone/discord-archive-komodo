No you cant link back... There is no possible way to

[08-Jan-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unfortuantly... Unless we logg that data with this format to an oracle ot a DB

[08-Jan-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then somehow enable the explorer to retreive the data

[08-Jan-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all gets very comploicated

[08-Jan-19 11:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Easy enough to use back button on browser.

Somehting like that... with all people submitting to their own oracle ... possible have 1 or 2 oracle chains that are not in cluster to log too.

[08-Jan-19 11:33 AM] CrisF#3405
The explorer is awesome.  It was said that it would be impossible to do what you guys did today when we first saw migrates on an explorer.

`{"src_chain":"CFEK", :src_sum":10, "export_txid": <txid>, "timeofexport":1546341430, "dest_chain":"CFEKED", "dest_sum":10, "import_txid": <txid>, "timeofimport":1546341430, "block_confirmed_import",<blockhash>}`

[08-Jan-19 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was impossible until we added that source chain to the burn tx

[08-Jan-19 11:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Any need for a notarization, or other data, to conclusively provide proof of migrations?

[08-Jan-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
block confirmed import is to use `getimports` RPC to scan for the import txid, and check the export txid.

[08-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A script should be able to verify everything after the fact no problem... may take a while to run... but it will work.

[08-Jan-19 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
How about time of 'arrival' ( when the coins are spendable)?  It would be good to a lot of data to get a good idea of times.

[08-Jan-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible maybe to do this a diffrent way that would be faster need to think about it... With existing tools that way works, might be a little slow though.

[08-Jan-19 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Something to test future upgrades against.

[08-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
time imported should be a confirmed block.

[08-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the script waits for confirm... at least it did... not sure if tony super speedy script does.

[08-Jan-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
haha

[08-Jan-19 11:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the time section should be confirmed time...

[08-Jan-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easily checked... I may even change it... (the data is probably all in getrawtransation now because of explorers)

[08-Jan-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So really with that, you need a txid of import only to prove it as james said. It would be good to log some extra thigns though to really push the oracles contract.

[08-Jan-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
I will be a good (rare) opportunity to have a larger variety of testers with a mix of systems and locales.

{Reactions}
💯 

[08-Jan-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
As long as we have a back-up plan, like a really basic script, if things go bad, then might as well try as much as we can when we have the chance.

[08-Jan-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so final version I think is this:
`{"src_chain":"CFEK", :src_sum":10, "import_txid": <txid>, "timeofexport":1546341430, "dest_chain":"CFEKED", "dest_sum":10, "export_txid": <txid>, "timeofimport":1546341430,}` 
timeofexport must be confirmed export tx (not went created, so we can check it on chain)
timeofimport must be confirmed on target so we can check it on chain
getrawtransaction can be used to verify the submitted data is correct
getimports can be looped over every chain in the cluster to gather global stats after the fact.

[08-Jan-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then is should be easy to see, if the total amounts excceed each user added together, (no coins were lost or created)

[08-Jan-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe minimum 4 chains in the cluster + 2 chains for oracles. This can be discussed by everyone, remember right now we need a full KMD node on each VPS doing migrates. So launchinfg 300 google clouds isnt an option 😄

{Reactions}
😋 

[08-Jan-19 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
OK.  So that's the stats and proof. There's another big thing.

[08-Jan-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats all we need yes

[08-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A central place for KMD signing would be great, but probably out of reach at this stage.

[08-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I think in a stress test, it could be overwhelmed.

[08-Jan-19 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
We need to know of failures.
And get a log for debugging.

[08-Jan-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
log fails locally

[08-Jan-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You will know if they failed, because you have txid of export but no import tx

[08-Jan-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm

[08-Jan-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe then the stats need to be 2 seperate JSONs

[08-Jan-19 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah.

[08-Jan-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`{"src_chain":"CFEK", :src_sum":10, "export_txid": <txid>, "timeofexport":1546341430, "hex": <export tx full hex>, "payouts":<payouts hash> }  
{"dest_chain":"CFEKED", "dest_sum":10, "import_txid": <txid>, "timeofimport":1546341430}`

[08-Jan-19 11:48 AM] CrisF#3405
That would be useful for future tests.  2 separate modules.

[08-Jan-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats much better.... confirm your export log it to oracle

[08-Jan-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then when import is confirmed log it

[08-Jan-19 11:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Could a script push a persons fail log (like the log on your previous script) to a logging oracle?

[08-Jan-19 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the import fails, the script should already be logging it... so push to file,. then send into oracle.

[08-Jan-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not that you need to

[08-Jan-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because you know things failed if exports > imports

[08-Jan-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Use oracle data to total up all exports... then teh getimports RPC for total imported across all chains... if these are not the same... something went wrong...

[08-Jan-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm what happens though, if its a VPS crash or something... script should save the export tx

[08-Jan-19 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
On your previous script the fail logs were sent to a file.

[08-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
updated

[08-Jan-19 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Could that, or something like it, be sent to an oracle.

[08-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes you can send the export hex and payouts to oracle.

[08-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then if script fdails, the tx can be resumed

[08-Jan-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at any time, by any person

[08-Jan-19 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
So you could get a view of what is happening somewhat real-time?

[08-Jan-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dunno about real time tbh ... that would only work with either explorers, or the `getimports` RPC being called on blocknotify on each chain

[08-Jan-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only one node has to do that

[08-Jan-19 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If smk has any spare time, he would be best to have a look at doing something for that

[08-Jan-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
updated JSON, please record that for me 😃 I need to run.

[08-Jan-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothign here is stone... we can change it, have a start though.

[08-Jan-19 11:55 AM] CrisF#3405
He should have a look at the ```{"src_chain":"CFEK", :src_sum":10, "import_txid": <txid>, "timeofexport":1546341430, "dest_chain":"CFEKED", "dest_sum":10, "export_txid": <txid>, "timeofimport":1546341430,}``` too.

[08-Jan-19 11:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll put a copy of them all on the pad.

[08-Jan-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what he would need tbh to display thigns

[08-Jan-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything is in the getimports RPC ..

[08-Jan-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
main thing here is to prove they all worked. 😄

[08-Jan-19 11:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah.  To me it looks similar to hes JSON suggestion for data format.

[08-Jan-19 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405
After smk checks is it pretty much ready for Alright and Mylo to have a look at?

[08-Jan-19 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405
(they both asked today)

[08-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah Alright or Tony will need to add it to the migrate script and write some instructions

[08-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything I put down there is avalible in the script... at stages... after its complete you pust to oracle before continiuing.

[08-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to run

[08-Jan-19 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok I'll put it in the pad and ask smk to check

[08-Jan-19 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405
tHIS COULD USE YOUR INPUT 😃

I can use the scale vis assets I guess... but I need a data feed

[08-Jan-19 12:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ideally seomthing fresh can be made, depends on timeline

[08-Jan-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd like to see the chains as discrete items, with the migrations between them visualised.

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can fetch all imports in real time with getimports RPC

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this is pretty cool - http://metrocosm.com/global-immigration-map/

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Tony's script - I have a modded version that writes all hexes to a file. Was going to look at a version with less user output for automating - but might wait for Tony's with threading.

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
hang on, Il update my nodes and check the rpc

[08-Jan-19 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  That sounds cool. Could you please talk with @TonyL about it?

[08-Jan-19 12:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that json string seems to have enough to animate migrations.

[08-Jan-19 12:23 PM] CrisF#3405
That looks great smk762.  Something like that for the chains would be very good for many reasons.

[08-Jan-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
value = dot radius
time import vs time export = dot velocity
import/export chain = start/end of animation

[08-Jan-19 12:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
we still have colors up the sleeve for address/pubkey identification

[08-Jan-19 12:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can that be derived using the txids?

[08-Jan-19 12:26 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel In v2 I'm not using threading, just using lists (hexes or txids on each step) in step by step flow. Not hard to output any transactions list to file if needed. Minimising prints much in script itself may make script hard to debug if something go wrong -  I think it's better to just forward stdout on execution to file if needed to make logs

[08-Jan-19 12:28 PM] TonyL#3577
So there is let's say `payouts_list` or `signed_hexes_list` and you can save to file/files all that you need

[08-Jan-19 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Will publish this one asap

[08-Jan-19 12:29 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool. I'll check it out tonight and feedback.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator The 4 versions of the info are now up the ptop of the pad for you.  I believe that version 3 might be the semi-final version.

[08-Jan-19 12:32 PM] CrisF#3405
This is for the Migrations Test. More stats later for the cluster.
