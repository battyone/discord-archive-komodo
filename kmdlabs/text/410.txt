Here's a message that can be verified with the PGP key on my NN proposal.

[28-May-19 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Sorry for the trouble (and pissed off I've been missing all the fun :abusedsmily: )

[28-May-19 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405

[28-May-19 12:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Oops, can't attach a file. Will put it up on my github proposal and attach a link.

Hi, Is anyone else getting `-` times on their stats? ```-CHAIN-     -NOTR- -LASTN- -UTXO-    -BAL-   -BLOX- -LASTB- -CON- -SIZE-
KMD[U]                 11m     24   10.209  1375601     54s    94   302M 0 mined
LABS           118     11m     16   32.693     5757    -32s    20   740K @ 14:55``` This is using @webworker01's script.  I'm wondering if I broke something commenting out things (line#210) to get it to display properly with just one chain...

[28-May-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!

[28-May-19 01:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I haven't seen one over a minute yet.

Speaking of staking, my balance is lower than yesterday Having trouble staking for sure.:abusedsmily:

[28-May-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I'll check...

[28-May-19 01:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Yep, that was it.  Thanks @webworker01, 1 :treasure: found!

Apparently I'm still not much of a staker...

[28-May-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's just wrong on so many levels 👆🏽

[28-May-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice you voted on the wrong poll for Tony's chain

[28-May-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
bit of a problem getting the CFEKBET0 prices chain running, need joker to fix something before we can proceed

[28-May-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
Also if you don't want to notarize LABSBET0, please explicitly vote no, so we have some idea of how many people are willing to notarize it at the ac_notarypay price

[28-May-19 02:48 PM] Alright#0419
if it's the price you're unhappy with, you can select subjective and it will prompt you to input the reason you find it subjective, use that to state what ac_notarypay amount you would notarize it for

[28-May-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i heard there was some new LABS coin or something?

[28-May-19 03:02 PM] CMaurice#1685
Huh @Alright , thought I checked the numbers, thanks

[28-May-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
it's the one that says UPD! in the name

[28-May-19 03:05 PM] CMaurice#1685
So I got TUIstaker.py working on Debian 9, one part of tricks was to pip3 install python-bitcoinlib, possibly because was compiled from source

[28-May-19 03:06 PM] CMaurice#1685
anyway... hacked stakerlib to the -datadir i'm using to keep komodo and StakedNotary/komodo running separately

[28-May-19 03:08 PM] CMaurice#1685
to run everything I need all komodo-cli calls to be appended with -datadir, but everything should be ok 'cos the rpc_connection calls won't require this, right?

[28-May-19 03:08 PM] CMaurice#1685

@phm87 👆

[28-May-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
did you give him the key?

[28-May-19 03:16 PM] Mylo#8306
instructions given, it's on a VPS with sshkey and gpg to unlock passphrase.

[28-May-19 03:16 PM] phm87#7395
I will take mylo key tonight and do it tonight. Sorry I am still at work

[28-May-19 03:16 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry for the delay

[28-May-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
no worries, just giving a reminder

[28-May-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419

[28-May-19 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
bootstrap of the chain worked fine to start

[28-May-19 06:05 PM] Exile13#4458
Oh, I was advised by @Alright to build from scratch since we are in production now

[28-May-19 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136

[28-May-19 07:42 PM] phm87#7395
I got Mylo key securely, I imported it into KMD (not into LABS), I stopped iguana then I restart ./start.sh it updated, it compiled then it ended with:
```[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...
 Starting KMD Failed: help human!```
As I am a human, what can I do to help komodo daemon ?

[28-May-19 07:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
cd to StakedNotary/komodo/master and launch komodod

[28-May-19 07:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
see if it fails and why

[28-May-19 07:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
if it doesnt fail just let it sync like that for a bit

[28-May-19 07:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats what mine is doing right now

[28-May-19 07:51 PM] phm87#7395
I relaunched the whole thing while I was waiting and it crashed with a big stack trace, I'll paste it on pastebin 
I'll try your advice, thank you

[28-May-19 07:51 PM] phm87#7395
komodod is still running on my side

[28-May-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
then fromt he same dir komodo-cli getinfo

[28-May-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
and watch it

[28-May-19 07:53 PM] phm87#7395
