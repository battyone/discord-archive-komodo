I think I have fixed the cleanwalletnotarisations RPC ... also added logs... altough I think it needs to have the vectors sorted and filterered for unique hashes ... to make the logs a bit nicer i really dont care about that at this point... just need it working lol

i'm pretty sure the issue only arises when you have claimed intrest ... so our ndoes are not affected, due to not having over 10KMD utxo in them

[11-Nov-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
removed symlink from update_komodo.sh in StakedNotary ... no required any more

[11-Nov-18 08:33 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Something a bit odd about :1M:  migrate.
Pre-migrate```~/staked$ ./asset-cli CFEKED getbalance 
383191.08448008```
Post-migrate```~/staked$ ./asset-cli CFEKED getbalance
1383191.08448008``` Now```~/staked$ ./asset-cli CFEKED getbalance
383191.08448008```
```"walletversion": 60000,

CFEKED is not on a fork ?

[11-Nov-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we horribly broke these chains in the last day or so ... really need to start new ones lol

[11-Nov-18 08:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahhh, not sure.

[11-Nov-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
get info check longest chain is == blocks

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] CrisF#3405
oh, debuglog

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] gt#2812
i had balance issues as well when trying to migrate 10k plus

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe the mining node is not updated ?

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] CrisF#3405
```"blocks": 13578,
  "longestchain": 13578,```

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the max money is a hard forking consensus change

[11-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the mining node is orphaning the txs... best guess I can make

[11-Nov-18 08:37 AM] CrisF#3405
ahh

[11-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or A mining node to be mor specific

[11-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a node that accepts the TX mines a block

[11-Nov-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then anohter node, mines a longer chain that will not accept it

[11-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
adn the tx is pushed back to the mempool

[11-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will just need to battle on here with what we have .. i have a few more things to get done can start new chains

[11-Nov-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its really paying up, but stp using it üò¶

[11-Nov-18 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok cool.  I was wondering why it became unconfirmed.  That explains it üëç

[11-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
similar to what happened when we first tried to launch the staked notaries way back when... 2 chains battleing it out

[11-Nov-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becuase on diffrent verions

[11-Nov-18 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405

[11-Nov-18 08:44 AM] Alright#0419
all chains on master now?

[11-Nov-18 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe so. Blackjok3r can confirm.

[11-Nov-18 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
probably my nodes mining the fork

[11-Nov-18 08:46 AM] Alright#0419
have to update all of them

[11-Nov-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Nov-18 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
üëå

[11-Nov-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I merged pretty much everythig into master ...

[11-Nov-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to merge FSM into a new branch and start playing with that, and get a pool working with the new getblocktemplate RPC

[11-Nov-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we cn add a chain with founders reward, and maybe do an era change

[11-Nov-18 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what you're doing with getblocktemplate

[11-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... its pretty simple man ...

[11-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pass the coinbase as a normal tx and make the pool use it

[11-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
intead of making its own

[11-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that way it can have a CC tx, multisig what ever

[11-Nov-18 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mining a % of block reward to fauct ... mining a % of BR to a contract that distributes automatically based on notarisation counts etc....

[11-Nov-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My idea for that, is to have the notarisation to KMD, also sent to STAKED ... (the main chain)

[11-Nov-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to a contract .... or just a normal address, a contract can referace ... to count how many notarisations each node makes.

[11-Nov-18 08:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then after X blocks, pays out

[11-Nov-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem all that hard... but it requires a pool to be able to make a CC tx in the coinbase ... which is liek 100% impossible to do

[11-Nov-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so dont let the pool make a coinbase... make the daemon do it

[11-Nov-18 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
have you tried ac_script yet?

[11-Nov-18 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
will be testing it out in a bit

[11-Nov-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not yet ... I need to merge FSM into a brnach on staked first

[11-Nov-18 08:58 AM] Alright#0419
should allow for same thing joker is trying I believe

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a diffrent thing

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
can force a script in coinbase

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot have a dynamic tx there... just a staitc one

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't it be static?

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im still making the pool with the change ... IU dont care

[11-Nov-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I alrady made it work ...seems supid not to add it as an option to KNOMP

[11-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
so is there no need for ac_script?

[11-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
how can I test your implementation

[11-Nov-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes there is ...

[11-Nov-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The pool canot pay to a multisig in its current form man im sure of it ... but go ahead and test it

[11-Nov-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stratum can only do pubkeyhash and pubkey (maybe not even pubkey)

[11-Nov-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot pay to script as far as I am aware ... you need the coinbase mod to allow -ac_script to work with the startum

[11-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
I honestly don't have a good grasp of either

[11-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
I understand what I need to do to test ac_script but not your implementation

[11-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need to do anything to test my implementation

[11-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
youjust put the whatever it needs to be in the pool_config.json

[11-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it will just work

[11-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
are we ready for a chain based on it?

[11-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IF I can work out hwo to add an option to the pool config json and have it actually actiuvate ... atm its a hardfork to the pool thats not backwards comatible

[11-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can, but I need to merge ythe FSM into astaked ... and the MLT chainw as totally broken

[11-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I dont ewvne knowif FSM is going to totally fuck everything thats working atm ...

[11-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have things to do before we can merge that in... not going to just yolo it and break everything

the merge is fucking bullshit ... I guess I need to ask james if streamer can be merged to FSM after this, as these conflicts are like impossible to deal with atm ..

[11-Nov-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if the streamer options are done correctly, i can accept a pull request

[11-Nov-18 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works ... but merging it inot this might have broken it, I will need to test it all

[11-Nov-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I stupidly did it in staked, so might not be possible to merge JUST the streamer options in ... staked is compatible with KMD and all AC though ...

[11-Nov-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you could start from my FSM branch and just add in the things needed for streamer

[11-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That might be the only way to do it ...

[11-Nov-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a generally cool feature to have

[11-Nov-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think it needs a small modification, so you can only use ht eprivate chains feature

[11-Nov-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without the super easy minng/fast blocks

[11-Nov-18 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
enables even more use cases

[11-Nov-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810

Very easy way to do it, ac_stream=1 for normal difficulty ac_stream=2 for easy diff.

[11-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
merging it to FSM will be pretty hard, but i'll do it I think, so then its done, otherise it will just get harder and harder the longer I leave it. I did want @Alright  to test it first, maybe he can test it on FSM instead.

[11-Nov-18 10:15 AM] Alright#0419

Need to hear some opinions on this. This is in no way definitive, just an idea. What do you guys think of having double emissions for the first 2 months. Half of this would act as normal(10% for notaries, 90% for pos/pow) the other half would be airdropped to KMD. After 2 months we would have ~806k to airdrop to KMD. Some napkin maths say that'd be 1 STAKED/~140 KMD
