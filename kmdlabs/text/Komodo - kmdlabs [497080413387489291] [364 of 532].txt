starting from scratch is hard... takes a fair while to get something that works, once you do though adding on to it is quite easy. Break problem down into smaller parts. Ive written down about 2-3 pages of notes and stuff while doing this, hope it can help others,

that is a lot of instantiation!!

yeah, I think there will still be quite a few more.

For new chain?

[02-May-19 06:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
103.6.12.112 should be working, don't need to update yet though, its going to take a day to confirm the chain works as expected.

cool. It will take 1440 block*2 before anyone can release the funds. We sitting on 637 now. I will ping stakers to update and add the chain to notaries a bit alter today before we hit the first founders fee payment.

Ran into a couple of build issues, on one machine. Want to see if I can fix those before I get ppl to run it. Otherwise going to have lots of ppl complaining.

I think a good CC would be a offline dex trade

[03-May-19 04:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[03-May-19 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This CC is just ridiculous and stupid tbh... But I need a financial incentive for people to break the thing before I go building more stuff on top of it.

[03-May-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
We have some new chains added. CFEKPAY for the paymentsCC game, and LABSRCTEST which is another clone of the LABS main chain. STAKED4 airdrop has happened, and I beleive there is a chain oracle with the details of the airdrop saved into it. I am staking LABSRCTEST, can others please do that also?
If we could get a couple of GPUs or ASICS on this chain just for a few days that would be quite helpful, as this is the last test before launch! 
Yes its happening! We are actually starting the LABS chain 8-9 months after STAKED/POSTEST came into existance. Its been a long road, thanks to all who have helped along the way. 

For the Payments CC Game, I will be giving away 10,000LABS coin on the main chain at launch, to the person who wins the game. This is plenty to stake with and early on and could turn into quite a lot of LABS, if staked well. There may also be a KMD prize although this is yet to be decided. 

I noticed some minor issues with building the latest master. If it refuses to build. the process that got it working for me was the following:
AFTER running `./zcutil/build.sh`
1) enter `~/komodo `or `~/staked/StakedModo`
2) `make clean`
3) `cd src`
4) `rm libcc.so`
5) `cd cc`
6) `./makerogue`
7) `cd ../..` 
8) `make -j8`

Pinned a message.

[03-May-19 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also some CPU miners for CFEKPAY (just a core is fine) would be helpful,  its only being mined by my home computer, and that hasnt been too reliable to keep chains moving in the past.

That error is so annoying. Try to go into src/cc and try to build some diffrent libcc.so

I'm updating now, will report if seen

[03-May-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This crap is from KMD and I tried to fix it so many times unsucessfully

seems a total lottery which one will build ü§£

[03-May-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need to make my own cclib that just contains litterally nothing... then start.sh will work again

[03-May-19 05:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I didnt clean anythong, just git pull + build

[03-May-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Actuall cclib builder is `./makecclib` as far as I know

[03-May-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to work, it doesnt copy the cclib to the correct palce, and as changes werer made to CCutils.h the linker fails

[03-May-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless we 100% need a CClib for something I am going to make a blank one that LABS will default to so these linker errors are a thing of the past, very annoying.

makerogue was the only one that worked for me... I might make blank cclib rn tbh.

taht was with makecclib

make rogue finished ok, but I didnt build after it yet

`libdb4.8++-dev` installation should help with this db_cxx.h error

[03-May-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that is included with komodod already there is no reason for this

[03-May-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can cahnge that include to hard link to the file incuuded in komodod and then it "just works" every time./... but apparently this is not how your supposed to do it

[03-May-19 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the actual komodod is using DBD v6 something.... so by installing 4.8 your includeing a .so file with a diffrent version compiled in/linked to.,... seems very dangerous

this one should work üòÉ

[03-May-19 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`rm *.so and make clean in src` 
put this at the top opf `makecclib` ?

[03-May-19 05:55 AM] TonyL#3577
`rm *.so and make clean in src ` I'm not 100% sureif  this step is mandatory  üòÉ

[03-May-19 05:56 AM] TonyL#3577
But shouldn't do anything bad

[03-May-19 05:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Sequence above will build daemon with rogue cclib without issues

[03-May-19 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something stops it overwriting libcc.so with the new one that it compiles. OR the new one fails to comp[ile and there is no error message.

[03-May-19 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its either on or the other only. I think reverting back to the hardcoded berkely DB.h file is teh way to go, I never had a single build complaint while we were usign that.

[03-May-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent weeks moving code and includes aroudn in komodod months ago to fix all these silly linker erros it took hundred hours maybe more... thne go add cclib and ruin it again üò´

[03-May-19 06:01 AM] TonyL#3577
For now I think just change `./makerogue` to `./makecclb` in build.sh should solve issues because after `./makecclib` in src directory rogue cclib and roguecclib daemon compiling after make

[03-May-19 06:02 AM] TonyL#3577
If for this CC no matters which cclib it should be but cclib is mandatory

[03-May-19 06:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm up and running, with Tony's thing, just ignored the erros lol

[03-May-19 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we just need a correctly linked libcc.so

[03-May-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fixing this libcc.so mess isnt something I wanted to have to do... but LABS is ruined without a working start.sh
