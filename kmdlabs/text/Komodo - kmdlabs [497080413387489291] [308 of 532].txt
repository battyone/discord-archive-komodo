fwiw, Sydney pings chickenpool (in Arizona) @ 173 ms vs Dallas pining chicken pool @ about 25
so it'll be a true test to see if ping times make a significant impact

well... the mainnet notary nodes in SH all suck ... so either all their servers are shit, or they are just too far from the rest.

[21-Feb-19 11:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol just checked my ZEX pool... still chugging away, wallet.dat 100MB exactly... ran cleanwallettransaactions on it, 13,000 tx, 6500 remain. 😆

[21-Feb-19 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, that's the test....
to see if it's merely location or location and provider or location, provider, *and* set up or all/none of the above

[21-Feb-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its all ... but location give an unfair advantage.

[21-Feb-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like ive said a heap of times, my mainnet node does ok... 1-6th in SH usually last few weeks.

[21-Feb-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exact same server

[21-Feb-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
compared to ALL nodes tho, its terrible...

[21-Feb-19 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but location give an unfair advantage.`
If this test doesn't yield a significant loss in notarizations, then that's not entirely true

[21-Feb-19 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe... there is only 13 nodes atm.... we had 17 before. So until we are back at 17 nodes,  we cant know anything definative. The less nodes there are the more counts you get.

[21-Feb-19 11:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, but at 7x the ping time, then for your theory to hold true I whould end up at the bottom after a few days

[21-Feb-19 11:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The way its looking we will need to launch the main chain to get all the nodes back, seems ppl are fed up with testing :troll:

`seems ppl are fed up with testing`
then they weren't really ready to be testers to begin with, imo 😛

[21-Feb-19 11:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they have done well IMO ...

[21-Feb-19 11:14 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I'll test anything that can be done on a headless VM.

[21-Feb-19 11:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like nearly everything I think lol

[21-Feb-19 11:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats how I dev everything here. 2 headless VMs with ssh/tmux.

[21-Feb-19 11:15 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Some people don't understand when you say "Sorry - I am not running the GUI wallet"

[21-Feb-19 11:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha

[21-Feb-19 11:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Iguana had no updates and minsigs is set at 6 - so it looks like I am good at the mo.

[21-Feb-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its on KMD side. to make 100% sure you can do: `cat staked.json`

[21-Feb-19 11:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will see if I can add a print to my special node 0 prints to show each nodes minsigs ...

[21-Feb-19 11:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then I can DM each person. just once, to save flooding pings to everyone like what happened yesterday. that was just rude 😃

[22-Feb-19 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we got one.

[22-Feb-19 01:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you got what? an STD?

[22-Feb-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol its notarizing again

[22-Feb-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I got a coffee too 😄

[22-Feb-19 01:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
still nothing here on CFEKDIMXY2, but at least some progress on the other 2
will check back after while

[22-Feb-19 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless that chain is forked it will notarize eventually. Going to start on some musig tests here. 1000 signer multisig 😄 Should be useful for our bounties... if it can be made easy enough to use.

[22-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Nabob#5004
I havent got one on LABSTH , Cant we find out whether all nodes are in sync / disabled tor

[22-Feb-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
damn tor experiment lol

[22-Feb-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wasted a whole 3 days

[22-Feb-19 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They are notaruizing  but really badly... I guess the only way to force it to fix itself is to launch a new chain that makes everyone update 😄

[22-Feb-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or just continue to wait... We need to get announcements sorted and try to set a date to get this chain underway.

[22-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No much point dicking around any longer, main chain at least is ready to roll.

still happening but long time between

[22-Feb-19 06:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Can we have a chain called LABSTD which spreads an on chain virus if forking emissions are migrated into oracles, and causes a burning sensation in your tokens?

[22-Feb-19 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂  Please remove tor it broke everything lol

[22-Feb-19 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then do an update to get minsigs 6 if you havent already

[22-Feb-19 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
things are working... as far as I can see, but there are some huge gaps in notarizations atm, liek 25 blocks and stuff.

[22-Feb-19 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best guess is ppl not on minsigs 6, or at least I hope thats all it is.

[22-Feb-19 07:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
did uninstall tor, but didnt reboot until recently.

[22-Feb-19 07:10 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

hmm hardly any notarizations for me after that tor test

[22-Feb-19 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hardly for anyone really. I think until the rest get minsigs = 6 the network will be slightly segragated and not reliable.

[22-Feb-19 08:57 AM] dimxy#2587
On CFEKDIMXY notarizations works okay, thanks

[22-Feb-19 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes sorry about the outage. It didnt seem liek that was going to happen early on. Should be stable from now on, none of these chains will be removed any time soon.

[22-Feb-19 08:59 AM] zatJUM#9924
Had nota for all 20 mn ago for the latest

[22-Feb-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah they seem to come in waves ... there are possibly a few nodes non on minsigs 6 yet, which could be messing things up. They technically shouldn't but its iguana, and does funny things.

[22-Feb-19 09:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm slowly starting to get them more often now

[22-Feb-19 09:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm also getting some. 2, 5 & 13 minuts ago.

[22-Feb-19 09:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
30min on the oldest, around 7 in the last 2hrs on the least frequent

[22-Feb-19 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at min sigs of 6 they will be much more evenly distrubuted

[22-Feb-19 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
espeically because atm there is less nodes

[22-Feb-19 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Has anyone had a node fork ? 
My staker node forked at about block 4800 or something... I had to resync it aroudn blcok 5700 when I noticed it.

[22-Feb-19 09:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
managed to get oracle records displaying on web. With a few tweaks I can make this available to all LABS chains

{Reactions}
💯 (4) 🔥 (2) 

[22-Feb-19 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main chain will only have impor/export and oracle I think. We are disabling all other contracts. They need to be used on other chains.

[22-Feb-19 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
datafee cost is on the hosting node tho, so might have to setup some form of paywall

[22-Feb-19 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once coins are worth something

[22-Feb-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just been working with a new contract today, musig, it allows almost unlimited signers to multisig.... 
```./musigtest.py
Do you want to generate new pubkeys? y
Enter number of pubkeys to combine: 5000
Your combined pubkey is: 033024a87df3c113878307bba9297c2004c5e950d9521d0ef2a4a114bc40b00573
```

[22-Feb-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5000 signer multisig address 😄

[22-Feb-19 09:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool  How would that be used?

[22-Feb-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181

it pretty much only combines keys for now

james is working on it.

[22-Feb-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
4294967295 is the max signers possible

My staking node seems to have made it through the tor test unharmed. Still on the correct chain.

Hi, Have a vm with a 60gb disk.  Only done some migrations, and ROGUE.  Quite new setup.  Got ```Error: Error: Disk space is low!``` on ROGUE and when investigating found ```tmpfs           9.9G     0  9.9G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           9.9G     0  9.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup```
Could this be related to migrations?  I vaguely remember `^c`ing out of a larger migration loop at some point.

[22-Feb-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I have similar on my node (not doing any migrations or rogue)  ```udev            7.7G     0  7.7G   0% /dev
tmpfs           1.6G  720K  1.6G   1% /run
/dev/sda1       151G  107G   38G  74% /
tmpfs           7.7G     0  7.7G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           7.7G     0  7.7G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs           1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/112
tmpfs           1.6G     0  1.6G   0% /run/user/0
```
It's OS specifics memory sharing mechanisms as I understand

[22-Feb-19 10:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks @TonyL  :)
Need some further digging to see what is using up all of my disk and causing the error then.

[23-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
For staking, is 50 utxo the optimal amount? Or just as long as wallet size is small its okay

[23-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I had pretend lets say 1m coins staking, with 50 utxo. 
I buy another 1m coins and stake them, now its around 80-90utxo per segid

[23-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
but the amount of staked coins seems relatively the same

[23-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
@Crabby Paddy it's probably best to have >1000 as the daemon will keep all utxos in ram

[23-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
Gives a slight advantage

[23-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So no problems with having a few hundred utxo in each segid then? I don’t plan on making 1000 on purpose 😂 but as long as it’s okay now

[23-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And for the next few months then I’m happy with that

[23-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
I'm doing very well on OUR with ~50-100 coin utxos

[23-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just expected a bigger growth from the new coins than what I’ve been getting

[23-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
It's more about utxo age

[23-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
Lots of old utxos > a few large utxos

[23-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I was told too many would cause wallet size to be too big and may cause lag or slow issues I think

[23-Feb-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
The pos64staker thing will keep a static amount of utxos if you set it up properly

[23-Feb-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
I'm still trying to get it "noob friendly" so it'll do everything for you

[23-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
@Crabby Paddy would you like to test it?
