Technically I guess we can add the address, but it hardforks the entire thinga gain... takes days

[07-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Mylo#8306
ok.   IMP-CHAIN-TXID maybe.   migh tnot be pretty but we can make it link nicely

[07-Jan-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it works

[07-Jan-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it does

[07-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Mylo#8306
ah internal address..   have you got redirect in apache/nginx working to the "other" chain?

[07-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no ... thats just exactly what the explorer dumps out

[07-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im just runnign it in a VM no nginix

[07-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I take it we can filter `*address/IMP-*` and replace that with like `cfeky.kmdlabs.io/tx/<txid> `

[07-Jan-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gues hardest part is the cfeky at teh start.... maybe it can be like this:
`explorer.kmdlabs.io/cfeky/tx/<txid>`

[07-Jan-19 03:15 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't know the most about this, but 2nd look easier from the website side of things.

[07-Jan-19 03:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Don't need a subdomain for each coin.

[07-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could have the clusterID as the subdomain ?

[07-Jan-19 03:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Keeps things in one place also.

[07-Jan-19 03:16 PM] Mylo#8306
i'll have to check, but i think the easiest will be IMP?CFEKY&tx
doesn't matter what you want to redirect to, it's just a matter of mangling the url

[07-Jan-19 03:17 PM] CrisF#3405
sure

[07-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Mylo#8306
actually doesn't matter IMP-CFEKY-TX should be ok come to think of it.
rule match IMP- then grab the remainder and redirec to (http://url/CFEKY-TX)
rule match grabbing CFEKY
go to http://url-with-cfeky/tx/TX

[07-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe this is a good time to call on @webworker01

[07-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Mylo#8306
it's just redireting a few times to chunk down the url

[07-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Mylo#8306
haha yeah

[07-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the old explorers were set up by him...

[07-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if we can get this working with 2 chains, should be fine with more I assume?

[07-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if you use the clusterID as the subdomain... then it should always just work.

[07-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Mylo#8306
as long as we stick to convention yes.   need to keep the redirect rules in github like assetchains.json üòÉ

Can someone tell me exactly what we want logged to oracles for the stress test?

[07-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
just info on each migrate? Anything else? @blackjok3r @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @blackjok3r

[07-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Alright#0419
@CrisF

[07-Jan-19 11:43 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Hi, here's what I have (suggestions): ```
- txid of export 
- txid of import (confirmed)
- error and step at which it occurred *
- number of migrates (successful)** ***
- number of migrates (failed)** *** 
- time (how long migration took)```  ``` * currently no way for us to actually do that, as we poll RPCs until they work, so it will error until the correct amount of notarisations has happened. I got around this on old script, by counting tries and setting a maximum amount. Then logging the transaction, so you can manually check what error it was at a later time.
** Very simple way of counting number if migrates is to just append the txid's to a file, then do cat exports | wc -l 
*** number of imports/exports easy to calculate by the length of the txid list. each txid a JSON object and contain another object with imported/exported amount.```

[07-Jan-19 11:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Notes fyi from Blackjok3r.

[07-Jan-19 11:48 PM] CrisF#3405
The other guys will need to check and modify.

[07-Jan-19 11:54 PM] CrisF#3405
In addition to collecting data for de-bugging, one of the purposes of this is to provide evidence of the stability of migrations and our testing of that.

[08-Jan-19 12:03 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r @Alright If there will be a bounty for largest number migrates etc how will that be determined.  
Would a `Tester ID (pubkey?)` be useful to include to show we used certain number of tester?

[08-Jan-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
If need, some `Data Format` info near top of pad.

a good approach would be, what do we want to get metrics for? and then waht data do we need for those?

[08-Jan-19 01:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
migrations/sec

[08-Jan-19 01:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
migrations/address

[08-Jan-19 01:13 AM] CrisF#3405
üòÉ  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Do you have anything else for `Data Format`?  Especially with regard to pulling the data off the chain in a way/format best for for processing/visualization?

[08-Jan-19 01:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Was thinking to keep it simple for the Migration Stress Test and focus on basic `logging` for de-bugging and proof of stability testing.

[08-Jan-19 01:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Make this a basic template/tool to be used and modded by people doing tests later.

If can be done all at once, great!  Might get a little big for 1st go though, haha.

[08-Jan-19 01:23 AM] CrisF#3405
(didn't have chain names ü§¶ )

[08-Jan-19 01:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Vis will be aggregate so another layer for that

[08-Jan-19 01:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
But if priority for stress is debug, whats most important info to traceback?

[08-Jan-19 01:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Dont want too much else the logging might bottleneck or crash things!

[08-Jan-19 01:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, Blackjok3r had some note re: debug.  Jl777 said `confirmed import txid` for proof.

[08-Jan-19 01:38 AM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Added üëÜ to pad under `Stats [cluster]`, and chain names to `2) Data to record` also.

All u need for proof is the confirmed txid

[08-Jan-19 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All the other data can be goten from that...

[08-Jan-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Though we need a fool proof way of not letting ppl cheat, as this will be a competition.

[08-Jan-19 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah.  Didn't PoS64 use registered pubkeys?

[08-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I guess all migrates must go to a single address seems good enough

[08-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Change script to use get raw transaction ...

[08-Jan-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So they don't need they privkey imported

[08-Jan-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't see anyone migrating for someone else unless they make a team and try share winnings... Guess they could do that, can't really stop it

[08-Jan-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Tbh whoever deploys the most nodes will probably just win

[08-Jan-19 02:33 AM] CrisF#3405
What do you think of those not interested in running for the bounty being able to participate without a pubkey? Make it easy for real noobs.

I found that the explorers also show `unparsed address` for the burnTx .. will see if I cna get it to display chain name or something there.

[08-Jan-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got target chain showing for burn tx... might change it slightly as it makes little sense atm. Data is ther though, was pretty easy.

[08-Jan-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its annoying we cant link export to import... never be possible though. So what we have here is just about as good as we can get. Few dead links on explorer, at least it shows something relavent though now.

[08-Jan-19 06:29 AM] CrisF#3405

You can link export to import on migration creation stage (as key-value entry let's say)
