yes, it's in the right folder, it created it (albeit months ago)

[02-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Oszy#5734
this is what i have

[02-Jun-19 01:29 PM] gcharang#6833
guys are you using the branch `restart`?

[02-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Oszy#5734
I am on master

[02-Jun-19 01:30 PM] gcharang#6833
restart branch should work. I have been using it without modifications

[02-Jun-19 01:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm on master, but restart has newer files.

[02-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Nabob#5004
using restart branch, i have python issues. again moved to master

[02-Jun-19 01:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll have a look at both and see whats going on.
There was an older repo before `Staked` become `Labs`, so a few people still had the previous upstream earlier

[02-Jun-19 01:37 PM] gcharang#6833
virtual env should help with python versions and deps

[02-Jun-19 01:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64staker (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64staker (push)```
One of my older nodes, if you have this repo, backup your list.json files and clone `https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker`

@TonyL - managed to get prices working on a Bionic install (from source) - the dependencies are nasty.
What are the lines representing?

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel great üëç  which lines?

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
on the graphs - trace 0,1,2

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577
```As you noticed there are 3 numbers for each sample:
mined (actual received) price
correlated price
smoothed price
```

[02-Jun-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577
in the same manner (0, 1, 2)

[02-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Nabob#5004

tony and I started the prices chain yesterday, going to work on adding it to the cluster today

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
the actual prices CC will not work until it's "matured", but will just add it sometime today to get everything prepared

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
if anyone wants another fungible chain, now is a good time to make the poll for it

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] gcharang#6833
thanks @Nabob will correct it

the fungible chain seems healthy, but I'm going to hold off until we have some other people around other than myself 
@blackjok3r @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @TonyL if you have some time to help me out with this today, please let me know

[02-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
no actual rush to get it onto the cluster as the prices CC thing has still not matured

[02-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
was having trouble getting it to stop properly

[02-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
just nuked it with kill -9 and seems to have worked

[02-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
Although now I'm facing another problem üòÇ

[02-Jun-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
`sudo service nginx stop`

[02-Jun-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
what's that?

[02-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
would just give me nothing when I was doing it

[02-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
kill -9'd it and started it again and `sudo systemctl restart nginx` is working again

[02-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
have this setup to where I can start up a new instance of prices dapp really easily, if anyone wants to try it, lmk

[02-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
will just give you a link and login creds and you can try prices dapp on CFEKBET1

[03-Jun-19 05:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Blocktime on CFEKBET1 is huge - thought I had lost my funds making a position!

`Segmentation fault (core dumped)` Got this daemon stopped.

[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Dat feeling when restarted node, and waiting for staked blocks

[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But forgot to `setgenerate true 0`

[03-Jun-19 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@Oszy `Segmentation fault (core dumped) Got this daemon stopped.` from which repo/branch is your daemon?

[03-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734
KMDLabs/komodo

[03-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734
It was fine all along, first time i saw this

[03-Jun-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Dat feeling when `tail -f debug.log | grep 'generated'` for 18 hrs is more than a full screen...

[03-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jorian#4555
not so many i guess?

[03-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Nabob#5004
`Could not load list.json please make sure it is in the directory where komodod is located. Exiting` 
Getting this error on labs stdout, I kept file in komodod location. chains looks good

[03-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Nabob#5004
Seems staker.py,  needs to be updated with absolute location

[03-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
I put a copy of it into pos64staker folder as well, I think TUI wouldn't work

[03-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Nabob#5004
found, daemon needs to started from  pos64staker folder üë∂

[03-Jun-19 12:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Oszy what are your server specs?

[03-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Oszy#5734
it's a VM 4 core 8gb ram

[03-Jun-19 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that shoud be enough. Which coins' daemon is crashing?

[03-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
This was during staking LABS, using the KMDLabs/komodo repo

[03-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Only happened once in 4 days

[03-Jun-19 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had a similar issue with CFEKBET1 earlier, because I was running it manually and using wrong komodod

[03-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Oszy#5734
I'll keep running it see if it comes up again.

[03-Jun-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you launch with ./start.sh it should be fine. I also rebuilt the daemon just in case

[03-Jun-19 12:56 PM] CrisF#3405
I also had a `Segmentation fault` yesterday.  Restarted and it hasn't had trouble since.

[03-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i had a crash at the very beginning, but it runs stable for a long time now

[03-Jun-19 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
Rough notary stats since about this time yesterday

[03-Jun-19 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
for the lower half of the nodes anyways

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`x - y`
x and y = what?

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
X is current stats.py output

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
y is the diff from yesterdays output

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
total notarizations in ~24 hours = y
