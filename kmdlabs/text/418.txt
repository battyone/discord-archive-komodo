if you just resync, it works

[03-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
like 1/20 times it's happening, thinking it has something to do with system time, but I can't nail down the exact cause

[03-Jun-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that was reindex, will try after del dirs

Is LABSEX Launched???

[03-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
the chain is running right now, haven't added it to the cluster yet though

CFEK, LABSEX; we're really inviting the businesses to test their CC here 游땐

just need to burn the LABS and add it to assetchains.json

[03-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
but I figured I'd wait until joker is around in case something goes wrong

No hurry - getting REKT  on CFEKBET1 anyhow 游땑

[03-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Alright#0419

'LABS**EX**'
I don't care what you want it to be (or meant it to be), it's:
LAB**SEX** to the rest of the world

[03-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
CFEKBET1 needs to cut down on the std-out - it swamps everything else.

[03-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
ok I can add LABSEX to the cluster, but the stuff needed to check whether the proper amount of coins were burned on LABS is not there yet...

[03-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
so would have to manually validate that the amount burned in burntxid is the block 1 amount of LABSEX

[03-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
I began to try to rewrite StakedNotary in python and found that it's pretty impractical

[03-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
just going to keep the bash unless anyone wants to take a crack at it, will definitely rewrite the bash to use functions instead of scripts calling script calling scripts calling scripts

[03-Jun-19 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that makes me :giggle:

[03-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jorian#4555
why is rewriting it in python impractical?

[03-Jun-19 05:40 PM] jorian#4555

git management

[03-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
rather branch management

[03-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
it'll need a shit load of subprocess calls

[03-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Alright#0419
and when i realized that, I realized bash is likely a better solution because of it, and that **we** just need to clean up the scripts calling scripts calling scripts calling scripts spaghetti

[03-Jun-19 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so, a resync on CFEKBET1 gives me 0 blocks, same 0 peers, and same connection reset

[03-Jun-19 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
it's hard to unspaghettify code not written by yourself

[03-Jun-19 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
crisf had CFEK problems too

[03-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
we're likely to have them on LABSEX as well, so will hold off until @blackjok3r can take a look at it

[03-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
make sure your system clock is ntp'd?

[03-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
will definitely not work if it isn't

[03-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise, I'm not sure why it's happening. Seems like a timing thing

[03-Jun-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

what p2p port did you get when you launched it?

[03-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Alright#0419
sure the params were correct?

[03-Jun-19 05:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`what p2p port did you get when you launched it?`
default, I reckon 
`sure the params were correct?`
If not, you moofed the JSON

[03-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
did you kill it?

[03-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
or it killed itself?

[03-Jun-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I had 0 peers, I looked at debug log and saw similar to what I 1st posted above...
I did a reindex hoping it would solve the block issue.....
Reindex produced 1st above....
You said "resync", I tried that, and got last above

[03-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
I have this thing to launch 20 containers that all start syncing CFEKBET1 as soon as they're up. Each time it seems like at least 1 of them has that same error

[03-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
which is strange because they're all exactly the same

[03-Jun-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
OK, since I'm retarded, is there a way (other than pulling bet1 from the json) to get my NN running again?

[03-Jun-19 05:58 PM] jorian#4555
bootstrap?

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
delete the data dir for CFEKBET1 and start it again

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
is it happening every time? if so, we need to debug it

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
I can't reliably reproduce it

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`delete the data dir for CFEKBET1 and start it again`
I've done that 4 times

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
ok leave it until joker is back please

[03-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
for now just `git pull` to make sure you're on latest

[03-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
then remove it from json and `./start.sh`

[03-Jun-19 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`find . -not -name 'wallet.dat' -delete`
unless it's the wallet file feken it 游뱡游낗

[03-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
maybe?

[03-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
back up the wallet

[03-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
might need it to debug

[03-Jun-19 06:01 PM] SHossain#0007
`find . -type f -not -name "*.conf" -not -name "wallet.dat" -not -name "wallet.dat.bak" -delete`

[03-Jun-19 06:02 PM] SHossain#0007
i use this to preserve conf file and any wallet.dat including backup

[03-Jun-19 06:02 PM] SHossain#0007
nukes everything else

[03-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
delete it all after backing up wallet

[03-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Alright#0419
then try to sync again

[03-Jun-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Starting from empty dir = same auto-death, but no 'Connection reset by peer'

[03-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
anything in stdout?

[03-Jun-19 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
nothing significant to this; if run alone, a ton of shit

[03-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
can't understand why it's killing itself

[03-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
are you running it from pricescomp branch?

[03-Jun-19 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's running from whatever you guys tell it to run from 游땥

[03-Jun-19 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`./start.sh`

[03-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
`./listassetchainparams.py`

[03-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
take the params then 
`cd ~/StakedNotary/komodo/pricescomp`

[03-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
start it from there

@blackjok3r welcome back! 
are the rpc modifications to blockheader and getblock merged to jl777/komodo yet?

[04-Jun-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure mate.

[04-Jun-19 06:47 AM] gcharang#6833
this looks like the last merge from labs to jl777: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1499
it will reach there with the next Labs to jl777 merge correct? 
I am asking about the `last_notarized_height` you added to the above rpc in KMDLabs/komodo for me

LABS to  jl777 by blackjok3rtt 췅 Pull Request #1499 췅 jl777/komodo
Adds last notarized height to getrawtransaction for gcharang.
Adds LABS launch pubkeys, so explorers etc can use the main KMD repo.

I did them, but maybe it never got merged down. I think unless any bug reported in LABS master in next day or 2 i will merge it down.

[04-Jun-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
got so many things to work out atm.

well its working in LABS yes?

[04-Jun-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if so I will merge it down later on.

[04-Jun-19 07:34 AM] gcharang#6833
yes it is working on labs, using them for the explorer: http://labs.lordofthechains.com
when they are merged to jl777/komodo, they can be used for all the explorers on dexstats.info too

@Alright the dwy_mitigation thing, makes use of z_mergetoaddress. is the added functionality to the RPC only in the KMDLABS repo?

[04-Jun-19 09:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r I am asking about the insight-ui displaying `scriptPubkey` `scriptSig` etc.,

[04-Jun-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't think so, the fork of insight we used to do the cross chain transactions was never merged. We need to test that again before making a PR with the changes. Daemon side I think its all still working.
