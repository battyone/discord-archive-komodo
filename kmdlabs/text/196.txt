no nodes, break is it some new print?`
No, that means that @blackjok3r hasn't broken anything yet today :trollface:

[06-Jan-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt do anything today üòõ

[06-Jan-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
hence it not being broken yet today üòõ

[06-Jan-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if no one ever breaks it, then no one ever tested it üòâ

looks mostly non consensus bug fixes. Please let me know if anything breaks though.

I"ll update after work and retest the flow on DH.

[06-Jan-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Managed to get everything recovered and will get back to VM.  Start testing migration.

[06-Jan-19 11:53 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Hi, Thanks for the `getimports`üëç   I am going to check it off on the pad.
You mentioned exports here```I think the code I made for getimports can be added to getrawtransaction so that when you fetch an import tx with it, it shows the export details.``` Can I check that off too?

[07-Jan-19 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have not done it yet so no

[07-Jan-19 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think can have a go at that today

[07-Jan-19 02:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Cheers üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migrating itself isnt really needed testing as of yet, we need to test the data intergration etc..

[07-Jan-19 02:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, sounds like your initial migrations went very smoothly.

[07-Jan-19 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did 5000 sucessful mmigrates over 2 days. if they are going to fail, it will only be when we do litterally millions of them.... which tbh I dont think can even happen. if 1 migrate per block works... then 5000 migrates per block will work,.

Is more needed on `Data Format` now for the oracle, or will that just be modified as things progress to building it?

[07-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator which chain have you been using for DH

[07-Jan-19 02:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Cfekx

[07-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Alright#0419
need to test something on one of the chains, might entirely break it

[07-Jan-19 02:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Cfekx was already a bit broke

[07-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Alright#0419
I'll leave x alone

[07-Jan-19 02:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I cam move if needed, did some work towards streamlining mogration to new chain over weekend

[07-Jan-19 02:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Oracle data formats apart from S im yet to play with. Looking into storing pdfs and jpgs in hex, though S might handle that.

[07-Jan-19 02:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Depends on raw filesize

[07-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
D would be ideal

[07-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
S is only better if you want the oraclessamples to be human readable

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
S uses ~2x the data as D

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll aim at D then

[07-Jan-19 02:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Anyone got recommend linux based home camera security setup?

[07-Jan-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I didnt make them, might need to ask tony about it. just pulled from upstream.

[07-Jan-19 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Duke was just doing some changes to insight... I am going to start there and see if I can figure out this link import tx to the export on the other chain.

[07-Jan-19 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might make it a little easier where to place the new info (like what rpc call etc)

[07-Jan-19 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the worst part will be figureing out how to get the explorers web address in there...

[07-Jan-19 03:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Just for a node, we should used /StakedNotary

[07-Jan-19 03:25 AM] CrisF#3405
`staked` is good for a regular node.

@Alright `KY` is all smooth here.

[07-Jan-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright didnt have the fix I pushed for tonyL last night on the node he was testing on.... So he just added 114,000 token creates to Y for no reason üòÇ

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
What exactly is the fix?

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its some locks in main.cpp

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
I was able to stop a test chain entirely with that

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Oh, `KY` down on mining node. Restarting

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
still seeing what other consequences it might have

[07-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need the latest fix from yesterday or thge node will crash

[07-Jan-19 03:35 AM] Alright#0419
found a way to very easily fill blocks btw

yep

[07-Jan-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nodes who are not on latest will ahve stopped

[07-Jan-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likely most nodes are not

check logs, did you just ban 195.201.20.230

[07-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
lmao

[07-Jan-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary seems fine... I think the problem is mostly miners  ... and teh node that sends the tx.

[07-Jan-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any nodes who are heavily accessing the mempool

[07-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
think it's an easy way to slow down other miners

[07-Jan-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even with fix?

not sure, I need to set this up better

I may be able to.... I have a 280x ibn this PC but I have no miing software atm

[07-Jan-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
oh actually, I can just raise the diff on the port so mini doesn't shit out blocks
