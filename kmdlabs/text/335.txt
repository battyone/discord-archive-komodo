The idea is weight loss tracker where a person or group can monitor fat loss ⚖ .  People would post info to an oracle and monitor progress.
Betting options available. :Komodo: :pirate:

[15-Mar-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Was thinking of an office pool kind of situation.

[15-Mar-19 11:10 AM] CrisF#3405
Simple oracle to start and possibly building towards marketing to smart scale companies with an app for it?

[15-Mar-19 11:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Nice one for learning I think.  Many possibilities and tech combos that could be tried out.

iguana LABS is now using 80MB of ram vs hundreds or over 1 GB 🤣  
a-team ~600MB ram vs 5-10GB. Seems stable and is notarizing

Hi guys,
I've got a suggestion for a general structure for KMDLabs somewhat related to the `multisig discussion`.
Please read the disclaimer.
The intention of the proposal is to get everyone interested involved and to check that job off the todo list.
Everything on it is a `suggestion`.  Please change it as you see fit (add your name, strikethrough, add your changes)!

@Strob, `https://kmdlabs.com/getting-started/` and `https://kmdlabs.com/technical/` should give a bit of idea about what to do.  The `How KMDLabs Works` page is in a state of flux at the moment.
Please feel free to ask any questions here and to get the most up-to-date info 😃

@CrisF just read the ideas in that pad, I think something along these lines could work, but it's a fine line between a corporate structure and a community led project

-----------
Please see `https://kmdlabs.cc/p/KMDLabs_operations_proposal` for context.
-----------``` If the bureaucracy grows too large the Group Consensus can cull it as needed.```
Basically this mechanism would allow people to get on with Dev work and using LABs.
The elected volunteers would be given the responsibility for day-to-day matters to make this possible.
The way things would work aren't all that different than now.  For example, asking opinions on how to multisig or what logo looks better. 
The only real changes I see from now are that Labs Elected Volunteer(LEV)s would have some ability to take action through the limited trust granted to them through election by Stakers.  The LEV could then make a decision based on what they have learned.
LEVs serve the Group Consensus, and if their actions vary too widely from that path, then Group Consensus has the power to bring things back into line.
At the moment we are still setting things up and most Dev work is focussed on Labs.  That will change and people, including LEVs, will be focussed on `using` the Labs platform.
I think the LEV jobs will loose their glamour fairly quickly when it is realized how much work will be required, while others are out there having fun.  This is the nature of volunteer work.

[16-Mar-19 10:50 AM] newvulcan#9571
Hi, I'm having some problems with finding ZEX blocks on my mining pool. All other coins are working fine including KMD, ARRR, ZCL and HUSH. I'm using S-NOMP with the following config file for ZEX:{
"name": "ZADDEX",
"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"sapling": true,
"requireShielding": true
}
My komodod command line is: ./komodod -ac_founders=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -ac_name=ZEX -ac_reward=13000000000 -ac_pubkey=039d4a50cc70d1184e462a22edb3b66385da97cc8059196f8305c184a3e21440af -ac_cc=2 -ac_halving=525600 

The error that NPM throws is  "We thought a block was found, but it was rejected by the daemon"

The matching error line in the debug file is ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED

My guess is that something is wrong with one of the config files above.

[16-Mar-19 10:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi  @newvulcan ,
Are you in the correct channel?
#zexo maybe?

[16-Mar-19 11:16 AM] newvulcan#9571
Just to add. Tried the same thing with knomp and had the same errors

[16-Mar-19 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@newvulcan 
1) as you were already told, this isn't the proper channel for #zexo <- click the pretty blue letters
2) s/z/nomp will always build the wrong block because it requires a specific coinbase transaction type
3) when you're told that you're in the wrong channel, editing to make you post longer is pointless

[16-Mar-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419

Just a quick "where we're at" if anyone hasn't been following. Some of the MoMoM code upstream is being reworked to allow for cross-chain non-fungible token transfers. If we launched now, this would be a hard fork for the entire cluster as soon as this is ready.(which we don't want to deal with) We're going to thoroughly test this functionality on CFEK chains before moving onto launch prep.

[18-Mar-19 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
@dimxy what is the simplest way to create these non-fungible tokens? Are they different from a normal token with 1 supply? Trying to think of how best to test this, should we just launch a CFEK rogue chain?

[19-Mar-19 01:35 AM] Alright#0419
lol I just saw the PR merged and came here to say the same

[19-Mar-19 02:32 AM] dimxy#2587
@Alright  @blackjok3r  tokencreate supports additional param - nonfungible data.
There first byte should be the evalcode of cc contract responsible for validation of non-fungible tokens.
I temporary added return true into unused prices cc (eval=ED) validate func
so to create non-fungible token there is a cmd:
tokencreate name 0.00000001 "some desc" ED010203

[19-Mar-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see that tokencreate is limiting non fungible data to the entire op_return size? 
I think this will be a problem, as import tx with many input utxo already get over sized and cant validate... 
Is this somehting we will need to test, so this 10,000 limit on nonfungibledata can be lowered...

[19-Mar-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once thigns  are burnt, if the import cant happen they are lost forever

[19-Mar-19 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we need to work out exactly how much data is added during the create and complete import stage, and check the import tx size before the burn is created?

[19-Mar-19 02:38 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe 10,000 is just an upper limit to ensure non-fungible data is not oversized - a preliminary validation
So there should be another opreturn validation for its max size on the core level when all the data are  put into it

[19-Mar-19 02:39 AM] dimxy#2587
(I did not check it though)

[19-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
what is the largest the other data included OP_RETURN could ever be?

[19-Mar-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, what qwe need to work out is exactly how many bytes are added during create import tx and complete import tx... then we can define the maximum size a burn tx can be... and simply refuse to let people make and send a burn too large

[19-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
do we know this?

[19-Mar-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
10k bytes

[19-Mar-19 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
not including hex data from token creation I mean

[19-Mar-19 02:42 AM] dimxy#2587
there is a constant somewhere = 10001 . I thought whatever data I put into the opret they all totaly should not be over this
