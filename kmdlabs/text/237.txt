the problem with using POS for these chains is that we need *some* UTXO to produce blocks, so it seems very very hard to be able to move all coins off of a chain prior to it dying

[22-Jan-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm saying that if I/we need to divert x GPUs or y CPUs for a few hrs or a day to overcome an abandoned chain's diff, it's not like it's months or a large expense

[22-Jan-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the only time it would be an issue would be 100% PoS; but even then, why would we not have any already?

[22-Jan-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I guess I'm lost as to why we wouldn't have any of x if the premise is that x is of value enough *to* move ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[22-Jan-19 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
not sure we can get GPUs to produce consistent block times without any POS

[22-Jan-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
a very very last ditch effort would be to use bounty mechanism to recreate coins

[22-Jan-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
but I don't think this should ever be used

[22-Jan-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if the sole point is to move off ChainX, then why do we care if it's "consistent"?

[22-Jan-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
as the coins are not provably burned

[22-Jan-19 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how well momom will work with blocks days apart

[22-Jan-19 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
guess it would, but it's untested

[22-Jan-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm also lost as to why coins on a dead chain need to be "provably burnt" rather than just left dead on the dead chain

[22-Jan-19 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
we're talking about fungible chains

[22-Jan-19 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
LABS

[22-Jan-19 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
actual LABS that may get stuck on a dead chain

[22-Jan-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
OK, that part I get.
`not sure how well momom will work with blocks days apart`
I have not followed the concept closely, but it would seem to me that it time is a factor then the root are incorrect to begin with, no?
if the branch is provable to come from another branch, why would growth time matter?
If time is a factor, then wouldn't 10 sec blocks and 2 hr block fek it all up?

[22-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
we need to test it

[22-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what do you think

[22-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
if we had huge gaps in block times, would momom continue to work

[22-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The momom will work with long block times I'm pretty sure... Either way the point is, if a chain has stopped and its supply isn't enough to make any blocks then it is probably brunt

[22-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can make notarizations on that chain blacklisted

[22-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already wrote code for this

[22-Jan-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It would fork the notaries who collude to get the coins

[22-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Alright#0419
how does this blacklist work

[22-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Alright#0419
how would it fork them?

[22-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
fork them off the main chain?

[22-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
Yea, it's *probably* burned, not *provably*

[22-Jan-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/merkle-root-of-merkle-roots-v2-768x368.png
From what I get of the concept is that it's a proof that a given root came from another given root, no?

[22-Jan-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you import on a momom hash the daemon does not have it forks the chain... Is any node who does not see that notarization can't validate the momom and the block is invalid

[22-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand how that prevents it

[22-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
ok this situation

[22-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
we have a fungible chain being notarized 
it dies 
there were coins stuck on the chain, so notaries use bounty funds to reimburse on another chain
we think all is cool

[22-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
couple days later, notaries start notarizing it again and move the real coins back into the cluster

[22-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
either by malice or incompetence

[22-Jan-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`there were coins stuck on the chain, so notaries use bounty funds to reimburse on another chain`
why "reimburse" rather than just move the coins?

[22-Jan-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When chain dies the coins can just stay there its lime a thousand coins maybe less

[22-Jan-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Stop making it more complicated than it is

[22-Jan-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No blocks for x days, add to blacklist activated 1 block more than current higjt

[22-Jan-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked 255... Is perma era 0

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
who is going to let coins die with a chain

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactlt

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They will take them off before it stops... Because they can't stake them for morencpins

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
if these chains are POS, we need some coins to stake to produce blocks

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it's not being used it will just die

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
which can then never be moved back into the cluster

[22-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
On it own.. No human interventions

[22-Jan-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
"They will take them off before it stops"

[22-Jan-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
this is the part I can't wrap my head around

[22-Jan-19 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
the chains are POS, some coins need to be there to stake blocks

[22-Jan-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When they r not... The chain will stop

[22-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
you can't get 100% of coins off of chain like this

[22-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
that's my entire point

[22-Jan-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So

[22-Jan-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Who cares

[22-Jan-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It lowers aupply along all coins worth more

[22-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
we will surely have people bitching about this

[22-Jan-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
O doubt it

[22-Jan-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It's like a few hundred coins... I'd ppl don't move them when a chain is dead that their loss

[22-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
"hey guys, I left x LABS on this dapp chain about 2 weeks ago."

[22-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
TOUGH SHIT NOOB

Yep

üò´

[22-Jan-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Any other solution is not objective rules.... Can u suggest a better solution?

[22-Jan-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just premine some coins that are used for the final migration

[22-Jan-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
How is that cryptographically enforced?

[22-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c not sure what you mean

[22-Jan-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
1000 coins premined to be used only for the staking of the final blocks.

[22-Jan-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
they are expected to be stranded

[22-Jan-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
A single coin with enough hash rate will keep the chain moving long enough to withdraw the rest if that needs to happen

[22-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
Problem is that person who created it could take those 1000 off and leave users expecting chain to keep moving

[22-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
then chain suddenly stop and users screwed

[22-Jan-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain is abandoned then who cares who left coins on it... They didn't care about it

[22-Jan-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Who says the person who created it is the last person with coins on it

[22-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
we're making fungible chains, but our users can't trust that their money on these chains will exist in a month

[22-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
you don't see the problem in that?

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain is being used it will have blocks

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it's not then it wont

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is the entire point

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
we just need to educate about it though

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Otherwise the cost of notary exponentially rises holding dead chains like main net

[22-Jan-19 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
"don't store coins on fungible chains"

[22-Jan-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why wpypd anyone do that... When they can stake them on main for free coins

[22-Jan-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
If we're saying that ChainX has value, then why would __we__ not have ChainX coins in order to move ChainX coins (or LABS off ChainX as you initially suggested)?

[22-Jan-19 03:10 PM] Alright#0419
treat it like you would a CEX. Move coins to it, do what you need then move them back

[22-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The point is that anyone using a chain will stake... I fixed it so that that can work.

[22-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain has no use or someone does not keep it going... Then it stopa

[22-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It auto purges chains with no use

[22-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
ok lets say i start a chain for some use case, I stake some coins on it and invite others to use it. They see that it's moving steadily and start to trust that it will continue to do so. Then it suddenly stops, blacklist timeout gets triggered before I'm able to get the chain going again

[22-Jan-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
like

[22-Jan-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think we can just say "don't be a noob" in this case

[22-Jan-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
this makes using a fungible chain very very risky

[22-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make x long enough

[22-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It could be a year if ubwant

[22-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
64 days is about a notary change so seemed convenient

[22-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If could be x2 that...

[22-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If they have coins there they can just load it up and stake and it will move again

[22-Jan-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Have u seed what happens when u stake a stopped chain with even modest value?

[22-Jan-19 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
could we prevent certain coins from being able to be migrated?

[22-Jan-19 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
color them somehow?
