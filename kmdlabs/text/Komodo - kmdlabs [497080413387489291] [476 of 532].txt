@Deleted User we can notarize it on labs if you want to show notarizations

[28-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
at first yeah, maybe, I'm deploying servers for it to go live, it's very private for now, and we're still in investor's research phase, but I believe the articulation of all the parts I have in mind will make me go to the next level.

[28-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
last weeks testing were successful, now I need a 51% protection, so I asked to KMD, but 2K5 is too much for me, atm, to be honest, I'll do it on another way, already have it in mind. I hope some current notaries will "follow" me in this journey, no betrayal at all towards KMD, but, like a job they'll have their own incentives.

[28-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
KMD tech is amazing, and people in this ecosystem, some people in this ecosystem, are. So the door will be opened for them, no shady stuff, just an additional way to get rewarded to participate to a project on top of KMD tech

[28-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
see you soon, LABS buddies

[28-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Knowledge has value, and like I said, materializing this value is the way for the KMD ecosystem to get exposure

You can just launch your own dpow network fairly easily

[28-Aug-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He can do which ever.. I can launch a newwork for you in a ferw hours if you need? LABS can probably do a chain or 2 but I fear it will seta precedent that we didnt really want to be set.

a notary network is not a problem in itself, frequent hardforks are, that s the reason I asked in general

rescan didn't work that well, had to reimport privkey

use the checkmasks script sthat is now fixed

[29-Aug-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
./checkmasks 6789 LABS

[29-Aug-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is also a massive red print that happens if you do not submit UTXOs

[29-Aug-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other issue is a closed 8222 port

[30-Aug-19 01:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi,
I'm going to play around with some Antara modules in Labs.  Any particular chain I should use?

[30-Aug-19 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any CFEKMYLO6 or 9...

[30-Aug-19 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can MoMoM transfer coins if you need just post address

[30-Aug-19 04:20 AM] CrisF#3405

Be out for a bit but should be able to check in now and then.

[30-Aug-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Np...  I actually have a fair bit on NN form mining. Will send now @CrisF

[01-Sep-19 09:20 AM] Nabob#5004
whats the CFEKX longest chain block count ? Seems my chain is struck

[01-Sep-19 09:22 AM] Nabob#5004
if i want to start individual chain from labs stack, How can i  ? @Alright

[01-Sep-19 10:48 AM] CrisF#3405
CFEKX died for me also, but I think that it was meant to.  Alright can confirm.
You can start a chain from `~/StakedNotary/komodo/master` I believe @Nabob .

[01-Sep-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The chain totally broke... @Alright  delete it? 
The noyta stats are being thown off for the iguana by testing all these chains that are in non working state... CFEKAPW on y node just does not wotk, iguana cannot seeutxo... but my node is still near top in ranks... As I expected, a rotaing even of 24H isnt enough data I just pulled this with stats.py on LABS:
```Please specify chain: LABS
Please specify amount of previous blocks(0 for all): 7200
Please wait...

This is the last 5 days, with LABS being changed over 8 days ago according to git history... wow that time went fast.

[01-Sep-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tink I really need some way to monitor recvmasks on all nodes for every coin, over time, to be able to adjust counts to who was actually in working state each round.. Ther ear esome nodes that have really weird results.

[01-Sep-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Other wise we need a yeah of data lol...

[01-Sep-19 12:14 PM] CrisF#3405
What kind of weird results?

[01-Sep-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like @daemonfox  ox conistntly seems to be half the rate of everyone else.

[01-Sep-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on every chain... makes no sense.

[01-Sep-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The rest of the goups, on the grapth are because they are also not notarising a chain..

[01-Sep-19 12:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that is weird.
Is there a time limit on how long everyone has to enter recv?

[01-Sep-19 12:24 PM] jorian#4555
I'm surprised I'm on 1 with my cheap ass node

[01-Sep-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405

mostly because I don't want to sway the results of testing iguana atm

Definatly something wrong ther

[01-Sep-19 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
look s liejk there is an occasionial tx that is totally failing... and it can stop notarations... bugs there will be many 😅

[01-Sep-19 06:16 PM] phm87#7395
Interesting. It can explain the behaviour that @jorian @PHBA2061 and myself observed. Thank you

[01-Sep-19 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its a weird one... its revelaing  another bug...  I  can disable the ban and fast notaries count.. the tx will either fail to send, meaning it is invalid,  or it will send meanign bug in the verification... if the verification seems a race condition or something, as its only happening some times.

They support graviex as I've been able to track the Hush price

[03-Sep-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Bernz - Selling LABS, that was me.   
I got in touch with them and submitted an application.  Didn't hear back and followed up.  Got a reply back saying that we weren't on a supported exchange.  I did mention graviex in the application.

[03-Sep-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I didn't follow up from there.

[03-Sep-19 05:25 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Not sure how to go forward I suppose. I know they support graviex as I track the hush price using their exchange price. Have for at least a month or two.

[03-Sep-19 05:26 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Once atomicdex launches to the public it shouldn't matter, they'll support that. Until then however it seems I'll have to run the numbers manually

[03-Sep-19 05:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure either. I can try re-submitting the application or contact the guy who responded to me.  
I no longer have the mail he sent replying that we weren't on a listed exchange to reply to though.  I managed to loose that account when I upgraded the email service :/

[03-Sep-19 05:32 AM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I'd appreciate the re-submission, rfox had theirs approved within 2 weeks iirc

[03-Sep-19 05:33 AM] CrisF#3405

My brain has gone empty...
I've got a chain that has a balance and 0 UTXOs (even after a rescan)
anyone know a "shortcut" fix besides a fresh wallet.dat and a reimport?

[05-Sep-19 08:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No, you can try the rescanfromheight, but I think needs to delete the address first. likely expired tx. The LABS bash splitter, has no tx fee as fedault and they never confirm.

[05-Sep-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yay, so I do get to blame you for it :troll:

[05-Sep-19 09:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[05-Sep-19 09:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didn't write it. Saw this on testnet but as it was super edge casr didn't fix it.. Likely using normal acsplit would be fine
