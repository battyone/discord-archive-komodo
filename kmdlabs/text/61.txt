It's taking:
--- 12.7620718479 seconds ---
On CCNG chain with just 56 oracles on chain for this https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui/blob/master/chatlib.py#L4 one execution (getting list of all oracles, then for each oracle checking oraclesinfo and checking if description starting from CHAT to recognise it as a room)

Any suggestions how to improve speed are highly appreciated. If it's possible to speedup it somehow I'll update it in background same as messages, just a little bit more rare.

As an option I think to save oracleslist to file on first execution

[01-Nov-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
cache results and only issue rpc calls if input data has changed

[01-Nov-18 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha üí° , will save oracleslist + length variable to file and then compare actual oracleslist length with it and check matching only for a new ones + add to cache. Thanks @jl777c !

[01-Nov-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
further, maybe for each oracle, you can cache its state to avoid having to repeat lookups that will just return the same data

[01-Nov-18 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, I'll compare lengths and will check info only for a new elements

[01-Nov-18 05:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks gods order of oracleslist not changing

[01-Nov-18 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's next in the list after "work at least once" basic functionality implementation üòÉ 
Rooms and nicknames already creating - so only sending is left

[01-Nov-18 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
does oraclessamples always give back everything? maybe we can add option to RPC to fetch from a known number to save returning everyhting ?

[01-Nov-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it has a field to limit how many samples

[01-Nov-18 05:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

I need some way to grab latest messages from all publishers easily

[01-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise I think I have to download the full history of a channel to show it coherently

[01-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
I need something like oraclessamples but have it list most recent `oraclesdata`s from all publisher

[01-Nov-18 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
right now my history script grabs some amount of latest messages from all publishers then sorts them by timestamp

[01-Nov-18 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
but that is deeply flawed if you think about it

[01-Nov-18 06:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its better to do any sorting needed inside the daemon, its heaps faster.

[02-Nov-18 04:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
where is the README for people who are wildly out-of-date with all the latest STAKED madness?

[02-Nov-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not out yet ...

[02-Nov-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[02-Nov-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have a few things started, but wont have all info for at least a few more days yet

[02-Nov-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1) Staked Notary - close to automatic notary node system adds chains on the fly and handles multiple brnachs for multiple AC's 
2) trollbox - on chain chat dAPP in python using oracles CC
3) Staked Dog- GPS tracker on a dog logging to the blockchain, secured by dpow
4) Streamer - ondemand chains with extreme bandwith to save files into/ stream video etc
5) MoMoM cluster testing - allows multiple chains to share coins.

Organize anything, together. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, know what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

[02-Nov-18 05:51 AM] CrisF#3405
The live chain will be going up in the nest couple of weeks.
Before that a new test cluster will be going up.

[02-Nov-18 05:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Some one will be around soon and they'll be able to give you some more info.

[02-Nov-18 05:53 AM] emma#2653
any doc on stakedchain..what is stakedchain?

[02-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked chain is not exactly defined right now ...

[02-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a chain, that has as many other chains as we want

[02-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can send coins between this group of chains

[02-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main chain allows a stable to place to mine/stake while the other chains are some what disposable for testing Crypto Condition contracts and other things

[02-Nov-18 05:54 AM] CrisF#3405
We have been testing Komodo CC contracts and developing on them and the platform in general.

[02-Nov-18 05:55 AM] emma#2653
a chain with multiple side chains

[02-Nov-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes as amazing as that sounds

[02-Nov-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can send coins from one blockchain to another

[02-Nov-18 05:56 AM] CrisF#3405
The STAKED chain is the main chain in the cluster, and other clusters or individual chains can be added.  The main STAKED chain notarizes all of the others to KMD and therefore BTC.

[02-Nov-18 05:57 AM] CrisF#3405
It's not quite as simple as a chain with sidechains due the CC aspect.

[02-Nov-18 05:58 AM] CrisF#3405
As Blackjok3r says, migration of coins between separate chains is possible.  It is just one of the CCs that we are testing.

[02-Nov-18 06:00 AM] CrisF#3405
The power of these CCs will make this very different than the simple chain/assetchain model that was the previous norn.

[02-Nov-18 06:03 AM] CrisF#3405
STAKED is also able to test CCs for others.  And when the main STAKED chain is live others will be able to join the STAKED clusters for testing or other purposes.

[02-Nov-18 06:06 AM] CrisF#3405
As Blackjok3r also mentioned the exact definition of STAKED is still in development stages.  So of course things will inevitably change to some degree or other!

[02-Nov-18 06:07 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright will be able to give you more information, and point out where I was wrong üëÜ haha

[02-Nov-18 06:09 AM] emma#2653
thanks for your efforts ..lot of things went top  of my head .. I am new to komodo platform though I understand ethereum and it's smart contract ecosystem .. I need to read more then only I can ask better questions..

[02-Nov-18 06:10 AM] CrisF#3405
You are always welcome to ask!  I'm new to all of this too üòÄ

[02-Nov-18 06:12 AM] emma#2653
üòÉ

[02-Nov-18 06:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Basically STAKED is a place to test and develop CCs.

[02-Nov-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is where we break things

[02-Nov-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and do world firsts

[02-Nov-18 06:12 AM] CrisF#3405
YES! üëÜ

[02-Nov-18 06:13 AM] emma#2653
any CC where you can point me and I can run on my system

[02-Nov-18 06:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Break and make, haha.

[02-Nov-18 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the only operational CC chain at the moment might be KMDICE as we shut down the first staked testnet yesterday.

Wow - some serious pruning been going on in github.

[02-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its not working so good last few weeks... I think we will get our own gitlab server up soon lol just incase

[02-Nov-18 06:21 AM] emma#2653
just curious (not want to be rude).. how many of you work full time on stakedchain or kmd.?

[02-Nov-18 06:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Not me üòÄ

[02-Nov-18 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  is a KMD team member, and I was recently added to the dev team, but dont get paid, I am funded by my notary node a-team.

[02-Nov-18 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The rest of the people here are mostly volunteers, which we all started out as pretty much.

[02-Nov-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is really good place to learn about blockchain, I went from noob to making my own chains and stuff in a year.

[02-Nov-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I put a LOT of tiem in though

[02-Nov-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably more than a full time job.

[02-Nov-18 06:49 AM] emma#2653
general question - how someone's career will be safeguarded by learning to build blockchains on kmd platform? what kind of opportunities are there now and for future?

[02-Nov-18 06:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Recently Komodo has made it extremely easy to start your own chain on the platform.  Almost anyone can do that.

[02-Nov-18 06:55 AM] CrisF#3405
The technology that Komodo is developing, and we are testing in STAKED, is right on the cutting edge of so many areas. Not many places you can participate that and probably none that have it in one place.

[02-Nov-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I have managed to learn here in a single year, would have taken we 5-6 years at a univeristy, for sure.

[02-Nov-18 06:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not the person to give career advice so I won't touch that, haha.

[02-Nov-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant even do courses on most of this stuff

[02-Nov-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
job prospects, not sure ...

[02-Nov-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But create something cool enough and you wont have to work a "job" again

[02-Nov-18 06:58 AM] emma#2653
sorry for lack of my knowledge -  but at first prompt I see that komodo is like hyperledger but there is main chain which for security purpose..

[02-Nov-18 06:59 AM] emma#2653
I think mostly business will make asset chains..in that case businesses already using hyperledger.. why and who will use kmd  asset chains

[02-Nov-18 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hyper ledger from my understanding is private chains, like our streamer chain, where its owned by an entity or a someone

[02-Nov-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These chains are public chains, they tech and the code that ends up powering things like hyperledger is invented in places like this.

[02-Nov-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The speed at which things get developed around here is mind blowing

[02-Nov-18 07:13 AM] emma#2653
most of the asset chain use cases will be deployed privately correct?

[02-Nov-18 07:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
hopefully not, but there are many private blockchains out there already in use and their usage is likely a trade secret.

[02-Nov-18 07:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
but he power of blockchain tech lies in it's availability to all.

@emma I went from a total blockchain noob to developing in under a year. I attribute this entirely to the KMD community

I'm still not a great "developer", but I know way more than I would if I would have stuck around any other community

@emma I just arrived at the start of the year and looked for things to do, learning on the way by getting my hands dirty. Like jok3r, Ive been recently added as a dapp dev as I now have a project in mind and the tools to do it ‚ò∫

[02-Nov-18 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Figure worth learning it all and having proof via something build will turn out a good choice in a few year once the rest of the world catches up and is crying out for devs

[02-Nov-18 07:39 AM] emma#2653
any asset chain running on production, i can look into or any business is using it..so i can see the usecases

[02-Nov-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
Plenty of assetchains in production, not so many contracts in production

[02-Nov-18 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
KMDICE has dice betting and VRSC has a "stakeguard" contract(which is hella clever, you guys should check that out
