yes, totally independent

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sounds like a better solution

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
import is a CC

[05-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses MoMoM magic to approve imports by proving a burntxid and then marks that burntxid as being used

[05-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need to use the same mechanism to prevent double imports

[05-Mar-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. its actually quite simple once I worked out what exactly it was doing. 😃

[05-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and we can have some sort of requirement of M notaries to approve the proof txid and given that, the import CC will do the import

[05-Mar-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so work on making the MoMoM process as reliable as possible, but 100% is not needed as we will have an alternate means. get @dimxy in the loop to make sure double imports cant be done and then we have 100% reliability

[05-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
a manual txproof process with M notary approvals. this process can even be automated by having a "mailbox" for txproof txid to be sent that notaries scan. If they agree that it was indeed a valid burn txproof, they post to an oracle. The one who did the burn would then gather all the specific approvals and submit a special import tx.

[05-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
its like baggage claim at the airport

[05-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the time the bags are just there, no problems

[05-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the bags dont arrive, you fill out a form, wait around, eventually they find the bag and deliver it the next day

seems notarization on LABSTH0 have stopped... the NULL MoMoM has activated and KMD blocks happening have not made it change from not null. Might need more range. Testing now will push fix shortly if it fixes it.

[05-Mar-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is really weird

[05-Mar-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems the issue is caused by one chain not having any notarizations for some extended time, just breaks everything

[05-Mar-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying a couple of things, but Im jaut about to give up 😢

[05-Mar-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im prety sure just but having lots of chains, so there are always MoM hash in the range... maybe it would force it to work, which may be why it worked when testing with a clsuter of 4.

[05-Mar-19 09:53 AM] CrisF#3405
What broke?

[05-Mar-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really dont understand

[05-Mar-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its like teh DB is just randomly empty

[05-Mar-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant fins any MoM hash.

[05-Mar-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not fucking with this tonight. Will sert my KMD to reindex and try again tomorrow if LABSTH0 is dead I iwll repalce it with a new chain.

[05-Mar-19 09:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm getting a strange balance in the node I'm setting up for migrates.  Seem to be missing ~30,000 DIMXY1.
Not sure if could be related.

[05-Mar-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No.. this is very specific bug, but making iguana refuse to notarize when it appeared makes the bug able to be fixed, I htink... added prints and I can see exactly what its doing. Its like it forgot notarizations. It takes 5-10 mins to resart KMD to test each change. Im not doing this now, its been a long enough day as it is. CFEK cluster is fine to test migrates on. LABSTH0 is dead, Im going to stop staking it so that block stop happening and it starys in this state for me to test toimorrow. There is 100% a bug here just need to wrok out what it is.

[05-Mar-19 09:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, have a good rest 👍

[05-Mar-19 09:59 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll see what I can get up to with migration.

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK will work, until this bug appears there

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it will stop notarizing

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This obviously has been the issue the whole time .....

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just couldnt see it

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or find it

[05-Mar-19 10:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Good that it is clearer now the.

[05-Mar-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Just time consuming to test as KMD takes to darn long to laod

[05-Mar-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even on fast computer 5-10 mins each time

[05-Mar-19 10:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Very  🆒

[05-Mar-19 11:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Is that from an oracle?

[05-Mar-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not yet

[05-Mar-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just working on the basic script to get the info needed from rpcs while waiting for cc qa tests to run

[05-Mar-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but this script will feed the oracle

[05-Mar-19 11:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll do one for the KMD assetchains too

What will the hardest part of making this?

[05-Mar-19 11:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
finding time :p

[05-Mar-19 11:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mostly the building blocks are available, so shouldn't be too hard

[05-Mar-19 11:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also been asked to incorporate into twitbot, which I've not done yet

[05-Mar-19 11:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, didn't think of that.  Would have guessed output. (vis)

[05-Mar-19 11:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just need to find the right python for it.  yep, vis will be added to oracle.earth

What will it twiit?  A text version, similar to the above?

@blackjok3r I'm seeing `komodo_staked invalid depth 0` in stdout for a PoS/PoW chain, am I correct in assuming that's from it trying to look at immature coinbase tx?

[05-Mar-19 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Only the PoS node is kicking that out, the PoW node does not

[05-Mar-19 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but the PoW node does have a bunch of `Requesting new peer node.3 blocksinrow.14 blocsinrow2.5`, not sure what that means either

[05-Mar-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

someone __please__ PoS LABSTH0

I need to migrate some from TH, so maybe later when I get home.

[05-Mar-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can't migrate to a non-moving chain 😛

[05-Mar-19 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
skimmed over the conversation here about failed imports, I can start helping designing "baggage claim" oracle if someone can explain to me what the inputs and outputs of it must be

[05-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
notaries checking oracle for users to post a burn txid that failed. Then what?

[05-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
they do a self import @jl777c ?

[05-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
they validate it's truly failed then self import it*

[05-Mar-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i wrote a document and posted it

[05-Mar-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
at first we need the rpc that does the baggage claim, dimxy is on that

[05-Mar-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is in place, it will become much clearer the oracle level things that are needed. basically a way to post a new baggage claim proof txid and a way for notaries to post their approvals

[05-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
ok, but what mechanism will we use to recreate the coins on target chain?

[05-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
will the notaries re-do the necessary notarization for it to not fail?

[05-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
or a self import?

[05-Mar-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be like a selfimport, but really it is a crosschain import

[05-Mar-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so there will be an import rpc that is given the txid of the txproof and the txids of the notary approvals of the proof tx

[05-Mar-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is my NN stuffed or have all chains but LABSTH been stuffed for like 3.5-4 hrs?

if anyone read what I wrote... I stoped staking LABSTH0 to keep it in an exact state

[05-Mar-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I left my computer to do a reindex on KMD to test  something.. and it froze.

[05-Mar-19 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  what is wrong with REWIND? it would be super useful  in this situation

[05-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
rewind *kind of* works, what do you need it for?

[05-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
it's very finicky, but I could explain how to use it

[05-Mar-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I decided against it... my PC is frozen but I can still ssh into the VM lol... going to kill it at 95% and then backup the chain. same result

[05-Mar-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
alright saved it at 94%... easy test tomorrow... finally an answer to why MoMoM hash is null....

[05-Mar-19 05:09 PM] Mylo#8306
i was reading about linkedin engineering's use of log files (kapka from apache and append-only logging).   gave me some thoughts on using multiple oracles for some dapps (like the supply chain stuff) for a PoC

[05-Mar-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
-rewind isnt guaranteed to work. i think it isnt cleanly rewinding, so eventually your DB gets messed up. however it can be useful for short term debuggings

Sorry to ask what might be a basic question but I'm trying to start komodod for komodo (KMD) and I'm having difficulty finding the paramaters for the daemon. Does anyone know what they should be ? Thanks

Fab, thanks 😃

[06-Mar-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
reindex didnt fix anything... so at least I know its not some kind of corruption.

[06-Mar-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
finally getting somewhere.... Seems there are multiple notarizations with the same MoM hash... guess it will need a dupe filter. Also my range "extender" didnt actually work I was missing another peice of the puzzle.

[06-Mar-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  if your dont censorship attack the chain the baggage claim isnt needed, your just making more work for yourself :troll_cool:

[06-Mar-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can get the system to work fine, wihtout the bagage claim, but its nice to have in the 1 millionth of 1  percent of imports that fail, be able to be recovered
