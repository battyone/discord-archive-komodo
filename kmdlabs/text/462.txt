Something is wrong 😅

[10-Aug-19 10:15 AM] phm87#7395
I hope that the ban will be ban to nota 1 coin and not ban to nota all coins (during one cycle)

[10-Aug-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
15 nodes with none lol. It could be many things

[10-Aug-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first of all you have to change the code tosubmit a bad sig,  but we have seen it happen in the past due to bugs or network problems
The ban works by checking each sig submitted on all nodes before they try to send the transaction, and detects which node did it then exludes it from the next round on that coin only.

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-Aug-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However, it didnt seem to be working too well when the node was banned. So banning may not be the best way to go... Having a way to easily tell which sig is bad, is very good tool though.

Are not working... Im investigating node 18 atm.

[10-Aug-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Probably a bug, I expected there to be some lol

`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/nn_testnet/src/notarystats.py` 
I used this but changed it to work

[10-Aug-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yours is better, just add the sort to it I guess. So its easier to read.

[10-Aug-19 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I had a sort, but key was string so 2 > 19

[10-Aug-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now I dont car about sorting into regins. The nodes not working are not in recvmask on other nodes, only themself so there is somehting wrong for sure.

[10-Aug-19 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
with vis, assming the aim is a sine wave?

[10-Aug-19 11:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe not... more like a staircase?

[10-Aug-19 11:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all notaries climb offset, share the landing and offset climb again

[10-Aug-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I thiunk something to monitor the frequency they happen, so we can easily see when one was missed and who participated... The best.k was rotating around by +1 with small number of nodes, but with 40+ its more random

[10-Aug-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That doesnt matter if the counts are reasonably close together.

[10-Aug-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
apart from the nodes not working at all, its within 50% after a day.

[10-Aug-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
48 in recvmak out of 59 nodes, 5/6 are offline

[10-Aug-19 11:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what block range should I run it at which is enough for assumed equality?

[10-Aug-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe start at 4500 .. the network took a while to stabilise at first.

[10-Aug-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But IO need to get these non working nodes working... then we can start the tally and run it for another 24H or so

[10-Aug-19 11:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nah I mean if I run it every 10 min (or hour), how many blocks back from tip? For graph, a set block range should give a better line (level gradient)

[10-Aug-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh sorry, um the RPC is pretty fast, so just poll getinfo for last notarised height

[10-Aug-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then grab that block+1 iterating forwards

[10-Aug-19 11:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but like total, 1 days worth of blocks?

[10-Aug-19 11:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
like ignore older

[10-Aug-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh, yeah a day seems enough

[10-Aug-19 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
then more sine wave than staircase.

[10-Aug-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This will be some boring stuff lol... going to take ages to gather enough info

[10-Aug-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181

💯

[10-Aug-19 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of the non working nodes were due to KMD splits not having a tx fee, and I did so many of them at once launching 36 nodes at the same time, they expired..

[10-Aug-19 05:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are 2 nodes who are connected to all others, but do not send packets... Weird stuff.

[10-Aug-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  
I guess the wallet should be notified about expired tx

[11-Aug-19 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I solved the nodes who do not send packets. There is bug in WIF detection for walletpassphrase call... 
Seems node 25 is on some kind of go go juice for no particualr reason 😄

[12-Aug-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  Can you please start the visualisation for testnet counts at block 8777 ? 
I have fixed some bugs

[12-Aug-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cany you remove nodes : 57, 52, 24, 5, 6 ?

[12-Aug-19 04:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no probs. it is oracle read/write, so I'll have to filter it from reading records older than timestamp value also

[12-Aug-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is the buttons to turn them off already. just ahrd to find them with so many lol

[12-Aug-19 04:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah lol. I was looking at it yesterday, thinkning of better filters

[12-Aug-19 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. block 8777 just happened... I guess it will take a day or so to get enough notas... Maybe I can make a second chain with very fast block times 🤔

[12-Aug-19 04:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
btw, I've had to take my LABS staking offline for this, might be time we make some proposals for the NN funds 😄

_says the bloke who hasnt sent his in to the multisig yet_

[12-Aug-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the bestk is rotating perfectly now. I think I got it right this time

how much labs we need nowadays to get at least 1 stake a day?

[13-Aug-19 10:52 AM] phm87#7395
@Oszy it depends a lot of other stakers, segid used ...
FYI, here is what I stake with around 5300 labs staking:

@phm87 thanks, I thought i should be betting something like this, I am staking about 4500 now but got no stakes in 16 hours, wondering if i am doing something wrong

[13-Aug-19 10:56 AM] phm87#7395
I use the pos64 to use all segids

chain ofc started with pubkey

[13-Aug-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
don't know what else it could be

[13-Aug-19 11:00 AM] phm87#7395
I started it without pubkey and I had better earnings

[13-Aug-19 11:00 AM] phm87#7395
I tried to have each utxo of 20 labs minimum

[13-Aug-19 11:00 AM] Oszy#5734
don't you need pubkey because of CC?

[13-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
or that'sj ust for Staked?

[13-Aug-19 11:01 AM] phm87#7395
I don t know. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 gave me few advices at that time

[13-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
I used to stake just fine back in June, even with only 2 labs on each segid

[13-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
just restarted yesterday

[13-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
with 70 each

[13-Aug-19 11:02 AM] phm87#7395
Someone on this channel created a tool to optimismze weight in each segid

[13-Aug-19 11:02 AM] phm87#7395
70 x 64 : you should have similar earnings than I have

[13-Aug-19 11:03 AM] phm87#7395
Search this channel for advices. Search pos64 ppl tried to enhance it and configure it better

[13-Aug-19 11:03 AM] phm87#7395
I will go back to work. I will read later sorry guy

[13-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Oszy#5734
yes i figured. might just consolidate and try again without pubkey
i also had problems with sendmany.py saying i have to enter a number (int) when i clearly entered a number 😄

[13-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Oszy#5734
thanks for help

[13-Aug-19 11:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Your chances are based on balance and utxo age, so the longer they sit still the better your odds become.

[13-Aug-19 11:12 AM] Oszy#5734
okay, do i need to use pubkey tho?

[13-Aug-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
if you use pubkey, all the new coins are sent there
till you are actively using a cc, a pubkey is not mandatory

[13-Aug-19 11:14 AM] Oszy#5734
thanks

[13-Aug-19 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not about CC at all
if you do use pubkey, all earnings go to that pubkey (more specifically they go to that same seg every time)
if you *don't* use pubkey, the earnings go to a "random" address (more specifically they go to a new random seg each time)

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
specifically more random than specific? 🤔

{Reactions}
😛 

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've gotten in habit of always setting pubkey, might need to not when I start LABs on up my staking node again.
