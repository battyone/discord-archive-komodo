[24-May-19 05:01 PM] Exile13#4458
run LABS from komodo/src?

[24-May-19 05:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just got home. Reading past messages now.

[24-May-19 05:02 PM] jorian#4555
there's really only one thing you should know: LABS released!

[24-May-19 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
We've got ~10k blocks until full block reward

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] Alright#0419
spread the word!

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] jorian#4555

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Alright#0419

`could you do pools when you get a chance`
tag me a list of what you want and a name  and I'll set up a labs pool and domain

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Alright#0419
chickenpool is fine?

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
feel free to do LABS unique domain though

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can add to chicken, but I figured we might want something specifically tied
I'm fine either way

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] jorian#4555
chickenpool plz

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] jorian#4555

[24-May-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Where can I find LABS4 chain params (have to make a snapshot)?

[24-May-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
I'll be throwing up my own chain as well, going to be using it for dilithium testing

[24-May-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only caveat to adding to chicken is that it will drop every time KMD drops until I sort out why the daemon dies on rewards blocks

[24-May-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, pricesCC coming to labs! 😃

[24-May-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r joker has bootstraps hosted somewhere @TonyL

[24-May-19 05:16 PM] jorian#4555

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
I'll buy as much as you'll sell at $50 mcap

😂 

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
whatever that may be

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
but seriously, no idea

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$50 mcap 😂 so much faith

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
offers?

[24-May-19 05:17 PM] jorian#4555
haha

[24-May-19 05:18 PM] jorian#4555
i need to check out some supply statistics

[24-May-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
takes ~10 years to reach basically 50% of the supply

[24-May-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
but not actually as there is no cap

[24-May-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel pushed it, can you try it and confirm it works

[24-May-19 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
`./stop.sh` `git pull` `./start.sh`

[24-May-19 05:27 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It runs on staked repo - just turning to Notary now

[24-May-19 05:27 PM] Exile13#4458

[24-May-19 05:30 PM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL , did you get the params?

[24-May-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, nor params or snapshot 😃

[24-May-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I have some blocks locally so maybe params will do a trick

[24-May-19 05:31 PM] Exile13#4458
`sudo ufw deny 9997`? and `sudo ufw allow 9333`?

[24-May-19 05:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, @Alright , could you confirm these are the params for STAKED4?```./komodod -ac_name=STAKED4 -ac_supply=274561 -ac_reward=1000000000 -ac_staked=100 -ac_end=8768 -ac_ccactivate=600 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5```

[24-May-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
`sudo ufw delete allow 9997`

might need some HAX to get it to sync now

[24-May-19 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
we should make a branch for syncing the STAKED chains though, get some explorers up

[24-May-19 05:35 PM] CrisF#3405
It's not for me.  @TonyL  needs it  (and the snapshot?)
