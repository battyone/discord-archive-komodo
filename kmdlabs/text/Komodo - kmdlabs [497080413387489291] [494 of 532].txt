yea... not sure why anyone would still be using it @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[24-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
the problems it fixed are fixed otherwise

[24-Oct-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
if anyone needs KMD for their node before the 31st, just message me

[24-Oct-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure why anyone would still be using it`
because you never know when someone will do something stupid?

Pinned a message.

[24-Oct-19 03:04 PM] phm87#7395
I needed this feature to be able to rescan to have utxo after whitelist one addy. I wanted to rescan from height for an addy already imported.
 But Alright proposed to spend utxo rrom mempool and I think it can be better
Thank you joker and alright

[24-Oct-19 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
sorry not sure what you're talking about @phm87

[24-Oct-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
rescan is for all addresses, if you rescan a height it processes all

[24-Oct-19 03:12 PM] phm87#7395
Jl: about rescan, later, I will show you joker s code and mine. Aim is to importprivkey with partil rescan when key is already imported.
Alright: I will tell you in DM

[24-Oct-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@phm87  what jl means is that if you trigger a rescan (even using my code to start and height and stop at a height) it will scan for ALL address in the wallet. There is no way to just scan for 1.

[24-Oct-19 03:59 PM] phm87#7395
Mmhhh maybe i misunderstood sth. I though my code rescan only for 1 addy as it is based on importprivkey. I will revise

[24-Oct-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No matter what or where you call it, it will scan ALL of the address's.

[24-Oct-19 04:04 PM] phm87#7395
Ok. For reference,
My idea: https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/pull/116 based on importprivkey. I will read again the rescan part ...

importprivkey allows to rescan from height if the address is not imported yet. A new parameter to importprivkey allows to rescan from height and force it if the address is already imported.

Mmmhhh you are right, both codes will rescan all addys
pwalletMain->ScanForWalletTransactions(chainActive[height], true);

[24-Oct-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, unless we edit the deep rescan code... which seems not the best idea.

[24-Oct-19 04:07 PM] phm87#7395
But in my case, there is only 1 addy in the wallet so i don t care. I played with walletfilter and this

[24-Oct-19 04:07 PM] phm87#7395
I won t edit deep rescan code

[24-Oct-19 04:08 PM] phm87#7395
But on my nn, only the nn addy is important. No other address should be there. Anyway, this idea is obsolete bc of alright idea to spend from mempool

[24-Oct-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
spend what from mempool?

[24-Oct-19 04:24 PM] phm87#7395
Utxo

[24-Oct-19 04:25 PM] phm87#7395
Alright had this idea when some utxo disappeared from 2 nodes

[24-Oct-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has spent UTXOs from the mempool longer than he's know what Komodo was other than a large lizard_

[24-Oct-19 04:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in some cases, spending mempool UTXOs is a good way to get around high BTC fees

[24-Oct-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i spent from mempool few days ago on KMD

[24-Oct-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
had to use higher fee

[24-Oct-19 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i mean for what reason do ypu need to spend from mempool and how does it relate to wallet filter

[24-Oct-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
both those txs confirmed in same block

[24-Oct-19 04:29 PM] phm87#7395
First, I wanted to split from another node, use walletfilter to do not see these utxo. And use rescan from height to see the utxo.
Secondly, alright suggested to coinsplit from another node, not broadcast tx, put mempool utxo on the nn, not broadcast it, spend it.
I hope to keep a small wallet.dat with alright idea

[24-Oct-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i mean for what reason do ypu need to spend from mempool and how does it relate to wallet filter`
dunno about the 2nd part, but for the 1st part:
super low fee on a large tx and a "high" fee on respending the change will be a lower total fee and the change tx will force the low fee tx to process

[24-Oct-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
So walletfilter is not related to mempool spending. Sorry for the confusion

[24-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 previous tx does need to be broadcast prior to using it

[24-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
idea was to make a few in advance, and broadcast them as needed

[24-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
think it will cause the notarization round to stop if all nodes in the round don't have the previous dependent tx in their mempool

[24-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
Ah right, no this idea was for *mining* blocks, not notarizations

[24-Oct-19 04:38 PM] phm87#7395
Interesting. I did not test it yet

[24-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
yea kind of forgot why I had suggested it, basically it was a way to ensure a NN key could continually mine even if the key had been leaked

[24-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
you need a 0.0001 utxo to mine a block, so idea was to just create this utxo *within* the block

My sas ssd does not work. What is the min req for the test net? I can pick up a 10k hdd 150gb is that good enough?

[25-Oct-19 08:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yes that. China not going to squash crypto.

[25-Oct-19 08:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
@hastrup I believe joker run a main net notary node on 15k drives last year. With the new iguana it should work as it has some delays in it and waits for others if I understood correctly.
10k should be fine give it a try or get some cheap vps on hetzner they have ssd

[25-Oct-19 09:07 PM] hastrup#8742
@CHMEX thx I will try tomorrow and hope I make it I time

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] Alright#0419
@kevinkatovic how long are these "breaks"?

[25-Oct-19 11:19 PM] Alright#0419
you mean your own nodes or the network in general?

[25-Oct-19 11:28 PM] gt#2812
i think he means block times

[25-Oct-19 11:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's maybe because i've put some asics on the network

it's just how pos64 works, it's really wonky when hashrate comes on/off the network

[25-Oct-19 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
needs to be fixed, might have to get rid of the pos algo entirely though

[25-Oct-19 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
basically, it will increase pow diff to some ridiculous unminingable level expecting a POS block to come in

[25-Oct-19 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
POS block doesn't come in and it just sits and waits until one does

[25-Oct-19 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
or someone solves the incredibly high diff

[25-Oct-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
increase hashrate?

[25-Oct-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419

a linux virtual machine

[25-Oct-19 11:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's not a masternode

[25-Oct-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
java? O.o

[25-Oct-19 11:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
staking is best done in a full node - cli (command line interface)

[25-Oct-19 11:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you're on windows, google/learn how to setup a linux virtual machine and then come back for the next step

[25-Oct-19 11:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you use windows 10 you can use WSL (windows subsystem for linux) with ubuntu

[26-Oct-19 12:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
it seems like you're in need of learning how crypto works
