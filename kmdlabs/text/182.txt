OK I have this working. I ended up removing teh exports... Its going to be too slow to calculate those. It seems a simple `gettxoutsetinfo`  will be the easierst way to detect burnt coins, and then usign the new data from james change earlier we can locate the export tx on the source chain. 
So you run the RPC on a block, it returns the blocktime, the total amount imported in that block, and an array of these for each import tx:
```    {
      "txid": "57afa5f7750029709ec224e63528eba997f6865598c7bfc6c5fb7324f3e7b62e",
      "amount": 10.00000000,
      "address": "RAwx45zENMPa2p4AGnGmbrFEw6wtGoUXi6",
      "export": {
        "txid": "1f3294e2c236d36cf3d8d447d3f6185e4523101a9f5498c629ad3872dc995a91",
        "amount": 10.00000000
        "chain": "CFEK:"
      }
    }
```

I guess I will merge upstream down, and make sure I can build everything in the new branch with those changes. Then we need new chains with this new data. ONce 2we have some data I can work out how to extract it and add to the new RPC.

[02-Jan-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can also add one of these new chains james is working on, as a seperate chain, so we can test his new changes, to make sure they dont break anything.

[02-Jan-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This will be needed before launch.

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] CrisF#3405
So I have 3 new chains for testing - Stress Test Logging, Dragonhound spam test, jl777 Test chain.

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Does that sound right?

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We needto check with james on specifics of his new chain and what he needs tested.

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As we now need to merge the code down, we need to test it...

[02-Jan-19 02:58 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, and need to find out if PoS can be on-demand.

[02-Jan-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that it can, as long as there is no block reward.... Keep in mind an on demand chain cannot be in the cluster

[02-Jan-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without blocks happening, the MoMoM hash cannot get built.

[02-Jan-19 03:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, maybe better to put that on-demand off then.

[02-Jan-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont take up that much extra, but having too many chains, will make this test a little hard... we should keep scale in mind but not go overboard.

[02-Jan-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will get expensive fast if we have too many chains.

[02-Jan-19 03:03 PM] CrisF#3405
With a Dragonhound chain and log chain both doing a lot of oracle transactions while the migration stress test is going on will it be a bit of a simulation for the Scaling Test?

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes this is the idea... I was asked to incorperate othe new types of txs into that...

[02-Jan-19 03:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Is it better to do a pure migration test first?  Then add oracle action when that's complete?

[02-Jan-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hard to say... at this point we just need new chains so we can test something, as right now the whole CFEK network is not really usuable for migrates.

[02-Jan-19 03:07 PM] CrisF#3405
So next step is making new chains to test RPC?

[02-Jan-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, I need to get this stuff working, it should be the last of any hardforking changes needed..

[02-Jan-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unles we find more

[02-Jan-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ondemand is independent of consensus mechanism

[02-Jan-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
migrates depend on block to be happening though, so on demand is not compatible with a cluster,

[02-Jan-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would probably work, but you need to tx generate to keep the chain moving

[02-Jan-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
makes sense. ondemand is just the miners waiting for a mempool tx

[02-Jan-19 03:12 PM] CrisF#3405
Should we add a 100%PoW or 2 also?

[02-Jan-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... those are easier for test chains as we dont need to worry about staking... that said, if someone wants to ruin th test they can stall the chains... so

[02-Jan-19 03:17 PM] CrisF#3405
I was thinking just for these tests, more to simulate Scaling, not for final launch config.

[02-Jan-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it should be ok to just do something easier yes.

[02-Jan-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What we want at first is simply 2 chains in a cluster

[02-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once everything on those is confirmed to at least work, we can launch everything else... We cna keep CFEK and CFEKLF if ppl need those for existing work.

[02-Jan-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
these changes are in a new branch at least for now...

[02-Jan-19 03:35 PM] CrisF#3405
So something like this?
Test jl777 chain
100%POW -- Dragonhound cluster  (fresh chains, just testing migrations)
add Log chain (outside observer, not in cluster, see how oracle activity effects migrations, start logging)
add new 100%POW -- new Dragonhound to CFEK -- CFEKLF cluster with Log chain (logging, outside observer)
Go sick, logging mass migrations.

[02-Jan-19 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks good üòÉ

[02-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This new branch is working... Appears that existing calls are not broken with new feild... I need to create a burn with the new feild though ü§î

[02-Jan-19 03:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool!

[02-Jan-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I might try a migrate on CFEKING ....

[02-Jan-19 03:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Do you still need the params and info needed for the chain for jl777?

[02-Jan-19 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I am not 100% sure what he changed... I changed some of that code already to make it work for what I need it for...

[02-Jan-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not even sure if all these changes are finished.

[02-Jan-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it adds the source chain automatically, as long as that is what runs the migrate_converttoexport rpc

[02-Jan-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that is there... I just ahd to remove your things for 0xfffff

[02-Jan-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it actually used it for all chains

[02-Jan-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
why? 0xffffffff wont ever happen

[02-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Existing calls seem to be working... I think

[02-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that was some special case you added to activate the rawproof

[02-Jan-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
only selfimport call does that

[02-Jan-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it denotes a selfimport

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
which happens to need the rawproof

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes and migtates now also need the rawproof

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
well  i had it so it was optional

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want to make it required that is a hardfork

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes which is why I am hardforking

[02-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and making new chains

[02-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they have been hard forked already

[02-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they are broken

[02-Jan-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how do I convert the vecort of ints back to a string?

[02-Jan-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just len followed by the string

[02-Jan-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
uint8_t holds a char

[02-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got it

[02-Jan-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i designed the 0xffffffff path to be able to work backwards compatible with existing

[02-Jan-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and it would never happen with normal crosschain import

[02-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but to add the source chain to the burntx it would never add it

[02-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For anything we have been discussing today to work it needs this change...

[02-Jan-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it does

[02-Jan-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
line 204 to 207 crosschain.cpp

[02-Jan-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the MakeBurnOutput gets the rawproof, which is the ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL

[02-Jan-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i see, i missed a spot

[02-Jan-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
in the function itself it needs to do it all the time

[02-Jan-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
fixing

[02-Jan-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed

[02-Jan-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so it always write it, but it wont use it for consensus

[02-Jan-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I think I get how I am supposed to do it then, rather than use UnmarshalBurn I just use the code for it in my RPC. Thanks

[02-Jan-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Jan-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if I try to add data that isnt there it will crash right?

[02-Jan-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So i need to check that its included first ?

[02-Jan-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
unmarshal will just fail

[02-Jan-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok sweet that makes it easy then

[02-Jan-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok this is all working now... I tested the logic of extracting the source name with a simple 10 line C program, and ti worked so it should work. Its also al backwards compatible. If the data isnt there it just skips source for that import.

I'll have to come back to this... didnt work.

[02-Jan-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it does need to specifically parse the rawproof

[02-Jan-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It might do... Its far too late to delve into it now.. Will look at it tomorrow

Hi @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator,  was wondering if you saw the talk of adding a Dragonhound test change to the migration stress test?

[03-Jan-19 12:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Are there and params that you'd like to test/use?

[03-Jan-19 01:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I've added a summary of what was discussed yesterday to the pad and updated the Todo.

[03-Jan-19 01:34 AM] CrisF#3405
There are 2 things that could use some rather immediate attention:
(on Todo)  
1.1 Collect info on what is needed for TUI.  Send to TonyL.
1.2 Data Format for oracle
Help on these would be much appreciated!

We need to decide what data is relavent ...

[03-Jan-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like what do we want to show...

[03-Jan-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we show too much ... it will be overwhelming... needs to be like what we did for scaletest and take the bare minimum. Then show it nice and simple.

[03-Jan-19 01:44 AM] CrisF#3405
First part for stress test should be straight logging.
