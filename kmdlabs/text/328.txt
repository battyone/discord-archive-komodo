@Alright - has the notary fund gone out?

[10-Mar-19 11:03 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[10-Mar-19 11:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
do you need funds to notarize?

[10-Mar-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, there should be funds sent to your NN adress.

[10-Mar-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
10 for both the new chains.

[10-Mar-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Also need a little KMD.

[10-Mar-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
@CHMEX

[10-Mar-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
I'm hoping to set up some kind of centralized faucet for notaries if I win elections

[10-Mar-19 11:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
post the KMD address and I send some

[10-Mar-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
50% of mining rewards go to this faucet then LABS notaries have a weekly stipen they can claim if they choose to

[10-Mar-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
or monthly I guess

[10-Mar-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I have some CHMEX, sorry I though you mean if they are required.

[10-Mar-19 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
50% is a lot!

[10-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
pssshhh that's only 25 simultaneous chains

[10-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
less and less as we add notaries

[10-Mar-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Does a KMD NN average 2000 KMD/month?

[10-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
~50/day

[10-Mar-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
even better üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 11:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes about 1500 per Month

{Reactions}
treasure 

[10-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think 50% is enough even @CrisF üòõ

[10-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
I want us to have enough saved up to last for years

[10-Mar-19 11:28 AM] CHMEX#0686
If I get elected I will have send at least 10% ( 150KMD) per month.
If needed to get started I can even send it upfront.

We'll have to figure a way for the chain to become self-supporting.

[10-Mar-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
this is it üòõ

[10-Mar-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise notaries or chain creators can be responsible for providing KMD needed for notarization tx fees

[10-Mar-19 11:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I was relying on the tipbot before but not much tipping going on these days.

[10-Mar-19 11:30 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Yeah - I had to sell some other stuff to buy some KMD

[10-Mar-19 11:31 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
but KMD is well undervalued ATM so..

[10-Mar-19 11:33 AM] gt#2812
how big does the pot have to be to be self sustaining?

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been selling small parts of my soul, 5 days a week to buy KMD üëî

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
a single KMD notary can sustain about 50 simultaneous LABS/CFEK chains. This number will go down as we add more min sigs.

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
we could change the RXL address and recycle the KMD if we absolutely needed to, but I'd rather not do this

[10-Mar-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
even if we did that, we would need to still cover tx fees

[10-Mar-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
we aren't entirely reliant on funding from a KMD notary, but it's much better for LABS NNs to not have to worry about buying KMD

gotta update that node, brb

[10-Mar-19 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

I haven't had a single XY4 notarisation yet

[10-Mar-19 12:17 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
and only 3 connections

[10-Mar-19 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I'm getting the most on xy4.
3 connections also.

[10-Mar-19 12:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ahh - probably my peers then

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
I have 14 and 16 peers on the seed nodes

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
only 3 on my NN

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
open your p2p ports if you want, I don't think it's a problem though

[10-Mar-19 12:26 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
p2p's are open - 3 is a worry, as I have two local nodes on connect to it - so it looks like I am only getting the seed.

[10-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Nabob#5004
Updated, I see LABSTH chains killed, are we adding those notarized  funds to existing chains ?

[10-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
@Nabob sorry, what?

[10-Mar-19 02:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Updated

[10-Mar-19 02:11 PM] gt#2812
those were just test chains

[10-Mar-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they lived long enough

[10-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
Ah right, @Nabob sorry is that was confusing, LABSTH and LASBTH0 were not canonical chains

hello folks.  Thanks to @MadMaX 's new explorer I just leared that your CFEKDIMXY3 notarizations are hitting the blockchain.  Congrats!  Obviously I need to get out more and see what others are doing.  Is there an address I can donate to help offset some of the costs?

[10-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Mylo#8306
@CrisF put a donate address on the site maybe?   Use a vanity address üòÑ   i've got a vanity address for when i'm in full swing and can update keys - RKMDLaBSboRLuhSZ9.......

wont matter becasue your pubkey isnt in the current era it wont work

[11-Mar-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I wrote the script not sure if it works yet... such a slow test lol.. at least after it runs once I can just use the same export tx over and over to debug the script.
