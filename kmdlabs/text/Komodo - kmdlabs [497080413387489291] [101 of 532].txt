it shoul dstill work... but these chains still had issues with stalling

[23-Nov-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be ok now as I definatly am mining and staking all of them

[23-Nov-18 10:34 AM] CrisF#3405
👌  Not sure if related to the reset.

[23-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still cant see anyone in my mask 😦 something is definatly wrong atm

[23-Nov-18 10:35 AM] gt#2812
cfek seems to be barely moving

[23-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats normal

[23-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the difficulty gfrom Alright staking with trillions of coins is through the roof

[23-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just dont have enough to keep it moving atm

[23-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should adjust

[23-Nov-18 10:36 AM] gt#2812
i keep having needs to be funded but it should be

`curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server KMD.(127.0.0.1:7771 getinfo), retries: 4
`
Ahhh, do I need port 7771 open...

[23-Nov-18 10:37 AM] jorian#4555
that means KMD is down

[23-Nov-18 10:37 AM] CrisF#3405
yeah, ufw?

[23-Nov-18 10:37 AM] zatJUM#9924
just 22 and 9997 ports

[23-Nov-18 10:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's what I thought.  They are good.

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komod is not running for you dude

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try to start it manually

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just ./komodod -stakednotary -pubkey=<pubkey>

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, wondering why.

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe crashed ??? I just started a fresh sync KMD here ... and it worked instantly

[23-Nov-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
master branch

[23-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just restarted my notary - new pubkey, output looks ok

👌 

[23-Nov-18 10:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Mine was going well, too.

[23-Nov-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do you have utxo @Bar_F1sh_Rel

[23-Nov-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do ./stats

[23-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hard to keep track - Ash on old windows phone!

[23-Nov-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should just need 2 more nodes with utxos and it will start working ... but i dont really know ... I onyl ahve the 1 node this time ... so I am rlying on you guys to help em work out why its broken 😅

[23-Nov-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once again, sorry for just hardforking the whiole netrwork with no notice .. this wil be hte last time 🤞

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Utxo's 20+ but no notarizations

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its not notarising ...

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you have KMD utxo ?

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Last time, where's the fun in that?
I should be up in a few

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
48+

[23-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok .. there is only 3 things it can be ...

[23-Nov-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no utxo, bad netowkr connection (its not that I can see you call in my extra prints on node 0 )or the most likely, 
we udated era too fast, and some nodes are seeing diffrent last notarisations to others, and they cant reach consensus.

[23-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in alst case, reayncing CFEK* chains, will fix it once updated to newest verison.

[23-Nov-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just wait for a few more ppl to get nodes up dated and we can see...

[23-Nov-18 10:49 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ok. Break over anyway - will be home and on a proper keyboard in about 3h

{Reactions}
👍 

[23-Nov-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I need to make change to iguana... for now its no problem... as we are only using CFEK.. will do that now though befor ei forget about it.

[23-Nov-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
i have funds but not notarizign

[23-Nov-18 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
port open

[23-Nov-18 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
recvmask.20

[23-Nov-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have recv mask 23, me alright, and tonyL

[23-Nov-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will resync my node ..

[23-Nov-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
see what it does

[23-Nov-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likely also, maybe the seed nodes being all flat wrong is an issue.

[23-Nov-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nobody has updated them for a long time... I htink possibly my node is the only one that is right

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If resync oesnt fix it ... I will nee to gather some IPs off you guys and update the seeds.

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
There are CFEK, CFEKED, CFEKING and CFEKLF. What is the purpose of each chain?

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing really ... they aere to test MoMoM

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
And as a suggestion maybe naming will be changed in future?

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
started as one chain each with a diffrent fix and setting

[23-Nov-18 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Since it's a lab now 😃

[23-Nov-18 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes all new chains wil lbe LAB* or LABS*

[23-Nov-18 10:57 AM] CrisF#3405
`195.201.150.200`

[23-Nov-18 10:58 AM] CrisF#3405
`LAB` looks better.

[23-Nov-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we can add multiple names ... its very easy

[23-Nov-18 10:59 AM] gcharang#6833
Deleteing the `.komodo` dir and starting again fixed that 
```
  "blocks": 0,
  "longestchain": 0,
```
problem

[23-Nov-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... still dont get what its from ..

[23-Nov-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that does always fix it

[23-Nov-18 11:00 AM] CrisF#3405
`LAB-FEK`...

[23-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL we're going to try to keep CFEK network alive as a testnet

[23-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jorian#4555
yeah or start animal names. something really distinguishing

[23-Nov-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
most of the totally disposable chains stuff is done ... at least I hope it is ...

lablab

[23-Nov-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the main thing we needed was MoMoM working perectly so ppl couldnt lose coins ... and that seems to be done. abut I need to retest ... I have an idea of how to fill blocks wiht migrates btw ...

I like the sounds of that!!

[23-Nov-18 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Marketing guy aske dme about it ... and with the wallet cleaner, and the right logic in the scripts it seems quite easy

[23-Nov-18 11:03 AM] CMaurice#1685
bags IA chain

[23-Nov-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cna all have a chain each... but keep in mind, adding more chains long term means you need more and more RAM ... for your notatry.

[23-Nov-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably a good idea to keep initial chains small,... so notary stays profitable..

[23-Nov-18 11:05 AM] CMaurice#1685
I only want it for the name LABIA

😅 

[23-Nov-18 11:05 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r Shouldn't port 7776 be open to ```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776"``` in your scripts?

[23-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
NO!

[23-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats iguanas RPC port

[23-Nov-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it MUST be closed

[23-Nov-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your only using it locally... opening it means ppl can issue commands to your iguana

[23-Nov-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or worse attack it in some way

[23-Nov-18 11:07 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok!

[23-Nov-18 11:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
Trying to find why I get this:```$ ./checkmasks 
Seed recvmask: 0
[]
not:
[]

My recvmask: 0
[]

Best bestmask: null [null agree]
[]

My bestmask: 0
[]```

[23-Nov-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1) becasue that script doesnt work...

[23-Nov-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and 2) you dont ahve any info

[23-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
