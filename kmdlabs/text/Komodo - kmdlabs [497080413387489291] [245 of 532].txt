Fixed KMD syncing issue.

[25-Jan-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still not sure how that happened... it was some kind of overflow bug...

[25-Jan-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
where it was saying that `"" == CFEK`

[25-Jan-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to test it works with labs chain.

[25-Jan-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then will push fix

[25-Jan-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
Update pushed. There are 2 changes that might have broken everything. 
1)  KMD was somehow identifying itself as a staked chain, and initializing the incorrect notary nodes. 
2) LABST was being set as STAKED = 2, which means it wasnt allowed a block reward. This could have forked some nodes... Hopefully nobody was on the commit that introduced this problem. Its only been up a few hours.

[25-Jan-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its possible that LABST will need to be restarted.. I cant be sure.

[25-Jan-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
YAY!! I haz UTXOs 😎

[25-Jan-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As a result of the new build:
```initialized CFEKPOS51 at 1548437427
komodod: chain.cpp:162: CBlockIndex* CBlockIndex::GetAncestor(int): Assertion `pindexWalk->pprev' failed.```

[25-Jan-19 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there were about 40 blocks mined with 0 coinbase when it shoul have ahd a coinbase

[25-Jan-19 05:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm or not

[25-Jan-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on the + side, it's only 16k blocks to resync 😛

[25-Jan-19 05:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[25-Jan-19 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK sorry thaught it was LABST

[25-Jan-19 05:52 PM] gt#2812
```komodod: main.cpp:3966: bool ConnectTip(CValidationState&, CBlockIndex*, CBlock*): Assertion `pcoinsTip->GetSproutAnchorAt(pcoinsTip->GetBestAnchor(SPROUT), oldSproutTree)' failed.```

[25-Jan-19 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
reindex fixed whatever issue CFEKPOS51 had 👍🏽

[25-Jan-19 05:54 PM] CMaurice#1685
updated but forgot to delete LABST let me know if it was needed, back later to do it if necessary

[25-Jan-19 05:54 PM] gt#2812
i'll just sync from scratch

[25-Jan-19 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What will happen here, is the ndoes who update will instantly fork LABST once someone mines a block with a reward

[25-Jan-19 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because its currentl;y mining blocks, with 0 reweard, that is less than what its meant to be, so its valid

[25-Jan-19 05:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no need to resync at this time. Until someone mines/stakes a block with a reward there have been no forks *yet*

[25-Jan-19 05:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if anything happens tro any chains, reindex or resync them.

[25-Jan-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

any idea as to why my nn hasn't notarized __anything__ in over an hr on the new build?

[25-Jan-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
probably because  everyone who updated has a broken KMD ndoe

[25-Jan-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no nobody is notarising

[25-Jan-19 06:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`CFEKPOS51` is showing a ton of notarizations on my staking node

[25-Jan-19 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Will check my node soon, x and y may not have any blocks? I stopped mining nodes and ran out of time to get more back up. St I'm sure just need more to update to same version.

[26-Jan-19 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There will be nodes on a fork
