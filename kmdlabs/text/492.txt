So reindex did the trick.

[21-Oct-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know it's moving, I need to know how long you need it to move for 😛

[21-Oct-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems an issue with the altest merge then. I'll double check this tomorrow. Can someone try to start KMD with utxocache branch to see if is also affected?

[21-Oct-19 02:02 PM] CrisF#3405
That's fine now.  Confirmed `6` can notarize here now.

[21-Oct-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant merge that down to our master if it breaks everything

[21-Oct-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Can someone try to start KMD with utxocache branch to see if is also affected?`
sure, I need to collect rewards anyway 😛

[21-Oct-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure KMD will be happy if we find bugs also

[21-Oct-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
still 9 days to sync, but KMD seems fine

[21-Oct-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did we work out what caused it, or just that doing a reindex fixes it?

[21-Oct-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't sort out what actually caused it
it wasn't a specific block or tx
they "just didn't work" and then they did after a reindex 🤷🏽

[21-Oct-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder why it only did that to some of you?

[21-Oct-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it would load a few new blocks each run (in the locked state)

[21-Oct-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wonder why it only did that to some of you?`
that bit I cannot guess at even, since I can't even tell *why* it wouldn't go

[21-Oct-19 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
reindex fixes it, but I have no clue what it fixes 😕

[21-Oct-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah. iuf anyone still has a blockchain that does this please tar it for me

[21-Oct-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the really strange bit for me was that after the reindex of CFEKMYLO6, CFEKMYLO "magically" did the same thing

[21-Oct-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its clearly a problem with mutex/locks... they are the hardest bugs to fix 😅

[21-Oct-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stop introducing bugs then :troll_lol:

[21-Oct-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the fact that reindex "fixed" it may not be the case... just that it removed some condition that is needed for it to happen, it may reappar. 
I only merged down FSM, it must be that, because master and utxocache are equal for us.. I merged FSM to utxocche for @CrisF  and then this happened... 
Try to load a chain affected with master branch if anyone still has an issue. That should at least narrow ti down to tthat merge and give me something to look at

👍 

[21-Oct-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I merged FSM to utxocche for @CrisF and then this happened... `
or it may be entirely unrelated, so `Try to load a chain affected with master branch if anyone still has an issue.` is a really good next try if it happens to anyone else 👍🏽

[21-Oct-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
----------
KMD with utxocache branch synced and worked with no obvious issues

[21-Oct-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wanders off to finish the staking script he should have finished 6 months ago...._

[21-Oct-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... after all that, CFEKMYLO6 has finally locked for me 🙂 Will check it out once Im finished what Im doing

[21-Oct-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
randomness: such a lovely, detestable thing

[21-Oct-19 02:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, interested to know what's causing it.

😂 💯 treasure 

[21-Oct-19 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r 
The issue seems to cascade for whatever reason
I had it pop up again with 6, changed that to master, then it existed in CFEKMYLO. changed that to master, now it's present in CFEKAPOW
😕

[21-Oct-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So its in master and utxocache branches? This isnt chain specific. I haver a node in a stuck state, need to gdb to it. you cant attach it to the thread and then find which lock is stuck.

[21-Oct-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but im deep in other code... really cant do it now

[21-Oct-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everything that I switched to master worked
the problem is that the issue seems to "jump" chains based on usage of the utxocache branch (the issue, oddly enough,seems to be contained to the 1st or 2nd chain used)

@LabsAssistant  
I pushed update to remove CFEKOD and revert all chains back to master branch.
`cd ~/StakedNotary`
`git checkout many_iguana`
`pkill -15 iguana`
`pkill -15 komodod` 
wait until the responding daemons stop
`pkill -9 komodod`
`./start.sh`

[21-Oct-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
on the last update, i had to do fresh sync for all chains exccept KMD

[21-Oct-19 08:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
ufff at least KMD survived

[21-Oct-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
but, had to launch KMD manually though :abused_smiley:

[21-Oct-19 08:11 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`pkill -15 komodod` followed by `pkill -9 komodod` 😅

[21-Oct-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
use -9 IF -15 didnt work

[21-Oct-19 08:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are more than 1 komodod... doing 15 first makes sure the ones thjat are not dead locked stop safley.

[21-Oct-19 08:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
didn't you make a stop.sh script to stop everything ? I always used that

[21-Oct-19 08:27 PM] zatJUM#9924
👆 Here too 😉

[21-Oct-19 08:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but when the daemon is deadlocked the stop script hangs

G'day fellows

[22-Oct-19 10:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I hear you guys have a chain that uses aPoW in your cluster. What is the performance like? What test have been done/what can one expect?

[22-Oct-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes CFEKAPOW has beeen running for a while. @Alright  and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  were the ones messing with that. Not sure how far they got.

[22-Oct-19 10:26 AM] Oszy#5734
Shossain and Jl tested aPoW extensively back in August in #talk-mining  around the 8th of Aug you can see their results

[22-Oct-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not sure how far they got.`
the end result was that no one still believes what I said

[22-Oct-19 02:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
im in the dark on aPoW... what did the Genie say?!?

So who is the whale buying up LABS on Graviex?

[22-Oct-19 02:17 PM] Oszy#5734
someone who knows that it's worth a lot more than 100th of a cent 😄

[22-Oct-19 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
25K in 3 days of buying

[22-Oct-19 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
not a bad haulr for them

[22-Oct-19 02:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
and for under 300 KMD no less

[22-Oct-19 02:21 PM] Oszy#5734
pretty cheap and staking 25k can get you around 500 or more a day

[22-Oct-19 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats about in line with my staking per amount held

bot has sold 44k sold in last 2 days, and purchased 11k

[22-Oct-19 02:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still tryna find a good price point, graviex was all I had to go by and it's not that informative. I had enough to spare tho, and will adjust prices to reflect market

[22-Oct-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
graviex has low volume and an arbitrage bot on btc/kmd not very informative regarding a fair price

[22-Oct-19 02:57 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well, its rising there also 🙂

I have (had) LABS pairs for a dozen coins on AtomicDEX. Will activate BTC next round.

Is the oracle still broken to register for lottery?

[22-Oct-19 03:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah actually it is, I already had BTC active but only as buy not sell. my bot has two flags - one for buy and another for sell. most coins on binance have both active but I dont really have enough btc in there to make selling worth it (fees etc)

Wooohooo, after many failed attempts, I was able to connect to the VM, make the necessary update then ... the connection broke (my friend will try to fix the unstability in the network between the servers/pfsenses and he will also add a new entry point on the pfsense of the server containing KMDLabs VM).
Good news is that I was able to update the KMDLabs nn ^^

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I read somewhere that you have a bot that allows you to create liquidity on atomicDEX, do some arbitrage and loose money (tiny %). Is it opensource ? Can I use it to add liquidity on something else ? (I am thinking about Chips tbh)

[22-Oct-19 09:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
bots can add volume but not liquidity imo

[22-Oct-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
yes I see what you mean but it will create at least some movements and if we have an OTC deal with a whale, it can do the trick

[22-Oct-19 10:56 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can remove apow chain if it's still there, completely forgot about it

[22-Oct-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
pretty thoroughly tested, maybe ready for production, but should do some wider scale tests really

[22-Oct-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
who was thinking about using it?

[22-Oct-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
I guess that if apow is added into chips, dpow should run as fine as it is running on CFEKAPOW and as fine as it will run on "normal" chips

[22-Oct-19 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
you going to port it?

[22-Oct-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
jl helped me, code is done, I tested it the HF worked and I had cpu blocks, it worked but I tweaked too much

[22-Oct-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
make CHIPS 100% POS and increase overall supply 😛
