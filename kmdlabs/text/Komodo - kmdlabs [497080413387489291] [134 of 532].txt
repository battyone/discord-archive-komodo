@CrisF ill help out in anyway i can

[27-Nov-18 01:51 PM] CrisF#3405
That's great @gt !
Could you please get in touch with @CMaurice ?  I think that @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  has many things you can use and will be a great help when  he has the chance!

[27-Nov-18 01:53 PM] CrisF#3405
A good goal to start might be to get something running for the upcoming migrations test.  I don't think anything fancy would be needed.

[27-Nov-18 01:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Maybe @blackjok3r can give an idea of what stats would be useful for that.

[27-Nov-18 01:58 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm looking forward to see what you guys come up with!  There are many people here who can help out.

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF I think maybe this might be related to what that guy is reporting in developer, you were staking and tried to do a sendmany?

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And it just dead locked?

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes.

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes.

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Haven't seen that one yet.

[27-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Does it do it every time?

[27-Nov-18 02:04 PM] CrisF#3405
No, did 10~12so far with no problem. Then problem.

[27-Nov-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmm OK.. I'll have a look at it, I dont this k that should happen

[27-Nov-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[27-Nov-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe try to setgenerate false before sending as a work around for now

[27-Nov-18 02:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, it might have been a coincidence  about the send many, but that's how it played out.
I've got to run now but will check back.

[27-Nov-18 02:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Will do.

[27-Nov-18 06:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Signing import tx on KMD...
still from  12 hours ago

[27-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - check KMD komodod has not crashed

[27-Nov-18 06:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
KMD                      51 1115830       3.9138    27s

[27-Nov-18 06:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
still nota

[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hmmm - I run my migrates on a non-notary (so I can reset without fekin stuff up!)

[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
lol

[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I was just testing for fun

[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill atop and build my other system

[27-Nov-18 06:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you could try a stop/start - shouldn't hurt notary that much - and were not mainnet yet

[27-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r - excuse my dimm-ness - trying to do the sendrawtransaction for CFEK-CFEKLF error from earlier.
Do I need to use the asset-cli from CFEKLF and which bit of the hex do I need to append?

[27-Nov-18 06:56 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I was sure it was supposed to be ``$completeTX`` but that gives me ``0: invalid-coin-import``

[27-Nov-18 07:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
Can someone explain to me (or point an url) what all this migrating stuff is all about? 4 or 5 people here seem to know all about that for 2 days, and I'm not one of those üòâ

[27-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
part of the cluster workings is that you can transfer coins between chains with the same CCid
so from CFEK to CFEKED or to CFEKING etc etc.
The migrate scripts are the process.

[27-Nov-18 07:43 PM] CMaurice#1685
Where is the CCid?

[27-Nov-18 07:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Bar_F1sh_Rel I don't understand. Your explaination is like "transfer kmd to btc blockchain" ü§î

[27-Nov-18 07:49 PM] CMaurice#1685
@zatJUM you can easily look up "one way peg", as jl777 explained to me this is a n:n peg

[27-Nov-18 09:13 PM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice cc ID is in `getinfo`.  I think this cluster is 103 but pls check.

[27-Nov-18 09:16 PM] CrisF#3405
@zatJUM Yes, it's like that. Coins are burned on one chain and created on the other.

[27-Nov-18 09:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
So it modifies the coin supply?

[27-Nov-18 09:17 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm not near pc now so don't have a link.

[27-Nov-18 09:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Not, a burn a d create.

[27-Nov-18 09:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
One chain sees its supply shrink whereas the other sees its grow?

[27-Nov-18 09:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes

[27-Nov-18 09:19 PM] zatJUM#9924
I see it better now, but what's the use of doing that?

[27-Nov-18 09:20 PM] CMaurice#1685
CCid 102

[27-Nov-18 09:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Most of the contracts have a very good explanation at the top of the `.cpp` in github.

[27-Nov-18 09:20 PM] CrisF#3405
OK, sorry!

[27-Nov-18 09:20 PM] CMaurice#1685
I assume someone can't just code up another chain and fungibilise coins straight out

[27-Nov-18 09:22 PM] CrisF#3405
I believe the 0br and the concensus among NNs is to help to prevent that.

[27-Nov-18 09:23 PM] CrisF#3405
@zatJUM This will be very useful for us to move coins to another chain for testing.

[27-Nov-18 09:24 PM] zatJUM#9924
OK thanks it's clearer üòÉ

[27-Nov-18 09:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Some one will have some better info and links soon I'm sure.

[27-Nov-18 09:25 PM] CrisF#3405
The info on '. cpp' is very good.

[27-Nov-18 09:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'll check that later on, but other good examples of use would be nice üòâ

[27-Nov-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"fungibilise" ü§£

[27-Nov-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if the total supply of coins across a cluster of chains is held constant, then we know new coins arent being created that shouldnt be

[27-Nov-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems to have a significant value

[27-Nov-18 09:38 PM] CrisF#3405
It seems to be key for unlocking the power of the cluster.

[27-Nov-18 09:50 PM] CMaurice#1685
We are... the fungibilisers

[27-Nov-18 10:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @zatJUM , sorry I made a mistake about finding info in  .cpp for migration.  Migratration is pre-cc.
I reccomend  . cpp for info on other contracts.

[27-Nov-18 10:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Definitely coffee time üò¥

[28-Nov-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel invalid coin import is expected, if the import has failed... But that's very much not good, this issue was fixed :( and some how is back here. What is the output in stdout on the import chain? Or can you send me the raw log file for the failed migrate.

[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This in my number one priority now to try and find out what's gone wrong here, hopefully its something simple.

[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like a merge the stuffed up, I thought I checked it though.

[28-Nov-18 12:42 AM] Hermes#6934
so this tests are every week?

[28-Nov-18 12:53 AM] Hermes#6934
will try to catch up with these dragons üòâ

[28-Nov-18 12:54 AM] Alright#0419
@Hermes it's just on going

{Reactions}
üëå 

[28-Nov-18 01:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
@Alright is there an active chain for the current STAKED coins we have been migrating? I never consolidated so mine are in 64 addresses still

[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TSAKED4 was aridropped to LAMEDUCKS

[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as a test

[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are not real coins

[28-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it for people to test with, make sure they ahve coins etc

[28-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with that faile migrate repoerted ..  we ahve a seriousl problem unfirtunatlky

[28-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until I know exactly why this opccured we cant do anyhting

[28-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¶

[28-Nov-18 02:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Fek!

[28-Nov-18 03:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
K so the STAKED4 snap is the same that will be dropped when live chain happens. That is what LAMEDUCKS did to provide test coins.

[28-Nov-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of.... we tested a whole bunch of stuff at once with Ducks

[28-Nov-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a special mining mode where 10% fo the blcok reward mines to a multi sig address for making payments for notarisations

[28-Nov-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the airdrop was tested

[28-Nov-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and we used it to select who could be a main net notary.

[28-Nov-18 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however... somwhere along the line MoMoM has broken again... it wasworking perfectly in the last stress test WITHOUT the CC mempool fix, and this is the only thing I can think of that is causing it ... so I might revisit that, and see if I can exempt notarisitions from it, like z-tx are exempt.

[28-Nov-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a way to esily check if a tx is a CC transaction., but in this case I dont think that will work, as a CC tx could depend on a normal tx, so I will need to use the code from the miner, that I made that gives notarisations top priotity, to detect notarisations and have them not be removed from the mempool. üò¶ all starting to get very complicated tbh.... it should not ahve to work like this.

[28-Nov-18 03:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
CC mepool fix script please - i can trace

[28-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not a script

[28-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its inside the connect blcok in komodo

[28-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very ahrd to explain.... I will deal with it... I need bar fish to supply me with the failed migrate

[28-Nov-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before I mess with anything

[28-Nov-18 03:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Let my try to reproduce in the morning. .give me the params. .....B.E.D.

[28-Nov-18 07:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Mylo , do you have a NN running now?

[28-Nov-18 07:55 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Hi, for some reason I'm seeing `mylo` in the checkmasks.

[28-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
script is wrong... keeop saying this

[28-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
return garbled info

[28-Nov-18 07:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, Thanks.

[28-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also I think I foudn ther issue witrh minign nodes lcokign up

[28-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also seems related tyo the chain not syncing problem

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, mine just did it on `DUCKS` again.  Not as bad.

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mempool fix was indeed not great... I asked for it to be tersted a heaps fo times, but james just added it to the main FSM branch and a heap of stuff got merged on top of it

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am tessting a fix now

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Great.

[28-Nov-18 07:57 AM] CrisF#3405
This time ^c could get prompt.

[28-Nov-18 07:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Couldn't stop though, or RPC.

[28-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah they are hard lcoking
