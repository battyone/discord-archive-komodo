Where are you seeing `021914947402d936a89fbdd1b12be49eb894a1568e5e17bb18c8a6cffbd3dc106e`?

[12-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Alright#0419
idk someone registered with it

[12-Oct-18 12:14 PM] Alright#0419

[12-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
the jsons that outputs are still wonky

[12-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
just ignore how it duplicates a bunch of them

[12-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
do `ps aux | grep STAKEDB1`

[12-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
should show the pubkey you have set

[12-Oct-18 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
just gave it a couple utxos

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmmm, I'm not running the chain with that pubkey.  Maybe that .

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§¶

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
try it now

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
you are running the chain with that pubkey

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to use -pubkey of the pubkey you use

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, It sent

[12-Oct-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is why I made config.ini

[12-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so user cannot make this mistake

üòÉ 

[12-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think though, that I need to see if we can set pubkey with RPC call that would be optimal

[12-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then cna start daemon ....

[12-Oct-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make address

[12-Oct-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then set pubkey ü§î

[12-Oct-18 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
It's working with that key.  I'm on with Alright.

[12-Oct-18 12:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Might be out of UTXos?

[12-Oct-18 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
are you on this chain?

[12-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
oh it'll work now

[12-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
just needed the kvupdate to confirm

[12-Oct-18 12:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Sry, how to check?

[12-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
just type a message

[12-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
it'll work I think

[12-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
yes works

[12-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
if you wanted to check if you were on that chain btw, you'd look at the debug with `tail -f ~/.komodo/STAKEDB1/debug.log`

[12-Oct-18 12:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!

[12-Oct-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419

I'll be there soon just starting chain for first time ... B1 is pretyy big lol

[12-Oct-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
it's a 100% viable chat room

[12-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
works so fucking well, you forget you're talking on a blockchain

[12-Oct-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your talking on a mempool :trollface:

[12-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
yerp

[12-Oct-18 12:34 PM] CrisF#3405
That is very cool.

[12-Oct-18 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Instant.

[12-Oct-18 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
I still have memories of a 48 BTC confirmation wait.  Thats what I think of when blockchain.

[12-Oct-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now what if ... the oracles subscribe was combined with channels CC so that each msg to the mempool was sucured by dpow?

[12-Oct-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î

[12-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
no idea what you mean

[12-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
I saw some mention about mempool being secured by dpow, but I didn't know what it was in reference to

[12-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
what does that have to do with channels?

[12-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
really want to try to link this channel with an oracle channel with a discord bot

[12-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
I'd actually use this instead of discord

[12-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont work

[12-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the payment is secured by dPoW as soon as it enters the mempool but not the tx as all its vins can be double spent

[12-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so the message wont be able to be preserved

{Reactions}
üò¶ 

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but after a notarization, it can be used as a secured medium

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
are there any blockchains that have onchain chat rooms?

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
I wonder if a CHAT chain would be popular

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
think this may be another world's first for KMD

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is another world first

[12-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe do it like PIRATE and see what happens

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
Think we're just going to have STAKEDTROLL and make the coins worthless

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
don't think it should cost money to chat

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
you can use it on any chain with oracles

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
so CHAT wouldn't be that special

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well CHAT doesnt have any moetary value.. which was kind of my point yesterady and why I spent so long making a chain where the coins are mined by anyone independant of the BR .

[12-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think anything thats free is popular no ?

[12-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you need to burn some staked to get your pubkey ?

[12-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that is the only thing I can think of

[12-Oct-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like an entry fee

[12-Oct-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oh `jq: error (at <stdin>:2): Cannot iterate over null (null)` 
found bug in chatreceive

[12-Oct-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you are not synced to wher ethe oracle was made it gets angry

[12-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
not so great at error exceptions üòÖ

[12-Oct-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... I have spent the last week getting very good at them .

@CrisF  and @CMaurice  and @kmdkrazy  have made me think of these things along the way

[12-Oct-18 12:50 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright can I post  screenshot?

[12-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
was that not enough lol

[12-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
go ahead?

[12-Oct-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have an idea.. get it working and make it so that it wont work if the user made a mistake and tells them why, if possible

[12-Oct-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean we can guide people though it and teach them, but what if 1000 people want to chat ?

[12-Oct-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the errors they make need to explain them selves so they can learn without instructions

[12-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
can probably merge both scripts into one

[12-Oct-18 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can yes
