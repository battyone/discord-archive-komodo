not gonna help you on same utxos

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Sols are going to go up now!!

[29-Nov-19 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
and 1 more time for good measure...

[29-Nov-19 03:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
split my  funds in half?

[29-Nov-19 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
staking on a NON POST FORK ninary is unadvised unless we have confirmation that branch can handle it

[29-Nov-19 03:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I own 50k worth of LABS and I think CG is having breakfast on the trade

[29-Nov-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao

how does he lowlight and italisize

[29-Nov-19 03:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so use it only to mess with the utxos and do not use it to mine?

[29-Nov-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats what I was going to be testing more

[29-Nov-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
Used it before HF

[29-Nov-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
worked fine and works for all other assets

[29-Nov-19 03:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
got it --- --

[29-Nov-19 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
fwiw
`listunspent|jq -cr '.|[map(select(.))]|.[]|.[]|{amount,account,address,confirmations}'`
non-GUI "coin selection" list  in "list mode"(without the checkboxes and date, obviously)

[29-Nov-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
can use `"recieved with label":.account` in place of `account` if you want "fancy"

[29-Nov-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if you're really bored:
`listunspent|jq -cr '.|[map(select(.))]|.[]|sort_by(.account)[]|{amount,"recieved with label":.account,address,confirmations}'`

[29-Nov-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"close to"the "tree mode"

[29-Nov-19 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill test these out and play... ty CG

[29-Nov-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
for utility, you'd want to add txid in there too üòõ

[29-Nov-19 03:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
MOAR

[29-Nov-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but, anyway, if you can do it in GUI, you can do it cli/script üòõ

[29-Nov-19 05:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
"(we want large and old utxos to maximise staking rewards.)"

[29-Nov-19 05:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how large?

[29-Nov-19 05:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
UTXO size = 15000 * Difficulty * ((1/Efficiency) ‚Äì 1)

[29-Nov-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
You ask GREAT questions

[29-Nov-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
I JUST did this math so maybe you can validate me a bit...

[29-Nov-19 05:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
1440 block sper day avg

[29-Nov-19 05:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
so 51% POS is ~734 blocks per day to staking

[29-Nov-19 05:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
YOURCOINTOTAL/TOTALCOINSUPPLY = the TOP % you should earn each day with optimal utxo distribution

[29-Nov-19 05:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
YOUR%STAKES * 734 = YOURSTAKEPOTENTIALINBLOCKS

[29-Nov-19 05:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
per day

[29-Nov-19 05:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
IF that amount is the TOP amount of blocks your coin supply has potential to earn...

[29-Nov-19 05:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Then you want to extrapolate that to a UTXO size and total count per segid

[29-Nov-19 05:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
so if your math says you could only expect 10 blocks per day...

[29-Nov-19 05:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
You only need 10 valid utxos to stake to meet that

[29-Nov-19 05:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
That is totally up to you to research how everyone else is distributed so you can pick the segids to place and how many utxos in each

[29-Nov-19 05:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
also... not sure how difficulty plays into stakes...

[29-Nov-19 05:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
2% of total supply =  14  blocks  per day

[29-Nov-19 05:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
def affects PoW blocks

[29-Nov-19 05:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
that sounds right

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
then  I  am doing  fine

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
+ potential for extra if ppl arent staking or have bad distibution

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
The math is if every coin is in play

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`how large?`
large enough to carry more weight than anyone else currently staking

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
^^

[29-Nov-19 05:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
per segid

[29-Nov-19 05:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
half  supply being  staked  =  28 blocks

[29-Nov-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there is no "magic number" because it can change at any given time depending on what else is staking at that time

[29-Nov-19 05:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
you could look at it that way

[29-Nov-19 05:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
if half coins arent staking your share would double in theory

[29-Nov-19 05:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
all things being equal

[29-Nov-19 05:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and large enough  should be say  50  UTXOs  each  addie spread out  if owned 50000 coins

[29-Nov-19 05:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
no one knows for sure

[29-Nov-19 05:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
I sub to the lite model... less than a dozen utxos in any segid

[29-Nov-19 05:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok -- Ill  start counting better and optimizing

[29-Nov-19 05:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Jok3r and others play the AS MANY UTXOS AS POSSIBLE game last I recall them stating here

[29-Nov-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`2% of total supply = 14 blocks per day`
based on whatever is staking
with 100% staking, I'm sure it would be less
and it could be more or less depending on UTXO management

[29-Nov-19 05:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so going back to UTXO managment --- Shit - got to take my kid to  the  mall ...

[29-Nov-19 05:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
a.nd just in case you havent seen it... it doesnt take long for rando 8 LABS utxos from a stake to begin staking themselves

[29-Nov-19 05:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
That should speak volumes when i see myself daily staking from 8 LABS utxos

[29-Nov-19 05:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
management system is already  running in TUIstaker.py

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`management system is already running in TUIstaker.py`
that is **a** system, not "the system" because there are many

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill come back and ask  more "dumb"  questions

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
love it

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i need a better system

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
be right back

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
mall down  the street

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have less than 1% supply...  stake more than my fair share

[29-Nov-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`ill come back and ask more "dumb" questions`
ill come back and give more "dumb" answers :troll_lol:

I'm told that "there are no stupid questions", not sure if it's true or not, but I know I've misread a lot of things and given a lot of stupid answers

[29-Nov-19 05:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
You gotta finish that quote for it to be valid...

[29-Nov-19 05:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
"There are no stupid questions... just stupid people."

[29-Nov-19 07:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok - woah

[29-Nov-19 07:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Lol

[29-Nov-19 07:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ooops  what  does  consolidate.sh  do again?  I know it moved  9500  coins into my main  address -  damn it! are my  other UTXOs  consolidated into each  of my  other 63 addresses?

[29-Nov-19 07:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so  now  I  have 65  ish UTXOs?

[29-Nov-19 07:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like it only  moved my extra large UTXOs over

[29-Nov-19 07:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
now  - that  is the script I really need - sendmany  from main  address only

[29-Nov-19 07:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Looks like KOcean wont sync LABS even this release from today.

[29-Nov-19 07:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  think I saw part of the command last night

[29-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Oszy#5734
use z_sendmany it's what i use when i top up staking addresses

[29-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Oszy#5734
little bit of editing, quite long command but works

[29-Nov-19 07:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes the regular sendmany... I used it when we started the first contest on STAKED chain... it stopped working for me in later branches and still does not do what I want when i try to use it...

[29-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Oszy#5734
create a .sh
```#!/bin/bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS z_sendmany "ADDRESS FROM " '[
{"address":"TO ADDRESS1","amount": 100},
{"address":" TO ADDRESS2","amount": 100}
...
{"address":"TO ADDRESS64","amount": 100]'
```

üëç 

[29-Nov-19 07:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
but... my issue seems to stem from importing and account naming issues at times... the script defaults to use the "" unamed account and it gets messed up sometimes with importing

[29-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Oszy#5734
thats why z not regular

[29-Nov-19 07:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
What Oszy pasted would work so much better

[29-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Oszy#5734
if you know py + json you can use list.json to populate the addresses but i was too lazy to write that

[29-Nov-19 07:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think  my wallet  is  jacked  up again  lol

[29-Nov-19 07:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
that method is in the other .py scripts though so can be cut and pasted to your needs

[29-Nov-19 07:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
the TUI uses the list.json

[29-Nov-19 07:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
all addresses have zewo balance

[29-Nov-19 07:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
except 1

[29-Nov-19 07:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and the explorer says different

[29-Nov-19 07:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
"RVsqc6bkCEju9XVNcBG1xjo69zvKFgVENn",
      50265.95045032,

[29-Nov-19 07:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
im  too dumb for  this  shit
