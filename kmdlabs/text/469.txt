Those having issues building, delete komodo folder and supernet folder from home directory and run the install scripts again.

[21-Aug-19 05:56 PM] CMaurice#1685
ok, did that, re ./start.sh'd but..

about ``bitcoind_RPC: GIN post_process_bitcoind_RPC (dpowlistunspent) error.`` I am guilty, I will dig why and fix my shit.

[21-Aug-19 09:03 PM] phm87#7395
but it should work for KMD so either my iguana change is wrong and I need to learn because I didn't expect error from KMD ``KMD post_process_bitcoind_RPC (dpowlistunspent) error.{"result":null,"error":{"code":-1,"message":"JSON value is not a string as expected"},"id":"jl777"}``

https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/blob/blackjok3r/iguana/dpow/dpow_rpc.c#L1034
As there is only one utxo, it will break the loop and exit here, I'll adapt somehow

Ok, The blackjok3r iguana is working extremly well for the nodes that are actually working. 
It seems that webworkers node is catching up since he sorted the ports out. 
There is a node  submitting sprnt utxos, so I am goign to write the gettxout detection shortly. Dont update anything until I ping here. 
@CMaurice  @Bar_F1sh_Rel  
I would liek to get remote access to your nodes if possible, as they both seem to be stuck on the same recvmask, which is diffrent to the rest of the nodes for some reason. Really need to work out what the problem is.. The distribution will only work as intended if yuor node is actually in the agreed recvmask, so need to work out what can cause this not to be the case and find fixes for it.

External ssh is locked down atm. Be about 12h before I am at a machine with privelidges to open it up.

[22-Aug-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats cool man. Let me know when free and if I still need to do it, will do then. Got plenty of stuff to sort in the mean time.

[22-Aug-19 08:03 AM] CrisF#3405
I seem to have gotten my MYLO notarizing finally. No Labs brfore had to head out.
Needed to `pkill - 9 komodod` and start manually.
Re installed SuperNet and komodo.

[22-Aug-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think most of the problems are going to be the repos being messed up. A fresh clone should sort it. I think I broke something along the way with a force push.. I did the same on the AWS testnet 2 times, and had to reclone supernet on all 50 nodes lol

[22-Aug-19 10:43 AM] phm87#7395
About my tests of dpowlistunspent of btcand kmd on mainet, I have good perfs on my 3P notas but no block mined since yesterday (I am using kmdlabs/komodo). I tried to setgenerate true 1 but still no blocks. I will mkne on another node with beta kmd branch

[22-Aug-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to set -notary to mine

[22-Aug-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I would not use LABS komodo on a main net notary, its not enything near equal with jls repo atm

[22-Aug-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Did you add a reset for the cache when a non noatization tx is made?

[22-Aug-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I gave you example code for that, needs to go in wallet.cpp in committransaction

[22-Aug-19 11:35 AM] phm87#7395
I did not change anything in kmdlabs komodo. Notas on 3P are high. I will have a look at reset tonight. Maybe I rushed a bit

[22-Aug-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
reset is the most important thing...

[22-Aug-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because if any utxo in the cache are spent it doesnt know until after the notarization has comopleted and then it fails

[22-Aug-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I mean, DO NOT use KMDLABS./komodo on your main notary at all, it probably isnt the same as KMD right now..

[22-Aug-19 11:43 AM] phm87#7395
Ok sorry. I will change to correct kmd in 4 hours

[22-Aug-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. I cant be sure, but it just doenst seem like a good idea to me to do that

[22-Aug-19 12:11 PM] phm87#7395
Notarization works perfectly using kmdlabs/komodo on main NN but no block mined ... on the second node I was able to mine a block (using another kmd branch repo). Huge 3Pnota rate.  Thank you for your help

[22-Aug-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries... BUt we should not be using these mods to increase nota counts for just a handful of nodes... Need to get it working safelky for everyone... 
I'm not sure why but my current utxo cache is returning spent utxo randomly on a few nodes... Maybe they are not updated to latest... I guess maybe its time to tell everyone to update ü§î

[22-Aug-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  @zatJUM  @SHossain  @gt 
Can you please tell me what commit you are on for KMDLabs/komodo/master
`cd ~/StakedNotary/komodo/master`
`cat lastbuildcommit`
It seems the spent utxo are only coming from your node and I'm not sure why.
If the build commit is `77505ef1c2f3405a0a87ea9f9175a17fd5bc3146`
Then please check the KMD debug.log and to a sendtoaddress to yourself (small amount not whole balance) and see if it prints the following in the log:
