still ugly as sin lol....

[27-Jan-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea was just to use KMD from a  main net ntoary to fund notarisations for LABS chains, if more people donate to it than that needs it would be like a dev fund of sorts. Exchange listings, website marketing etc...

[27-Jan-19 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r how much feken hash does one need to throw at LABST to get POS down below PoS 60% vs target 51% ?

[27-Jan-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If labs itself has value, KMD can jsut be purchesed with LABS and none of that needs to be done.

[27-Jan-19 03:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
fwiw, I'm happy to donate pool income to the Labs effort (minus hosting costs)

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Not sure if there a bug? 
my testing earlier was about 500 h/s To get it back to 51%...

[27-Jan-19 03:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is labst the main chain?

[27-Jan-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a test of it

[27-Jan-19 03:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, a 9900 can't do it 😛

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to make sure it will work

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Equihash NEEDS at least 1 GPU to hold the % at target

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is why I spent 2 weeks getting VerusHash to work...

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or PoS needs a higher diff target :troll:

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is there a planned launch date for the main chain

[27-Jan-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Feb 1st

[27-Jan-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with a 1 week ramp up fo blcok reward

[27-Jan-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0 -> 7.7 LABS per block over 10800 blocks

[27-Jan-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 If you like we can launch another chain, using the PoS difficulty algo ?

[27-Jan-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its disabled on equihash to keep it abckwards compatible... but we can add an exception just for LABS chain

[27-Jan-19 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it needs testing then launch it, beyond that it's just me hating on all dual systems favor PoS

[27-Jan-19 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really want to doi it today... I thaught that the PoS algo for equiahash was decided to be stable ages ago (I dissagree with this, it has issues) So just left equiahsh as is.

[27-Jan-19 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stable and fair are not synonyms 😛

[27-Jan-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.... Its just that the chain will mostlikely have enough hash on it though... I dont see LABS main chain as a chain ppl will only CPU mine... So rather than make it more compicated and introduce mroe possible bugs, I thaught we should just leave it.,

[27-Jan-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could take weeks to fully test a PoS difficulty adjustment that actually works properly...

[27-Jan-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Getting the diff to adjust the correct amount... May be quite difficult

[27-Jan-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there are a lot of stakers, and it lowers gtoo much everyone will be able to stake a block at the same time.

maybe it's just my PoW background, but I abhor the fact that PoS can hit 100% on a 20% target chain and it takes Warren Buffett money to move PoW 5% past the PoS target

[27-Jan-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree with you... Its stupid... but I'm not sure if there are concequences to changing it we havent thaught of...

[27-Jan-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is enough hash... then PoS does not get over its target

[27-Jan-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if you make ti take longer for PoS to get blocks, when the target is over.. the chain could stop dead if there is no hash.

[27-Jan-19 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I know the "why" of why james did it (to stop someone from doing just that, dumping a ton of rentals and running the chain before diff can recover)
I just keep hoping you come up with a better way 😛

maybe some day I'll lean C++ and attempt to implement the 3 point balance I envision

[27-Jan-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code is there for us to add this... Its a pretty easy change now to enable it...

[27-Jan-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just dont know enough about the complex math involved to make the adjustment the right amounts... It would take many chains of tests to get right I think

[27-Jan-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For verushash it took 3-4 goes at it... and OI still dont know if its right, becasuse I've only suie one staking node to test it.

[27-Jan-19 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so slap up a chain and we'll test it 😛

[27-Jan-19 04:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Is `ac_founders=1440` an asset param that will be used on the main chain?

[27-Jan-19 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I dont think we need to do that any more... As Alright moved the notary income to a new chain.... This makes it easier to change the MofN

[27-Jan-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just moved the exact amount of satoshies that  was paid to the fouinders address to a diffrent chain... provided the block times are averagfe 60s on both chains coin emission does not change.

[27-Jan-19 04:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Does ac_founders cause difficulties in any way?

[27-Jan-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly... as long as teh multisig signers never change.... but we cannot know that... And its highly likely it will need to change. The PAYME chain, is how notaries get paid LABS, so they are motivated to keep it working at all times... We thaught maybe to make ti notary minable only also... but I dont think this is really needed as it ahs no block reward, I cant see why anyonje else would bother to mine it.

[27-Jan-19 04:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Could `-ac_founders` be used to have the chain create it's own 'dev fund' (used for exchange listings, website, marketing etc...) rather than rely on individuals' donations (KMD NNs) and be self-supporting?

[27-Jan-19 04:22 AM] CrisF#3405
(notarizations being separate for the time being)

[27-Jan-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notary nodes use ac_founders on the PAYME chain... as long as LABS has value then they can sell that to buy KMD...

[27-Jan-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry

[27-Jan-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm not sure exactly

[27-Jan-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We arleady take a ~22% of the block reward for notary nodes... not sure we should take too much.

[27-Jan-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would hope that people who end up with quite a bit of LABS would do things like that out of their own pockets.

[27-Jan-19 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It's kind of in their best interests

[27-Jan-19 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And if notaries decide between them some of the notary funds need to be uised for something, they can simply take that from the muiltisig address

[27-Jan-19 04:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah,  I was thinking it might be nice to have the chain being as self-suficient as possible.  Donations would be needed at the start and appreciated in the future of course.  I'm not sure how to to create that, but maybe -ac_founders would be part of that...

[27-Jan-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can make ac_founders have some % to "dev fund"... As it is thats kind if what it is.... just an address owned by 15 people, what they decide to do with it is really up to them... It supposed to pay for notarisation costs, but it does not ahve to... If labs gets quite a bit of value, then there would be more there than they need to operate.

[27-Jan-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Depends if they deiced to keep the profits, between them or spend it to increase coin price.

[27-Jan-19 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It takes majority of signers... Or at least 50% , dont think the exact number was decided on yet.

[27-Jan-19 04:31 AM] CrisF#3405
(atm, I have smk762's suggestion of 66% as the signers required as the only alternative suggestion to 50% - that's for bounties)

[27-Jan-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We dont want it to come down to like say a small majority of the signers hold the others to randsom and refuse to sign unless they get more money... its a diffiuclt thing to solve...

[27-Jan-19 04:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it getting to complicated to keep dev fund on main chain, separate from bounties and notarizations, so chain can provide that for itself?  Notary pay and bounties on PAYME. Maybe eventually have Labs bounty funds (as opposed to non-Labs, private projects) supported by mainchain -ac_founders or something?

[27-Jan-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bounty fund would be a new chain again... The mechanisim fo ther bounty chain still needs to be made.. I was going to make that as the first chain we make on mainnet.

[27-Jan-19 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can take an addition founders reward from the main chain... IF we like... but who does it go to? If its a multisig address and someone wants to leave then the chain is broken, and requires complicated hard forks and exceptions in the code base to allow this.

[27-Jan-19 04:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Yean, sounds better to keep it as a separate module.

[27-Jan-19 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
By using seperate chains, we simply withdraw the staking weight off the chain when its not longer needed to be used and it stops... Create new chain. ONce the staking weight has been removed (or tis added to notarisation blacklist in code) then a new cahin with a new multiu sig address can be started.

[27-Jan-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a little comploicated but not as bad as having to hard fork the main chain all the time... The idea of the main chain is to that it can be on exchanges etc... they are not going to handle multiple hard forks.

[27-Jan-19 04:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you think a dev fund would be controversial?

[27-Jan-19 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure what we need it for

[27-Jan-19 04:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Was thinking mainly to, over time, reduce the reliance on needing a KMD NN.

[27-Jan-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If its something we need its not really an issue to add it... But I dont really think its required... All holders stake ... so they get "free money" anyway ... Its in their best intrests to do things to promote the coin etc... As long as notaries are making enough money to cover costs then everything is fine. Notaries can just sell some LABS to fund KMD needed... but having a KMD notary node just makes it easier.

[27-Jan-19 04:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Will a single multi-sig be used for everything? (NN payment, bounty approval, etc)?

[27-Jan-19 04:53 AM] CrisF#3405
(I'm adding all of this to the info Alright requested)

[27-Jan-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks. I think just one multi sig wil be needed.,.. maybe bounty would be less MofN required, dependig o0n what % of supply is allocated to bounties...

[27-Jan-19 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1-5% is what has been discussed... But does not nessarily get used... If claims are not made then the coins are not moved. I hope to be able to have some kind of reverse nLockTime.... so that the minned bounty funds expire after some amount of time.

[27-Jan-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just to avoid the situation where there could be no bounties for ages and the signers deciding to withdraw the balance for themselvs.

[27-Jan-19 05:06 AM] CrisF#3405
One thing I'm not clear on, is the 1-5% of supply for bounties offered by Labs for Labs projects(ie create a Labs visualization)?  While Project X would provide Labs with bounty funds for setting up an incentivized test and have notaries paying bounties?

[27-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The bounty funds are extra coins created that are not mined in the actaul block reward...

[27-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they sit in a multisig address, until someone makes a claim

[27-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the signers of the multisig agree the claim is valid then it is paid.

[27-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If no claims are made those coins never enter supply.

[27-Jan-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The exact mecahnisim of this is still to be created... Hopefully there is a nice simple solution.

[27-Jan-19 05:08 AM] CrisF#3405
And these claims could be made on any project?

[27-Jan-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes thats what the bounty mechnisim always was... Alright came up with it... I'm just trying to explain how I understand it to work.

[27-Jan-19 05:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, just trying to get a better understanding.  Then I can write it better hopefully 😃

[27-Jan-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... I was always a bit confused by it tbh.

[27-Jan-19 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think by having it be some extra chain with an exact block reward as  % of the total supply that expires, it prevents people poking holes in it saying we can create as many coins as we like.

[27-Jan-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, the extra chain, modular, system sounds very good.

[27-Jan-19 05:20 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm having a hard time getting a clear picture of the very basics of the bounties system though.
I could understand if Labs creates bounty funds for itself to uses for its own  project bounties.  With an outside project paying coins to Labs to set up and run a bounty program for them.
