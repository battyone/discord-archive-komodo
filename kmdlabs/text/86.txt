on my staked kmd.  stopped syncing at block 813610

[12-Nov-18 12:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I got something similar when I didn't have enough swap.

[12-Nov-18 12:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Haven't had that kind of trouble since using the bootstrap.

[12-Nov-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its a RAM issue ... I have had my staked KMD stop working a few times on the momom test VM ... but there is only 8GB ram there

[12-Nov-18 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would really like to know what it is ... as it could be somethign in my code ...

[12-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
hmmm ok this VPS only has 4GB RAM.  I might up it then.

[12-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks @CrisF @blackjok3r

[12-Nov-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181

there is no need to use more than 4GB on testnet

unless @Alright  has one somehwer I can try to sync ?

[12-Nov-18 01:04 PM] CrisF#3405
What is the `pay to CC chain`?

[12-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Mylo#8306
BR to CC?

[12-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes we can hopefully now mine a % of the block reward to a crypto condition contract

[12-Nov-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I can make custom miner that can create dynacmic block rewards baesd on CC contract

[12-Nov-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the pool now just takes the daemons coinbase tx and usues it isntead od making its own ... so yo ucan have anyhting in the coinabse you like

[12-Nov-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181

It seems like I am getting nothing on my trello board done .. but it seems to be better way f doing things to make low level things that allow more powerful ways to solve porblems rather than hack something dodgy together that just works as it will only cause greif later on.

I need to get the streamer into FSM before we add any more stuff in... its too ahrd to merge it .. as it is, I might have to remove the streamer stuff totally from staked, port it to FSM then merge it back down into staked just to make it not have a million conflicts.

[12-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although staked works with KMD, we cna just merge the whole lot into KMD :trollface:

A decreasing supply ?

[12-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that would do it

[12-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe

[12-Nov-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I can make it randomly burn coins

[12-Nov-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what about a reverse rewards?

[12-Nov-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the utxo gets X% smaller in Y time

[12-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that way it doesnt just steal someones entire balance... they all go downa the same rate.

yeah been getting htat aswell

[12-Nov-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need to keep trying it

[12-Nov-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we should get a diffrent mirror for libsodium ?

[12-Nov-18 03:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm tried like a 5 times already still:
```Fetching libsodium...

[12-Nov-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the malformed is normal

[12-Nov-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but eh URL is broken ...

[12-Nov-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe just wait a while ... as far as I know its not a problem with staked, as I never changed anything

[12-Nov-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try a build form jl777/komodo and see if its the same ?

do a list unspent call

[12-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there could be a problem with the cleanwalletnotarisations RPC or you need to send the balance to youself

[12-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or its split, and stuck in mempool

is there an extra utxo in the wallet by any chance ? one that didnt go away when you sent balance to self?

[12-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I  kept aving an issue with the wallet cleaner RPC where it did that on KMD .. but didnt seem to do it on other chains

[12-Nov-18 03:37 PM] gt#2812
no i don‚Äôt believe so

[12-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
great

[12-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that the wallet cleaner does not like KMD rewards

[12-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
keep KMD utxo under 10 in size and it works fine ... if its like 100 it ends up with random spent utxo in listunspent

[12-Nov-18 03:38 PM] gt#2812
came up with [] when listunspent ran again

[12-Nov-18 03:38 PM] gt#2812

[12-Nov-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I might have been a little to agressive with the wallet cleaner on the newest verison, it seems to dro pthe occasional utxo... I relaly dont think it matters so much, a script that sends all utxo older than 2000 blocks before running it will stop that happening.

[12-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
effectivly if it works as intended, there is a rolling "working range" of ~2000 blocks that the notary wallet works in, everything before that is just discarded.

[12-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the funds always are in this range.

[12-Nov-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  when it hapened to me, I copied the tar.gz from another komodo folder.. maybe you can D/L from the mirror into the right folder, although the hash might fail

PR. for change to pool... its all in the stratum back end, pool didnt need any changes. I gave some comments in the PR, if you ca test this mode with payment processor, maybe on CFEK as that has a block reward... Need some way of taking a pool fee, but thats not super importantat this stage.

Alright suggested to have the pool spoof shares for itself as a way to take a fee.

[12-Nov-18 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my java script is terrible... honestly dont understand it at all .. if you get time... if not dont worry about it, we should launch with a zero fee pool anyway.

[12-Nov-18 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also maybe look at the staked repo I posted above .. it should nbe hte easiest way to start the chains on correct branch, although its just using git for assetchains.json still.
