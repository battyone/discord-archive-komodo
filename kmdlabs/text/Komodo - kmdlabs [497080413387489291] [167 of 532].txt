pulled and indexed almost 600 UTXOs and consolidated, signed and broadcast tx in 2.151s
I'm happy with that as a consolidator 😃 
still needs some error checking, but beats the hell out of the 1-2 minutes it *was* taking

I figured out hwo to stop the staking loop on shutdown so that it doesnt just crash

Once alright returns we will discuss how best to do it ... there were two people at the end, maybe its ok to let both in.

[19-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code is not in a final state as I am still finding bugs... It makes little sense to launch until they are fixed ... We dont want the exchanges to need to update too often

Hi, Does anyone happen to have the `CFEKLAMEDUCKS` params or know where I can find them?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   all the cool kids use silversearcher these days.  Bad grep skills just make you bleeding edge now

[20-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Hello, I was referred here by JL777 .  A new social movement in Mexico is willing to create the first Decentralized Political Party (right now its just a citizens organization) willing to implement the blockchain as main platform for all their activities. I am going to help them and this will be made in stages, so the first one will be to create a Social Network using Komodo Platform. I have heard that a chat has been created and James thinks we can improve it and convert it into a social platform, any comments or input on that? Also I would like to know if there are anyone who would be willing to collaborate with this project?  The second stage after the social network is the Voting System and later connect it with AI.

[20-Dec-18 05:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) , welcome 👋

[20-Dec-18 05:58 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Hi @CrisF thanks

[20-Dec-18 06:01 AM] CrisF#3405
That sounds like an amazing project!
I think that you'll be able to find people who would be interested in helping 😀 
We do have  a blockchain based chat called TROLLBOX.
You can find it here https://github.com/StakedChain/trollbox .
The developer of it is away at the moment but I think he would be very interested in your ideas on expanding it into a social app.
Some of the other should be able to tell you more about it in the meantime.

What sort of help are you looking for?

[20-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Basically development for creating a basic social platform and web/mobile app

[20-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
I am not a developer just a project manager.

[20-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Something like FB or Steem but basic and later we can add more features.

[20-Dec-18 06:46 AM] CrisF#3405
This would be a very good place to work on a project like that.  And KMD certainly has the tech for it.

[20-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  How would I fill a block with oracle transactions? Some of yours have about 500 and I think that I have validation time now fast enough that a full 4MB block should take less than 30s to process.

[20-Dec-18 08:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can remove the sleep, encryption and database calls

[20-Dec-18 08:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you'll need the getconf.py rpcs - https://github.com/smk762/Dragonhound/blob/master/getconf.py
and this script has a function that takes care of the rest - https://github.com/smk762/Dragonhound/blob/master/oraclesio.py

thanks man.

[20-Dec-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
found a few other oddities that I need to take care of first then will try that. I think might tdo it on some other chain, maybe even a new one...just incase it really bogs it down.

[20-Dec-18 09:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe a new chain that could test out params for the Dragonhound chain at the same time?

[20-Dec-18 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Did you have any params for a chain in mind @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[20-Dec-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not a bad idea... but I dont need to actually notarise it for this test

[20-Dec-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will just start 2 VMs and fill a few blocks then time how long it takes to process them on sync

cool... I have one last problem... on chain sync of cc chains, it sends all the txs in each processed block to every peer (even though theay cannot be accepted there)

this seems to slow it down or at least  max out uplaod bandwidth on chain sync

there was a fix added early in cc development I think, where on block dsownlaod it needs to add all the tx in the block to tme mempool, so that the cc tx that are confirmed out of order can be validated... but this had a shit laod of side effects

reading up on Verus sounded good, but not sure

[20-Dec-18 09:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will use a hybrid PoS/PoW

[20-Dec-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
verus PoS was much better, but that could have changed now pos64 is fixed.

[20-Dec-18 09:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
figure those using the service heavily could benefit from staking  to cover read/write costs

{Reactions}
🤔 

[20-Dec-18 09:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so its effectively free if you stake the right amount

[20-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
problem with verus is that your locked to 50/50

[20-Dec-18 09:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah the more I read the less I thought it would work overall

[20-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully pos64 is good for production chains now...

[20-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
