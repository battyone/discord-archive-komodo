`I have spetn the last almost 24H straight retesting and debugging and fixing somethign he said worked fine`
I've spent almost 2 years disagreeing with him about "works fine" üòõ

[27-Oct-19 10:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
or just random among entrants?

[27-Oct-19 10:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
seems like whomever has been a labs nn picked up quite a lot of stuff.. i want that 'cause i'm selfish like that

[27-Oct-19 10:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its b ased on a hash of the pubkey and data you submit against a BTC blockhash

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
so results are done

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
we just need to look them up

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
with the BTC hash

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know... @Alright  does all this

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you can read his code and do it dfrst üòÑ

[27-Oct-19 10:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
the DAPP has the instruction

[27-Oct-19 10:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
so first btc block after that timestamp?

[27-Oct-19 10:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
thanks @Oszy

[27-Oct-19 10:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
Use the first BTC block hash after the timestop of expiry, enter it into step 6 of DAPP

[27-Oct-19 10:47 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`maybe you can read his code and do it dfrst`

[27-Oct-19 10:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the rules were supposed to be../. only 2 added each 2 months... but we missed a bunch of months... so...

[27-Oct-19 10:51 PM] phm87#7395
```Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See debug log for details.
komodod: /home/wallets/sources/kmdlabs/depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/../include/boost/thread/pthread/mutex.hpp:111: boost::mutex::~mutex(): Assertion `!res' failed.``` I had komodo running on the same rpc port. I tried to launch LABS and I had this error. I changed the rpcport to sth different then I had no error. Error is not very clean but I know it is my fault

[27-Oct-19 10:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@phm87  have you tried to update to the latest?

[27-Oct-19 10:52 PM] phm87#7395
For LABS, I am using KMDLabs/komodo master branch, I compiled few minutes ago but for komodo I used jl777/komodo master

[27-Oct-19 10:53 PM] phm87#7395
Should I use sth else ?

[27-Oct-19 10:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
`What happened to dwy?` don't ask man

[27-Oct-19 10:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... no that is correct... Latest merges have some issues, I have fixed a few though in last 2 days

should I use a previous commit / tag / branch / sth ?

[27-Oct-19 10:54 PM] phm87#7395
anyway, I can use backups of the old code I used

[27-Oct-19 10:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no I doubt it will help... If you see dead locks or crashes on the latest I could use some help with backtrace's etc...

[27-Oct-19 10:55 PM] phm87#7395
can I use jl777/komodo master branch to run LABS ?

[27-Oct-19 10:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no you cant

[27-Oct-19 10:55 PM] phm87#7395
this is what I remembered

[27-Oct-19 10:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There isnt much diffrence, but there is some fixes we have that they do not yet...

[27-Oct-19 11:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
wait... is the VRSC AGAMA not using the master branch? It has LABS in it... I stake in it just fine... coins go back and forth between my NN and AGAMA no issues.

[27-Oct-19 11:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For just runnign a node it should work yes

[27-Oct-19 11:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no consensus things have been changed in quite some time...

[27-Oct-19 11:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
So RUN LABS yes... RUN LABS NN not gonna  happen

[27-Oct-19 11:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might do... try it if you like.... dont see the point though.

Do believe we had some proposed mechanism for weeding out sock puppets üòÖ would have to dig through discord history to find it

[27-Oct-19 11:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It relied on the selection process, and assumed there would alwyas be more people running than places...

[27-Oct-19 11:26 PM] Alright#0419
think it was meant to just be a notary vote

[27-Oct-19 11:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont recall there being a vote for anything except reverting the kick for notarizing less than 25%

I got into the crypto space through @daemonfox  in the spring of 2017.  I am not as tech savy as most of the community so I just read and try to learn. I will be more active as I continue to learn and have something to contribute. Thanks for the opportunity to operate a NN.
