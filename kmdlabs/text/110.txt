We are in quite different timezones so no trouble about that 游땎

[23-Nov-18 11:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
this is pointless... I've tried this several times now, with differing mixes of IPs and installs... it just doesn;t work

[23-Nov-18 11:04 PM] CMaurice#1685
CFEKING stops at the same place each time, it most likely a timing issue given that all others synced earlier

[23-Nov-18 11:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I'm not sure this is relevant or if it's what you mean about timing but there was something earlier on in STAKED about having the correct time set on the server.

[23-Nov-18 11:07 PM] CrisF#3405
Just a moment and I'll dig it up...

[23-Nov-18 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
```$ asset-cli CFEKING getpeerinfo | jq '.[].addr'
"94.130.56.65:31666"
"103.6.13.44:39312"
"94.23.1.95:54960"

```Please ensure that your system clock is synced via NTP. If you do not do this, your node may lag behind.
sudo apt-get install chrony
sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
then check timedatectl status for NTP synchronized: yes```

[23-Nov-18 11:11 PM] CMaurice#1685
done, CrisF, we'll see. Thanks ComputerGenie may try some later but several supposedly functioning IPs tried already, don't think that's the issue

[23-Nov-18 11:11 PM] CMaurice#1685
may drop in later, or not

[23-Nov-18 11:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Come back after some sleep, we can sort it out then.  游녨

[23-Nov-18 11:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Should be. Latest was 10am UTC, Sat.

[23-Nov-18 11:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
So, what's the min number of notarizations to get me the job? :trollface:

[23-Nov-18 11:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Think it's just 1.

Just need to be in the first 20 to notarize after the start of the new chain coming at 10am UTC Saturday.

[23-Nov-18 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then dafuq am I running now for?

[23-Nov-18 11:49 PM] CrisF#3405
These chains now are only the test, so won't get the job for you.

11 hrs of ssh traffic for nothing 游땴

[23-Nov-18 11:51 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, well, since you have the setup notarizing now it should just be a matter of ./stop.sh then ./start.sh at the right time.

[23-Nov-18 11:53 PM] CrisF#3405
I thought there was going to be a test of the STAKED4 airdrop on these chains.

`that denoted when a new day begins`
given that some of us are, literally, 12 hrs apart....

[23-Nov-18 11:56 PM] CrisF#3405
I saw some people mention that they would cron ./start.sh.

[24-Nov-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if the node is running

[24-Nov-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And notarising cfek chains

[24-Nov-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then you can crown start.sh

[24-Nov-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And it will add the new chain automatically

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does anyone know how long until chain launch?

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still no idea when it meant to be

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405
haha, I was hoping you could confirm!

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cron

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nor crown

[24-Nov-18 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Last I heard was 10am UTC Saturday

[24-Nov-18 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's right I thibk

[24-Nov-18 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright is the only person who k ows how to do it

[24-Nov-18 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I'm getting g yelled at to get up and go tot he city again

[24-Nov-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I think I'm not going to go, there's bulk free beer there, but really not feeling like doi g that lol

[24-Nov-18 12:37 AM] CrisF#3405
CMaurice was still having trouble syncing before he headed out.  Do you think a bootstrap of CFEKING would help him?

[24-Nov-18 12:38 AM] CrisF#3405
He said `CFEKING stops at the same place each time`

[24-Nov-18 12:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Mine is synced so was thinking to get him a copy somehow.

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would really like to be able to reproduce his problem

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As it clearly a massive issue

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Poor guy

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's a long time to battle with the same thing happeneing

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, frustrating af.

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And most of the reason I'm staying home

[24-Nov-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are problems

[24-Nov-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although being cfeking only might mean we can just dispose of that Fe:king chain 游땍

[24-Nov-18 12:41 AM] CrisF#3405
He mentioned something about timing so he tried ```Please ensure that your system clock is synced via NTP. If you do not do this, your node may lag behind.
sudo apt-get install chrony
sudo systemctl restart chrony.service
then check timedatectl status for NTP synchronized: yes``` before heading out.  Wonder if that will work.

[24-Nov-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
K owing why seems important though

[24-Nov-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure that the clock, will do it

[24-Nov-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will affect his staked.json

[24-Nov-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which uses local time to determine era

[24-Nov-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But that's a different this g

[24-Nov-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will spend today setting up my PC here and getting VMS working again, so will try and reproduce there

[24-Nov-18 12:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, resyncing with `connect`worked for others.  But not him.

[24-Nov-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I saw that James pushed something to FSM that had to do with a sync bug, not sure if that was just sapling related will investigate that

[24-Nov-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really don't want versus merge in here any time soon, it will just delay us more

[24-Nov-18 12:46 AM] CrisF#3405
That time thing above was from STAKED3.

[24-Nov-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah staking chains do constantly tomewarp attach

[24-Nov-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But that shouldn't affect syncing only stakong

[24-Nov-18 12:49 AM] CrisF#3405
`why would [CFEKING] stop at block 29170 again, 3rd time`

[24-Nov-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The block has always been the exact same one?

[24-Nov-18 01:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I don't know.  He got up to `[CFEKING] 97.000% 29160 of 30042` when he did `connect` to my IP.

[24-Nov-18 01:14 AM] CrisF#3405
I was wondering if a bootstrap might get him past that and notarizing.  Doesn't help with finding the cause though.

[24-Nov-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bootstrap will "fix" it

[24-Nov-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the chains should be syncing

[24-Nov-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is an issue there

[24-Nov-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try and get a chain stuck and mess with it

[24-Nov-18 01:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Could this be in anyway similar to the issue others had getting stuck around the same place when syncing KMD?

[24-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kmd was due to am extra sat in the block reward.. That has been fixed now

[24-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although that's not to say some o e mine a.block with an extra sat on cfeking

[24-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't k ow why they would have bothered, and the error message o saw was not related to that

[24-Nov-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was getting similar thing on kmd trying to sync few days ago too

[24-Nov-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Similar to cfeking thatbis

[24-Nov-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its some edge case, not sure if its staked related only or problem from upstream kmd

[24-Nov-18 01:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, so it was an intentional extra sat on KMD.

[24-Nov-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There was a +1 to the block reward check in kmd alright asked me to remove that, but I did it wrong

[24-Nov-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In doing so we worked out what chains had blocks mined using an extra sat

[24-Nov-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And an exception was added to all kmd branches  that disabled it, for all chains that hadnd had it happen to them

[24-Nov-18 01:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Well, I'll attempt a bootstrap for CMaurice so hopefully he can get things running when he's back.

[24-Nov-18 01:25 AM] CrisF#3405
From what I gather the bootstrap would be a tar.gz for CFEKING `blocks` and `chainstate`.  Does that sound right?

[24-Nov-18 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think u need the whole dir but not your wallet.DAT or Conf file

[24-Nov-18 01:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I'll do that.

[24-Nov-18 01:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Well, I made the bootstrap.  Ended up just putting blocks and chainstate in.

[24-Nov-18 01:55 AM] CrisF#3405
It's just over 117mb.

[24-Nov-18 02:11 AM] CrisF#3405
@CMaurice Hi, I've made a CFEKING bootstrap that may help.  How can I get it to you?

[24-Nov-18 04:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
shit. too late to change pubkey?

[24-Nov-18 04:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Think so.

[24-Nov-18 04:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
validateaddress is giving me different to what I had saved

[24-Nov-18 04:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Owww...
@blackjok3r might be around, he was earlier.

[24-Nov-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am here yes

[24-Nov-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you havent notarised at ALL since era change

[24-Nov-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ai can change it

[24-Nov-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you cant notarise until everyone updates I dont think

[24-Nov-18 04:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah dont think I;ve notarised.
