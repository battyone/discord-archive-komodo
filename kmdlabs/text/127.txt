@webworker01 Do you know how I can get notarization details apart from stats? Also, ones after a wallet cleaning?  Alright was using some how using explorer lastnight.

[25-Nov-18 04:15 AM] Nabob#5004
You have explorer link, we can find the tx id

[25-Nov-18 04:15 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
explorer is almost done from what I hear

[25-Nov-18 04:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
shituations stopped it from comming to fruition

[25-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Nabob#5004
okie

[25-Nov-18 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt Yes, cleaning the wallet should split the utxos. @Mylo

[25-Nov-18 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405
No sure if Mylo can do that from the bus.

[25-Nov-18 04:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[25-Nov-18 04:23 AM] CrisF#3405
You need to notarize CFEKLAMEDUCKS, @daemonfox .

[25-Nov-18 04:23 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[25-Nov-18 04:24 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[25-Nov-18 04:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
i just wanted to know in the command window output, where does it spit out the txid

[25-Nov-18 04:24 AM] CrisF#3405
If all is set up you'll have to wait.

[25-Nov-18 04:24 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and ./utxosplitter.sh

[25-Nov-18 04:24 AM] CrisF#3405
std shows the info.  You can also used the explorer `http://140.82.3.117:3002/` and check for your address sending to the address webworker01 gave `RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA` , @daemonfox

[25-Nov-18 04:37 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo  do cleanwallettransactions like greentea suggested.  walletreset.sh <COIN> for acs.

[25-Nov-18 04:38 AM] Mylo#8306

[25-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Mylo#8306
./utxosplitter.sh

[25-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thx

[25-Nov-18 04:39 AM] CrisF#3405
cleanwallettransactions is for KMD

[25-Nov-18 04:42 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo Sorry, I was wrong there.
```New HARD walletreset done.
./walletreset.sh <coin>
Will send all utxo to self, wait confirm, then remove all txs that are not that tx from wallet. if you ahev lots of dust, this is the one to use. 
To do a soft reset:
komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions
works for all chains on master branch of StakedChain/komodo```

[25-Nov-18 04:46 AM] Mylo#8306
Oh this is one of blackjok3rs new cli commands, nice.

[25-Nov-18 04:46 AM] CrisF#3405
