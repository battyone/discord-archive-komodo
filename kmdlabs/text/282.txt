it wont pay the notaries... and their pay is lost due to the oirphaned block

[08-Feb-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the ndoes who see the orphan, then see this non payment block as valid... and ndoes who dont, see it as invlaid. Which is generally on a resync, or a badlyt connected node

either way it needs to be rectified, so that if a notarisation being included is the exact same as the previous checkpoint, it uses the checkpoint previous to that one, to create the coinbase... its just HOW to do this that is the hard part.

[08-Feb-19 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know you've explained it to me 3 times already, but I still think the "how to fix it" lies in the "why it happens"
If my node has any level of checks that when later applied by my node to a block my node created result in my node deciding that my block isn't valid, then it should be expected that someone else's node will find it invalid.
And that's the last I'll write before I actually read what you wrote 😛

```The checkpoint cant be undone incase of a reorg, for obvious reasons. The tx/block the notarizion is in, can be reorged until the next notarisation happens```
(bearing in mind I just got up and not thinking 100% yet)These seem to be contradictory. 
assuming the tx is in block 100:
Is the "checkpoint" *for* block 100 or some previous block?

[08-Feb-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notarized height is usually 2-3 block before the block that pays the notaries

[08-Feb-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once it gets confirmed once... the checkpoint is created

[08-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this condition seems quite rare ... but if we dont fix it... our chain will constantly fork, and wont be able to sync after some time.

[08-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm pretty sure I understand whats heappening enough to be able to fix it... but the data I need uisnt readily avalible ... ie there is no `komodo_previousnotarisedht` function I think if I can make that, then its pretty simple... 
` if notarizedhash == previous_notarisedhash` 
 `then notrisezheight = previous_notarisedheight`
`else notarisedheight = current_notarisedheight`

[08-Feb-19 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( fJustCheck && matched != 0 && *notarizedheightp == sp->NOTARIZED_HEIGHT && sp->NOTARIZED_DESTTXID == desttxid && sp->NOTARIZED_HASH == srchash)
                    return(-2);```
```
notarizedht = komodo_notarized_height(&prevMoMheight,&notarizedhash,&txid,&prevnotarizedht);
if ( height == notarizedht )
    {
        notarizedht = prevnotarizedht;
        fprintf(stderr, "using the current checkpoint, calculating based on previous notarized height!\n");
    }```

[08-Feb-19 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is it....

[08-Feb-19 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it compiles 😄

[08-Feb-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it compiles`
That's always a bonus 🙂

[08-Feb-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just added previous notarised height to the state sctructure

[08-Feb-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when it updates, it sets the current as previous

[08-Feb-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems too easy but I think it will work... the only way to find out is to make another chain and wait until the condition happens again

[08-Feb-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and wait until the condition happens again`
could be waiting 15 seconds or until never 😕

[08-Feb-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it took 2000 blocks to happen on ST2

[08-Feb-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the other thing we can try is to just keep force reorging between notarizations .. not sure how hard that would be @Alright

[08-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I can jsut run this validation on LABST2 and when my node forks... we know it works 🤷

[08-Feb-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This validation is backwards compatible... my node should reject the block if the condition happens again. Will leave it staking here and wait I guess.

[08-Feb-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly, with things that are anomalous like this, wait and see is all you can do ☹

[08-Feb-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r did you push potential fix on master branch or test?
5 moofed again, so I figure now's as good a time as any for me to try it too

[08-Feb-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Umm no I didn't

[08-Feb-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can push it I guess as long as notaries font update... If we are all on it and it works its hard to know it works or not...

[08-Feb-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL told you I needed more ☕ I thought you said you pushed it already 😛

[08-Feb-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No I just started my node mining with it, so that if the condition happens my node will fork and stop, saves me sitting watching it constantly

[08-Feb-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be banned by all peers and just stop mining 🤞

[08-Feb-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r are you running that on 2?

[08-Feb-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

dis clearbanned. didn't help
should I delete blockchain data and start again?

[08-Feb-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can try, doing that worked for me earlier, but now am stuck on the 2127/2128 block issue noted earlier

[08-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can do reorgs over and over if you want

[08-Feb-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
St2 doesn't sync

[08-Feb-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have fix if it works

[08-Feb-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Be home soon

[08-Feb-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well it still won't sync

[08-Feb-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But it should prevent this happening again

[08-Feb-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright that helps... Let's do it

[08-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
what chain?

[08-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
how often?

[08-Feb-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we need a new one

[08-Feb-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless 5 can still sync

[08-Feb-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean easy.. Push fix... Start new chain then reorg it over and over

[08-Feb-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
99% sure the fix will work

[08-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
just reorg a single block over and over?

[08-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
like

[08-Feb-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
wait for 1 public block, broadcast 2 stealth mined blocks?

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When a notarization is confirmed once

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
repeat?

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U need to reorg it back out of the chain

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And see if the next block still pays notaries

[08-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
ok what's the easiest way to check if it's a notarization?

[08-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
just going to poll all txs in blocks as they come in and invalidate it if there's a notarization in it

[08-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
equihash chain will make this much easier

[08-Feb-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Equihash pos64 will do it on its own given enough time

[08-Feb-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But we can test it faster if we can force it

[08-Feb-19 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
100% pow equihash chain is easiest

[08-Feb-19 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
can we do that

[08-Feb-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool.. I'll head home soon, wife n kids put all night my mate just left... Then another rocked up lolz.. Be he reokons been at party and is sleeping haha

never seen that before

[08-Feb-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive got 2905 as last block then crashed out

[08-Feb-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed to master

[08-Feb-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[08-Feb-19 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
going to take me a bit to write this reorg thing

[08-Feb-19 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
what kind of params should I use

[08-Feb-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ac_notarypay is just about all.

[08-Feb-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all wqe need to do is make notaries be paid

[08-Feb-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then reorg the notarisation out of the chain

[08-Feb-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the checkpoint will stick

[08-Feb-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the notarisation should now pay notaries even if its a reorg

[08-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Alright#0419
ok going to need a chain to even start testing it, so I'll get it going now

[08-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Alright#0419
`komodod -ac_name=LABSTRE -ac_supply=20000 -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_notarypay=100000 -ac_cc=667`

[08-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Alright#0419
look fine?

[08-Feb-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fine

[08-Feb-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tink it worked.. because after a restart I ahve notarized height as 2900 but blocks at 2831 and its refusing to accept any conections
