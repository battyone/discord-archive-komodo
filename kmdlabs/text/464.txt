There is code that would do that, for PIRATE... bvut you need to make it apply to what you are doing

Originally I was wondering if it would be possible to do something like the Lab vote.

[19-Aug-19 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
A way that it was known that the vote was made by a NN pub key, but not wich pubkey made it.

[19-Aug-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh not 100% sure what you guys are talking about lol but its not hard to prevent a vin from a zaddr to a taddr to be unspendable I think.

[19-Aug-19 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
That's why I called it `Zero-Knowledge Vote`

[19-Aug-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is as long as all of them have the exact same rule applied

[19-Aug-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you need to go back and look for some pattern, it becomes much harder

[19-Aug-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not impossible

[19-Aug-19 09:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Mylo , there was some talk of putting up some more chains in Labs to test the new iguana.
I remember you mentioning about doing something in Labs recently but I wasn't sure what your plan was.
Were you planning to put up some chains?

Correct me if im way off but... the DAPP used to do the ARRR sprout to sapling conversions... it did almost exactly what you are talking about for this vote thing just it had to be done due to ARRR not supporting t addresses. So, the process of voting you described seems to use some of the same steps... coin V is sent via z transaction to NN voters so thats obscured. DAPP can be adapted to perform w/e path of steps you want to vote...  but will limit any other functions other than sending to the vote addresses. Guarantees no one screws it up.

[19-Aug-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
and to follow that, NN ops should be required to vote at all times no? Continued missing votes could be another item added to the list a reasons to HF and remove NN pubkeys as new slots open up.

[19-Aug-19 03:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
a DAPP would make that simple for everyone to do each vote.

[19-Aug-19 04:13 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm not sure how the ARRR dapp works.  That would be very good if it could be adapted.

[19-Aug-19 04:14 PM] CrisF#3405
The vote that Alright made was good.

[19-Aug-19 04:16 PM] CrisF#3405
At the moment I'm particularly interested in a vote that is provably from a particular set (notaries in this case) but anonymous.

[20-Aug-19 02:56 AM] Mylo#8306
3 chain cluster.

[20-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Mylo#8306
For marketing.  Can reset every month to reduce storage needs

[20-Aug-19 03:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Anything specific wanted param-wise, or just basic test chains?

[20-Aug-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got a pretty decent idea we can use to test this new iguana, and also this cluster at the same time. Going to attemt to spagetti the bash spagettit some more, so that it can launch multiple iguanas with start.sh. 
Then  we can run LABS iguana `staked` branch alongside CFEK iguana in `blackjok3r` branch. And directly compare the counts.

[20-Aug-19 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181

🤔  Will we need to change the name from CFEK to something else, because its for marketking ❓

[20-Aug-19 07:55 AM] PHBA2061#2530
who came up with the CFEK prefix ? 😂

Massive update to StakedNotary 😄

[20-Aug-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can now run a diffrent iguana for every coin. I think we cna also use this to run 2 iguanas on the same coin, on the same nodes.. To test diffrent algos etc against each oter with just about no other variables

@blackjok3r you need big server  for test?

[20-Aug-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No...

[20-Aug-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
or same labs nn server?

[20-Aug-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure why we would need a big server

[20-Aug-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can use new chains, and kill them after 5000 blocks so they onyl use 150MB RAM each
