I wake up some days and wonder if I'm going to live long enough to finish this thing

[01-Feb-19 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
damn thing has more whys and ifs than a 6 year old

[01-Feb-19 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which is why I made mine 游뱎

but yours doesn't handle CHIPS that you were supposed to verushash a year ago :troll_king:

[01-Feb-19 03:09 AM] Alright#0419
can we talk about this "best" notaries metric again? What did we land on?
we count LABS->KMD
we start counting fungible chains counts if notary notarizes it once based on (how many notarizations they made/how many they could have made)
we somehow weigh this towards notaries who accept to notarize more chains

[01-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Alright#0419
I think the first two points there are solid

[01-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Alright#0419

how

[01-Feb-19 03:11 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
simple, you don't strive to do the max you can, then back into the election pool you go 游땥

[01-Feb-19 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
a notary should be able to remain competitive without notarizing every single chain

{Reactions}
游녧 

[01-Feb-19 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise, notarization cost is a race to 0

[01-Feb-19 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This one shouldn't be too difficult to put into a pool, but its a consensus rule that a coin base that does not pay notaries has only 1 vout

[01-Feb-19 03:13 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`a notary should be able to remain competitive without notarizing every single chain`
only if the majority follow that same rule, but if the majority are hitting as many as they can then you're entering the realm of "every kid deserves a prize just for trying" by rewarding them for doing less than the majority

[01-Feb-19 03:14 AM] Alright#0419
let's say going rate is 1000 LABS/month in notarization costs at the beginning

[01-Feb-19 03:14 AM] Alright#0419
a new chain offers 900 instead, 6 notaries start notarizing it and leap ahead in counts

[01-Feb-19 03:15 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`This one shouldn't be too difficult to put into a pool`
yeah, I was just teasing you, 99% of pools get the entire tx structure from the template and push it out the same as it came in

[01-Feb-19 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
do the other 14 have any option at that point?

[01-Feb-19 03:16 AM] Alright#0419
honestly I think maybe the metric should be only LABS->KMD

[01-Feb-19 03:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright I'm lost as to how you say you want a "free market" structure, but you want to figure out a rewards system that anything but

[01-Feb-19 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
What is the word for ISP monopoly?

[01-Feb-19 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
ie, you only have one option in your area

[01-Feb-19 03:18 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you put in the work and you get rewarded for it
you don't work you don't get paid
why should I get "equal pay" for *not* doing something someone else is doing?

[01-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
what do you propose then? Pure counts?

[01-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
it's not equal pay whatsoever

[01-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
you can earn more if you choose

[01-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
if you agree to notarize fungible chains

[01-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
but are we going to penalize notaries that say "no, I won't notarize that chain"

[01-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
if we do, I believe every notary is forced to notarize every chain

[01-Feb-19 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`what do you propose then? `
If you notarize 90% of everything you can notarize than you rank above someone that notarized 80% of everything they could notarize
`but are we going to penalize notaries that say "no, I won't notarize that chain"`
Yes. When you refuse to do something you contract to do, does the contractor/boss not penalize/fire you?

[01-Feb-19 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`if we do, I believe every notary is forced to notarize every chain`
No, they aren't "forced" to, they are just "forced" to explain next election to people why they should keep a job they choose not to  do to the best of their ability

[01-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
`KMD->LABS*amount of fungible chains notarized*(how many notarizations they did/how many notarizations they could have done for given fungible chain)`

[01-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
does this work?

[01-Feb-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
no I believe that is stupid

[01-Feb-19 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
but I think we will be able to find something simple and objective like the above that will work well

[01-Feb-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
we don't have elections

[01-Feb-19 03:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`we don't have elections`
so, the 20 of us are the notaries forever? because we like us?

[01-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
well this obviously still up for discussion

[01-Feb-19 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
but I believe we landed on top 15 notaries keeping their spot, bottom 5 spots are chosen by provably random lottery of those who can show they know how to run a notary and sign up for the lottery

[01-Feb-19 03:27 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm lost as to how this democratic socialist free market dictatorship plays out in your mind 游땟

[01-Feb-19 03:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
That's not the part that I get lost with
I'm lost as to how you say you want a "free market" (your words, not mine) system, but you want it magically anything but that

[01-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
How can we have a free market if 6 notaries can dictate what the rest will accept

[01-Feb-19 03:32 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
In a free market, you thrive by providing

[01-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
I guess that is a free market

[01-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
but it's a race to the bottom

[01-Feb-19 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
welcome to a free market

[01-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
so we'll just do it for free then?

[01-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
why not just start there

[01-Feb-19 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
OK, so, here's my proposal:
we can figure out the math of any system you envision, provided you stop using the term "free market" when that's not what you actually want

[01-Feb-19 03:35 AM] Alright#0419
ok

[01-Feb-19 03:35 AM] Alright#0419
"market" if that makes you happier

[01-Feb-19 03:35 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it makes me happier when you use the words that describe what you actually envision because I can't read your mind 游땥

[01-Feb-19 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
and I believe I said *hope*

[01-Feb-19 03:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
hope has no place in math 游땥

[01-Feb-19 03:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`Abandon all hope ye who enter here!`

[01-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
let's take a step back and try to look at this objectively. Lot's a moving pieces here.

We have a limit of how many notaries we can have.(we should increase from 20 in the future, but this is besides the point)

top n% of top performing notaries keep their position because they're good for the network

we have 1 set of notarizations(LABS->KMD) that is mandatory. If an NN sucks at this, they should no longer be an NN. The emissions of the coin pays for these.

We have many sets of notarizations that are not mandatory. (fungible chains) The chain creator pays for these.

We need a metric for "top performing notary"

We need to facilitate a market for notarization fees for fungible chains.

If the metric for "top performing notary" penalizes a notary for not notarizing a chain, this leads to all notaries being forced to notarize all chains in order to keep their spot. 

It also leads to cheaper and cheaper notarization fees for fungible chains as once a chain starts being notarized, the remaining notaries are forced to notarize it regardless of what the notary fee is

[01-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
/rant

[01-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
just needed to keep my thoughts together on this, sorry for wall of text

[01-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
We have all the tech ready or ready to test for this. We just need to determine a good metric that fits these requirements.

[01-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
The "wall" is good, because without words we cannot communicate ideas
`If the metric for "top performing notary" penalizes a notary for not notarizing a chain, this leads to all notaries being forced to notarize all chains in order to keep their spot. `
See, that's the part I get stuck on
I can't see how you envision a system that puts those that do less on par with those that do more. I agree that the minority can force the majority to do more in order to keep their jobs, but as you pointed out `The chain creator pays for these.` Why would we get paid for not doing what someone is paying us to do while we sit back and watch someone else do it? Isn't it more unfair to penalize the guy doing the work by elevating someone that didn't? If we can *not* notarize and be on equal footing as someone that does, then what's the incentive to do it ever?

[01-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think he means like thos who can...  for example my Labs notary node has like 64Gb of ram... and it pauid for by a KMD node.... So I can add every chain at 0 cost... Not saying I will but there are opther in my same boat im sure that really dont carte about cost and will just try to win at all costs...

[01-Feb-19 03:57 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
To flip your statement:
If the metric for "top performing notary" elevates a notary for not notarizing a chain, this leads to all notaries having no incentive to notarize any chains in order to keep their spot.

[01-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This fucks over the samller guy

[01-Feb-19 03:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he has no chance at  auto election

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
incentive is the ac_notarypay amount

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... If you can notaerise for very little cost...

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I believe the fix here is more min sigs...

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I;m not sure how far we can increase it and still have reliable notarisations

[01-Feb-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think we should change it until we have a stable production cluster running

[01-Feb-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed

[01-Feb-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even 50% o(so 10 of 20) ius likely too many

[01-Feb-19 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to work out how many notaries ther are thet have basically unlimited recources in the context of what otehrs are usuing...

[01-Feb-19 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then make min sigs so that its more then them 游땥

[01-Feb-19 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@blackjok3r so you're saying that you envision having 175 chains to notarize and *not* earning $200 worth of payments?

[01-Feb-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
s the cluster goes along.. It will end up centralising power/resources to some small group no matter hwo you doit Ithink... I theink just having LABS->KMD and then hey get paid to notarise the rest... works for me.

[01-Feb-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to notarise LABS.... You get PAID to notarise the rest... so if you CAN you notarise it and take the money 游땎

[01-Feb-19 04:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`You get PAID to notarise the rest... so if you CAN you notarise it and take the money`
exactly, so you wouldn't need anything near 64M without being compensated, so I'm lost on that claim too 游땟

[01-Feb-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The point is ... that the notareis who can do it cheaper.... will end up pushign the other out... but that isnt such a bad thing... For myself... my node is in a terrible palce... So stratagey to stay elected is to simply add more chain than anyone else, as my server is bigger and it was cheap...

[01-Feb-19 04:05 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I don't see how they'd "push others out". If I'm making $5 and Joe Schmoe is making $10 because he has less overhead, I'm still making $5

[01-Feb-19 04:05 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but, wtf do I know, I paid $2k a piece for Z9 minis 游땥

[01-Feb-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because of counts.... The top counts dont need to do anything but stay at the top... there is no metric to replace them...

[01-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with going only by counts and makeing everyone notarise every chain... is that nodes will all end up nexty to each other in the same DC over time.

[01-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
just counting LABS->KMD leads to notaries not being bothered to notarize a fungible chain unless it is truly worth the LABS the chain creator is paying

[01-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
I like this

[01-Feb-19 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`because of counts.... `
how does it costing him $5 and me $500 change our counts?

[01-Feb-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`. is that nodes will all end up nexty to each other in the same DC over time.`

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We cannot change the code that causes this anomaly to hapopen... its just too hard..

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
the weather

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we need to structure the economic system so that nodes dont do that

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
DC?

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
data centre

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
node very close to each other

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
form groups

[01-Feb-19 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that dominat counts... everythign else being equal

[01-Feb-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would work

[01-Feb-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node is in the most isolated city in the world and does alright.... But its down to shit loads of sofware tricks... and hacks that took months to work out... and everyone else isnt useing... BUT labs has these enabled by default
