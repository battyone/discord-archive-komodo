yewah... if you use config.ini it will import that private key to each chain

[12-Jan-19 05:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh right, yep I set that up now

[12-Jan-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That way, if anything goes wrong you can clear the chain data, even wallet... and everything is safe...

[12-Jan-19 05:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Currently in `/staked/` it still says `btcpubkey:`, should be `kmdpubkey:` I'm guessing

[12-Jan-19 05:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Probably not high on the priority list

[12-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not its btc pubkey 😉

[12-Jan-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats its actual name... the pubkey will work on any BTC fork

[12-Jan-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and generate a diffrent address

[12-Jan-19 05:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
oh wow, didn't know that. In the config.ini is there a way to input multiple addresses in there?

[12-Jan-19 05:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
as in, an `[ADDRESS2]` or some similar option?

[12-Jan-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no curentl;y not...  the proiblem is that CC contracts all use -pubkey to determine your working address
So I made config.ini so that the daemons all load up with it already set, and address imported.... It stops a large amount of OP error and needless questions needing to be asked by people.

[12-Jan-19 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made an RPC to set the -pubkey in runtime, but it only works to set it once, you cant change it...

[12-Jan-19 05:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ah right, so you'd just have to manually import other addresses if you wanted to

[12-Jan-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also a fix was pushed to staked ropo recently that fixes the private key import it was broken on old release for some time.

[12-Jan-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but its not really recomended to do so if dealing with CC's just use the one address.

[12-Jan-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you could have multiple config.inis and restart if diffrent address's were needed?

[12-Jan-19 05:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So the idea will to be only ever have 1 usable address?

[12-Jan-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that would work... your balance would show incoprrectly, because of other address's but it should still work.

[12-Jan-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for CC's yes pretty much.... I dont see an easy way of fixing that its a pretty low level thing for CCs that it uses -pubkey

[12-Jan-19 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe my RPC can be unlocked to allow changing -pubkey in runtime... but I really dont think it will be safe... once it has been set lots of things assume it to never changes.

[12-Jan-19 05:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've made the pool use a config.ini with script to generate fresh so it'll cycle as required. figured it's add some security perhaps

[12-Jan-19 05:37 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was thinking more to do with a pool rewardRecipient set. You usually wouldn't use the same address as the pool address. If you can't use a second wallet address, I don't know if you'd have any other option

[12-Jan-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for mining just start it with `noconfig` option

[12-Jan-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
works for me, but pool node is not notary

[12-Jan-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats for explorers and pools to use

[12-Jan-19 05:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

1 migration = ~1 second, these mempool things seems stable now

[12-Jan-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes things are good now as far as I can see

[12-Jan-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am adding a 51% PoS chain with a founders reward paid every 24H... I need to test some stuff. Its not fungible in this cluster. If the chain works well enough we can use it for oracle logging.

[12-Jan-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Please dont try to load anything from StakedNotary or staked for a little while... I need to launch the seed and then connect my miners to it, and make sure the chain works. 😃

Luanching a PoS chain is not easy...

[12-Jan-19 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Now for this chain I have a founders address, each day (1440) blocks, 1% of the total mining reward for that day goes to my address, if anyone wants the total of this to test staking please ask me. I started chain with a million coins, msotly to test my staking scripts out, which seem to be working perfectly so far 🌞

[12-Jan-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notaries funded

[12-Jan-19 07:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might test later once I've knocked down a few things. okay to restart tho?

[12-Jan-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah seems to be working well enough... you can attampt to mine some coinw ith GPU but the BR is only 9, so it wont be enough to stake....

[12-Jan-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I send coins around, it could stall the chain, need to let it run for about a day

[12-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the founders reward goes to s diffrent address... can likely pull some utxos off the staker into that address aswell, tomorrow

all good, worked on second run

[12-Jan-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... should be ok. mine split after a while...

[12-Jan-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
script and staker had a few issues early on... seems to have resolved... kept mining every block from segid0 despite that segid having the least balance... must be an early chain thing... these chains really need about 1000 blocks to level off.... they act very strange at the start.

[12-Jan-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
added the explorer node as a second seed... have about 10 nodes up already, its unlikely to fork.

[12-Jan-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
Update and a new chain. Update when you can. If build fails, just try `start.sh` again maybe will take 3 goes.

shouldnt that be `"generate":false` and `"staking":true` ?

:trollface:

[12-Jan-19 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
99% more fixed :trollface:

[12-Jan-19 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Give it a go, I fixed all remaining bugs with staker!

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And implemented RPC calls that let u efficiently stake, with almost no effort... Also scripts using the method... I sit back and wait for some to use that script to make a better staker, it has improvements to be made.

[12-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will give u half the premine @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ? Shouldn't be hard to select all uxtos from some depth to send without stalling the chain.

[12-Jan-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Let's race?

[12-Jan-19 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe tomorrow, atm I'm deep in trying to figure out why pool html even works with all this bracketed shit that's wrong according to every document, but nothing works if you recode it "right"

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U can only fix that stuff by trial and error don't google it... It won't helping!

[12-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Explorer mods were literally hardest code I've had to deal with

LOL I've tried 4 different UI editors and I can't get a grasp on how this works

`Property assignment expected.` seems to be the "favorite" error things like to kick out

what are the new rpcs?

[12-Jan-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
10000 in one batch worked too, but slower than 5000

@TonyL if you have a minute, can you make that log payouts and export txid

[12-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
if not, I'll do it sometime soon

[12-Jan-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
I was using it last night, and if it gets past 60 attempts, it doesn't seem like there's a way to recover from that

[12-Jan-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
or was I missing something?

[12-Jan-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes this 60 tries logic was ported from `.sh` script 
There is a list with each type on transactions in python script (these lists declared before relevant transactions generating part you can find it by []). Can write these lists to file, I may do it

[12-Jan-19 12:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Other solution is just disable this 60 tries thing

[12-Jan-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
will be testing that in a moment

[12-Jan-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
I was thinking the best strat for this test is going to be continually fill blocks with exports until the first batch is ready to be imported then start filling blocks with imports on the other chain

[12-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
going to try to script that logic I guess

[12-Jan-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Script now is working almost like this - waiting for previous step batch ready to proceed to the next step

[12-Jan-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe just some adjustment is needed

[12-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
yea so my idea is to not stop sending txs ever

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a good plan

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
if you're waiting for imports to be ready, send exports in the mean time

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
You may save txs to file, and other part read tx ids from file

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
If success delete entry

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
As easiest way

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
Will try that, thanks

[12-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Kinda SQS 😃

[12-Jan-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
Although reading writing to same file can be a problem, no?

[12-Jan-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
like if script tries to read and write at the same time

[12-Jan-19 01:02 PM] TonyL#3577
File streams can be both opened and closed

[12-Jan-19 01:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Or you even can use same file stream in different parts of program

[12-Jan-19 01:03 PM] TonyL#3577
`+` modes allows both writing and reading

[12-Jan-19 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
do you think we should leave everyone on their own to best tweak their migrate scripts?

[12-Jan-19 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
like if we release the "best" script publicly, it'll just be a matter of who can bother to set up more machines

[12-Jan-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
maybe that is the point though

[12-Jan-19 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be competition in the same time for all competitors on the same chains?

[12-Jan-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
Yes
