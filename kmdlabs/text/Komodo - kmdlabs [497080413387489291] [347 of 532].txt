haha thats one way to do it.

[01-Apr-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`cd ~/.komodo && find . -not -name 'wallet.dat' -delete` works too

either way start.sh will import the privkey before starting the sync lol take forever on the old keys like mine...

[01-Apr-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
60,000tx +

[01-Apr-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, that's reason #2 for me switching from using 1 addy for several things

[01-Apr-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or more specifically, several things carrying the same privkeys
even when I use addy1 for item1 and addy2 for item2, there's tx bleedover on some things and I have to manually transfer back :/

can someone give me a peer for each chain?

[01-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
don't want to take seed nodes down until I'm sure I have someone else to sync from

[01-Apr-19 01:49 PM] CrisF#3405
I can, but my node has been faaked up all day.

[01-Apr-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181

In short this allows migration of tokens, either fungible or non-fungible. Should allow some cool stuff.

[01-Apr-19 02:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Very cool 😃

[01-Apr-19 03:28 PM] Mylo#8306
just nuked `.komodo/*` and ran `start.sh` from StakedNotary dir - hope that's how i do it

just read last pinned post, thats pretty cool

Hi Mylo 👋

[01-Apr-19 03:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that Looks very cool doesn't it!

[01-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Mylo#8306
both sets of news are pretty cool

[01-Apr-19 03:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah 😃

[01-Apr-19 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
That method should resync everything for you.

[01-Apr-19 04:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r - wtf is CFEKNK and why won't it start for me from start.sh?

[01-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Oh - it's OK, just needed to be started twice.

{Reactions}
👌 

[01-Apr-19 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cfeknk is preparation for token migrate, notarizations should pay well, or mining is 10 coins a block. Special equihash params, some ridiculous numbers I've never seen before. Need to test them before we make the PR for the tokens stuff to KMD.

[02-Apr-19 12:08 AM] CrisF#3405
96% on KMD.
Hi @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Besides `blocks` what else should I include in a `'true'` bootstrap? (Some people had trouble with a bootstrap that only had blocks in ROGUE.  Seems adding `chainstate` helped.)

[02-Apr-19 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think do all  of it apart fro. The wallet and conf... @CrisF mine should be ready, will have bootstrap of all chains up after coffee.

[02-Apr-19 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Let's get this happening!

[02-Apr-19 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405

[02-Apr-19 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405
What is the best way to share a bootstrap?

[02-Apr-19 12:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Archive `blocks` and `chainstate` folders and share the link for archive

[02-Apr-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
You can start let's say apache and put archive to /var/www/html

[02-Apr-19 12:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, Tony.

make sure to include the following files. 
I have a bototstrap but its going to take an hour to upload to notary 😦 
`tar -cxvf komodo.tgz blocks chainstate komodostate* notarizations signedmasks` 
Pretty sure you need all those.

I don't have apache on NN.

[02-Apr-19 01:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Will spin up a vm and install it.

[02-Apr-19 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It may be because of notarizations that a "standard" bootstrap doesn't work 😕 
@dukeleto any insights?

[02-Apr-19 01:08 AM] CrisF#3405
```TonyLYesterday at 1:48 PM
Maybe if include chainstate to bootstrap it'll pass this validation ``` from cc-rogue.
The bootstrap that included `chainstate` was reported to have worked.

[02-Apr-19 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I keep forgetting that our chain keeps getting more complex

[02-Apr-19 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you ignore komododstate and the notarizations folder it will still work.... But it wont have any notarizations...

[02-Apr-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is fine, though because after 1 happens its protected by dpow...

[02-Apr-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man if I win this election Im upgrading my internet to the fastest speed... screw this 25mbit upload lol... at first I was like "holy crap this is fast" .... Now its too slow 😛

[02-Apr-19 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz is just blocks and chainstate

[02-Apr-19 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw

[02-Apr-19 01:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  😃

[02-Apr-19 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.. I think in our case we need them all... but Im not 100% siure on that. I now understand why the Zcash and Verus additions to the blockindex did a memory only thing and calculate the stuff on daemon load... But I think if we wanted to we can stick that stuff into the index and make everyone resync :troll:  
At least KMD wont take 15mins to load for me anymore that way LOL

[02-Apr-19 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`At least KMD wont take 15mins to load for me anymore that way `
When I complained about that last year, everyone said "Get an SSD" 🤷🏽

[02-Apr-19 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Since sapling merge its got really bad... That was fixed just afrer elections last year byut sapling broke it again

[02-Apr-19 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have worked out at elast in theory how to "fix" it ... but it also breaks everything by doing so ...

[02-Apr-19 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
last time I broke the block index the notaries were very angry at me

[02-Apr-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
http://103.6.12.112:8080/komodo.tgz This is a boot strap for komodo. My server isnt the fastest upload. If someone grabs a copy please host it elsewhere so we have a few copies up. 
This is using the new blockindex format, and only works with LABS komodod. Normal komodod will not load it. 
The ERA will change at 1554207078 which is 9 hours from now.  Plenty of time to get 6 notaries up. 
You need to also resync the DIMXY5/6 and ORKL/NK chains if you have not already done so. Please `stop.sh` and `start.sh` to update to latest. 
Then make sure you have port 9999 open `sudo ufw allow 9999`.
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  and @Mylo  your keys are the only ones that got changed, so I am relying on you to tell me if you start notarizing automagically at era change. 
I have activated the fetching of era pubkeys at the start of each notarization round. I'm 99% sure it works. But you two need to confirm this for me please. 
Once the era changes and everything is working, I will merge the tokens stuff to master and launch another chain in the CFEKNK cluster so we can begin testing it.

Started resync yesterday right after ping - somewhere close to webworker atm too 😂

[02-Apr-19 03:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Hope 9 more hours will be enough to finish

9999 is new iguana port?

[02-Apr-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[02-Apr-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
do we need to restart iguana at era change?

[02-Apr-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
how the fek'd you do that

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or you shouldnt .. it should "just work" Im 99% sure everything updates. The only thing it cant change without a restart is the port. Most of the time we wont need to change port at era change.. The reason for change port was so that everyone was on this exact version.

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
so it does need a restart?

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs to be started on port 9999 and nothing else

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at era change it will fetch the pubkeys fromt he daemon

[02-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
Ahh didn't realized it was already changed

[02-Apr-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it pulls the `getiguanajson` from the KMD deamon at the start of each dpow round.

[02-Apr-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
extracts the minsigs, number of notaries, and the array of pubkeys.

[02-Apr-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all notaries funded 100 coins on CFEKNK. plus the two keys that are changing. Hopefully we can get some notarizations on that chain before era change.

[02-Apr-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will take 200 notarizations until the burn address runs out of funds... So about 2-3 days.

[02-Apr-19 04:07 AM] gt#2812
i don’t think i’ll by synched in 8 hours 😅

yeah, i'll stop the sync and go with that. thanks!

[02-Apr-19 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just make sure keep wallet.dat

😥 

[02-Apr-19 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you dont ahve to rescan the chain (which is what takes all the time)

{Reactions}
😪 

[02-Apr-19 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resync here with no keys imported took liek 6H on 50mbit internet

[02-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can always import key with false

[02-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then use z_importkey to rescan back 20,000 blocks

[02-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is a very useful trick for notary wallets if something goes wrong

[02-Apr-19 04:15 AM] TonyL#3577
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/*` was a definetly not best idea...

```  "blocks": 714412,
  "longestchain": 1294405,

[02-Apr-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah.. grab bootstrap. manually import wif, with rescan = false

[02-Apr-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then z_importkey with rescan true current height - 20,000 blocks
