@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  trying to merge my Knomp into StakedChain is giving me this crazy shit.

[04-Dec-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think any of it re4ally amtters though

[04-Dec-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so i'll just merge it, and will need to test it

[04-Dec-18 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
examples and templates are ignorable

[04-Dec-18 12:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the html has changes that arent much

gnecfg just needs the new one ... I imp[orved it a lot ... but yours doenst even use that right?

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and gencfg was just to make populating the templates easier

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I played with and used it early on

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but once its done its done

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so manual setup is just as easy

[04-Dec-18 12:14 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r CMaurice and greentea said that they'd be willing to work on a logging/stats chain/oracle. If you could give them some ideas on what dada would be useful for you to collect for a migration log I think they'd be happy to get to work on it.

[04-Dec-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ok

[04-Dec-18 12:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you only really need gencfg if you are starting it for the first time and dnot know what you're doing

[04-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I made that script so I could be lazy getting a solo pool up instntly for minign ACs

[04-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will submit to your repo instead of staked chain if you are ok to sort merge out ?

[04-Dec-18 12:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I'll give it a look

[04-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool. thanks ... as you ahev the pool working and I ghave no idea how it works id rather let you do it. nothign Ive changed appears to be conflicting

[04-Dec-18 12:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Apart from it not paying out the first day I installed it, it's been pretty low maintenence üòÉ

yep they are not bad.

[04-Dec-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
changes for this version

[04-Dec-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`disablecb:true` is mandatory for all sapling chains (will be everything for us) .. and they require a clean node_modules and npm install.

[04-Dec-18 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
So kill pool and goto new VPS?

[04-Dec-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can if you want to yes

[04-Dec-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to get some actual oficial ones sorted

[04-Dec-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but thats really something @Alright will need to sort out .. im not flash with cash atm lol

[04-Dec-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
A VPS for pool, a server for seed nodes etc.

[04-Dec-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking we should have a test launch, with a cluster of 4 chains, and sapling merged in and activated at a low blockheight. as one last test, then I think we are ready. Provided MoMoM is working still.

[04-Dec-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I will set something up to test some migrates on sapling version, but without it activating for us, we cant test it perfectly.

[04-Dec-18 12:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
My migrates are crashing randomly at last import occasionally.
All so new error - I ran out of KMD, so I sent some from tipbot - but the node did not acknowledge receipt. Had to do a full rescan.

0.2 kmd

[04-Dec-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That will be the problem

[04-Dec-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
attack mitigation ... I did doucment that and ask Alright to test ti, but I guess he hasnt been able to

[04-Dec-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to either add a way to disable it for time being, or fully document it so that people know how to use it.

[04-Dec-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
more info on imports crashing? you mean not working, ort crashignt he daemon totally?

[04-Dec-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will update readme on how to disable "attack mitigation"

[04-Dec-18 12:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Same as previously - timing out on broadcast, can't import the hex.

[04-Dec-18 12:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Although - not sure I am importing correctly manually

[04-Dec-18 12:46 PM] CrisF#3405
How large are the transactions?

[04-Dec-18 12:46 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Random between 1 and 300

[04-Dec-18 12:46 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I would need to check the logs to isolate

[04-Dec-18 12:48 PM] CrisF#3405
I had troubles before due to UXTOs.  It occurred when I attempted large transactions using many small utxos.

[04-Dec-18 12:49 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Could utxos have anything to with this?

[04-Dec-18 12:50 PM] CrisF#3405
Random amounts would certainly need a variety of utxos.

[04-Dec-18 12:52 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Expecially as this is a staking node - so breaking up BR's

[04-Dec-18 12:53 PM] CrisF#3405
What did you mean when you said `manually`, Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834 ?

[04-Dec-18 12:54 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

I tested all those params, myself... but they are untested by 3rd parties, so I dont know if they work perfectly. The code is pretty simple, so it shouldnt have issues.

[04-Dec-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
i followed that a while ago when i set it all up, seemed ok

[04-Dec-18 01:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Nice!
 Maybe 2 sentences here`This is needed on KMD, to activate our features amoung other things, add the flags below in start.sh to customise it.`

In ETH, they created a new op code called ‚ÄúCALL‚Äù which calls a ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù.
Similarly, jl created a new op code to deal with the new CC vout.
What a crypto condition is ...... is anything.  You want to write some code that will send an email, get the mail receipt and include that in the transaction details, your code logic becomes part of the consensus.

That last one, is something I am pursuing soon... But I need to amker sure we have finished everything else first.

[04-Dec-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just culled out the Trello

[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] CMaurice#1685
Taking it slowly, haven't finished yet, but this looks really good @Mylo  .  Particularly like the way the  supply chain scenario is used to explain how the different CC are implemented in  pseudocode

Yeah use oracle data as your protocol storage / protocol on top of blockchain.
Mempool can be used as buffer/cache for faster state change in your dApp

@LabsAssistant  
Is anyone here able to stake all CFEK chains in cluster 102, CFEK, CFEKING, CFEKED, CFEKLF? I need to test some mirates and I can t stake the chains at hte same time...

[04-Dec-18 02:26 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have a VPS almost ready - should be able to finish it tonight.

[04-Dec-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... I can probably set something up at home. but if my pwoer geos out or something or kid turns off PC it might stuff up results.

[04-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to copy paste this VPS on server and just start another copy of it to stake with.

[04-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still cant nail down the wallet rescan bug.

[04-Dec-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So will try spend some time on that.

[04-Dec-18 02:28 PM] Mylo#8306
I can lend a vps.  Has staked already installed

[04-Dec-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am simply staking 5000-10000 utxos on each chain in the same address... it keeps the chain moving. But its locking up the VPS I have set up to stress test migrates.

[04-Dec-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no possible way those daemons will let me migrate as well in vast numbers.

[04-Dec-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will wait for Bar Fish, and try to debug the wallet rescan bug.

[04-Dec-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Your welcome to try setup some staking nodes... I can migrate the funds from CFEK on my PoW VPS to each chain for you @Mylo

[04-Dec-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need an address

I alrready tried to add:
``` if vin is empty 
 do not add to wallet```
in the wallet code ... but that doesnt work

[04-Dec-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
miket said something about the mempool scan in main.cpp

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems unrelated, but put it here just in case

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
he has a check for a staking block for VRSC and sets a flag to call a wallet function

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand why it is needed but mike says VRSC needed it and maybe so does PoS64

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and within a day or so

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just does it again

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every time you start the daemon with large amount of utxos it has to rescan the wole wallet

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it happens if a block you staked gets reorged

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... so mike solved this on Verus ?

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I should look there... I am on the sapling branch with these nodes

[04-Dec-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is a bit of an edge case, but on a long chain, staking fromt he same wallet for  a long time, this will be a PITA...

                    } else rejects++;
