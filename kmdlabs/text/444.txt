last time I tried ctrl A D many many times, it never worked ... but today, I tried once and it worked, it is weird

@phm87 you re a NN now, the mojo is coming

[07-Jul-19 08:07 PM] phm87#7395
weird : LABS is running under gdb but I can run a second instance on the same machine (without gdb)

[07-Jul-19 08:08 PM] phm87#7395
mojo means dick in the movie I'm thinking about ...

[07-Jul-19 08:08 PM] phm87#7395
can you tell me in french what you want to say about NN and mojo ? ^^

[07-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
not to me

[07-Jul-19 08:08 PM] phm87#7395
ok

see it as "superpowers" 😃

[07-Jul-19 08:12 PM] phm87#7395
Do you know how I can set the LABS.conf file used by gdb ? The other solution is to put everything into parameters

[07-Jul-19 08:14 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User  do not worry, I didn't loose my mojo nor confidence, I'm fine. I'm just trying to understand some behaviors and weird logs (invalid nota ?)

[07-Jul-19 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just told you now you got another superpower ^^

`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commit/be1721cb80349905334a7d0aceff9826329f40c6`
For those who care, I wrote this last night before bed, was thinking about it all day while driving to the city. Went a back way that was about 1.5H longer lol, but it was a really nice drive though all this country with riversand hills. Really good day, 
Basically, how it works is this:
1) On the first withdraw an object is created that contains the winner, before any bets have been spent from the game address, and after a result can be calculated, we can use the withdraw RPC to calculate the winner, Then in validation the exact same function is called to verify that the correct winner was added into this object. 
2) next withdraw and all withdraws after this, simply spend the withdraw vout, into a new vout with the same object. 
3) The validation simply hashes this object from the vin, and the vout  and compares they are the same. So we know that its is valid. 
3) This means, that we can have 1 ticket with a fixed price if needed now, because even if there is say a million tickets have been sold or even a billion lol, the validation only needs to run once, and then the winner can just keep withdrawing over and over to merge the tickets and spend them to their specified pubkey. The overhead after the first withdraw is very low, and shouldnt slow all nodes down while the winner is extracting their funds.

[08-Jul-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to do it this way, because once some of the, utxos have been claimed from the game address, then the function I made that calculates the winner cant work, because it uses all the unspents in the game address. I think this will work, but its never been done before, I couldnt even see in VRSC pbass if miket did anything like this. Maybe their validation will do it, but as it hasnt been written yet I'm not sure. 
We are pretty close ot being able to start a chain on this branch, and put it into the CFEFEK cluster, because that chain has intesne supply of coins. 

The only thing Im not sure about is the function that calculates the winner, it may not actually work as intended. But as its just 1 function, we can change this easily to something elseif the algo for calculating the winner is not right.

@Deleted User thank you for help! published offer 😃

      Hi, there. I’m inviting you to make a 5 KMD swap in exchange for 200 LABS through Barterlly Escrow swaps. It’s the safest way for people that just want to make quick OTC swaps.
      If you want to go through with the swap you need to accept it and follow the instructions on http://app.barterlly.io/invite/8966
    ```

[08-Jul-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r is it possible to test already?

[08-Jul-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its best to wait until tomorrow when I have some time. I haven't tested it all, but I'd does build. What we can donis add the chain for it, needs customcc as the cclib, and a large supply and be in a cluster with at least 1 other chain.

{Reactions}
👌 

[08-Jul-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed update, to the lottoCC, I relaised that after adding withdraw object stuff that the status RPC would be broken. status RPC will be important as its the only way to tell if a winner has been found.

[08-Jul-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its pretty hard for me to test all this stuff woithout my dev machine setup, so just going to write code for it if I think of anything until I get home on Wednesday night or thursday.

My LABS node crashed again without anything in the logs and no backtrace into gdb, it is weird. Here are the details and gdb commands and outputs: https://pastebin.com/PjE9nYub we discussed it yesterday with @Alright  and dwy

[08-Jul-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If GDB is not returning anything that means you failed some kind of assert. The error mesage will or should be the last thing printed in the console the daemon was started in.

[08-Jul-19 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why is anyone caring why an outdated node is crashing?

[08-Jul-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah im confused about that aswell.. Nobody else has reported this. I did merge some fixes down from upstream a fwew weeks ago, but did not update my staking node.

[08-Jul-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will go update it to latest now to see if it crashes for me.

[08-Jul-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```From outside the screen:
 
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getinfo
{
  "version": 2001526,
  "protocolversion": 170007,
  "KMDversion": "0.3.3b",```
literally the only thing that matters in that pastebin
it needs to be updated

[08-Jul-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean, its totally possible that it could crash, because while its waiting for the block to be elegible... its not under a cs_main lock, because that would stop make the daemon upresponsive to RPC calls... But it may pull data from `chainActive` which should be in cs_main lock when accessed.

[08-Jul-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That said, every staking node for every staking chain would have the same crash.

[08-Jul-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And this is something new... Nobody has told me about before.

[08-Jul-19 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`every staking node for every staking chain would have the same crash`
well, we know from experience that that's not entirely true (given all the crashes I had for pool)

[08-Jul-19 11:54 AM] phm87#7395
Alright asked me yesterday to reproduce the bug with the old code. I wanted to update

[08-Jul-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think he caught the bit about it being outdated 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 11:55 AM] SHossain#0007
staking nodes are not crashing in general. i found 2 pools reported komodo daemon crash

[08-Jul-19 11:57 AM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I shared the outputs of ``git show`` and ``git remote -v`` and ``getinfo`` yesterday and I wanted to update on the last master branch of KMDLabs/komodo but Alright preferred that I reproduce this bug

[08-Jul-19 11:58 AM] phm87#7395
I'll try to reproduce it with an up-to-date code

[08-Jul-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo:
if error then check for updates
doesn't really have an else in LABS

[08-Jul-19 11:59 AM] phm87#7395
Remark: @blackjok3r I can reccord the rpc calls if it is useful to try to understand the problem (or add mroe logs). i'll use a fresh master branch of KMDLabs/komodo (if it is fine)

[08-Jul-19 12:00 PM] phm87#7395
CG: I asked yesterday and I wanted to update (I already compiled it yesterday in another folder but I don't use it yet bc Alright asked me to try again with the same outdated code ... maybe we misunderstood each other yesterday)

[08-Jul-19 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
telling me that 3 times in 6 minutes doesn't change the fact that you could be on a moot code base 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 12:02 PM] phm87#7395
I followed instructions that I received

[08-Jul-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sometimes, the power of the human mind is stronger than any external set of instructions

[08-Jul-19 12:04 PM] phm87#7395
that's why I compiled fresh new code yesterday (just in case old code was too old or in an undetermined state)

[08-Jul-19 12:05 PM] phm87#7395
but I still think that Alright, blackjok3r and you CG know way more things in komodo and assetchains than me so I'm ready to be wrong (especially in the NN stuff)

[08-Jul-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its fine, I think I did read Alright say that... I do know that thoretically its possible to happen, but I haven't seen it happen before. I will look at the miner code in that commit you were on, because I dont recall any changes recently to it, related to staking chains. KMD did have a bug, that Genie found and we fixed that.

[08-Jul-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You are ok to update @phm87  if it happens on new code we can investigate further.

[08-Jul-19 12:12 PM] phm87#7395
I'll update no problem. This node is used for mining and staking but as there is no miners, only few rpc calls will be sent for mining from stratum and yiimp admin loops (getinfo, getblocktemplate, ...)

[08-Jul-19 12:12 PM] phm87#7395
and stacking worked (I got several blocks ^^)

[08-Jul-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice. My staking node is doing very badly atm, I keep getting a lot of incorrect nBits errors... which is very strange, as staking should be minimum diff.

[08-Jul-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The fix for mining has been added since the commit he's working from

[08-Jul-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"20 days ago" and he's on one from Jun 4

[08-Jul-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`503848228 block.nBits vs. calc 503847701 for block #61542`
Yes but that fix wasnt for staking chains at all... Which is what I mean, he should update and let us know, because my staking node is likely on the same version if not older.

[08-Jul-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
of all people, htf are you not on an updated node?

[08-Jul-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[08-Jul-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it has been working just fine so I just leave it...

[08-Jul-19 12:17 PM] phm87#7395
as my LABS node was used for mining and staking, I wouldn't be surprised if the mining fix fix my problem

[08-Jul-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh h

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you are staking and running pool on same node?

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did add things for that, but we never teted that it works.

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] phm87#7395
yes but as there is no miners few rpc calls are sent I guess

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`staking and running pool on same node`
that leads to ugly

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it may crash when it calls getblocktemplate

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did enable it, just to see what happens

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] phm87#7395
oh

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But maybe its not a geat idea

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know, I'd like that LABS and komodo works with all features activated together on the same node

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the issue is that staking needs to release a memory lock, otherwise it locks the daemon up and it becomes unreponsive to RPC calls, and it keeps trying to submit a stake even if a block arrives, wasting heaps of CPU cycles.

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the template for mining and the template for staking are different

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but you can stake

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the getblocktemplate will return a PoW block. I changed it ages ago

[08-Jul-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and the getblocktemplate will return a PoW block. I changed it ages ago`
then I'm glad this convo came up, because that feks my next project 😛

[08-Jul-19 12:21 PM] phm87#7395
I'll tell you why I'm trying to do this : outside of KMD ecosystem, some PoW pools with POW/POS coins (with masternodes) adds a masternode within the pool to pay miners with the masternode earnings. It is working fine to use the same node for mining and do the masternode. I'd like to do the same with LABS

[08-Jul-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im pretty sure I said i did this in chat, but nobody actually tested it. We can either revert it, or we can fix it properly.

[08-Jul-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fixing it properly means we need to seperate the staking to its own thread. like VRSC does with theirs.

[08-Jul-19 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Im pretty sure I said i did this in chat`
You likely did, but you know how things get lost in other things and forgotten 😁

[08-Jul-19 12:22 PM] phm87#7395
Some generous pool operators pay the masternode with their own money. Other pool ops are doing some shared masternode + PoW mining (but it is getting out of this conversation)

[08-Jul-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That may not get around the problems of memory locks crossing over but it does allow daemon mining and staking at once, not that thats very useful for LABS being equihash 200

[08-Jul-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would need to install knomp and a CPU miner on my staking node to test this, and add a heap of prints...

[08-Jul-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just as well, I suppose, because most likely folks wouldn't understand the wording of how the pool I was going to make would work anyway :troll:

[08-Jul-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is that its not crashing but just locking up, could be wrong though....

[08-Jul-19 12:24 PM] phm87#7395
I saw no crash but it stopped working without any log nor complain

[08-Jul-19 12:24 PM] phm87#7395
sorry I said crash : my wording was confusing

[08-Jul-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I saw no crash but it stopped working without any log nor complain`
That sounds exactly like one of the issues fixed

[08-Jul-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
could be different, but by wording it sounds the same

[08-Jul-19 12:25 PM] phm87#7395
I'm currently testing with fresh new code, we'll see

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[08-Jul-19 12:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
You did say it in chat... that you would look into it when I sked if it was possible to mine and stake like VRSC.

[08-Jul-19 12:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
so good to hear its already coded and needs testing

[08-Jul-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need a pool. I dont think that you understand how large a job that would be to daemon mine and stake at once. It took me about 6 months to amke staking actually stable for prduction use as it was. Changing it is not something I want to do unless its absolutly nessary.

[08-Jul-19 12:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
my LABS staking node runs KMDLabs/komodo with the latest commit on May 30th, it never crashed so I just leave it like that 😅

[08-Jul-19 12:32 PM] phm87#7395
can you make some getblocktemplate rpc calls on your node while it is staking @PHBA2061  ? :troll:

[08-Jul-19 12:33 PM] phm87#7395
(I'm trolling, do not do it or the node may stop if you are lucky or unlucky)

{Reactions}
😂 

[08-Jul-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly lol. The issue is definatly that he has a pool running on the same node. maybe a cron each minute of getblocktemplate will cause mine to reproduce the error

[08-Jul-19 12:35 PM] phm87#7395
but if the issue requires too much work to be fixed and only 2 users are complaining (daemonfox and myself), I don't know if it is worth to fix (but maybe put it in a list of low priority things)

[08-Jul-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It depends... To daemon PoW mine and stake is a horrible job to fix... but the getblocktemplate should be working... and I guess it does most of the time.

[08-Jul-19 12:42 PM] phm87#7395
@blackjok3r  in my case, the daemon itself is not mining (gen=0 in LABS.conf and I've just ran the command to stake setgenerate true 0) : pool and stratum are sending getblocktemplate, getinfo and submitblock rpc calls. I don't know if there is a huge difference. I'll tell you in few hours/days if I encounter the same problem. I hope that the 'mining fix' did fix my problem. Thank you for your time

```#!/bin/bash

This isnt crashing my staking node lol

[08-Jul-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder if its another call that may do it 🤔

[08-Jul-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I dont think that you understand how large a job that would be to daemon mine and stake at once.`
897 extra lines of js code (give or take 100 lines) to make it halt payments, alternate on posperc and diff wall, and make payments on a bidaily basis :troll:
