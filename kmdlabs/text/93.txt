Bad timing if there's a problem!

[18-Nov-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm almost home, guess I should check out the testnet and start testing things

[18-Nov-18 06:45 AM] TonyL#3577
There is a `The Notarization Process` paragraph

Need to merge FSM down, tried this morning but again multiple conflicts so stopped.. Once that's on we can do a ac script chain to pay to multisig address.

[18-Nov-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And merge maatertest to master and do one last migrate stress test.. Need to make 100% sure all chain s are being mined and staked, as when they stall out my VM dies totally and reslts are incorrectly reported

you might want to change to jl777 from FSM. FSM is now in flux

[18-Nov-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 was synced with FSM prior to the massive changes to FSM

@gt How's it going with the migration?

[18-Nov-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just merged the ac_script fixes to mastertest on staked before Verus was added in... so I htink we are ok there.

[18-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  would the Verus Nothing at stake contract be able to be used with komodo PoS ?

[18-Nov-18 10:22 AM] gt#2812
@CrisF i haven‚Äôt done any today sorry

[18-Nov-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that CC is not integrated

[18-Nov-18 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
No worries, @gt .  I'll give it a go.  Please let Blackjok3r and Alright know if anything shows up in the logs or there are any troubles.

[18-Nov-18 10:29 AM] CrisF#3405
`CFEK` might need mining.  100%PoSvs51% target.  My 4 cores aren't doing much.  2414522 dificulty.

[18-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah.... we identified that issue ... It seems as though the main chain will NEED hash power, but also we know that it should have a fair bit of it, a single mini corrected the % easily... if all chains are progressing, migrates should be wokring, provided the notary nodes are working... I sitll have the 2 of them, and havent checked them in a while.

[18-Nov-18 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, my NN has been very stable too.

[18-Nov-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I just solved the wallet cleaner problem with a very simple solution... starting new code project at 8pm ... have to stop doing this LOL

[18-Nov-18 12:04 PM] CrisF#3405
üí•  Good stuff!

[18-Nov-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```    {
        // listunspent call... this gets us all the txids that are unspent, we search this list for the oldest tx,
        vector<COutput> vecOutputs;
        assert(pwalletMain != NULL);
        pwalletMain->AvailableCoins(vecOutputs, false, NULL, true);
        int32_t oldestTxDepth = 0;
        BOOST_FOREACH(const COutput& out, vecOutputs)
        {
          if ( out.nDepth > oldestTxDepth )
              oldestTxDepth = out.nDepth;
        }
        oldestTxDepth = oldestTxDepth + 1; // add extra block just for safety.

        // then add all txs in the wallet before this block to the list to remove.
        for (map<uint256, CWalletTx>::iterator it = pwalletMain->mapWallet.begin(); it != pwalletMain->mapWallet.end(); ++it)
        {
            const CWalletTx& wtx = (*it).second;
            if (wtx.GetDepthInMainChain() > oldestTxDepth)
                TxToRemove.push_back(wtx.GetHash());
        }
    }

    // erase txs
    BOOST_FOREACH (uint256& hash, TxToRemove)
    {
        pwalletMain->EraseFromWallet(hash);
        LogPrintf("ERASED spent Tx: %s\n",hash.ToString().c_str());
    }```

[18-Nov-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
works pefectly ... very fast and doesnt miss any txs or remove txs that are unspent.

[18-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its merged into mastertest branch

[18-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think I have anything really left needed... we are up to testing phase before launch of 10% blck reward and notaries to be chosen for mainnet.

[18-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  can you please test `mastertest` branch with your `ac_script` chain. to amke sure it works.

[18-Nov-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if thats confirmed I can merge mastertest to master tomorrow

[18-Nov-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RPC for wallet cleaner is : `cleanwallettransactions`

[18-Nov-18 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
need to test pos on ac_script, so I'll do FSM and staked at the same time

[18-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
change to jl777 branch

[18-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
FSM is having issues with all the latest changes

Create a bash file for noobs....git pull ... start from scatch with new testname....you guys are killing the part time lovers.  

AssetChain.sh

[18-Nov-18 11:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Master and mastertest

[18-Nov-18 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[18-Nov-18 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
What is it you want us to do?

[19-Nov-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked repo does that @kmdkrazy

[19-Nov-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It starts all or a single chain with a so gle command

[19-Nov-18 01:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I keep working on my business and keep coming back ....you guys change shit before i wake up..
..please keep testing chains updated with some type of updated bash...so the newb 12 hours away can test.....

[19-Nov-18 01:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Maybe im 2 weeks behind

[19-Nov-18 02:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Stop progressing so dam fast !!

[19-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
the purpose of the test chains is testing, they aren't particularly important as we can just restart them if there is a problem. Mainnet will be much more consistent than the testnet

[19-Nov-18 02:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Yeah...but changing to FSM and or from testnet needs a better stucture....i understand that you are in prototype.... but there should be a place to see these new changes without scrolling back

[19-Nov-18 02:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
If github has those

[19-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the staked repo will start a chain you specify from the correct branch with no user input required

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Fogive me

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./start.sh CFEK` for example

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you cant do a config.ini

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it even easiuer

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./start.sh CFEK noconfig`

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Nice

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it was needed

[19-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at the moment everything is in master branch anyway so its not really needed.

[19-Nov-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I have bulk things to merge down, once we have verified everythiing in matsertest is working.

[19-Nov-18 02:14 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just change the komodod to staked 1375

[19-Nov-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally everythig will be in master

[19-Nov-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont want to have to change things to often... likely the testnet will use a diffrent branch ...

[19-Nov-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we dont expect everyone to actually run a testnet node.

[19-Nov-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its msotly for my testing, so I dont merge broken shit into the amin chain... that would eb very bad

[19-Nov-18 02:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
As a tester ...i need "komodod" to equal test chain  instead of the easier way you are operating

[19-Nov-18 02:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
When i kill komodod

[19-Nov-18 02:17 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I want to know which one

[19-Nov-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Please confirm the address and pubkey here are correct, and that you still own them. This is what is going into the source code. If there is a problem, send an email to stakechain@protonmail.com immediately . This is the only acceptable way to make sure you get your chance at being a notary. Discord messages easily get lost.

It's on you guys to verify. Don't assume I didn't make a mistake while creating that.

I will manually cross check it before adding to the ERA2 in the code ... and doing myt tests, I will check the email, Alright has given me access to it.

[19-Nov-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These are not mainnet pubkeys, but you can use them there aswell, if you like.

Will leave this another at least 4H before putting the keys into the code. then we can announce the activation time for era2 and launch of the 10% br chain.

[19-Nov-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
