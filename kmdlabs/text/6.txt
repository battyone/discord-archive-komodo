@kmdkrazy  do you have the pubkey for this address : RWHGbrLSP89fTzNVF9U9xiekDYJqcibTca 
The address is in the komodo code, but the pubkey is a copy of one of mine for some reason. must have been a copy paste mix up

[08-Oct-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have created a STAKEDTROLL chain, it uses its own branch of komodo and will be our first chain, that is not in the cluster. It is ondemand blocks, with a static difficulty of 1 and a block reward of 0.  I will disable the RPC call for `getblocktemplate` so that it will not be easy to GPU/ASIC mine.

[08-Oct-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also ther is 1,000,000,000 coins in the faucet and ir rewards 100 coins. This is the only way to get coins.

[08-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actually I think I will scratch this one and make a new one.

[08-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just had an idea

[08-Oct-18 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Just noticed mentioning of mine - @CrisF  feel free to buzz me in PM or #cc-general if you have a questions/concerns for CC calls or want to collaborate in testing of some CC

[08-Oct-18 08:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
trying to catch up today,  pulled StakedNotary and restarting, is that all?

[08-Oct-18 08:53 AM] CrisF#3405

Hi @CMaurice That's all I did.

[08-Oct-18 08:57 AM] CMaurice#1685
thanks, will be a few mins... have o read a script that requires a password at least

[08-Oct-18 08:58 AM] CrisF#3405
That's good advice for me.

[08-Oct-18 09:12 AM] CMaurice#1685
saw some connection failed rpc errors, seems ok after that

[08-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it should all just work

[08-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one bug with start.sh

[08-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that if KMD has (so masterbranch) has been updated, iguana will crash

[08-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however it will restart again

[08-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe that is onyl happening on my blackjok3r branch and does not happen for your guys, I havent got back to that yet, as have been playing with kvtroll branch all day.

[08-Oct-18 09:25 AM] CMaurice#1685
damn, shoulda checked resource usage after 3 days uptime

[08-Oct-18 09:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Where/How to check that @CMaurice?

[08-Oct-18 09:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
I should have used htop, f4 to filter for `iguana` and `komodo`

[08-Oct-18 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks.  I'll check that.

[08-Oct-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This has taken way longer than it should have, but I think I finally got this working.

[08-Oct-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Our first chain that needs a diffrent branch is done.

[08-Oct-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To make it so that it has only ondemand blocks with a static difficulty of 1, i have forced ac_pubkey and ac_perc, so that stratums dont work, but the block reward and the ac_perc reward are both 0. The entire coin supply is in the faucet apart from 100 coins i sent to each notary address.

[08-Oct-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But there is nothing stopping anyone creating a new address and then doing a faucetget to get 100 coins.

[08-Oct-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KV chat is also working to stdout

[08-Oct-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we might need a few scripts to handle that a bit easier.

got a few more things to double check and clean up then i will update assetchains.json and test on my nodes. Then we can update

I think I have figured out how to make onDemand blocks a consensus rule

[08-Oct-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so had to start anohter chain... I updated assetchains.json but that chain doesnt exist so please do not update until I ping the staker role, if anyone is here

[08-Oct-18 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  you will not be able to statum mine STAKED onDemand chains, even if we have a block reward set, its a consensus rule that the block must have 2 transactions or more

[08-Oct-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r what does 1 have to do with the other?

[08-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
welll at least I think it is... I need to see what it deos when it gets over 128

[08-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you were the one who figured out how to force mine ondemand chains

[08-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just solved that problem to amke them ondemand

[08-Oct-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
again

[08-Oct-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
send 1 sat to self
send 1 sat to self
for the cost of 2 sat you now have 3 tx

[08-Oct-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it also has ac_perc set but with zero reward so a stratum doesnt work

[08-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the coinbase is 2 TX both of 0, but I think it can have a block reward this way aswell., with a slight change

[08-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what about TX fees ... of you modify the miner to mine your own at zero fee?

[08-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the block time on these chains is hilarious 😂  like 5s static diff of 1 lol

[08-Oct-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I need more ☕ before I begin to attempt to understand what you're on about about a chain called STAKED than has 0 rewards

[08-Oct-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
has to be on demand consensue of it will fork and regorg constantly if someone puts any amount of meaninggful hash on it

[08-Oct-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`@ComputerGenie you will not be able to statum mine STAKED onDemand chains, even if we have a block reward set, its a consensus rule that the block must have 2 transactions or more`
...
`even if we have a block reward set` = reward
beyond that, I dunno what you're saying

[08-Oct-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically I made it so that you must create a startum that can mine ac_perc chains to mine ondemand chains and also blocks with only a coinbase are invalid blocks.

[08-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ComputerGenieToday at 8:20 AM
send 1 sat to self send 1 sat to self for the cost of 2 sat you now have 3 tx`

[08-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need ac perc to send 1 sat

[08-Oct-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need acperc to make startums not work.

[08-Oct-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
proud of you @blackjok3r a year ago(?) you started with the barterDEX competitions and now making consensus level changes!!

👍 (6) ☝ (6) 💯 (7) 

[08-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to just disable getblock template but any monkey with half a brain could just activate it again

[08-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so ac_perc seemed alike a good place to start

[08-Oct-18 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ac perc doesn't stop stratums, ac perc stops *me* from putting pubkey tx as coinbase tx *in nomp*

[08-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as we alrady know that statrums dont work with that

[08-Oct-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well there might be another way to do it. if thats an issue... but I think for this particualr chain that has 0 BR ... its so much effort for someone to mine it with a stratum they wont bother

[08-Oct-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
a small GetScriptAddress call would allow ac_perc to work with the address of the pubkey

[08-Oct-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I, personally, cannot follow the bufferst that the lib uses; never take that as meaning it can't be done

[08-Oct-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes @jl777c you have taught me very much

[08-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but mostly you did it via "stumbling and bumbling" about. sort of what I did at first too

[08-Oct-18 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, that makes it more valuable as it's actual learning and not just happens to work "because the book said so" 👍🏼

[08-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
books take too long

😝 

[08-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this method is much faster

[08-Oct-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although i must say not everyone can learn this way.

[08-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181

```
It works

[08-Oct-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there could be a way someone can break it, but its a lot of work for no gain.

[08-Oct-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for the record, if the wallet can do x then *a* stratum can do x; that stratum might not be in js, however, but it could be done

[08-Oct-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, the idea is onDemand blocks that are enforced I guess a determined person could figure some way to create a TX in the block template and force mine blocks, but with 0 BR that seems pointless...

[08-Oct-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The reason james never added any stops to existing block-on-demand (as far as a tx requirement goes) is because the miner can always create a tx
Now as far as doing it for 0 br, I agree that no one will do it for long (other than to show that they can) without any personal gains

[08-Oct-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My sticking point earlier was that you said 'even if we have a block reward set'; If there is a br, then the personal gain changes in the favor of choosing to mine if the cost of mining < total br that can be had

[08-Oct-18 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, I realised later that if there was a block reward then someone would e determined enough to make it work. I cannot think of any other way to do it  than the way I have done. It is muhc better then there being no checks. This seems the only possible way to creat a chain with as close to instant TX confirm as possible, that also wouldnt be just blown up by an attacker.

[08-Oct-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
could have just a limited number of pubkeys that is able to mine

[08-Oct-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm the ac_pubkey is the only valid miner 🤔

[08-Oct-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but what is stopping a person just starting komodod with that pubkey

[08-Oct-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and them mining empty blocks

[08-Oct-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I seem to recall a chain that tried that idea

[08-Oct-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
would need to use he notary miner... and then you need utxo

[08-Oct-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
😃

[08-Oct-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how hard is it to change the type of utxo that is needed ? or does the notary miner not need p2pk ?

[08-Oct-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can require a properly signed opreturn signature

[08-Oct-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can make it so that the BR isthe utxo needed so that the creation of a block, allows the creaation of the next one

[08-Oct-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only as it is hard to write the matching pair of vout creation/validation

[08-Oct-18 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`could have just a limited number of pubkeys that is able to mine`
to be devil's advocate here....
Isn't there a chain that has that, with like 21 block makers, that our community mocks on a regular basis?

[08-Oct-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... but this chain is for a very specific application

[08-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think hte way it is, is probably fine for now... unless someone tries  to repeatedly break it

[08-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the true masternode implementation for KMD chains. yes, it is horrible, but anything is possible

[08-Oct-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then we will need to look at that solution.

[08-Oct-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
These changes make making dApps much eaier, as you dont need to wait for blocks... they happen within seconds of sending TX

[08-Oct-18 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's hard to balance freedom, restrictions, and centralization 😦

[08-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes very much so ...

[08-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is more for a testing situation, than a production chain

[08-Oct-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
centralisation in this case isnt that bad

[08-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
people are free to create restrictive and centralized monstrosities

[08-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
just as long as they dont have the power to force others to use it, all is well

[08-Oct-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm  not even saying that it wouldn't make a great production chain, just that perception might not lead to the public viewing it as positive as it actually is

[08-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD can create PIRATE, it can also create EOS equivalent

[08-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
seems ok to me

[08-Oct-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes posibly making it so that only notaries can mine the test chains on STAKED is a good idea, but the main chain can be mined/staked by anyone

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[08-Oct-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this isnt very hard to do at all, as the is_STAKED function cna return any number, so there can be multiple definitions of chains that are staked.

[08-Oct-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did it that way just incase something like this was needed.
