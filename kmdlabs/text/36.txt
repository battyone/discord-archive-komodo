nice! üòÉ

just shows how you can never tell when something will be utilized in the future. it might have some normal seeming function,but turns out to be the enabling piece for a bigger solution

[14-Oct-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and like PIRATE this LIVE chain would be feature complete on launch. of course not all the ancillary things, but it would be able to stream at the 256kb/sec, and have basic codec support. VLC integration would solve the display side

[14-Oct-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
also it would be a lot more work, but a decentralized discord is also enabled

[14-Oct-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
quite a few channels would fit into 256kb bandwidth

There is also the option of a non-arm board.  These are pretty good. https://www.udoo.org/

Rpi would have more of a draw from the marketing side of things.

[14-Oct-18 10:41 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
LIVE chain. I like it. STREAM works well too.

[14-Oct-18 10:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You could have temporary and permanent autospawn chains. For different prices and different uses. If you wanted to conduct a single on-chain voice meeting, you could use a temporary chain. Or if someone wanted a permanent stream chain, it would be up all the time. Could you have some in browser vlc support as well?

[14-Oct-18 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
all that is possible

[14-Oct-18 11:39 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe LIVE is the ticker for Live Stars. An adult streaming platform and social network üòê

Libscott got back to me yesterday, o gave him access to my test VM, so might have some time to do some early bandwidth tests on troll, and make sure a chain that fast does not break under full block conditions

[15-Oct-18 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
can we make it not mine blocks until they're full?

[15-Oct-18 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
let's say you send 8kb of data, network mines it immediately

[15-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
but if you there were 2 8kb txs in that block, it would have saved space

[15-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r

[15-Oct-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure

[15-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Alright#0419
the block time isn't really what matters, it's the throughput of mempool

[15-Oct-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No problem

[15-Oct-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Right now it only mines blocks with 2 tx, instead it needs to use block size

[15-Oct-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Shouldn't be too hard, I can't work on it for a while tho my house was destroyed on the weekend need to clean up :(

[15-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
destroyed?

[15-Oct-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.. Children can destroy thing very fast

[15-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Alright#0419
lol thought you meant literally *destroyed*

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I want to merge latest FSM to staked master, but I think there is a channels hard fork in it

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its only channels I think thats ok ...

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
we could update all nodes then say "don't use channels for now"

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe one chain only had that used on it

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
then once someone uses it, it will hard fork

[15-Oct-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CrisF used it once

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure on which chain

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
maybe just make a new chain/branch?

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do that too if you want to

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or harddork stakeed ... and merge FSM to blackjok3r

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Alright#0419
Yea, I will. Need to start digging into it this week

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we cont need to add more chain

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
stakeded is running on bj branch?

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used ti to test

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
that'll work, but it's still a hardfork

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as me and you both upgrade it shoauld be ok ...

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419

[15-Oct-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
