[22-Jan-19 06:51 PM] Alright#0419
so we won't be using this for 0BR chains or what

[22-Jan-19 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is what im using now

[22-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
I'm still confused as to where we are at with 0BR chains

[22-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
do we have a working example yet or are you still working on it

[22-Jan-19 06:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it appears to work perfectly here.. but its impossible to know without a test with lots fo staking nodes

[22-Jan-19 06:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the supply doesnt seem to make a lot of diff... tbh

[22-Jan-19 06:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10000 or 1 million it stil works

[23-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to be number of utxo more than total supply.. Will need some more tests but looks good so far.

[23-Jan-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All chains are within .5 of a second average 60s block times. This is ready for further testing

[23-Jan-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```LAB: 
  "premine": 10000,
  "reward": "1",
  "endsubsidy": "1",
  "staked": 60
  174 million diff, 10,000
  10,000 coins, 1 CPU core
  59.31s average blocktime  

LAB601:
  "premine": 1000000,
  "reward": "1",
  "endsubsidy": "1",
  "staked": 60
  1.12 billion diff
  1,000,000 coins, 1 CPU core.
  60.02s average blocktime```

@Alright  Fixed ac_founders_reward ac param. 
This allows an assetchain with no block reward to pay ac_pubkey or ac_script an amount of satoshies at some period of blocks. 
If you want to seperate coin emmissions to diffrent chains, and multisig address's you can use this for that.

ac_founders_reward fix · StakedChain/komodo@a0427eb
https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30971146?s=200&v=4

[23-Jan-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs `-ac_founders_reward=<satoshies>`  to replace assetchains comission. 
for example:
`./komodod -ac_name=LABTEST -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_staked=60 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_founders=10 -ac_founders_reward=1000000000 -ac_pubkey=035fc678bf796ad52f69e1f5759be54ec671c559a22adf27eed067e0ddf1531574`
Will pay the ac_pubkey address 10 coins every 10 blocks.

[23-Jan-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
what if both are set?

[23-Jan-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if the options are mutually exclusive, it is best to have a specific check that they are not both active. i just exit if I find an invalid ac_params combo as the chain is likely wrong

[23-Jan-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I gues it would probably crash if both ar set...

[23-Jan-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just made it work, as the first version I asked him to test didnt work

[23-Jan-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed fix for checking if they are both set, and added founders_reward to magic value.

[23-Jan-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Manged to get FSM to compile down with all latest changes. I created `mastertest` branch with all new code and changes. Not sure we should use this for launch or not.. Maybe we need to create some 0BR chains and do some testing over the next week.

[23-Jan-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It builds, but is largly untested... I suggest anyone who is doing any testing to use this branch. 😃

👍 

[23-Jan-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL CFEKPOS51 has 11,682 valid forks... but I think `getchaintips` is returning dupicates.

[23-Jan-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`11,682 valid forks` 🤣

[23-Jan-19 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bored much?

[23-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha no... Need to figure out how to make it "forget" forks and orphaned blocks once a notarisatioon has happned

[23-Jan-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as they can never be used anyway and just waste space

[23-Jan-19 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
What is FEK?
Baby don't fork me
Don't fork me
No more

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  Would you guys be able to run this branch for CFEKPOS51 mining/staking?
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/tree/chaintipstest
It should be perfectly safe... but it needs testing. It now purges all forked/orphaned blocks that are from before a notarisation, each time a notarisation happens.

I'm not sure about it as it was far too easy to implement.

[24-Jan-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it seems fine... my node is syncing and receiving main chain perfectly fine. Havent tried mining though.

[24-Jan-19 09:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should be able to give it a crack later tonight 👍

[24-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no rush... just let me know if anything werid happens

[24-Jan-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r what's with the `removing oprhans from before `?

[24-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pos attack mitigation

[24-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Didn't work... Leveldb doesn't reuse space

[24-Jan-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like the Waller db does

[24-Jan-19 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, I guesss 
`Sucessfully removed all known orphaned blocks before height`
is "true" because it is a "success" to "remove" something that didn't happen :trollface:

[24-Jan-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Huh? Every received block is saved whether vaild or not so u can spam invalid blocks and fill and nodes storage u til it crashes

[24-Jan-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```removing oprhans from before 15090
Sucessfully removed all known orphaned blocks before height 15090```
```removing oprhans from before 15095
Sucessfully removed all known orphaned blocks before height 15095```

[24-Jan-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Print is useless needs James fix from upstream to display vaild data... The only way to check it is to call getchaintips before and after the call happeneds

[24-Jan-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as I can tell there was nothing *to* "remove"

[24-Jan-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Getchaintips will give like 30,000 results before the call.. And 1 after it

[24-Jan-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It works... But its doesn't solve the problem I set put to solve as the reserved space isn't re used

[24-Jan-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to basically replace level db ... To use something else that can re use space

[24-Jan-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or at least the way it saves .blk files

[24-Jan-19 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you going to rebuild wallet db while you're at it? :trollface:

[24-Jan-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wallet db is actually better in this case as the erased space is actually reused.

[24-Jan-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Too slow for blocks though :(

[24-Jan-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nm, I guess you missed the joke part of that (going on about bdb being ancient in btc) 😛

[24-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Jl has a decent idea, seems a lot of work though... To replace the layer that saves files with the implementation from iguana

[24-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be faster and use less space ald enable this "fix" to work

[24-Jan-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think level db can still be used just needs relevant functions to read and writr files and update index

[24-Jan-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright hasn't successfully been able to carry out this attack yet rho to really test it

[24-Jan-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`seconds until elegible, waiting.` <- I like that print 👍🏽

[24-Jan-19 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah changed the staker a lot

[24-Jan-19 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It waits for submission in createblock rather than in the pow loop , saves CPU

[24-Jan-19 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasn't possible before the staker operated outside of lock cs_main

[24-Jan-19 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is also 4 loops removed for choosing utxo.. Speeds that up a heap

[24-Jan-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now just uses the validation loop to choose and validate the utxo

[24-Jan-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do segids matter with this set up?

[24-Jan-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes should be exactly the same... Maybe with versus hash it matters less, I'm not sure yet... By lowering staking diff, you change the time a utxo is eligible

[24-Jan-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Equihash does not use the staking diff changing code because it would hard fork all chains

[24-Jan-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Guess it's time to pull the parts off the shelf and build that i7-8700K rig

[24-Jan-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ha yeah, I'm finding from testing verishash with pos64 that CPU is not really used at all... Unless u have absolutely crazy numbers of utxos... Equijash is still the same unless its waiting for utxo to become eligible

[24-Jan-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then it uses 0

[24-Jan-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I bought the 8700 as a "meantime" waiting on the 9900; then when the 9900 finally got here I put it in and never did anything with the 8700
fek, crypto has been good to me; 5 years ago if you told me I'd have a rig like that sitting on a shelf (mostly unboxed) I would have spent an hr LOLing at you

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha.. Yeah never would have thought I'd have that system I've got.. Thanks pirate

[24-Jan-19 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I can't do much with my PIRATE profits, I spent it all on ASICs

[24-Jan-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol... This computer already paid for itself by how much it increased my productivity... Being able to run that any VMS locally and have that much screen space really helped. Plays games like a boss too at the same time... Not that I've had much time for that.

[24-Jan-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This computer already paid for itself by how much it increased my productivity.`
every reason why my wife thought I was insane when I 1st said I was getting 3 screens, but now 100% understands why I find it odd to attempt to function with just 1

[24-Jan-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just got one freeking huge one and kept a 24"... I think anothe r 24" on the other side would be even better tho lol

[24-Jan-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, until 3 days ago I never used tmux and I come from a win background, so 2 was a "must" by like 2004 😛

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still using tmux heavily even with the massive screen... Still using the laptop for all my servers.... So kinda is 3 screens

[24-Jan-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm using 3 curved 27" screens
I couldn't ever go back to a "normal" sized office even if I wanted to 😛

[24-Jan-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nice 1 35" curved doesn't fit on my desk as it is

[24-Jan-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my desk started as a custom "L" that was 4mx3m, with the long one being my "workbench" back when I did PC repair
ended up putting in a new cutout on the long side and now that's my use space with a smaller bench

[24-Jan-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesn't sound like that would fit inside my house 😂

[24-Jan-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL My "office" used to be what we consider in the US to be a "full-sized" bedroom

[24-Jan-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what mine is... The previous owners removed a bunch of walls to "open up the space" effectively creating a room in the exact middle of my house surrounded on 3 sides by doors

[24-Jan-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With no doors, like openings the size of 2 doors

[24-Jan-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasted space... Lined the remaining wall with a huge desk

[24-Jan-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the room is 14'x18' (too lazy to do that many metric decimals in my head this early in the am)

[24-Jan-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what size it is... But if I used an L shaped desk it would block a door so I cant

[24-Jan-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I put the door in the corner just so that I could have both my desk and wife's

[24-Jan-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it used to be in the middle of the "short" wall, but I kept tripping over her chair

[24-Jan-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I this k the only way to fix my place is to either burn it down and start again or remove the rest of the Walls so its just one giant massive room

[24-Jan-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That said its a house... And I own it.. In Australia which is like impossible atm

[24-Jan-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`burn it down and start again`
is our future plan, this house sucks ass

[24-Jan-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181

💯 

[24-Jan-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we'll this property started out as a dumbass retirement idea my parents had for themselves and ended up with *me* spending 2x what it was worth 🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think mine was about double what its worth... But if I bought in a city especially east coast, I'd pay 4-5x what it would be worth

[24-Jan-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I could have bought a similar property *in town* for less ☹

[24-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol could have got sizable land if I went put of town... But no Internet... Never would have ended up here doing this

[24-Jan-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But no Internet`
100% of the reason we don't live on our 7 acre lot
because of location it would cost the phone co like 400k to put another substation to even run lines out there

[24-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They ended up putting in fixed wireless around most of here in the last few years... Its not terrible but its not fiber

[24-Jan-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I doubt I'll live to see fiber here
this place is so feked that the electric co is talking about maybe running fiber before the phone co that nets $18 billion a year 🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically mine isn't fiver the last 80m is copper 🤦

[24-Jan-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm interested to see how well above-ground fiber works 😛

[24-Jan-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No out of town is wireless.. In town is kind of fiber, still 100mbit

[24-Jan-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I meant here, they are considering using existing above-ground electric poles to run the new fiber system 🤦🏽

[24-Jan-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ah
