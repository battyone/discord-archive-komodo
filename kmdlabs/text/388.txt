`testnode=1` does the same thing, but without all complexities. Just use 1 node. Its there for testing chain params, as they are starting to get quite complex.

[21-May-19 11:04 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it. but some cc do require multiple daemons to test them properly, like musig and such
this different data dirs method can be used in such cases

Did you add swap space?

it says its not advisable is you have a SSD

[21-May-19 09:13 PM] Exile13#4458
`Although swap is generally recommended for systems utilizing traditional spinning hard drives, using swap with SSDs can cause issues with hardware degradation over time. Due to this consideration, we do not recommend enabling swap on DigitalOcean or any other provider that utilizes SSD storage. Doing so can impact the reliability of the underlying hardware for you and your neighbors. This guide is provided as reference for users who may have spinning disk systems elsewhere.`

yea... well it's not going to work with 4gb ram

you might be able to build the binary on another machine and use it

[21-May-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
but you won't be able to build it with 4 gb of RAM

who's still trying to use that?

[21-May-19 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
you don't need the swap space always

[21-May-19 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
just to build the daemon, it'd definitely help otherwise

@LabsAssistant would like to hear some opinions on whether we should launch right now(not literally but sometime today) or wait until the weekend. We're going to need support from the notaries to get it up and running. Would you be more available on the weekend or today?

[22-May-19 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
early morning in Aus right now, if consensus seems to be that we should do it today, we'll get the ball rolling as soon as Joker is online

I have several ones, but it took me half a day to mine this one

[22-May-19 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Mined this one yesterday `RSchwBApVquaG6mXH31bQ6P83kMN4Hound` üê∂

[22-May-19 10:13 AM] PHBA2061#2530
interesting, didn't know that you can also search for pattern in the checksum part

[22-May-19 10:24 AM] jorian#4555
you mean the Hound part? that is not the checksum

[22-May-19 10:24 AM] jorian#4555
the chekcsum is in the public key hash

[22-May-19 10:24 AM] jorian#4555
which including the prefix will be the address after a base58 encoding

[22-May-19 10:39 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah I just learnt that yesterday üòÖ 
I meant the last 6 characters of the R-address correspond to the checksum (4 last bytes/8 last hex characters)  of the pubkey hash

[22-May-19 11:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just let it mine until I had one at the end.

[22-May-19 11:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
How long per letter is the calc for time to find?

[22-May-19 11:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Wanted to try for DragonHound, but thought that might take a few deacdes ü§∑

[22-May-19 12:06 PM] jorian#4555

just the 1 extra char for dragon took a while longer, but still got more than a few in a day

`make clean` didnt work, remove this line? `// If CCLIB fails to compile with this, use the one below.` in the wallet/db.h?

and why did it work the first 3 times lol

@Alright on pos64staker, is it possible that the balance in my wallet goes down? I just checked now and it's 26 coins lower than it was a few hours ago?

[22-May-19 10:53 PM] ph03nix#3115
@wookie this happens from time to time, not sure why, but `getbalance64` always shows me the correct balance

@wookie are the keys from the json imported?

[23-May-19 02:47 AM] Alright#0419
The staker is sending block rewards and staked amount to an address in the json each time a block is staked or mined

[23-May-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry was testing something last night and broke build. Will fix shortly.

[23-May-19 08:47 AM] wookie#7663
@Alright I initially did genaddresses. After that,  I copied my wallet and    .conf from my computer to the vps, and I ran the importlist command in tuistaker. Is that what you mean?

[23-May-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
@wookie where are you seeing a reduced balance?

[23-May-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
getbalance?

[23-May-19 11:17 AM] wookie#7663
With getinfo at block 15936 I had one number then when I checked later at block 16020 I had 26 coins less on the balance.

[23-May-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
sounds like you don't have all the addresses in the json imported

[23-May-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
but not sure

[23-May-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
try doing `importlist` on it again and seeing if your balance goes up

[23-May-19 12:26 PM] wookie#7663
@Alright before I re-ran importlist the getinfo balance was lower than the getbalance64 balance. I ran importlist again now and now both balances are the same. Am I good?
