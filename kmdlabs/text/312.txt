we have a fungible cluster of chains( one coin, many chains)

[26-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
we wouldn't have been able to manage it on KMD's dpow network, so we had to create our own

[26-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
and kmdlabs notarize to kmd?

what will be the use case for LABS coin?

[26-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Alright#0419
@Markus we will likely be the first chain to have a plethora of different CCs. All other assetchains must hard fork to implement new CCs whereas we can just add a new chain to the cluster

[26-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
the overall purpose is to give a place for devs to test their dapps/CCs on a wide audience and to foster a learning environment for testers

[26-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
but that doesn't mean once a CC is tested, it must go away

has someone been pentesting on LABSTH?

[27-Feb-19 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
don't touch LABSTH nodes until further notice, don't do anything to your notary at all please

[27-Feb-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed fix for the problem. Seems safe enough. Looks like we might have encountered a 1 in a billion (even trillion?) dPoW bug... Still do not understand what happened. Somehow a notarization with a blockhash that pointed to a non existant block, was accepted as valid on all online nodes, but upon chain sync it was no longer valid. Best guess is the weather changed. By paying notaries without needing the blockhash to match, it gets around this. Stil requires minsigs of notaries, and an OP_RETURN constructed by iguana to pay out. Dont think it will be any problem.

trying to wrap my head around `Somehow a notarization with a blockhash that pointed to a non existant block, was accepted as valid on all online nodes, but upon chain sync it was no longer valid. `

[27-Feb-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
this is an edge case that is accounted for

[27-Feb-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the issues is that the tx with the notarization can be in flight while the notarized block is still not protected by the notarization that is in the process of being mined. still the notarization logic is intact as the invalidated notarization is treated as an invalid notarization

[27-Feb-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like something broke migrates no idea what it was. There hve been that many changes. Going to start with a git difff of when they were alst working. Does not appear to be anything related to notary pay as CFEK chains also seem broken. This is the worst they have ever worked. Im getting a missed MoMoM has at least once per hour. Something is definatly very very broken.

[27-Feb-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm CFEK maybe not. Guess I need to leave my loops running on CFEK for 24H to gather enough data.

[27-Feb-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABSTH0 is definatly missing MoMoM hashes though, doesnt make a lot of sense. I checked iguana code, and the expirty on notarizations is set at 0, so they should not expire. üò¶

[27-Feb-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is quite frustrating tbh. I;mn not even sure how the fix libscott made to fix them in the first place even works. Struggling to even read the code.

[27-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont understand it 100%, odds are any changes you make will break it

[27-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe get help from @dimxy

[27-Feb-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well, I didnt change this part. The MoMoM DB it a totally seperate thign altogether

[27-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any notarization on eh chain, will be added to that DB

[27-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its competely and totally seperate from what I have changed All I did was limit to 1 notarizatino per block. And somehow its broken it.

[27-Feb-19 10:04 AM] CrisF#3405

[27-Feb-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats fine. I think I need to just leave it looping CFEK cluster here for a good 24 maybe even 48H to see if there are any fails on that, because that narrows the problem down immensly.

[27-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool. thanks cris. that helps at least if there are newer commits that broke it. I am looking at some stuff, and its very difficult to know what parts yuse james code and what parts use libscotts... the two are intertwined, iguana gets info from james, code and the actual migrates, use all liubscotts code and track notarizations diffrently.

[27-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if funds matched then it was fine.

[27-Feb-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405

I also have something thats been in the back of my head after working on notary pay, and the getinfo call that iguana uses to find the last MoM height is not being pulled from the notarizations DB, I think to make it exactly realiable it should be getting that data from the database.... that way it is unaffected by notarizations being reorged out of the chain. I will fix this tonight after some food. This will be a great start as there is definatly chances for bugs there,m due to mismatched data.

[27-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant hurt it, or at leat shouldnt so while Im waiting on results I can fix that proiblem.

[27-Feb-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the dPoW code should not be being used at all for MoMoM crosschain, eveything should come directly from the import code base. Otherwise its bound to break.

[27-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r - if you specify / share the script you want to test with I can set some going.

[27-Feb-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure. Looks like CFEK cluster is working ok, but its ahrd to say, the tests months ago sometimes took 24H to get a single gap. But this looks ok, musty be something in notary pay that is confusing the  MoM depth, I think I cna fix it, but will need to wait until tomorrow after Ive had some rest.

[27-Feb-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using the `seqmigratecoin.sh` but the `migratecoin.sh` needs a log of txns deleted in `waitforconfirm`

[27-Feb-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the idea is to do 1 export per block, which then covers all blocks for MoMoM hash's.

[27-Feb-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is not point doing 1000 per block or anything, as if a block is covered by the MoMoM then it is covered.

it looks ok on CFEK, but I extended the maximum wait time on import to 2H so it might not have logged yet.

@blackjok3r last time I tested migrates was on dimxy's chains, I didn't do thousands and thousands of them, but a couple hundred worked fine

[28-Feb-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
117 failed out of 1963 attempts here on CFEK chains, so something has broken.

[28-Feb-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will start investigating this today. üò¶

[28-Feb-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think hte total loop was 2000 so I'll have solid numbers in a few hours. Not sure if just bad luck when testing LABST cluster, or if notary pay chain preform worse. Eitehr way need to get CFEK working 100% again then work backwards from there. I will start by trying to work out how MoM is calculated. After the work on notary pay, MoM, canot be being calcualted from dPoW checkpoints as its possible that after a chain resync that data isnt in the chain.

[28-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419

belong to anyone here?

[28-Feb-19 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok,, I think I have somethign we can work with. Removed all of the MoM crap from dPoW as it was unused and just wasting RAM. Written new function for Previous MoM height that uses the MoMoM notarization DB. Technically, now MoMoM is 100% seperated from dPoW itself. This means that a notariszation can now be reorged out of the chain and everything will still work.

[28-Feb-19 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Provided this is what the issue was or was related to. I have seen prints where a notarization seems is either created twice or added twice. So hopefully this is what the problem is.

[28-Feb-19 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly issue on CFEK chain was MoM data missing.

[28-Feb-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think though that there could still be issue, I wonder if its possible to use MoM from the previous notarized height to the current, it could slow thigns down a bit because it needs an extra notarization, but this would make sure 100% that all notarization being used for import txn is in the chain and notarized in the chain unable to be lost.

[28-Feb-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem seems to stem from MoM or MoMoM notarizations being lost.

[28-Feb-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For whatever reason. So rather than try to figure out why its bing lost, I started with removing possibilities of them being lost.

looks liek everything builds, but to use this branch it needs a resync of every chain, including KMD, I got around KMD here by just deleteing the `komodostate*` files, and `signedmasks`. Just means KMD doesnt have any known dpow checkpoints on start, but once 1 notarization happens then all previous notatizations are notarized adn no longer requried anyway.

[28-Feb-19 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok have a plan to debug this. There will be a mandatory update soon so iguana will need to change port. We need everyone who updates to be only connected to ppl who have also updated. This "fix" requires a resync of all chains.

I can probably make it so that the komodostate file can still load the old data structure. but Im not concerend with wasting time, doing that if this "fix" doesnt work.

[28-Feb-19 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Would it be any use to backup `.komodo` (just in case - to avoid a possible re-sync)?

[28-Feb-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to also create way to log that all notarizations iguana is making actually end up in the chain, that seems like another issue that could be happening. Need to take my time with this, nobody update to anything being pushed while Im still trying to get it work.

[28-Feb-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use a bootastrap to restore KMD if anything ahppens... All its doing it wiping the notarizations checkpoints. As soon as you get 1 notarisaion on KMD .. then the chain will be protected by dPoW again.

[28-Feb-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Reindex works as well. I will just add -reindex to the start.sh for you guys. KMD you will need to manually delete the files or it will complain a lot when you start it. might still start, but there will be millions of errors .

https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/master/src/crosschain.cpp#L342
@jl777c  I think maybe this is causing problems also. Before sapling, using a supress every 3 KMD blocks was enough to make sure they were confirmed in order. This is no longer the case. I am increasing the suppress to 5 KMD blocks. I really really dont understand how the 
```auto isTarget = [&](Notarisation &nota) {
            if (!IsSameAssetChain(nota)) return false;
            return nota.second.height >= blockIndex->GetHeight();
        };
        if (!ScanNotarisationsFromHeight(blockIndex->GetHeight(), isTarget, nota))
            throw std::runtime_error("backnotarisation not yet confirmed");
``` function works... 
it seems to referance something called IsTarget that simply does not exist anywhere in the code. No idea what the hell its doing. This was something @libscott  added when we added the sledgehammer approach to handle out of order notarizations. But I dont think it works exactly correctly for some reason. Either that or notarisations are not being added to a chain at all for some reason.
