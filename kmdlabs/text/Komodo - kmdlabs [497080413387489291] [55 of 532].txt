You can seek through all blocks, but adding an oracle to the chain wher you post the block the stream starts and ends at after saving would work better

[30-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be a requirement for notaries

[30-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
as it'll just be a backup of all other chainss

[30-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
maybe we pay for KMD notaries to do it? üòÖ

[30-Oct-18 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it doesnt really need to be notarised... but I think you could have a version wher it just uses a pruned node on notaries and saves only notary wallet txs and block hashes liek a light eth node does

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
would need to get some estimates of how large how quickly it would get

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD otaries dont ahve the space, some of them went with 500gb total this year

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
well relative to some other chains, it's not that big

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It is ecactly 10% more than the copressed bootstrap

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are no blocks unless you stream into it

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just waits for data

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
the entire testnet cluster (all chains ever so far) is 2.3gb

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
and we had *lots* of chains

[30-Oct-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, chains without txs are tiny

[30-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
we wouln't have nearly as many real chain as we did test chains

[30-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
would probably take a year to get that big on main net

[30-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Streamer chain should work for notary nodes, but id have to port he ac options into KMD

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might get away with having mainnet ones notarise it... definatly keeps a full copy no matter what with 64 nodes

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but when you stream, they will see huge bandwidth use

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only bursts but

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
the streams wouldn't be that large

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well the 35MB steam was noting

[30-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
idk, we can't do it if it's more overhead than a typical chain

[30-Oct-18 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
but if it's about the same overhead, seems like a good idea

[30-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only more overhead, ifyou stream to it all the time....

[30-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what you need to work out is the average amount you will stream to it

[30-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even though blocks are every few seconds... it only makes blocks when you use it/

[30-Oct-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it your only using once a week or every 2 weeks, the average amount of blocks is tiny

[30-Oct-18 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
how much in tx fees to stream them directly to KMD :trollface:

[30-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
or lol....

[30-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
any random chain being notarized üòÇ

[30-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
MGNX?

[30-Oct-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They dont have the RPC to fetch it, and the algo for extracting the data would break in a normal chain.... it makes a shit load of assumptions to work

[30-Oct-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each chunk must be in the tx directly after the previous chunk

[30-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will skip any txs without an OPreturn at the 3rd vout... so that notarisations can still work

[30-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but not sure a normal chain would work at all

[30-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
Maybe we can just pay more per notarization for STKDMETA

[30-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
make it optional for staked notaries to run

[30-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
just to clarify, all chains are optional to begin with

[30-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
but STKDMETA may have a larger overhead than the average chain, so maybe we pay twice as much for notaries to run it

[30-Oct-18 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
also if STKDMETA ever becomes unbearably large, we can move to STKDMETA2 and so on. Would just have to ensure we have plenty of backups before doing so

@Alright  I'm in meetings for another 4hrs or so, will advise once back home üëç

Working on notary node atm, man its been a while since I did maiuntance, lke eveything was out of date, coins on forks üòÇ  no wonder its down the ranks lol

[30-Oct-18 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
the pubkey address shouldn't need funds in it

[30-Oct-18 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
to use a contract

[30-Oct-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But does it need to send the funding txs from the right pubkey ?

[30-Oct-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some contracts have a check at daemons load, that flood you with messages about needing the private key imported, but other ones dont

[30-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Alright#0419
oracles I know at least doesn't require the pubkey address to have funds

[30-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Alright#0419
it would get funds from change with the first tx it made anyway

[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
pushed an update to trollbox

[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
use setusername again

[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
it's checking whether the username is signed by the pubkey now

@blackjok3r @CrisF @jl777c @CHMEX @libscott @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @Deleted User @webworker01 @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ @Mylo @TonyL @Nabob @CMaurice 

Please read http://pad.supernet.org/staked_proposals about signers. We are asking you to be one. 

If you can be a signer, please leave an üëå  emoji on this post. I will contact you to get your pubkey.

We don't need 100% of signers to sign each bi-weekly transaction, just some %. The % will be based on response to this message.

For the time being, a signers job is to check that (% of notarizations = % of biweekly payment). We will make this easy to verify.

We will work on the process of collectively signing a transaction.

This is a temporary solution until we can have real pay per notarization working.

updated it a bit, there's new dependencies in the readme

[30-Oct-18 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
and you need to run setusername again if it's already set

[30-Oct-18 09:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok I'll find my way over.

[30-Oct-18 09:54 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Hi , got this ```File "./setusername.py", line 7, in <module>

ImportError: No module named 'bitcoin'```

[30-Oct-18 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
read the readme for new dependencies I added

[30-Oct-18 09:56 AM] CrisF#3405
oh, Added the 3 listed. must have missed something. Sry, I'll check.

[30-Oct-18 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
pip3 install python-bitcoinlib

[30-Oct-18 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
that

[30-Oct-18 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
if you did that and it still doesn't work, something is wrong

[30-Oct-18 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
It didn't install 1st time. I messedd it up. re-did and ok.

I'm having pubkey issues

[30-Oct-18 10:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
took me a minute to figure out it meant how many coins i had in STAKEDED

[30-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
can send you STAKEDED if you need it

[30-Oct-18 10:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`none`

[30-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
yea, I'll error check it

all good just kicked off a miner

[30-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419

[30-Oct-18 10:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh, its made alot more sense than a few other error messages I've seen lately. I just failed to understand it's context.

by default it will make 10 1 coin oraclessubscribes

[30-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
meaning you can send 10 messages per block

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
that's just a coincidence that says none lol

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the None error message thrw me aswell, simply polling balance first will fix it.

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not a hard fix

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
will do

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
make more sens than ` error -25`

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that error is the worst.

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
did you get that?

[30-Oct-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
litterally has 0 meaning
