PS - mining SUPERNET at 0.0001 reward paid for that server; so, there's that

[22-Aug-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a 10s block time chain with 4MB blocks would eat 135GB a day

[22-Aug-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yuou could alwyays not mine a full block and get less coins

[22-Aug-19 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
or people could just stop pretending that it's still 1995 and storage space is expensive....

[22-Aug-19 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
....or non-hypocritically remember that he used to mine a specific AC and made decent bank on it.....

Does that mean the bad tx came from them, @blackjok3r?

[22-Aug-19 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but its a bug

[22-Aug-19 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not that they are doing anything wrong

[22-Aug-19 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well I dont think they are, because its all nodes doing it

[22-Aug-19 06:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know how to fix it with a giant üî®  its just taking me waay too long

[22-Aug-19 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
no rush, I don't really want to notarize 3P anyway :troll_hardcore:

[22-Aug-19 06:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im pretty sure I fixed the utxo cache so that it can never have spent utxos, can also add gettxout call to iguana that checks the utxos being submitted before letting a node in recvmask.

[22-Aug-19 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

[22-Aug-19 06:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This seems to solve a bunch of problems., Glad this bug happened.

[22-Aug-19 06:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its reliably giving me something to test against

Hi @blackjok3r - checked ports are open on firewall this end - but still seem to be in my own recvmask.

[22-Aug-19 09:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
for some reasons I'm suddenly unable to split my CFEKMYLO for the last 3 hours

@blackjok3r - nevermind - think I have figured it - restructured my net and have f**ked up my routing.

np thanks man

[23-Aug-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
Please `./start.sh`
I have got spent utxo detection working, rather than banning after the fact, it stops bad utxos even being sent to recvmask. üôÇ 
Along with this I wrote a new utxo cache that leverages the wallet filter to remove any utxo that has been spent from the cache upon receive to mempool. Rather than needing to reset it entirly every time. This should fix the last of the issues ü§û

Hi joker.
I had a look at your new utxo cache, the address as input is taken into account now, it is fine.
CTxDestination address is not used anywhere I think: dest is used in place of. Can we remove address if it is not used ?

[23-Aug-19 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh Im not sure... I was prety sleepy when I finsihed it.. It took wfar longer than it should have. 
Im not sure that all oof that was required, but nodes were definatly and still are submitting utxos that are spent up to thousands of blocks ago. 
So I re made it to cover as many edge cases as possible

[23-Aug-19 06:18 AM] phm87#7395
I agree. I will test it and polish it. Thank you for your awesome work

[23-Aug-19 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess we just need to wait for all nodes here to update and see if the spent utxo problem stops. Its a little over engineered atm, but once it works I can simplify it a bit mroe.

[23-Aug-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Thx but I thought that address or dest can be removed

[23-Aug-19 07:03 AM] phm87#7395
Anyway it is fine

[23-Aug-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it work perfectly and that is all that matters

[23-Aug-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Aug-19 07:04 AM] phm87#7395
Yes

[23-Aug-19 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this version covers everything... You cannot submit spent utxo's all nodes check them before adding to recvmask, and the fastnotaries count detects if the scriptPubKey/scriptsig has been mixed up. I dont know of any other way to stop noarizatioins happening, but there is liekly something still to be found.

[23-Aug-19 07:10 AM] phm87#7395
What if the utxo was spent on another node using same wallet.dat ? I hope that it will work fine

[23-Aug-19 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses gettxout

[23-Aug-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the same result on every node. I have been testing it but importying notary key into notary and another node.

[23-Aug-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
load the utxo cache uip on second node.

[23-Aug-19 07:11 AM] phm87#7395
Yes

[23-Aug-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then as the notary spends the utxos, they are removed form the cache on both nodes

[23-Aug-19 07:11 AM] phm87#7395
Good

[23-Aug-19 07:12 AM] phm87#7395
What if a nn use replace by fee (double spend) ? Will it break utxocache ?

[23-Aug-19 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You mean liek after they ahve commited they spend the utxo before the notaization finishes?

[23-Aug-19 07:13 AM] phm87#7395
Yes with a higher fee

[23-Aug-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a secondary check when the notarization tx is sent, that checks all vins a second time. This can be ised to ban or notify OPs

[23-Aug-19 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not really poissible to prevent a bad acting notary 100%, but at least we can easily detect and see who is doing it now.

[23-Aug-19 07:15 AM] phm87#7395
Cool. Thx

I only have KMD and LABS running
no CFEK chains
is that normal or I borked sth?

[23-Aug-19 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to stop everything.

[23-Aug-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe even restart the VPS? 
Then do git checkout many_iguana 
in StakedNotary
./start.sh

[23-Aug-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that doesnt work for you, delete SuperNET and komodo folder from the home dir and run the install scripts again

[23-Aug-19 09:18 AM] gcharang#6833
trying

[23-Aug-19 09:19 AM] gcharang#6833
my StakedNotary is currently on master
will try many_iguana

[23-Aug-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes you need many_iguana branch

[23-Aug-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
