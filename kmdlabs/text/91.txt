Yes

[15-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Some of mine will b donated

[15-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will all be in my noratu proposal

[15-Nov-18 12:12 PM] gt#2812
labs seems like a good fit for people dipping their toe in testing/development. i‚Äôve learned a lot already

[15-Nov-18 12:12 PM] gt#2812
hope it can keep that spirit

[15-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its the place to be

[15-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Let change the world

[15-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just cuz we can

[15-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Anything is possible

[15-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just have the idea

[15-Nov-18 12:13 PM] gt#2812
chain the planet

[15-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When every thing is on a block chain do we need laws?

[15-Nov-18 12:14 PM] gt#2812
well probably less lawyers at least

[15-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why

[15-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Everything u do will be logged on an immutable ledger

[15-Nov-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No one can lie

[15-Nov-18 12:15 PM] gt#2812
so less people will be needed to interpret the ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù right?

[15-Nov-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... I see it as smks staked dog.. Means that any sensor with data is on the blockxhain should that sensor choose to use it

[15-Nov-18 12:23 PM] gt#2812
yep logged

[15-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Better than vlogged

_stopped STAKED4 when week 4 was over, so all he has are blocks that were in the snapshot_

[15-Nov-18 12:55 PM] jorian#4555
my node was at height 27000 something

[15-Nov-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not sure what I have, pretty sure I  stopped it that Saturday

[15-Nov-18 12:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I though you found something still running recently. Must have been someone else! Sorry :abusedsmily:

[15-Nov-18 01:22 PM] jorian#4555
what are you running as node? VPS 2 core 4 GB?

[15-Nov-18 01:34 PM] gt#2812
believe that‚Äôs what i got

[15-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian if you want to check your balance, I'll put a STAKED4 node up

[15-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED4 is what is being airdropped to main LABS chain

[15-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
there was 17k in contracts at the time of snapshot, so that either needs to be distributed fairly or burned

[15-Nov-18 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
don't need to, i just need to know what height the snapshot was

[15-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
7633

[15-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Alright#0419
17146.89653687 coins were in contracts

[15-Nov-18 02:51 PM] jorian#4555
oh. then i don't know how much i have üòõ

[15-Nov-18 02:51 PM] jorian#4555
my chain is 20,000 blocks longer

[15-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
want me to put explorer back up?

[15-Nov-18 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
I'll do `-stopat=7633` on it

[15-Nov-18 02:55 PM] jorian#4555
if it's easy, otherwise i'll let it surprise me

[15-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
Ah forgot I killed the VPS

[15-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
easiest way for you to check would be for me to put up a node with `-stopat`, you sync from it and import your keys

[15-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
then check balance

[15-Nov-18 04:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Modafinil if you need to do bursts

[15-Nov-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think i had some coins on the very very first STAKED chain

[15-Nov-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm, no it was called AT1

[15-Nov-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have AT1 data from Aug 10th-ish

[15-Nov-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i can't remember, was AT1/etc precursors to STAKED? I looked away and too much happened

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
POSTEST was

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
is there anything useful/salvageable in an old AT1 chain?

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe AT1 was related to cryptoconditions testing

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
AT chains started as asset testing chains

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
asset contract

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
then we were just using them for anything

[15-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok

[15-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Alright#0419
There were 2 POSTEST contests

[15-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Alright#0419
that's where the idea formed

[15-Nov-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, I have 0 ownership of STAKED/LABS, full disclosure. Looking to become a LABS notary for the fame, I guess

[15-Nov-18 11:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@polycryptoblog I've tried that shit it wasn't so good lol

[15-Nov-18 11:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I had a nootropic fascination awhile back in college that's how I found out about it.

[16-Nov-18 01:08 AM] gt#2812
is there a proper way to clean out kmd wallet notizations

[16-Nov-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a wallet reset script in the StakedNotary repo

[16-Nov-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it doesnt respect the branch settting... as all chains are on master at the moment though it will work.

Alpha brain makes Joe Rogan appear intelligent, so nootropics must have some value :trollface:

[17-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
just a little update, we have the basis for paying 10% of block rewards to a multisig address ready thanks to jl

[17-Nov-18 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
joker is trying to get a different method working so we wouldn't have a need for multisig address, but if we can't get that working relatively soon, we'll just launch with multisig implementation

Changed messenger RPC connection to defining by user on login page - remote servers now possible to use as well.
So no more hardcode needed  and in theory it's already possible to build an Android mobile prototype.
https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui/releases/tag/0.0.1 also made  kinda installation script which setup dependencies and creating launcher icon (tested on Ubuntu 18.04) - for easier and faster installation

Now working on messaging process testing/debugging, hope soon it'll be as smooth as scripts üòÉ 
+ some usability improvements like a RPC details caching for fast login, graphic part, Enter button handling and etc in progress

[17-Nov-18 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Very cool,Tony!!

[17-Nov-18 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @CrisF ! If you'll have some time we may try to chat on some chain

[17-Nov-18 10:49 AM] CrisF#3405
I still haven't installed the correct python and try setting up now.

you can spell kmdlabs with element symbols

[17-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
just throwing it out there, might not be pretty as it'd be 5 different elements

[17-Nov-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
they didnt spell all of breaking bad with elements either

La is used as a catalyst.  Like that idea.
