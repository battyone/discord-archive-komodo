I thought the idea was to make it work 🤔

[26-Aug-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have to break it first

[26-Aug-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's broken by design :troll_lol:

[26-Aug-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like iguan :troll: ❓

[26-Aug-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I could learn a 2nd language and type
"Diff walls are a horrible idea"
in that language
🤷🏽

[26-Aug-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.... I worked that out :abusedsmily:

@blackjok3r yea you fucked up a test I was doing a couple days ago 😛

[26-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
by mining it

[26-Aug-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry

[26-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
well not you specifically, but don't need to name names

[26-Aug-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had it mining... but I dont have any blocks it says.. but my balance is HUGE

[26-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
yea, about to start testing again, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is convinced of something, and I plan to prove him wrong :troll:

[26-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
those maths really are a problem for him

[26-Aug-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and I plan to prove him wrong`
because you've done that how many times when it comes to mining? :troll_lol:

[26-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
more than I can count

[26-Aug-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[26-Aug-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[26-Aug-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😗

[26-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
alright, yea, just fucking with you

[26-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
you could be correct, but I don't think you are

[26-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Alright#0419
you should explain your theory to @jl777c

[26-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 seriously explain it please because I don't see how it's possible

[26-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
maybe he will understand

[26-Aug-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no need to explain, after you're done dicking around I'll just write the pool and prove it 😛

[26-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
~15 minutes, I'll be ready

[26-Aug-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`diff wall + hash = diff wall`

[26-Aug-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
anyway, jl, he's convinced that this won't distribute mining rewards based on hashrate correctly. He thinks if one miner is mining with 90ksol and another is mining with 10ksol, the 90ksol miner will get *all* of the blocks

[26-Aug-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine ZEC with a GPU and let me know how that works out for you 👍🏽

[26-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
don't understand

[26-Aug-19 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
obviously you won't get blocks, but why is that any different with apow?

[26-Aug-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because that's the situation that apow creates
the diff is "artificially" inflated and before if can get into the range that a smaller miner is likely to find, the larger miner can find a string of blocks and yoyo it back up

[26-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Alright#0419
yes but at that high diff, the likelihood of finding a block is no different

[26-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Alright#0419
with 90% of hashrate, you should have 90% chance
with 10%, 10%

[26-Aug-19 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with 90% of hashrate, you should have 90% chance`
until you add something to the diff algo that manipulates away from a smooth diff transition

[26-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
ok...

[26-Aug-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imagine BTC diff is the same as ZEC diff and 3 seconds later it's the same as BTC diff currently is

[26-Aug-19 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
let's say you and I forked ZEC and were competing to find the next block. You have 9sols, I have 1sols. How are you not exactly 9x more likely to find a block first?

[26-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
you're saying you would be infinitely more likely to find a block first, which I do not understand

[26-Aug-19 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How are you not exactly 9x more likely to find a block first?`
because the diff "magically" jumps 200x outside of your general find range

[26-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
man what

[26-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
we're both solving for the same min diff

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll explain hashrate, diff1/target (for the 1200000000000th time) and "expected" finds to you after lunch

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
vague bullshit

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
😫

[26-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
you'll argue whatever the first thing you decide is

[26-Aug-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the diff, 9x the hashrate is expected to get 9x the blocks

[26-Aug-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you'll argue whatever the first thing you decide is`
unless proven wrong, yes
..... and when you figure out how to get 75% of binance's new "staking" reward away from its users, I change my position on the last one too

noticed same before sleep, fixed and mustve happened again for some reason. not sure why, will monitor. had it setup to respawn after 5 min if detected down 🤔

@blackjok3r - Network routes re-configured. still not ideal, but should allow incoming connections.

[27-Aug-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just stop it

[27-Aug-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
restart VPS if needed

[27-Aug-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that doesnt wqork. reclone supernet and komodo

[27-Aug-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure port 8222 is open. That seems to destroy your chances if its closed

[27-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Exile13#4458

I've reduced graph history from 24 to 12hrs to make it load a bit faster. Will implement better caching later when time is spare (at the moment, every load reads the oracle(s)).
