[26-May-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
comparing my staking stats from LABS to staking stats on OUR and ZEX is pretty funny

[26-May-19 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
it's very very clear that people actually know how to stake properly on LABS

[26-May-19 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I should hope so, we literally pioneered it on this platform 😛

[26-May-19 10:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it also helps that we're not competing against the weight of 100 gajillion premine

[26-May-19 10:32 AM] jorian#4555
yeah lol

[26-May-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
well.... it seems it's time for NH as no one is willing to sell 😂

[26-May-19 10:32 AM] jorian#4555
you should NH after 10080 right?

[26-May-19 10:33 AM] Alright#0419

[26-May-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
it's tempting honestly

[26-May-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
having a good amount now will lead to good amount staked in the future

where could I learn about PoS64 ? What is special about it ? 1 thing I've noticed so far is you got paid in coinbase for every notarizations

[26-May-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are separate things

[26-May-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

_wasn't trying to make a joke, but to point out that the payments in coinbase are unrelated to staking_

[26-May-19 10:43 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[26-May-19 01:16 PM] gt#2812
first and second are good logos imo

[26-May-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I think it looks good with the white, but :labs: any large than an emoji doesn't look so great IMO

[26-May-19 01:23 PM] CMaurice#1685
there is a unicode `Man Astronaut` for codepiction, Alembic for flask,  Rocket. Just noting

[26-May-19 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
holding up Agama integration for a logo is pretty freaking stupid though

[26-May-19 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
so let's just freaking pick one 😂

[26-May-19 01:25 PM] Alright#0419
I think the actual logo for :labs: is good, but the backround makes it look wonky if it's any bigger than an emoji
