thankfully pretty much the entire problem is contained to a single function lol. And it just had to be the hardest one to understand 😂

Good stuff!

[04-Mar-19 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the problem basically comes down to, if you go too fast with notarizations... then the range between each one, does not contain a MoM hash for the other chains. Thats it. So by making iguana skip a round of MoMoM is null... combined with using older notarizations, and a larger range... it just might work 🤞

fixing this seems actually quite easy if indeed it does work.

I've just gotten back and have a couple things to get done before starting on migrations.  Should I work on setting that up, or should I hold off?

[04-Mar-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
set it up but dont test it

[04-Mar-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I pushed some fixes to the script in PoS_Scripts repo for you last night

[04-Mar-19 08:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, thanks.

[04-Mar-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you test CFEK clustewr I will test LABS one... should have fix pushed out here in an hour or two unless i screwed it up .

[04-Mar-19 08:27 AM] CrisF#3405
OK.  Will it be ok if I send one or 2 to check if I've got the scripts set up right, or better to send nothing at all?

[04-Mar-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do them at the moment they are working... Its only when blocks stop being uniform when it all goes to shit.

[04-Mar-19 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Allright!  I'll get onto that shortly 😃

[04-Mar-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
messing with masterbranch right now, plese dont update anything 😃

[04-Mar-19 10:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Ooosp , I'm just in the process of updating.  Might have just finished.

[04-Mar-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this solution is reasonable... but while workign this out I thaught of something else lol... The MoM hash that is submitted could under a rare circumstance not actually be correct due to reorgs.. Really the entire thing needs to drop back 1 notarization. I have written some functions that will make this possible, but I will need help to get some others to be able to use that....

[04-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully we get close here and @dimxy  will be able to help with the last of it, as the C++  being sued there is beyond me at thsi point in time.

[04-Mar-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really should not be that hard to offset all MoM hash by 1 notarization.... Once this is done, then even under harsh attack things should be safe all the time.

[04-Mar-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok, looks like I have something here... Its only working for LAB cluster right now... but its working. 
I have a way for iguana to cancel a round if MoMoM is NULL.
And it now uses a range of 3 notarizations for each MoMoM hash, to stop rare condition of 2 notarization in the same block of KMD meaning there is no MoMoM range.  I dont think this will cause any issues, but we will need to test it.. I don't think that anything consensus related is changed, definatly as long as no notaries resync the chain we should be safe for the time being.  
The trick herre is to use notarized data, but chaging all this at once will be difficult.  So we need to start with simple things like this. If we can have overlapping MoMoM hashes and imports still work, then I think its totally possible to easily fix it. If overlapping MoMoM ahsh do not work, then welll... becomes a LOT harder.

@LabsAssistant  
Please `./stop.sh` `./start.sh` You can just do start.sh, but due to iguana being updated, your iguana TV will move the the terminal you run start.sh in.  Migrates may not be working on CFEK cluster with this fix, I'm not really sure. Just need to test overlapping MoMoM hash.

[04-Mar-19 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This fix will allow a chain to start but also never allow NULL MoMoM hash except the first 3 notarizations on the chain. From my testing, whenever an import failed, there was a NULL MoMoM hash on the target. This pevents this happening. So if it is gettin NULL for some exact reason, and it cannot be fixed just just skipping a notarization round. Notarizations will simply stop, hopefully allowing analysis of why its failing.

ok ! I understand now why when you ask to restart I often don't have any change in StakedNotary...

[04-Mar-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... without the start scripts, fetching everything automatically and building it... these constant testing updates would be very time consuming.

all chains can mine on the master branch?

[04-Mar-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think CFEK chains are only using some RPC diffrences ... I could merge them all. but Im messing with very low level stuff here, and dont want to break them. Its not consensus related as far as I can tell, as all the changed code is on a KMD RPC that iguana  and the migrate script uses.

[04-Mar-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Problem is that the 2 calls to this RPC return diffrent results sometimes... Need to force them to be equal under all circumstances, or fail so can be attempted later.

[04-Mar-19 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's only 2 RPCs that matter for mining :troll:

Yeah strangly, mine is still notarizing also... I have a feeling that with more chains in a cluster the MoMoM might be more reliable... Hopefully this fix is enough to get migrates working under perfect conditions wihtout slowing anything down. This was the goal... slowing it down only covers up the problem and means it could still happen, just less often.

Good morning.  I am looking for assistance with a stalled chain.  Theo suggested I reach out to someone in this channel.

[04-Mar-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure what chain is it? I assume PoS of some kind?

[04-Mar-19 02:13 PM] hypocalese#3688
PTX coin and its 50/50 pow/pos

I have 4 nodes and I normally mine it with one gpu.

[04-Mar-19 02:14 PM] hypocalese#3688
its been fine since Nov 17th.  But on Feb 27th it stalled.

[04-Mar-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats fine.... do you know how many utxos are being staked? Does it have any block reward? how are you staking it?

[04-Mar-19 02:15 PM] hypocalese#3688
I dont know exactly.  block reward is 15. node wallets are doing the staking.

[04-Mar-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS 64 is very touchy if not staked properly... technically it should never stop.... but if all the utxos are under 100 blocks old then none are elegible... It will take many mega sol to PoW it over the 100 blocks to unstick it.

[04-Mar-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can I have chain params to sync it? Maybe its something obvious...

[04-Mar-19 02:18 PM] hypocalese#3688

that transaction is just massive.... too many vins seems to overflow it somehow

[04-Mar-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
decoderawtransaction clearly says the vout is 200... so it must be inside the export tx in the OP_RETURN or something.... I think just limiting vins on export is the easiest fix.

[04-Mar-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weird it goes all the way to import stage to fail

[04-Mar-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
could have been right at the max txsize and then being included in import made it too big

[04-Mar-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I think something like a limit on vin size will be fine. Cant see anything obvious thats doing it, I think this was known about before, but I thaught it failed on creating the export tx
