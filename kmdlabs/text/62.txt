but those are each of the assetchains that KMD notaries notarize

[02-Nov-18 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
if you see that they have ac_cc= or ac_ccactivate= in their params, it means they have contracts activated

[02-Nov-18 07:43 AM] CrisF#3405
You can look at KMD itself.  It has many products coming from it (BarterDEX, JUMBLR, and all of the assetchains, etc.)  It is great example of what can be done.  And now CC is here!

[02-Nov-18 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
@emma if you're looking for something to get started with, I think oracles contract is a great place to start. You can push data on chain then have nodes do something based on that data. I wrote the proof of concept for the chat dapp in a few days. It's one of the simplest examples possible.

[02-Nov-18 07:48 AM] emma#2653
you are using shell script because there is no wrapper to interact with the chain.. correct?

[02-Nov-18 07:48 AM] Alright#0419
Was using a shell script because I was just trying to show that it worked, and that was the quickest way to do it

[02-Nov-18 07:48 AM] Alright#0419
if you look at master branch of trollbox repo, it's all in python

[02-Nov-18 07:49 AM] emma#2653
cool ..

[02-Nov-18 11:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`update detected`

[02-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
If anyone is available atm, we're starting the iguana network

[02-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
chains are already running, just pushed a new assetchains.json

[02-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
testing it all on a fresh VPS, will you let guys know how it does

[02-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator where's that print from?

[02-Nov-18 11:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just ran ./start and noticed the assechains.json

[02-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
just kill the notary for now please

[02-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
we're scraping all those chains

[02-Nov-18 11:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that was on the pool, so not notarisaing. I assume both need to be stopped

[02-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
yes, can take down anything you have for the previous chains

[02-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
we're moving entirely to CFEK chains for "production" testnet

[02-Nov-18 11:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
delete everything, clone, install, start?

[02-Nov-18 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
yep, giving it a go myself first if you just want to wait a few minutes

[02-Nov-18 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
feel free to try it though

[02-Nov-18 11:17 AM] gcharang#6833
can you add me in the notary's list: gcharang: 024ce12f3423345350d8535e402803da30abee3c2941840b5002bf05e88b7f6e2d

[02-Nov-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will get lost here

[02-Nov-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will do an era change and include everyone who wants a slpot in a few days

[02-Nov-18 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
Do you want to get a notary up now @gcharang ?

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
I have my test pubkeys in the source code still, you can use one for the time being

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
they'll be removed prior to launch for mainnet

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] gcharang#6833
OK. won't my node need it's wif for notarizing?

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
you can do that or wait until we do an era change

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
I'd give you the privkey of it

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] gcharang#6833
Ok

[02-Nov-18 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
if you wait until era change, that would be helpful

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
we'll need some new notaries to test that it works properly

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] gcharang#6833
I just want to get some experience before mainnet

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
Ah actually, can you use one of my test keys, then we'll remove it at era change?

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
that's a good test

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do you still reference oracle for assetchains.json?

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
not atm

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] gcharang#6833
>Ah actually, can you use one of my test keys, then we'll remove it at era change?
sure

[02-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
using git, haven't made the oracle of CFEK yet

[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
there's some work to be done there

[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cos that would offer `update detected` capability ðŸ˜‰

[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
what?

[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
I'd recommend you start building your nodes if you want to participate right now

[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
building all the branches will take a few minutes

[02-Nov-18 11:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cron the oracle, if assetchains changed:  ./start.sh

[02-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
yep, that's the plan

[02-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
we need some way to bootstrap the assetchains.json prior to running the notary though

[02-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
I will work on that soon

[02-Nov-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once we have a permenant chain ... it should be ok ... Can have a webserver server hte file right off chain as backup, or unless chain gets too big for someone they ahev that ption.

[02-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
I need some notary IPs to act of seed nodes for the iguana network

[02-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
your IP will be in staked.json

[02-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
any volunteers?

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
lol need at least one besides myself

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r ?

103.6.12.112

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
I need to keep those dupes in staked.json, right?

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will be a seed and notary for the whole time, mostly likely on mainnet aswell

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
what was the reason behind that again?

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has to have exactly 8

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or iguana with crash

[02-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 11:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pool's up btw -  http://pool.cryptocartography.io/

[02-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I love how fast that was ðŸ˜„

[02-Nov-18 11:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
managed to get that up without the "delete" part ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Nov-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start 5 blockchains ... 5 mins later pool ups

[02-Nov-18 11:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure why, but only 4 are on pool. It filters out ac_perc and ac_private, but cant see any of that in assetchains.json

[02-Nov-18 11:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no biggie, can migrate. might start next time.

[02-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
