gotta get ready for day slavery, will test more on return

[12-Nov-18 11:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
at a glance it seems just as it was before

I will check KMF sync as we never tested that it could be broken. I got a pretty good idea of what it is so don't worry too much. Thanks is for testing that, we been using bootstrap every time or already synced chains. This latest build has about a thousand merges init and I cant test everything ony own

[13-Nov-18 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ac perc will work with that option and ac private needs something from webs upstream you would need to ask him how eyo use or in #pirate @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[13-Nov-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  @Mylo  its only a very recent problem, I synced it a few dyas ago... master branch is not really mast erbranch here, it has everything merged in to it... Everyone using it is a tester, thanks for testing it and reporting issues, I have no doubt what so ever that it has more. Ther merge of FSM into staked had about 100 conflicts and I am sure I didnt get them all right first attempt.

I guess everybody just were scared of vice versa migration (from staked to jl777 or komodoplatform repos)

[13-Nov-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothig gets merged up to it gfrom thsi repo, everything that goes to KMD comes from my blackjok3r fork...

[13-Nov-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also alright made me change something in the code, and I am pretty sure its incorrect... which would be what is causing this exact problem I am pretty sure ... I am currently testing this for james, so it can be fixed upstream and merged down to us. Will be done today. Will let you know when I have fixed the KMD sync issue.

I think I found the problem, its definatly the +1sat thing .... I acidentally did it backwards I think

[13-Nov-18 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just reversed it and starta KMD sync

[13-Nov-18 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I think it will work, just reconsiderblock on the last block you had after starting

[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no need to resync or reindex from scratch

[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resonsiderblock with the block hash, so getblockhash <lastblock>

[13-Nov-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then reconsiderblock <blockhash>

[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I think it's better to do from scratch - just to be sure that everything is smooth

[13-Nov-18 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can if you want but I am already doing that

I think its in mastertest sorry

[13-Nov-18 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Should I checkout to `mastertest` branch to test?

that should be what we are testing... just not notaries yet

[13-Nov-18 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
theres a LOT to test

[13-Nov-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD also needs the +1 sats exemption?

[13-Nov-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so ...

[13-Nov-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I add the +1 exemption only for the 5 chains

[13-Nov-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will confirm KMD in a few more hours, I accidentally delete my local chain copy, so have to sync over internet and its taking a while.

[13-Nov-18 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r After building from `mastertest` and `getblockhash -> reconsiderblock` synchronisation continued

[13-Nov-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great I am pretty sure it was the same issue then ... I made a mistake int the exception ... it was meant to be == 0 not != 0

[13-Nov-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will leave it for now, until james adds the expetion to KMD then merge his fix down to mastertest.

[13-Nov-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once a copule more things are tested I will merge mastertest to master and we can try to add some more chains to cluster and get some more notary nodes into the testnet, pubkey/era change.

waiting for PR from @Alright

[13-Nov-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok .. its a little harder than just starting it for us ... needs exeptions in the is_STAKED function...

[13-Nov-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your adding it to KMD notaries I wont do it.

[13-Nov-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810

What is +1 exemption in one sentence?

[13-Nov-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
extra satoshi in txfee calcs

[13-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
the line of code that checked the block reward had blockreward+1 because of rewards rounding on KMD

[13-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
i realized that and mined an extra sat in blocks on some asset chains, so these chains needed exceptions when the +1 was removed

[13-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
again, sorry about that jl üòì

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator feel free to submit it even though it's not ready. I'll have some way to request updates. I think the whole database should be public info (so don't send anything you don't want to become semi public)

staked_proposals pad leads to a 502 error

[14-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Alright#0419
Yea, thanks we're aware. Wasn't meant to be a permanent solution to begin with

[14-Nov-18 07:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok. At last I could rent the server I was looking at, and I was looking for a "how to start"

[14-Nov-18 07:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is it still ubuntu 16.04 the recommended OS?

[14-Nov-18 07:16 PM] CMaurice#1685
works well for me

[14-Nov-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
16.04 or 18.04

[14-Nov-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
should start moving towards 18.04

[14-Nov-18 07:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
OK. I'm going to install 18.04. Is there a howto start? I think I have seen one here a few days ago

[14-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
you're looking to run a notary?

[14-Nov-18 07:25 PM] Alright#0419
if so, please send a pubkey and corresponding address to stakedchain@protonmail.com

[14-Nov-18 07:25 PM] Alright#0419
along with good way to contract you

[14-Nov-18 07:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
Yes / What do you mean by "pubkey"?

[14-Nov-18 07:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
GPG?

[14-Nov-18 07:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
You said nooks could run notaries üòâ

[14-Nov-18 07:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm not pure noob üòâ

[14-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
do `komodo-cli -ac_name=<whatever> validateaddress <an address you own>`

[14-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
will give you pubkey

[14-Nov-18 07:35 PM] zatJUM#9924
I thought it was gpg pubkey

[14-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
if you aren't familiar with a linux shell(or willing to learn), wouldn't recommend running a notary

[14-Nov-18 07:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
yes I'm familiar with linux (I use debian)

[14-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
üëç

[14-Nov-18 07:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
So you need a  pubkey of whatever assetchain I can run?

[14-Nov-18 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
it will be the same on any asset chain

[14-Nov-18 07:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is it linked to wallet.dat?

[14-Nov-18 07:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
I presume not

[14-Nov-18 07:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
If it's the same for different assetchain

[14-Nov-18 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
just use cli on any asset chain to create a new address, do validateaddress to get the pubkey and dumpprivkey to get the private key

[14-Nov-18 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
then send pubkey and address to stakedchain@protonmail.com

[14-Nov-18 07:41 PM] Alright#0419
we'll add you next era change, and you'll use that address to set up your notary

[14-Nov-18 07:49 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
@webworker01 @CrisF @jorian @TonyL @Deleted User @CHMEX @Bar_F1sh_Rel @jusoaresf @Mylo @kmdkrazy Please confirm you still own the address you have here
