you understand the difference between a miner and a NN? Notary Node doesn't have to be mining to be able to do notarizations

[05-Dec-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@jorian yes, I understand the difference
I do not, apparently understand how the mere existence of a tx that can be ignored stops an attack

simple way to own the chain: don't process the mempool

[05-Dec-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
so we have a tx that may or may not be in the mempool, which we can ignore (who ignores that? NN?) and that stops an attack?

[05-Dec-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
i have trouble understanding you apparently 游땥

[05-Dec-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
maybe i missed a part of the convo. if so, ignore me

[05-Dec-18 07:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
no NNs are blocking
my miner is creating all of the blocks
I can just ignore the mempool (the "notarization transactions") and bypass all notarization
I own the chain 100%

[05-Dec-18 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
no i still have no idea what you're talking about

[05-Dec-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a miner with 100% of blocks, then yes

[05-Dec-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not a healthy chain situation

[05-Dec-18 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm just some rando non-NN
I cloned the https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo.git repo
I built the daemon
I ran the daemon
I setgenerate true 11
I mined 30 blocks in a row
I own the chain
I can ignore "notarizations" that are just some NN tx

the only reason I stopped @ 30 is because it's a 51/49 chain and I lack hash

[05-Dec-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if notarizations are not being mined, then there wont be any notarizations seen by the nodes

[05-Dec-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a degenerate condition of a 100% attack

[05-Dec-18 10:31 PM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator The logo looks good.  I haven't received the final files yet.  Will send to you when I get them.  They'll go up on the website for dl also.

Hey...

Smart folks...

[06-Dec-18 12:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Decentralized trustless zSPV?
Is that even possible?  Masternode zSPV plan?

[06-Dec-18 12:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Notary Node zSPV checkpoints?

[06-Dec-18 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Can't have a trustless central server can we?  
游뱂

[06-Dec-18 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I hope I am thinking outside the box. 
Radix brought up this challenge when discussing a zSPV / Electurm for Pirate.  
That the server itself could be considered a trusted point of attack/weakness.

[06-Dec-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 by default the notarisation s are set at the highest priority unless a bug is happening, which is why there is a print of the tx hash it thinks is a notarisation, as far as I am aware its right. And yes if a chain is stalled dead and you mine it with empty blocks you can attack of, but if a chain is dead and stalled I don't think its of any value anyway lol.

[06-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sPV is trustless

[06-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I am aware all if does is broadcast the tx

[06-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The tx is signed locally

[06-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So u make the tx

[06-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then sendnit with a whole bunch of servers if only 1 of them is working and on the right chain the tx is sent

[06-Dec-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The tx can't be changes, just not sent

[06-Dec-18 12:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok...

[06-Dec-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Usual wait for a notarisation would apply

[06-Dec-18 12:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So as an electurm server...

[06-Dec-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then its considered aent

[06-Dec-18 12:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This is obv a diff conversation than I am asking about. 游땥

[06-Dec-18 12:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I edited my above post.  Hopefully someone understands what I am asking.

[06-Dec-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think k you can do things where a full node can just use normal peers to fetch info without using a "server"

[06-Dec-18 12:19 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`by default the notarisation s are set at the highest priority unless a bug is happening, which is why there is a print of the tx hash it thinks is a notarisation, as far as I am aware its right`
OK, so what stops me from:
seeing the mempool
waiting for a "notarization transaction"
ignoring that tx
mining on
spending
confirming the spend while ignoring the rest of the mempool
rewinding to the correct block the  "notarization transaction" *should be in*
making a new block
and then mining a new chain with a ds in it
?

[06-Dec-18 12:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Without downloading the whole chain... But I'm not 100% on that exactly.

[06-Dec-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisation isn't valid and a checkpoint hasn't been made, until the notarisation s is confirmed, you would indeed to mine all the blocks for over an hour ignoring it while also stopping someone else mineing it, to make it expire and be orphaned.

[06-Dec-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also while u were doing this

[06-Dec-18 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No notarisation s would be happenong

[06-Dec-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So no one should be considering their tx confirmed and would wait until u arop doing it

[06-Dec-18 12:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`...you would indeed to mine all the blocks for over an hour...`
I've mined the only blocks in 6 hrs+

[06-Dec-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then consider their tx conformed after u stopped and u gained nothing

[06-Dec-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then none else is minor ng that chain that ever chain it is

[06-Dec-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because they haven't checked their miners after yesterday's devacle

[06-Dec-18 12:23 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
my nn is fully updated and doing nothing with that chain

[06-Dec-18 12:23 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_is so cornfuzzed_

[06-Dec-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A 100% attack is a 100% attack wearher u have notaries or not... I think a 100% attack is going to break a chain

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What chain is it

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Early on I had enough notaries myself to check these things

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But with just 1 I can't really so anuthing

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely it stalled

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And nodes are out of utxo

[06-Dec-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At a giess

[06-Dec-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or they have forked some now

[06-Dec-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This happens when we hard fork ahit with no jotoce and ppl are not around

[06-Dec-18 12:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it stalled because I have no stake weight and not enough hash with 1 CPU to pass 52%

[06-Dec-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So who ever was staking it atopped

[06-Dec-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That wasn't me

[06-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I will try to stake it later on

[06-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have coins from airdrop

[06-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That should be mature

[06-Dec-18 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
either way, I'm still seeing the daemon believing that a notarization took place just because of a non-coinbase tx existing as a bad philosophy

[06-Dec-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm very lost as to how that is the case can u please post the tx hash of that, there is 3 different pieces of code that determine a tx is a notarisation, one of them is just the mier and could have bugs, its not important at all, it just sets priority, the other 2 need to be right however

[06-Dec-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
scroll back and I posted what I see as a user (which is also what any exchange would see)

[06-Dec-18 12:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the daemon literally prints that the blocks are, in fact, "VALID" and "NOTARIZED"

[06-Dec-18 12:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and the explorer followed all of that chain (so any exchange would too)

[06-Dec-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK I will.check it shortly... I think you might be confusing the block that the notarization was included in with the block that is notarised, they are NEVER the same block.

[06-Dec-18 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
imo, no block was "notarized" as no NN mined any blocks
the problem is that the stdout __says__ that it is
now, that may mean that it's recorded on the next higher chain
but, atm there's nothing stopping a rando miner from doing a ds on CFEKLAMEDUCKS (short of his being too busy to finish a proper non-CPU miner and being throttled by the fact that it's a PoS/PoW chain and 1 CPU will not pass the PoW diff)

[06-Dec-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
NN dont mine any blocks ...

[06-Dec-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or at least they should not be

[06-Dec-18 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then what stops a ds?

[06-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisations is a transaction

[06-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Upon a block being received

[06-Dec-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the daemon scans the transactions

[06-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and looks for a vaild notarisaiton

[06-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it finds one.

[06-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a checkpoint is made for the block that notaristion transaction was made for

[06-Dec-18 01:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the is NEVER the block the tx is included in, as the notarisiaion tx is made with a block hash of a confirmed block.

[06-Dec-18 01:15 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
OK, so lets say I mine block 1234
block 1235 "should" contain the the "notarization tx"
What stops me from:
mining 1235-1335 while ignoring the mempool
spending somewhere in that
rolling my miner back to 1235
adding the  "notarization tx" into 1235
and then respending in 1236
?

[06-Dec-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once the notarisation tx is confirmed... the chechpoint is made... even if the block containing the tx has bee nreorgd

[06-Dec-18 01:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but it's not confirmed if I refuse to put it into the block

[06-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you are preforming a 100% attack ... and nobody should be making any txs

[06-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until you run out of money

[06-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
游뱡

[06-Dec-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is why we are making every chain somehwer PoS

[06-Dec-18 01:18 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`until you run out of money`
given that I can ds every 4 blocks, I'll never run out of money

[06-Dec-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so that there is a stake holder mining at least some blocks... and all notaisions are MAXIUM pritoryt (unless htis is not working)_ so a miner trying to do what you describ can only do so until the staker gets a single block, then the chain is notarised

[06-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant double spend because confrimations wont progress past 1 untilk a notarisaion has occured

[06-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone waits 2 confirms

[06-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your just wasting money

[06-Dec-18 01:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
delaying the persons tx

[06-Dec-18 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dos that make sense ... you can try to reorg every 4 blocks... but what doe sthat even do ?

[06-Dec-18 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`Dos that make sense ... you can try to reorg every 4 blocks... but what doe sthat even do ?`
you're missing what I'm saying
I can run 100 blocks (assuming I have the hash) ignoring the notarization
do a spend in the middle
roll the chain back
add the notarization
wait 4 blocks
repeat

[06-Dec-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notarisaion contains a block hash

[06-Dec-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you change the chain
