Will the code be moved up an ERA before the chain launch?
Just asking - as @Alright is suggesting that new notaries are kicked if they have no notifications before release, but I don't think new pubkey/notaries are actually active in the code yet?

[15-Nov-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No they are not active

[15-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to get the 10% block reward to multi sig address working... then we will add  a new chain and chjange the ERA to 2. üòÉ Everyone will have at least a day to get their testnet up to notarise this chain.

[15-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the first 20 people to notarise this chain, get a main net spot..

[15-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this tests a whole bunch of stuff at once.

[15-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and decides who can notarise in KMDLABS era 1 main net

@gt @actionslacks  Thanks for the suggestions.  Looks like it'll be `KMDLABS`.
@CMaurice Liked the nursery idea.  Was wondering about a space kind of theme.  Chains and clusters would be easy to name, eh! `Coma cluster`

[15-Nov-18 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User you could just poll and look at every new block. Once you see confirms=2 for a xtn in that block, you know that block is notarized (as long as you are running new enough code to have dpowconfs)

Do I need to notarise something prior next week to not lose my pubkey in list or I can wait for a next chain?

[15-Nov-18 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm honestly tried to setup node this week but had issues üòÇ

[15-Nov-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everyone needs to notaries the new chain with the pay to multisig address enabled

[15-Nov-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The first 20 people to notaries that chain on era 2 get a spot

[15-Nov-18 11:30 AM] TonyL#3577
New chain = next week?

[15-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I must travel... For a few days, its unlikely the new chain. will be ready before half way through next week

[15-Nov-18 11:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Gotcha üëç

[15-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How ever it goes... There will be a 48h notice before it is launched, because some of you wage cuck and all

[15-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully none of us have to do that anymore

[15-Nov-18 11:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, Friday  or Saturday would be good üòâ

[15-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree a weekend is better

[15-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Gives me a week to get it done .. Less stress

[15-Nov-18 11:33 AM] CrisF#3405
The old 1am Tuesday morning STAKED starts really affected the week!

I remember when you set very tight deadline for a first staked and were rekt by it

[15-Nov-18 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a no sleep

[15-Nov-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We gave them up after staked 4 me and alright almost lost our minds

[15-Nov-18 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405
That was really good, but rough, PoC for a specific kind of contract testing.

[15-Nov-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideally I'd like to pay to contract br on launch but simple can't be done.. Unless miracle

[15-Nov-18 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Was the trouble you had related to syncing KMD, @TonyL ?

[15-Nov-18 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup this one

[15-Nov-18 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So if there will be a next chain anyway I'll just go in on it üòÉ

Just get ADHD

[15-Nov-18 11:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha

[15-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And don't take medications

[15-Nov-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Easy solved

[15-Nov-18 11:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Or take too much

[15-Nov-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Never again

[15-Nov-18 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess amphetamine can do a trick

[15-Nov-18 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
But better to not try

[15-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not worth it it kills ppl

[15-Nov-18 11:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Drugs are bad and killing yep

[15-Nov-18 11:48 AM] TonyL#3577
But ADHD medications should be a kinda drugs as well I thnk

[15-Nov-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One of my best mates got shot dead by TRg police last year just b4 I found kmd... If that didn't happen... If not be here

Let's make a system that rewards effort

[15-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone who can use their skills in any way is welcome

[15-Nov-18 11:54 AM] CrisF#3405
I figure rewarding both effort and results is good.  Effort --> Improvement -> Results (Theoretically)

[15-Nov-18 11:55 AM] CrisF#3405
That should bring up the bottom who can still proffit and still incentivized the top.

[15-Nov-18 11:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Measuring results is much easier than effort though.

[15-Nov-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Results are all you can measure

[15-Nov-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But effort =+ results

[15-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jorian#4555
is anyone still running STAKED4?

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Somewhere in this equitation should be a `skills` multiplier

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jorian#4555
and is STAKED4 valuable?

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jorian#4555
I  have some balance there

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked 4 + 17k coins is airdropped to staked

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
350k in total I tji k

[15-Nov-18 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405

Please confirm with @Alright and Blackjok3r, but I believe it was said that STAKED4 would be the one airdropped to the new chain.
