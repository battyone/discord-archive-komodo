does this message in stdout mean I have to literally do what it says?
`[CFEKHOUND] notary pay fund is empty, need to send coins to: REDVp3ox1pbcWYCzySadfHhk8UU3HM4k5x`

[20-Apr-19 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Give it a try.

[20-Apr-19 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
why are these stdout messages always so cryptic?

You tipped @blackjok3r **10 KMD**

[20-Apr-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
I don't have any coins for DRAGON&HOUND yet, smk762.  Should they have arrived yet?

[20-Apr-19 11:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I thought so 🤷

[20-Apr-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @gt  did your `DRAGON` & `HOUND` come through?

[20-Apr-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I'm there.

[20-Apr-19 11:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just sent more. last send was on node mining with only 2 online so might've forked it

[20-Apr-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, sorry.

[20-Apr-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
`getbalance` is showing them.  I was looking at stats.

[20-Apr-19 11:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all good, got enough to go around. will send more to whoever is testing migrates later

[20-Apr-19 11:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
what fun things are being poked now a days?

[20-Apr-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hey. We are headingh near launch hopefully if the next round of testing goes well. Cross chain coin imports are or should be working, we can also migrate tokens. Although I myself am yet to test this.

[20-Apr-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of developed a few CCs on LABS wihtout even launching it lol

[20-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810

What is the cross chain NFT?

[20-Apr-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
non fungible tokens migrate. That should be working. I will test this myself whne I add it to the migrate script

[20-Apr-19 12:56 PM] CrisF#3405

OK, because I'm retarded and it's been a long month....
do we have a pubkey list?

[20-Apr-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. `notaries_staked.h`

[20-Apr-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we are reset to era1

[20-Apr-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so the top grouping is the one we're using? need to make sure I'm using the right wallet 😛

[20-Apr-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes the top one

Yeah, long couple of weeks.

[20-Apr-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed

[20-Apr-19 01:13 PM] CrisF#3405
Been productive.
Figuring out RAID now.

[20-Apr-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol iI was thinking of wiping my entire server and removing that so I had more space 😄

[20-Apr-19 01:14 PM] CrisF#3405
What level are you using atm?

[20-Apr-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1

[20-Apr-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure but from what Ive been told, 0 doesnt help random read writes... and 1 is only faster when reading large files... both of which I dont think help with a ntoary node that much.

[20-Apr-19 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I was thinking to go 0.

[20-Apr-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said RAID1, means if a drive fails, you just hot swap it and server keeps going.

[20-Apr-19 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Have a larger disk for backup.

[20-Apr-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
down side is you ahve half the space

[20-Apr-19 01:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm... I have space to do either.  So thought to go for speed.

[20-Apr-19 01:17 PM] CrisF#3405
But if no dif...

[20-Apr-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well maybe more research is required tbh. When I built my node my partner told me RAID1 was faster at random reads, but ive since been told diffrent things. Generally RAID0 is faster, but not always. notary nodes are random reads mostly.

[20-Apr-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
write speeds isnt that important, as are copying large files...

[20-Apr-19 01:21 PM] CrisF#3405
I have 4 disks so could also do 10.

[20-Apr-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess that woud be optimal 😄

[20-Apr-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Was looking at ways to add nvme's to pic-e cards to my server.... but I think really the gain isnt going to be worth it. Guess I can use them in a new server though. SATA SSD definatly slows my node down, since getting the nvmes at home the diffrence i night and day really... but that may have more to do with pic-e controller being on CPU.

[20-Apr-19 01:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I've got a 970 hear waiting for the kickstarter computer to arrive.  Ordered in July and still hasn't shown up, haha.

[20-Apr-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
used 2x970 1TBs in this computer... one has the host OS the other all the VMs ... crazy fast stuff..

[20-Apr-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
waiting lsit to ge them, was nearly a month

[20-Apr-19 01:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Keen to try out nvme.

[20-Apr-19 01:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Getting addicted to speed.  My old laptop took a day to build komodo, haha.

[20-Apr-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... yeah. Its a bit liike that.

[20-Apr-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
It would be very hard to go back to that.

[20-Apr-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah hey. I get so ammoyed with my server now. When I got it I thaught it was crazy fast.... 10mins to load KMD daemon vs 2min on this PC ... crazy

[20-Apr-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
4 CPUs vs 1 🤣

[20-Apr-19 01:29 PM] CrisF#3405
You might have a hard time going back from the EU server.

[20-Apr-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181

lol with rescan from height we can probably change that to only scan say the last 50k blocks pretty safely?

[20-Apr-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that would be good if it had the last 50k blocks :troll:

[20-Apr-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this server is a while behind and still had my 1st addy in it

[20-Apr-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think most of us now are at the point where the totally automated scripts can amost be tossed tbh.

[20-Apr-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well not tossed, but maybe mor optional or something

start.sh doesnt work until reclone and rebuild manyallt first

[20-Apr-19 02:03 PM] CrisF#3405
I had an error, but it worked first go after rebuilding komodo.

[20-Apr-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is that I had to undo 3 months of commits then force push it to master... .that breaks github btw 😉

[20-Apr-19 02:04 PM] CrisF#3405
It worked out well.

[20-Apr-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
went fairly smoothly, if you delete and reclone komodo first
