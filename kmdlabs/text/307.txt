one way fungiblity is just imports without exports or exports without imports

[21-Feb-19 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
essentially just burning coins to get another coin

[21-Feb-19 02:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Yeah i was thinking maybe force return migrate attempts to be burnt.

[21-Feb-19 02:44 PM] Alright#0419
what use case do you imagine for this @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[21-Feb-19 02:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Heh, still figuring that out. Picture it kind of like arcade tokens for gaming. You migrate in to play, but there's no cashing out like poker chips.

[21-Feb-19 02:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
To make it even more difficult, maybe have a value chain, migrates to whatever game chain. Game chains can migrate to each other but not back to the value chain

[21-Feb-19 02:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Its barely an idea yet, and quite possibly pointless but curious if it could be done

[21-Feb-19 02:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
With existing contracts

[21-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
yes that would make sense for things like rogue

[21-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
but it is just burning coins basically

[21-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
would make sense if the arcade is walking away with the cash 游땥

[21-Feb-19 03:02 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well, value is on the "value chain", so they are effectively burnt as soon as they migrate into the games room. They offer use for whatever gaming purpose, but cant be redeemed to the value chain.
So basically if the value chain creator does a greedy pre-mine, they can charge entry to the games room.

[21-Feb-19 03:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still not convinced its not a stupid idea tho

[21-Feb-19 03:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
limiting user functionality seems a bad idea unless there's a valid reason

[21-Feb-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
it is a good idea, but I don't see why it should just be a money hole

[21-Feb-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
the coins could do something useful

[21-Feb-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not a fan of burning coins for it basically

[21-Feb-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
it does sound like it could work well though

[21-Feb-19 03:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which ones? The value chain's use is standard, either trade for kmd/fiat or buy fun tokens. Once you buy fun tokens, you can only play.

[21-Feb-19 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[21-Feb-19 03:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the more popular games are, the less value coins in supply = greater value

[21-Feb-19 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
are you burning coins to receive fun coins or just buying them from the chain creator?

[21-Feb-19 03:10 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
both? still bubbling this thought. chain creator could monopolise, though it seems greedy. But yeah, as soon as you buy fun coins, they exit the value supply

[21-Feb-19 03:10 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
dont put too much thought into it, I havent done that myself yet 游땏

[21-Feb-19 03:11 PM] Alright#0419
I was thinking how we might do a labs rogue chain, but I'm not sure how we would fund the coinbase txs to the CC address

[21-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
hmmm I just had an interesting idea, no idea if it would be practical to implement

[21-Feb-19 03:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically like when I first played with dice, tokens were basically locked into the contract unless you won it back. Something like this could mean whoever setup the gaming table could get paid for what goes onto the table before it goes onto the table.

[21-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
but what if LABS chain could have emissions, but the fungibility rate with the main chain is based on coins transferred to it/ coins emitted

[21-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
does that make sense?

[21-Feb-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
the longer you keep your coins on a chain with high emission, the less you can export back to main chain

[21-Feb-19 03:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
user that wins at table gets to play more, but thats about it

[21-Feb-19 03:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
means games have to be worth playing, not just for the hope of a jackpot

[21-Feb-19 03:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe, less heat from regulatory jackboots?

[21-Feb-19 03:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah to emmision thing is similar (or the inverse) to my half formed thoughts. basically  as fun tokens are purchased, supply goes down. So exchange value goes up in terms of fun token exchange rate

[21-Feb-19 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
for example let's say a fungible chain is created with 1 LABS per block. After 1000 blocks, the emission of this chain is 1000 LABS. If 10000 LABS are transferred to this chain, the most that can be exported back to mainchain is 10000. This means that exporting 1000 of this chain back to the main chain would result in ~909 coins coming back to the main chain

[21-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Alright#0419
so (total coins transferred / total coins on chain) would be the fungibility rate

[21-Feb-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
I guess it's not "fungible" at that point

[21-Feb-19 03:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
interesting economic experiment anyways

[21-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
basically, if a chain requires a block reward, you pay for it if you hold coins on this chain

[21-Feb-19 03:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it this like negative interest rates? Promoting spending, not saving

[21-Feb-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean

[21-Feb-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
if you see a chain with a high block reward and it's not worth transferring coins to it to use, don't.

[21-Feb-19 03:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
disincentivise holding, incetivise gameplay.

[21-Feb-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
but it would enable something like rogue to work which requires emissions

[21-Feb-19 03:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my mind is mud right now, been a pretty hectic week. not sure I'm even making sense to myself right now

[21-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
you would definitely not want to hold coins on one of these chains

[21-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
you're basically directly competing with other people holding coins on it for the emissions

[21-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
if you contribute 1 coin to the emissions, you should be trying to get back 1.1 at the loss of someone else

Hi,
Is notarization working for my CFEKDIMXY1 chain?
I'm receiving 'backnotarization not yet confirmed' for some time

[21-Feb-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@dimxy from what I see it is

[21-Feb-19 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

No I added IP bits back not min SIG's should be 6 which means they might be a but slower until everyone has updated. @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  I would say u need to replace your IP in peer IPS anyway even with ipbits its unreliable in the past

it wont be 'as good' but it mightbe close... I dont think labs has any Asian nodes ... which will slow both of us down signifcantly.
