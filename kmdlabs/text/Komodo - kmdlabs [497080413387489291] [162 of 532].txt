Been about 3 hours on LF, but ED happened in last 10 mins.

[16-Dec-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That means that `kmd_7776` is wrong ... or you iguana is not updated to latest ...

[16-Dec-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but if others are working then.... those 2 things cant be the reason

[16-Dec-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we might need to change iguana port to isolate this, ike we had to on mainnet ... as just 1 node that is on the old verison will prevent notarisations from happening.

[16-Dec-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to avoid making ppl update again though...

[16-Dec-18 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least until I finish these code changes... we need to get to a stable version for launch.

[16-Dec-18 05:49 AM] CrisF#3405
It was notarizing CFEK yesterday.  Last notarization just over 11 hours ago.

[16-Dec-18 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems maybe thats whne the chain must have stalled ...

[16-Dec-18 05:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Shall I `./stop.sh` `./start.sh`?

[16-Dec-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might help ... but if the others are working ... I wouldnt worry about it

[16-Dec-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as I setgenerate true 0 here CFEK just lcoks up instantly

[16-Dec-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to have to mess with this code rebase ad get it pushed.

juts leave it for  now... if the others are working there is no isssue..

[16-Dec-18 05:53 AM] CrisF#3405

[16-Dec-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks about right ... we have nodes that didnt update so 50% or maybe even 70% of noatisations fail.

[16-Dec-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Good news is I juts have to test KMD sync on this latest version and then remove some prints that we no longer need, and hopefully we are up to a final stable release... provided that is that the staker doesnt lock up the demon now.

[16-Dec-18 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as soon as I setgenerate true 0 here CFEK just lcoks up instantly`
as soon as I setgenerate true 0 here CFEK just mines a shitload of blocks

[16-Dec-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All of my nodes just kept mining invlaid blcoks... once I setgenerate true 8 on a fast computer and it mined 1 block

[16-Dec-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain started to race

[16-Dec-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
AndI dont think its actually lcoking up

[16-Dec-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its while the staking loop is running as the code for that lives in `rpcwallet.cpp`

[16-Dec-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope it seems my staker is trying to stak blocks from utxos that dont exist ... despite using a fresh sync. 🤷

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`TX Does Not Exist: 1d4e8c3f78167f69ee7123d4e6a37c4cf81d1e6518d773eeb4ae5a4b97c94710
Erased 1d4e8c3f78167f69ee7123d4e6a37c4cf81d1e6518d773eeb4ae5a4b97c94710 from wallet.`
Was that a fork or is it not getting notarized?

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that code will be removed in the next update

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what it does is on block reorg

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it scans the entrire wallet for ophaned txs

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and removes them

[16-Dec-18 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was to try and stop the wallet getting corrupted ... but it doesnt work

[16-Dec-18 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm seeing almost 200 blocks since last notarization, here on my mining node

[16-Dec-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... until 100% of nodes update notarisations will not work very well at all

[16-Dec-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its imperative we nede to fix it we can change port... but I dont want ot annoy everyone again for a testnet

[16-Dec-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are major issues happening atm ... that I need to work on

[16-Dec-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this issue of mine, seems to be that once the ram staker is being used (utxos > 10,000) then it mines unvalid blocks

[16-Dec-18 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I need to track that down

[16-Dec-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bad ram?

[16-Dec-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol no

[16-Dec-18 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tried on multiple computers same wallet

[16-Dec-18 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you try zapping it to see if it's a corruption?

[16-Dec-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it eventually found a block

[16-Dec-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I synced from scratch

[16-Dec-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with no wallet, and imported the private key very early on sync

[16-Dec-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this node has an outrageous wallet ... no wallet should ever be in this state

[16-Dec-18 09:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[16-Dec-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess I need to add a print of the tx that is missing inputs

[16-Dec-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see why its missing or why it thinks it exists when it does not

[16-Dec-18 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK listtransactions | jq 'select(.[].walletconflicts[] != null)'`
or maybe
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK listunspent | jq -c '[ .[] | select( .spendable == false) ]'`
?

[16-Dec-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this sucks ... added print and restarted ... an dnow its mining every block it goes for

[16-Dec-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wiat here it goes ... flooding now

[16-Dec-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep its what I thaught, its trying to use the same utxo over and over again, but it doesnt exist

[16-Dec-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I cna somehow flag it after the first attempt and make it skip it ... there is no way to remove utxos from the ram staker

[16-Dec-18 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its trying to use the same utxo over and over again, but it doesnt exist`
Do I even want to know how you got it to pull an imaginary hash?

[16-Dec-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt touch it

[16-Dec-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All I did was lower the value to activate the ram staker

[16-Dec-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to force it to use it

[16-Dec-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and now its spitting out invalid txs that dont exist and tryign to stake with them...

[16-Dec-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I added a gettransaction call to the loop, to skip txs that dont exist, but it already does this on the loop that adds them to the array... very strange

This one of the weirdest things i've seen lol ... added a gettransactipon call, and that returns valid tx ... but the tx in the staked block still does not exist.

[16-Dec-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
must be some kind of memroy corruption happening.

[16-Dec-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you try the 2 jq selects I posted earlier?

[16-Dec-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the ram staker is not active this never happens... which is fucking confusing ...

[16-Dec-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as what it does is this :
if the array is empty it loops thorugh unspents and adds them to array
loops over array looking for elegible utxos
if the array has less than X utxos inside it clears it

[16-Dec-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the problem has to be that when the arry is not empty, and skips the first step ... the array is corrupted.

[16-Dec-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to check offical komodo and make sure the code here hasnt been changed ... as I did mess with it at some point before removing it all ... maybe I remived someting thats meant to be there 🤷

Tried to run `start.sh` after `stop.sh` few mins ago. Iguana build failing on my side, and then it getting totally fecked

libsodium is a dep in the build sctipts

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only a few hours ago

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its was added to iguana for spaling

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to install it manually

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh fresh thing

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ...

[16-Dec-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
threw me at first too

ok boys I think thuis is sorted out 😄

[16-Dec-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to push large update, no consensus changes, but if you are staking updating is a good idea @CrisF

[16-Dec-18 08:52 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!

[17-Dec-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the problem with RPC call hanging might not be a daemon lock up, when the staking loop is running, the RPC is locked, simply waiting will let it return a result after a while, depends on how many utxos u have and how fast the computer is to how long it takes.

[17-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will see if incan work out a fix for that, but I'm guessing it probably can't be fixed.

[17-Dec-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK I seem to have both PoW and PoS VMs working again, long slog there but I think its finally working correctly. 🤞

[17-Dec-18 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
PoW has been working for me for the last hour on CFEK, since reset things.

[17-Dec-18 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Will test PoS next.

[17-Dec-18 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Mined a few. Will let it run for a bit.

[17-Dec-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its still not great ... trying one more thing

[17-Dec-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im no longer wokring locally, so please dont update until i say to 😃

👌 

[17-Dec-18 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The PoS keeps minign invalid blocks, and then resubmitting the same block over and over ...

[17-Dec-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I worked out what causes it... some how a transaction that does not exist is in the block template, and its failing to update that and keeps trying to mine a block with a transaction in it that does not exist ... very strange

[17-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man this freeking rescan bug hey ... I want to shoot it

[17-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
restart to test fix ... takes 1H to rescan wallet 😡

[17-Dec-18 09:52 AM] CrisF#3405

[17-Dec-18 09:53 AM] CrisF#3405
I've made some progress here, but it means 20 more small pain in the ass things to fix, haha.
