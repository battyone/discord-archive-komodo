So have fun stalling them. I have 1Sol of CPU on them, and I think habe mined 90% of the blocks

What will labs be worth in 6 months $$ ? ....just guess.  No smart assery...  .1 kmd?

[13-Nov-19 05:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd guess 0.25 KMD. 
and KMD will be 0.1 BTC.
and BTC will be $100K USD.
but a loaf of bread will cost $100USD.
so each LABS will be worth two and a half loaves of bread.

I'd actually be quite OK with that üèù

@blackjok3r 
my staking node of LABS crashed with
```
komodod: coins.cpp:564: const CTxOut& CCoinsViewCache::GetOutputFor(const CTxIn&) const: Assertion `coins && coins->IsAvailable(input.prevout.n)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```
do you need anything from the node before I restart it?

lol.. I have fix here wiul will push once tested

[14-Nov-19 01:55 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Can someone help me unstick my agama desktop linux wallet I sent a bunch of labs to the mining address and now the blockchain sticks and wont download past a block

[14-Nov-19 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
what os?

[14-Nov-19 01:57 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I have stake on last month I was staking and now the blockchain is froze I can only download about 94% of the blockchain in native mode I had staking on last month with what I sent I went to check and its failing to load Linux.

[14-Nov-19 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
look at the pinned message here, there is a link to binaries, you need to download them and replace the binary you have from Agama release

[14-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
also going to need to fix the current chain you have on that machine. Simplest way would be to resync from scratch with new binaries

[14-Nov-19 01:58 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I have rysnced from disk many times and it gets to 94% and fails

[14-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
you're on linux?

[14-Nov-19 01:58 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Yes

[14-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Alright#0419
Don't quite remember the directory to replace binaries in for Linux, give me a minute

[14-Nov-19 02:00 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Thanks I dont want to lose this its stuck on block 218763 wont download past that

[14-Nov-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/dev-multios-0.4.0a-labs/linux64.tar.gz

either download this or build it yourself, will find the path for binary in a moment

[14-Nov-19 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
should be something like `Agama/resources/app/assets/bin/`

[14-Nov-19 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
what do you see there?

[14-Nov-19 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
should have a folder with komodod binary in it there

[14-Nov-19 02:02 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I just load the bin

[14-Nov-19 02:02 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
?

[14-Nov-19 02:03 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Where sbin?

[14-Nov-19 02:04 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Im a novice sorry

[14-Nov-19 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
you could use it via cli, but if you want to use LABS in Agama, you need to...

stop agama entirely 
find where you unpacked it
find the Agama/resources/app/assets/bin/ directory
in that directory, there will be another directory with a file called `komodod` in it 
delete that komodod and replace it with the one from this download https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/dev-multios-0.4.0a-labs/linux64.tar.gz

[14-Nov-19 02:05 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Im doing that now

[14-Nov-19 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
and just restart Agama, it'll either sync to latest or you'll need to resync

[14-Nov-19 02:06 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Im searching for where I installed that but I can't find it

[14-Nov-19 02:06 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
im at root?

[14-Nov-19 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
where ever you downloaded it

[14-Nov-19 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
it's just an archive that you extracted

[14-Nov-19 02:08 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
the only file there is one binary agama-Linux-v0.5.7-4.AppImage there is no files it decompiles you expect me to decompile add these and recompile?

[14-Nov-19 02:09 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Its just one file 110 megs or so

[14-Nov-19 02:09 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I dont know where the app data directory is

[14-Nov-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
just open the appimage file with something like winrar

[14-Nov-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
it's just an archive

[14-Nov-19 02:10 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Ark wont open it

[14-Nov-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
pretty sure that would be extracted first, no?

[14-Nov-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
don't have a linux machine with UI to test this on

[14-Nov-19 02:12 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
show data folder hang on

[14-Nov-19 02:12 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I think I get you

[14-Nov-19 02:12 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942

[14-Nov-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
all good? üòÖ

[14-Nov-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
next release from them should include that binary, we just haven't nagged them to update it

[14-Nov-19 02:17 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Ok looks like it creates this and mounts it in the tmp directory hmmm

[14-Nov-19 02:17 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I guess I will just overright this if I can hang on

[14-Nov-19 02:18 AM] Alright#0419
I could be wrong man, need to look at how the appimage works

[14-Nov-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
seems we may actually need to repackage it for ourselves, didn't realize linux builds worked like that

[14-Nov-19 02:19 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I dont think we can do this looks like its generated differently every time

[14-Nov-19 02:19 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Its like expecting someone to code from scratch?

[14-Nov-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
sorry, what?

[14-Nov-19 02:21 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Well I will try this load again but I have a hunch this isn't going to work

[14-Nov-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
same, I'll look into it, sorry

[14-Nov-19 02:22 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Does the blockchain fail for everyone now?

[14-Nov-19 02:23 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
So my money is gone?

[14-Nov-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
money not gone, just not able to access it atm

[14-Nov-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
should be able to use SPV mode in Agama if you know the private keys

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
that will work just fine for sending/receiving, can't stake the coins though

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I have SPV works fine but the native is jammed where I had all the coins

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
"lite mode" is what they call it in wallet I think

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
are you trying to stake or just send the coins elsewhere?

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I load the keys from native to passive?

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
you can, need to do it one at a time though

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
?

[14-Nov-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
what is it that you're trying to do?

[14-Nov-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
just access the funds or stake?

[14-Nov-19 02:27 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I tried to stake on native and it seems to jammed wont complete the block

[14-Nov-19 02:27 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
wait seems to be loadking the blockchain again

[14-Nov-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
it's because you're on an outdated codebase

[14-Nov-19 02:28 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
The text is different maybe its using your cli

[14-Nov-19 02:28 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
hmmm looks like it jamed again at 218763

[14-Nov-19 02:30 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
omg I have to load 100 keys man this is insane with no gui this is like insane I can't remember omg

[14-Nov-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
if you're familar with cli, you can use that just fine

[14-Nov-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
if not, please come back tomorrow. I'll try to think of something. I need to get a linux desktop machine to test on

[14-Nov-19 02:34 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Well this was not a very nice thing to do to someone can you imagine what someone that hasn't done this for 14 years would do .  Your expectation is super insane if you expect this from your typical user lol

[14-Nov-19 02:34 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
The did this on purpose to freeze the blockchain for people trading?

[14-Nov-19 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
Do you want to learn?

[14-Nov-19 02:38 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
ASL?

[14-Nov-19 02:40 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Your working on the KMDLABS project?

[14-Nov-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[14-Nov-19 02:41 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
ASL?

[14-Nov-19 02:41 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Who created this?

[14-Nov-19 02:43 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Did you just break the chain to stop me from trading or everyone?

[14-Nov-19 02:53 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
I swept all my keeps but 190000 labs is missing now it only recovered 79 labs? woah thats brutal

[14-Nov-19 02:53 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
something is because it didn't load from native after the freeze its not processing

[14-Nov-19 02:53 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
passive isn't loading the native data

[14-Nov-19 02:56 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Well I'lll try and figure out whats going on here thanks for the help

[14-Nov-19 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
lite mode won't automatically use native keys

[14-Nov-19 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
your funds aren't gone, just aren't able to sync the chain

[14-Nov-19 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
if you want to use cli, I'll be glad to show you how
