Lol  - really need to get my KMD daemon load time down - despite what it says KMD *IS* running
```Started Assetchains
[KMD] : Checking your address and importing it if required.
 Starting KMD Failed: help human!```

[30-Dec-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` really need to get my KMD daemon load time down`
Not really much you can do about that, KMD is a beast

[30-Dec-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most days, you can sequentially load 3-5 chains in the time KMD loads

[30-Dec-18 12:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
yeah but start.sh terminates if KMD doesn't load in a set timeframe

[30-Dec-18 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
change the time?

[30-Dec-18 12:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
it's why I was asking about reducing wallet.dat size - resetting has shown time improvements on other coins with daemon load

[30-Dec-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
joker and I will have to agree to disagree on that being a significant load time factor outside of the extremes he's been playing with
I've had times where a wallet.dat with 1 used addy and 3 tx history took the same load time as my bdex wallet.dat

[30-Dec-18 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, it has more to do with the block data in KMD vs other chains

[30-Dec-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do agree that total tx history is a factor (albeit a small-ish one), though (because, database)

[30-Dec-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did plenty of experiments, and every notary node OP will tell youy wallet.dat size affects node preformance even more so than number of utxos (within reason)

[30-Dec-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wallet.dat size affects node preformance even more so than number of utxos (within reason)`
literally what I said 30 minutes ago and you gave a 👎🏽

[30-Dec-18 12:14 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Crossed wires - notary performance V's load performance?

[30-Dec-18 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no cross, db calls are db calls

[30-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... KMD deamon load after sapling is just slow

[30-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even with no wallet

[30-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the listunspent call....

[30-Dec-18 12:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
😄

[30-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is directly affected by the size of the wallets transaction history.

[30-Dec-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as non-sensical as that may sound it is 100% correct

[30-Dec-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are easily more speed improvements to be found in KMD, but I think I got the worst of them fixed in the last few weeks.

[30-Dec-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
again, __literally__ what I said earlier 😣

[30-Dec-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢Today at 7:48 PM
listunspent time is moot with utxo counts being 5-50
listtransactions time, might matter though```

[30-Dec-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[30-Dec-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man.... unspent call is affected by the amount of transactions ...

[30-Dec-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
weather you ask it to list transactions or not

[30-Dec-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "simple" fix is update the db structure

[30-Dec-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
while possible ... thats far from simple ... there is liek 10,000 lines of code that runs the wallet and many thousands more that use it

[30-Dec-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seemed far easier to make a way for the node to just have a moving window to work in, if it was required to make millions of txs a year.

[30-Dec-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`thats far from simple ` hence the quotes

[30-Dec-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
long term that is simply required

[30-Dec-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but a noob like me has no chance of even making that 1% of done

[30-Dec-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figure if we can use what we have and it works good enough someone with more recources will get that done eventually

[30-Dec-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean ther is no change BTC core will accept a PR with it anyway :trollface:

It's long since been deleted, but once upon a time Pieter Wuille had actually written the migration scripts for going from bdb4.8 to another structure (it may have been just a newer bdb, I forget), and then it was all just abandoned and later pruned

:tools: I am currently in maintenance mode and cannot interact with the public: *my engine is getting an upgrade to handle changes introduced with sapling update of Komodo wallet, and will likely return within a few days.* Thank you for your patience.

[30-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Mylo#8306
@blackjok3r KomodoPioneers team have a dedicated machine running KVM virt for some testing, some info is here - the "jamie linux" links in the more recent article are helpful,   https://i.mylomylo.com/category/kvm/

renting a server to test out from packet.net hourly for a few days is the cheapest way to test with internal network (NAT) but for a routed network with public addresses, hetzner server bidding have $0 setup.   Sometimes you can find 32GB RAM for <25EU although no SSD.

OneProvider offers 8 core atom servers for $15USD, but i had a lot of trouble with public addresses in their network setup.  Vultr have 20c/hr SSD servers, i think you an provision extra public IPs.

One of the Komodo Pioneers test boxes (maybe 16GB RAM)  might be able to be wiped for a small donation to the public community meet up fund and we'll tweet out the collaboration 😉

[31-Dec-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I am aware it only happens when mining... No notary has ever locked up?

[31-Dec-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the CPU goes to 0%, and the RPC calls hang.

[31-Dec-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have to kill process -9 to get rid of it

[31-Dec-18 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm re starting. haven't done any mining or staking lately. might kick one off to make sure pool is still ok

[31-Dec-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I thaught maybe it would be fixed, but seems not the case

[31-Dec-18 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
safe to test migrations again?

[31-Dec-18 09:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
actually, I have noticed a couple of times that ./stop.sh wasnt cutting it, and got stuck on stopping CFEK

[31-Dec-18 09:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yesterday, not while mining

[31-Dec-18 09:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
fine on NN right now tho

[31-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm when not mining it hung? the stop rpc is able to be sent

[31-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it stops all the threads, like miner, net etc, but main thread is locked hard

[31-Dec-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds like deadlock

[31-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it is ... extremly hard to track down

[31-Dec-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very rare

[31-Dec-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this time, it found a block, then hung... It had just started a new mining loop, the block hash isnt in the chain.

[31-Dec-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The mining loop wasnt locked. Just main.

[31-Dec-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe a LOCK(cs_main) ended up being called when it was already called

[31-Dec-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I tihnk thats what it is... but figureing out how its happening hasn't been so easy.

[31-Dec-18 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what ever code path it is... doesnt happen very often... maybe 0.1% of the time or less.

[31-Dec-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder if it exists in FSM branch aswell of is just us 🤔

[31-Dec-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
likely both

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
most systems mining wouldnt be used for cli usage

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so wouldnt be noticed

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it stops mining all together

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just stops and sits at 0% CPU

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure its cs_main that is being called twice.

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes but if you only mined it likely wouldnt end up in that situation

[31-Dec-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess you need to break into the debugger and see where it is waiting

[31-Dec-18 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does... I have a node thats done it the most times, is just PoW 1 thread... doesnt do anythign else at all. I've gone to check it a few times now and 2 chains are just stopped.

[31-Dec-18 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`yes but if you only mined it likely wouldnt end up in that situation`
My mining node does the same every day or 2

[31-Dec-18 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it only happens to CFEK and CFEKED, the other 2 chains seem immune

[31-Dec-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess the debugger is the go... looking into it..

[31-Dec-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically impossible to track down manually.

[31-Dec-18 10:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every time it happens, the debug.log last entries are like:
```2018-12-30 04:35:13 socket receive timeout: 1201s
2018-12-30 04:35:18 socket receive timeout: 1201s

2018-12-30 04:35:18 socket receive timeout: 1201s
2018-12-30 04:35:19 socket receive timeout: 1201s```

[31-Dec-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
highre than that

[31-Dec-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
20 mins before that

[31-Dec-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1201s ago it locked causing the socets to stop responding

[31-Dec-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine was block mined... and then got half way down the miing loop (there are no LOCK calls there at all) so it was something else.

[31-Dec-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is once possible thing it may be... but I dont really undsestand why.. Guess I can push it and we can try it.

[31-Dec-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It's only done this recently.. and I think I know what it was I changed.

[31-Dec-18 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
funny though, the solution appears to be to call another cs_main lock 😂

[31-Dec-18 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if I guessed correctly.

[31-Dec-18 10:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any reason why the hex created from `fundrawtransaction` would be rediculously long?

[31-Dec-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lots of utxos

[31-Dec-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
