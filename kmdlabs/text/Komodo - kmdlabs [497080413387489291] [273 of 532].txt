and they can be replaced in 2 months

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Oir lieky it would be less than 2 months ..

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`consantly attacking the network preventing notarisations happening`
And what if a private miner does that? :troll:

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depenign on how election is handled.. like 1 month before the 2 months is up, is 2 months evern possible.. maybe it needs to be 3 or 4>

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well.. I dont think it would matter as all chains have PoS

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] gt#2812
what triggers a vote to oust a bad node?

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mayeb it should be a "burn the witch village". If the mob wantd to they'll find a way. best we lay out the rules definine the custom.

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] gt#2812
should there be a vote to have a vote?

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically only qwould happen if a node was doing less than 10% of average ntoparisations

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise they are just taking up a spot soeone else can use

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they get paid per ntoarisation

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I can see hwo it would really ever happen

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but you need a way to remove nodes who dont remove themselfs

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just inc ase someon dies or whatever

[05-Feb-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>Hold on, I can't die yet I have to shut down my node...

[05-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im jst saying if someone just walks away and doesnt giv up their spot... if there is a key sitting ther never notarising... you need to be able to remove it

[05-Feb-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> I can't be dead, I still have privkeys 🙂

[05-Feb-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I agree, I'm just in a good, playful mood this morning 😛

[05-Feb-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool.. rather than needing to replace all nodes at eh bottom, you just add new ones unless a node is just dead.

{Reactions}
👍 

[05-Feb-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If ppl quiit then they can be replaced... keeps the amount of nodes dynamic wihtout making it too complicated I think.

[05-Feb-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
could do both, no? add new after x and after x(n) time, remove?

[05-Feb-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure...

[05-Feb-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So we just keep adding 2 more nodes ev ery 2 months, but if a node hasnt notarised for some time at each election we just remove them

[05-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short of an impassible hf, if I died right this minute, my NN wouldn't stop for years 😛

auto-pay from business account

[05-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
But that's ok

[05-Feb-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its fine... as mor chain are added

[05-Feb-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will slowly fall behind

`It's still helping the network`
Yes, but it would also be essentially the same as burning every coin I made

[05-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
And with start on cron it would be up to date.

[05-Feb-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure that would be a safe thing to do long term lol

[05-Feb-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

👍 (2) 

[05-Feb-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So there needs to be some threshold of notarisations like is the average is 10,000 and a node gets like 1000 then its a vote to remove it.

[05-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Reminds me - is there a list of notarization rpc's?

[05-Feb-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do we have any uninterrupted stats that we could realistically use to set a hard number like that?

[05-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the amount paid in the coinbase

[05-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its only a valid ntoarisation if you get paid

[05-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you dount how many times each notary was paid

[05-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not how much

[05-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just how many times

[05-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I mean in order to set 1000, 2000, or whatever specific number *now*

[05-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the average number of notarisation over all nodes / 10

[05-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if tis 10% of the average then its owner dowesnt care.. there is no other explination... doestn care or is dead

[05-Feb-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, I thought you meant to suggest a specific hard-coded number

[05-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Only from a specific block / timecode - otherwise newbie is auto out

[05-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes each 2 months

[05-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when era change is reset

[05-Feb-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its staggered form era

[05-Feb-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so starts half way though the first

[05-Feb-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doubt anyone is doing this in the first 2 moths, that avoids having a dead node in an entire era until the next change over

[05-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
time has to be long enough it wasnt just some emergancy, which is why its a vote

[05-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not a hard kick out

[05-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Could do with a hard checkpoint - to make the measurements transparent to all

[05-Feb-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed... has to be a timestamp, thats at least accurate down to 10 blocks or something

[05-Feb-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and works across all chains

[05-Feb-19 01:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Current rpc's work on block count - should be linkable

[05-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm your talking an RPC to determine this.. I was thinking external script to allow anyone to fetch this data from chain with `getblock`

[05-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
easily verified that way

[05-Feb-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not eveyone can read C++ code to chek the RPC is correct

[05-Feb-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldnt take long to loop over 2 months of coinbases with getblock

[05-Feb-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and works across all chains`
That was going to be my next question was if just main counted or if with the whole "free will" concept would one get punished for invoking their opt-out choice (although I've always maintained they should be 😛 )?

[05-Feb-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they should be .. if they cant afford to run that many chains they will either be replaced with soeone who can or the amount of notaries will decrease

[05-Feb-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doing it this way basically forces someone who cant make a profit to be replace with someon who can, or the amoutn  of ntaries goes down... which is the entire point

[05-Feb-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, we all know that I'm no fan of designing around the lowest common multiple, so I try not to beat that horse too much 😛

`1) every 2 months there is 2 spots avalible, until we reach 64 nodes. Provided nobody drops out or decides to leave. `
Do believe we  should do this slower than 1 new spot/month. Is this throwing the 75 25 lottery out the window?
`2) If soemone is litterally gone/their node is attacking us/ etc .. being bad actor., other ntoaries vote to remove that node (by majority vote) `
We don't need this for MIA notaries if we do 75 25 lottery. Bad acting notaries can be blocked by other notaries to put them in bottom 25%
`3) the genral election is run where the 2 spots are given out. Maybe a short list is voted by that is then chosen at random. `
voting is very flawed in that initial investors/notaries/whoever will control the network indefinitely

[06-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
notaries should not be asked to vote on notary things such as adding or removing another notary

[06-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
I was half joking when i suggested this last night as it'd be pretty messy to implement, but we could attempt some kind of checks and balances between stakers, miners and notaries

[06-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
miner vote can be signaling in coinbases
staker vote can be VOTE-esque chains
notary vote can be done via oracles

[06-Feb-19 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1) every 2 months there is 2 spots avalible, until we reach 64 nodes. Provided nobody drops out or decides to leave.
--- This is if nobody deceided to leave, or is lesss than threhold and is voted out. its not fixed at adding 1. 
--- If being a notary isnt profitable, ppl will drop out, if its profitable then the number will increase over time, until we hit 64 nodes
---- then we will use the exact same model as KMD.
2) If soemone is litterally gone/their node is attacking us/ etc .. being bad actor., other ntoaries vote to remove that node (by majority vote)
bad notaries being blocked by other ntoaries is the entire problem this set out to solve.... 
3) the genral election is run where the 2 spots are given out. Maybe a short list is voted by that is then chosen at random.
voting is very flawed in that initial investors/notaries/whoever will control the network indefinitely

--- if you read what genie said, the vote is not held from stake holders, and then its up to a random. The vote is to stop sybil attack, but is not by staked holders. 
--- Still not 100% on how it would work, but its vote, then random lottery. Its to verify a person is a person and not a person being a bunch of ppl.

[06-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
so you're proposing no lottery?

[06-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
i don't understand

[06-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Alright#0419
I think it's impractical to have a VOTE style election every 2 months

[06-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Alright#0419
the idea behind 75 25 lottery is that we would first have to verify that the person seems not to be a sock puppet and shows they are capable of notarizing by notarizing on testnet

[06-Feb-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats assuming proof of discord... this entire conversaion needs to be read i think... or your not going to understand it

[06-Feb-19 03:05 AM] Alright#0419
`After this stage, when we get to 64 (if we get there) we use a yearly election same as KMD.`

[06-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Alright#0419
We very much rely on notary involvement in the project. I'm not a fan of changing it yearly because of this.

[06-Feb-19 03:12 AM] gt#2812
wouldn't the low performing notary vote take care of that?

[06-Feb-19 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
sorry @gt what do you mean?

[06-Feb-19 03:16 AM] gt#2812
i think you could still have votes to take out bad nodes once the yearly election starts

{Reactions}
💯 

[06-Feb-19 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
once a year?

[06-Feb-19 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every 2months there is a threshold... nodes who are under this are voted to be removed by other notaries

[06-Feb-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to have some way of pruging nodes who preform badly.... or are not making a profit

[06-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think notaries should have the power to oust other notaries

[06-Feb-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they dont

[06-Feb-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only if they do likew 10% of the average

[06-Feb-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or soem other %

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
what?

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there wil be an average of notarieations

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easy detemined every 2 months

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if nodes fall under this

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the other notaries vote to remvoe them.. this stops notaries voting out ppl they dont like...

[06-Feb-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also if there is ome emergancy

[06-Feb-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that makes someone preform badly for a short time

[06-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
I really need a tl;dr of this proposal when you have a chance

[06-Feb-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah soon

[06-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
seems I'm failing to comprehend what you're saying
