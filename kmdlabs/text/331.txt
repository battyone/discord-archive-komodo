I wil be pushing the v4 script soon, the v3 had many bugs

[12-Mar-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it kind of worked....

[12-Mar-19 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but not properly

[12-Mar-19 09:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, let me know if you need anyone else to run a few.

The `buildkomodo.sh` script got a bit of a modification in making this.   Will make one for labs eventually so it's a turnkey install.    Only take a short time to change a repo, some scripts and some menu options.

Just about done with v4 migration script here. Full multithreaded with a built in save and resume function. When user reports failed migrate they only need supply the JSON that is saved to the failed file, to notaries, who then start the script with the path to the file as argument 1, and it will run thoguh the entire process, if it cannot manage to import the burn on the target then  notaries know that it failed and the backup validation can be used instead. 
We will need to test this backup validation. Hopeing to get an actual fail, but we dont need a fail to test the backup import.

[12-Mar-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
zI think some kind of server can be made also that takes the export JSON as input froma  website or API and it will do all migrates for you.

[12-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So you only need the source chain full daemon to create the burn transaction, everything else can be done by some central entity.

[12-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Solves needing KMD full daemon.

basically we need somehting that you can post your export JSON to that will return either an impoirt txid, or a notification that you need to use the backup process and instruction on how to do that.

Thanks, hopefully catch you a fail or 2.

[12-Mar-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, its pretty simple. I suggest doing just 1 migrate first go..

if thats all sweet try more... I'm pretty happy hwo ti turned out although the code looks terriblly messy it works very nicely.

```Total migrations amount: 50

This was sending 1 export evey 30s, the backup import transaction seems to be requried quite a lot, maybe 1/3 of the time, but all of them are working just fine.

Im only doing 1 coin per migrate abnd havent done many yet,... Its really getting going now though

[12-Mar-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no failed file generated yet 300+ exports in. Although with the PoW only chains, the timing issues dont happen very often. I will need to start a 0BR chain to join CFEKORKL cluster to get a situation where the timinmg issue will arise, more often. But just doing stupid amaounts of migrates on these chains, will hit the issue eventaully should it still exist.

[12-Mar-19 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems I have a batch of migrates that seem to either have failed or did not sucessfully create the backup transaction. üò¶ hopefully tis juist the backup transaaction

Hi, I'm getting a noob error or some thing when trying to run the script.
```with open(exports_filename, "a+") as export_transactions_file:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/crisf/migration/migrate_logs/exports_1552391930.txt'```
I made `~/migration/migrate_logs`.

[12-Mar-19 12:06 PM] CrisF#3405
This is the line in the script the error mentions ```with open(exports_filename, "a+") as export_transactions_file:
            export_transactions_file.write("%s\n" % json.dumps(export_obj))
        t = threading.Thread(target=do_migrate, args=(src_chain, dest_chain, sent_tx, payouts, signed_hex, index))```

Thanks, I'll give that a try.

[12-Mar-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
10 or even 20 notarizations maybe ...

[12-Mar-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems that backup transaction isnt always possible and as such the MoMoM hash is still missing from the chain.

[12-Mar-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed a few bug fixes for script.

[12-Mar-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a few failed transactions at least we can use for the backup. Testing fix for the range, guess we should test the failed thing first, then roll out the larger range and retest migrates in a few days time once we have checked off that everyone updated.

I usually had to wait for back notarizations upto 10 minutes when doing a single migration. But seems they eventually come...

[12-Mar-19 01:33 PM] CrisF#3405
That one was around 30 without movement on std.

[12-Mar-19 01:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Not a lot of mining going on DIMXY3 or 4.

[12-Mar-19 01:37 PM] CrisF#3405
Will  try and build up some funds for bigger migrations.

[12-Mar-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its definatly got gaps, i have a bunch of failed imports... testing fix. We have the faileds saved now,  fopr testing the notary backup thing, so I can push this chagne and we can wait for everyone to update. 
Just had to take a larger range, it seems that on KMD,  if 2 notarizations are inside the same block and then the 3rd one is in a very close block to it, that its still missign stuf.. 
So I increased it to 7 range back, and rewrote the migrate script, so that it generates a whole range of transactions... idea being is that if the 1st one fails, each notarization that is made  will have so many hashes included going back, that eventually a matching hash must be seen. Not sure really how safe this is at all but it should work.

[12-Mar-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
Pushed update to use range of 7. Please DM me when updated. I need to know all nodes are updated before we can reliably test again. 
This is a consensus change for iguana, but the code change is in komodod, specifically your KMD daemons used to make MoMoM hash that is included in each notarization.

@blackjok3r  I've just rebased the token support with kmdlabs master and testing it locally. I think it would not be long (1-2 days probably). Then i'll do a pull request to your repo.
But it is again going to be a hard fork because I had to change import tx: moved import tx opret from vout0 to the back and  combined it with tokens' opret.
(Andt we may already test that notarization backup feature for coins)
