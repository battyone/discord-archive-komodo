Well, @blackjok3r it's only been a brief test, but I'm beginning to believe there's some merit to your idea of 300 vs 120 ms ping times

Well ive ran a notary down here for almost a year, I figured I would probably know what I was talking about üòÇ

[24-Feb-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will check out the stats and my node in a minute. But mostly wont he here today. Has anyone been working on the launch?

[24-Feb-19 03:56 AM] CrisF#3405
What's to be done in that regard?

[24-Feb-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BCT ann etc... not 100% sure... Thats all thats left, so we can launch the LABS chain itself I think. as long as LABSTH is still working. Checking it all now

[24-Feb-19 04:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure. As for KMDLabs.com a lot / most of the info needs updating with all of the changes. Some of the things became outdated in a day or 2, haha.
Figured it will have to be totally remade anyhow to fit the rebrand.

[24-Feb-19 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not really worried a bout a website, as the KMD team opffered to help with stuff... We need an ANN and a launch date to be decided.

[24-Feb-19 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think anything else is important really... the block rerwards take a week to ramp up.

[24-Feb-19 04:12 AM] CrisF#3405
It would probably be useful to consolidate all the info and then should be easy to base ANN, website, off that.

[24-Feb-19 04:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Either way the KMD site builders will need the info for the site.

What we need to work on is the relavent info, like get rid of anyhting thats been removed. Maybe tonight I can do a short summery you can work off of. Not really avalible today. Shouldnt be on here atm lol

[24-Feb-19 04:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Depending on the purpose of the ANN it might be good to have a website link on it.

[24-Feb-19 04:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, same here.

Well with minsigs 6 its looking really nice distribution wise. These nodes near the bottom can easily be atributed to not running the scripts correctly, or down time.

[24-Feb-19 04:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Looks like it will takes days...

[24-Feb-19 04:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Can I get rid of txindex???

[24-Feb-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah KMD sync is bullshit now lol.. I did a sync here on my 2700X and managed it in just under 6H. But I synced with connect= from a VM -> VM ... so it was CPU limited.

[24-Feb-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Feb-19 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
txindex is required

[24-Feb-19 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Might be a coupe of days then, haha.
Better to do in now I suppose.

[24-Feb-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r If those links are updated,combined and added to where needed it should cover most what is needed.
I can help with re-writing if you want to rip through it and not worry about the writing itself.

[24-Feb-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this page is pretty good iteself. .. I think there are a few changes to be made, but overall its pretty decent.

thanks. Will spend a few hours on this. Hopefully we can get something simple enough for an ANN. I think if we announce a lunch date with say a weeks notice then we also have the 1 week of slow ramp up block rewards. I dont think anyone can complain about that. Really we just need to get this thing launched and try and use it... I'm sure more things are going to change as we implement stuff. James has given me a really cool project to work on, that will be able to use LABS I think. But we shall see how it goes.

[24-Feb-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Just create a bunch manually, or is there a better way?

[24-Feb-19 08:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there's no brute spam afaik, maybe CLI form spoofing - haven't tested that. no csrf token security at the moment so could be possible

[24-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will launch as a 0BR chain in a while, to test some migrates too, although I can mostly do that myself. Just wasn to confirm notarypay doesnt break it. Catn see why it would, but good to confirm this before launch.

[24-Feb-19 09:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Yeah, it's neat how the RPCs can connect to django like that. The only "downside" at the  moment is working off a single node means all users  have the same `publisher ID`, though that's also kind of an upside in terms of users not needing to know anything about blockchain or installing anything.

[24-Feb-19 09:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
means any fees need to be handled in another layer, though I have some ideas

[24-Feb-19 09:10 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll have a better look through the site when I get a moment.
Keen to get learning python and Django.  Still have to check off a couple things on the list first.

[24-Feb-19 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
My plan is to expand that site into a little "capture the territory" game I'm working on, where each user has an oracle to keep a record of their gameplay stats.

[24-Feb-19 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've not had time to see how Rogue does it, but its something I'd like to invesigate

@blackjok3r @Alright An example or 3 might really help people understand what Labs is and how to get things going.  Maybe good for website and ANN.
Have an old example I made a while back that will need correcting. 
Can make others if that first one is made technically correct.  (There is a link for a diagram there also.)

[24-Feb-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rogue is just saving key strokes, and then saving to OP_RETURN, allowing the game to be replayed.

[24-Feb-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just re writing the notary secion of the website... A lot changed. I think I remeber where all discussion went, so I iwll just put what I remeber and then others can read an correct if I got anything wrong.

Yeah, things changed so fast.

[24-Feb-19 09:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol, yeah this project is kind of a risk/civ hybrid. Once basic functionality is sorted,  it'll evolve to be more civ-like.

On the NN page I've changed the writing style a bit.  I'd really like to keep the entire bottom section from `-ac_notarypay` in the style you've written it, with your name there.  (maybe just check spelling and punctuation?)
