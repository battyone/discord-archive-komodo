I htink so far 99% of issues are wiht the chains stalling, rather than anything wrong wqith momom

[06-Nov-18 08:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Have a question about logs.

[06-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
MLT is still a non-start for me, no connections, no blocks.

[06-Nov-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really not sure what the fek happend to that chain tbh ... but as I only pulled it into this test to test the mempool fix affects on migrates im not that concerned atm i'll come back to that later.

[06-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It might not even be an issue with the mempool, fix, but a merge issue in the code... it was a huge mission to get all these branches ready, and I might have just stuffed comethig up.

[06-Nov-18 08:16 AM] CrisF#3405
The fails go to `FAILED`.  How can I check what the hexes in there are?

[06-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing that goes to FALIED is if the very last step faisl, as thats all that script is testing for.

[06-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It deosnt not log, or even look for any other steps to fail as I did thousands of migrates, and the onyl step that ever failed, was the import tx

[06-Nov-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats ot to say somethign else, is now broken and that can happen...

[06-Nov-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but my results we prety good so far at least from CFEK-> LF and ED

[06-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am hopeing to get this new bracng ready, so we cna merge libscotts fix, and the new notary stuff into master then start PoW only chains (so they dont stall at all) and restart

[06-Nov-18 08:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Reason I'm asking how / where I can check them is I missed cleaning out that log before the 5000 send.  I'd like to see the amounts to help remember if it was before the 5000 send ofr from that run.

[06-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you run the script without seqmig script, what it prints to the terminal, is what it sends to the log, when useing seq

[06-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the only info you have .. unless imprt fails, in that case it prints the import and exporttx + payouts, spo you can maulayy run the faields to see why they didnt work.

[06-Nov-18 08:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll manually send one again and see what happens.

[06-Nov-18 08:28 AM] emma#2653
how much space needed to sync komodo network?

[06-Nov-18 08:29 AM] emma#2653
I am running gcloud  with 16gb disc space ..will it suffice?

[06-Nov-18 08:31 AM] CMaurice#1685
I have 7.1Ggb for just the blocks, so you might be alright depending

[06-Nov-18 08:34 AM] emma#2653

@blackjok3r CFEK to CFEKLF migrated successfully.  So receiving node seems ok .

nood question : When initiating any Komodo-compatible blockchain other than the main KMD blockchain, the user should also include the -ac_name=COINNAME and -ac_supply=COINSUPPLY parameters.

the komodo daemon itself can run unlimited blockchains apart from justKMD by giving it start parameters. Start here:

we use this feature a lot, but I also extended the code with much more powerful parmeters, alowing some chains to use diffrent notary nodes to others

I offer my node  in sacrifice to stand as tribute

[06-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha I was going to use my own ... I have the notary runnign on a 2 core VULTR and another node at home in a VM, using the new branch, not notarising just runnign same keys and observing ... was going to just blast until the notary stopped working and seee how the other node holds up .. if that goes well we cna try and blast all notaris using the fix on a single chain .

I hope tht this "fix" isnt ever needed, but as its there now, it seems it would be stupid of anyone to waste their coins, balsteing us.

you still need half the nodes to stay there, as if they all chainge, the network willl stop

[06-Nov-18 09:08 AM] gt#2812
half or so are elected and half remain

[06-Nov-18 09:08 AM] emma#2653
which half? will there be vote for that too?

[06-Nov-18 09:16 AM] emma#2653
again for my understanding there will be vote for choose 30 exemplary service nodes.. than there will be election to choose other 30 nodes.. but in first vote only "already servicing 60" node will participate ...but in next election any one can participate...correct? (removing dev nodes from equation)

[06-Nov-18 09:16 AM] gt#2812
no vote for exemplary

[06-Nov-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no vote...its based on the amount of notarisations made

[06-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody can run to be a notary node

[06-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
only requirment is that you be able to manage a NN node properly

@blackjok3r still no receive from `ING` to `ED`.  For some reason my `ING` doesn't seem to be sending.
`ED` has just received from `CFEK` so it's able to receive.

[06-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had problems with ING receiving from CFEK .. but only a very small percentage and only at a couple of specific times... but like I said the blcokctimes atm are really bad... 200s+ sometimes more

Working there for me ... check your KMD node where you are runnig the script man. there has to be something wrong there.

[06-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also these scripts are for stress testing, and makeing sure its working, not for actual production use of migrateing funds ... A proper scritp would save each stage, so if a daemons was playing up you can continue the process somehwere else or after you sorted it .. as long as all the noratisations are there, and can be found, there is no chance of losing funds.
