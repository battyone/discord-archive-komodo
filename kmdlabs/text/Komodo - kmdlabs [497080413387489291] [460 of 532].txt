dont need to wait for a block. simpler solution

nope... I was wrong 😦

I think I made some good progress today on iguana. I have a network of only 6 nodes, but I found a few bugs with how utxos are sent and calcuated that may just fix all the issues.

cant be 100% sure, but it seems that nodes are caculating best consensus litterally as soon as they select their utxos, which means that nodes who reposnd slower are simply ignored.

[05-Aug-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
commenting the line out appears to have made a massive diffrence 🤣

[05-Aug-19 12:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok

[05-Aug-19 12:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
what line

[05-Aug-19 12:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
would be nice to get more then 2-3 a day

[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a secret line and you must be properly selected by the Illuminati, the masons, the deep state, and NWO all at the same time in order to be told

its Monday I expect nothing less

[05-Aug-19 12:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
also i dont know the "rules" of how a block is selected as notary and then what  notaries get to  be included. Seems random based on latency so a lot of missed chances for no reason other than geo location.

[05-Aug-19 12:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
Maybe the NN system should rotate through the NNs and have each act as the first notary and the rest be on as received so all NNs get a min cycle?

[05-Aug-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`for no reason other than geo location.`
that's the whole bit joker's been working on for 3 weeks

[05-Aug-19 12:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
1440/22 right now would be avg expected

[05-Aug-19 12:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
I cant think of any reason that cant work.

[05-Aug-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
code it up and submit a PR 🤷🏽

[05-Aug-19 01:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
i wish I had the knowledge to do so... I have zero idea how to code it for a PR

[05-Aug-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's why it takes so long to fix, we currently only have 1 person working on that code

[05-Aug-19 01:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
i would have to take time to learn what ive been hacking at instead so i knew what i was actually doing

[05-Aug-19 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
and ive tried navigating some of these githubs before to find specific elements on my own and im bad at it

[05-Aug-19 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
like frustratingly lol

[05-Aug-19 01:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
but if thats where all Jokers commits are aimed recently that should be easy enough right?

[05-Aug-19 01:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
so ill take a look and maybe something makes sense to me... its Monday who knows

[05-Aug-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_gets the sense that @daemonfox doesn't really get what's going on and what iguana is_

[05-Aug-19 01:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
that's exactly what i was insinuating when I said Id have to take time to learn what ive been hacking at so I actually understand it

[05-Aug-19 01:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
So yes I do not have a full grasp of how Iguana works at all

[05-Aug-19 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
and like someone said a few days ago... i didnt realize this was what I was getting into when I started playing the STAKED game... but im enjoying it and need to spend more time on it

[05-Aug-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you fully understand everything that iguana does and exactly how all of it works, you'll literally be the only one
iguana isn't just one app and many things can be borked by changing just 1 or 2 lines
it's a code base that has evolved over many years, both into and out of many things (keep in mind that the start params is the difference between being a NN app and being a mm trader app)

[06-Aug-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  I'm working on it. I spent 24h straight working on this yesterday, its no easy task. I will spend probably another 15h on it today now I've had some sleep. I understand things arr not working great with the previous fix, but I have a new one that closes all known attack vectors with iguana and Also forces all nodes to agree to the average of the last 10 revcvmasks. This means that all online and working nodes must wait for all the nodes to respond to them before best mask is decided. If this works without breaking things with large amounts of nodes it will he a matter of days. If u really want u can try going back to an older commit.

TY for all you do Joker.

[06-Aug-19 04:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
It seems to be behaving much better today

[06-Aug-19 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I did a git pull for Iguana manually yesterday too so maybe something was still not  in sync with my LABS and Iguana

[06-Aug-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah iguans auto updates are not exactly reliable...

[06-Aug-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just does git pull... and checks if there is a pull

[06-Aug-19 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not accurate atv all

[06-Aug-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
On my KMDLabs NN setup, KMD stopped to work the morning and LABS stopped the afternoon. I don't know if other ppl had this problem. I'll try to find a log or a gdb backtrace

[06-Aug-19 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got mighty distracted today lol... I worked out how to validate vins inside iguana but its taking me a LONG time to get it actally working lol

[06-Aug-19 04:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that leveraging nSPV?

[06-Aug-19 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I used the code from nSPV to do it... but its not compatible with the iguana data streuctures... so I have to convert it all over 😅

[06-Aug-19 04:23 PM] phm87#7395
Courage @blackjok3r  You are one of our best code-warrior. We are with you

[06-Aug-19 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just have nothing else to do lol....

[06-Aug-19 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its like playing a game... only more rewarding

[06-Aug-19 04:26 PM] phm87#7395
If you have easy tasks to do in iguana, I can give a try. I did this yesterday : https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/pull/1113
[ I will test your FSM branch on KMDLabs NN or my 3P srv. I failed to test it on a normal node (I have difficulties to identify address from the node because there is no NNaddress defined.) ]

Take coin->active into account by phm87 · Pull Request #1113 · j...
Now, I think that the iguana calls stopcoin and startcoin works without creating curl errors into iguanaTV.
Before this change, if we call stopcoin on iguana then we stop chips daemon, these errors...

iguana is just hard... Until I get this working 70% properly all I will do is waste everyones time.

[06-Aug-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice PR ther btw! 😃

[06-Aug-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you ^^

[06-Aug-19 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So far I have:
1) iguana  working with blocknotify for all dpowd coins. which means it no longer has to poll getchaintip constantly hundreds of times a second. (also it will update chaintip as soon as vblock arrives, reducing nodes starting dpow round at diffent times) 
2) revcmask is required to have X nodes matching before they will create bestmask. This has a few issues though as I need some way of tracking the online nodes so it has a target to aim at. 
3) almost have notariesfastverify from nSPV working in iguana, so if a notary is submitting bad sigs and breaking notarizations we cna ban them temporarily.

[06-Aug-19 04:33 PM] phm87#7395
How to make sure that no malicious NN try to hack the point 2 ? Create bestmask with fewer nodes. What information brings the additional NN that is required to calculate the bestmask ?

[06-Aug-19 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its consensus code

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if one node submits a bstmaks before the rest do, it wont match

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so will be ignored

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] phm87#7395
ok

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] phm87#7395
so as far as there is no group of 13 malicious NN, it should be fine

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries are not really designed for there to be bad actors... bnut thest changes go quite a long way to make sure they cant

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[06-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
13 wont be enough

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] phm87#7395
ok

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it stats at 48

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and slowly reduce over time

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until it gets to 13

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but there needs to be a better way do it.

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because notas could be very slow with the first attempt I made

[06-Aug-19 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if there are not many nodes online

[06-Aug-19 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
I explained wrong : I mean what if a group of 13 malicious NN is using a special version of iguana ? (hopefully no NN is malicious this year)

[06-Aug-19 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the explanations

[06-Aug-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if 13 NN make their own network., they could make notarizations with it.... not sure what that would acheive tho

[06-Aug-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basically, there was a bug

[06-Aug-19 04:38 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[06-Aug-19 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that allowed bestmask to be calculated, before recvmask was fully known

[06-Aug-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I knew about this for a long time... but its been horrible a slow going to find it

[06-Aug-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
had to learn many new skills 😅

[06-Aug-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
I also need to learn a lot to be able to do interesting stuff (now, I do simple things as the PR that I did)

[06-Aug-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to learn all the bitwise stuff... not sure why I put it off for so long, really isnt that hard

[06-Aug-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
simple things like that are very helpful 😃

[06-Aug-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you. I feel appreciated

the sooner you giter dun is the sooner I can notarize KMD with utility

[06-Aug-19 05:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well.... seems its hard forking I figured I may as well fix all of it...

last time I saw that is when I was on my own fork 😅

[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
went to bed and hadnt staked a block in nearly 1K blocks... woke up to over a dozen new stakes

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
and even the 8 coin blocks are staking now

[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can help you get less by turning his staking node back on if you like...._

[07-Aug-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've been really bad; I don't think I've had my staker running in like 2-3 weeks

OK I am getting very close to needing tresters for this iguana. Finally have the sigcheck working, that took about an entire day 😅

[08-Aug-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will first spin up my own nodes using AWS to make sure what I have done actually works with lots of nodes.
