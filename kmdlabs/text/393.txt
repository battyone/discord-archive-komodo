if you updated, you need to run all chains on latest so they need to stop first

[24-May-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
only chain active for dpow right now should be LABS

[24-May-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
you'll break CFEK chains if you try to notarize them after updating

[24-May-19 06:01 PM] Exile13#4458
should `./asset-cli -ac_name=LABS getinfo` in `StakedNotary` return info or am i on the wrong dir

[24-May-19 06:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

`(code -1)` make sure server is running..

[24-May-19 06:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
is ``komodod -ac_cclib=labs -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=........`` listed in htop?

[24-May-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
`ps aux | grep LABS`

[24-May-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419

not sure man, I don't really ever use that script

[24-May-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
just use `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getinfo`

[24-May-19 06:10 PM] Alright#0419
did you change the .conf file after launching it?

[24-May-19 06:10 PM] Exile13#4458
i ran that from ~/StakedNotary

[24-May-19 06:10 PM] Exile13#4458
to add my Radd pubkey and WIF, yes

[24-May-19 06:10 PM] cipi#4502
@Exile13 if you get this error while daemon is running, it is because it does not listen to the rpcport... this can happen if the port was in use by the time when you started the daemon

[24-May-19 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
just try `./stop.sh` then `./start.sh`

[24-May-19 06:11 PM] Exile13#4458
ok returned `~/StakedNotary$ ./stop.sh

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
`tail -f ~/.komodo/LABS/debug.log` to check the log

I think we can fix that...

[24-May-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the rescan from height I added it doesnt need to rescan whole chain anymore, just the lst 50k blocks or something maybe?

[24-May-19 06:16 PM] gcharang#6833
so stop KMD chain, manually start komodod like `komodod -rescan=50000` after it reaches tip, stop, then start the start.sh script? @blackjok3r

[24-May-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-May-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@CMaurice tnks, must be an edit that I made a while back to get the right wallet size; I now have a whole list of sizes trailing after the actual stats (maybe because only 1 chain 🤷🏽 )

[24-May-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think we ever had 1 chain before 😄
