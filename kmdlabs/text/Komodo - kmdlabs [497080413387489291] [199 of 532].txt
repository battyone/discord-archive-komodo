ive added logs evwerywhere no dice

[07-Jan-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant get the tx details from anywhere else ... they dont exist in get blcok (or at least I dont think they do)

[07-Jan-19 09:53 AM] Mylo#8306
so it dumps to console 'IS_IMPORT'?

[07-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt dump anything at all

[07-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0

[07-Jan-19 09:53 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt  What's the best way to get CFEKX 'blocks' you. ~22.5mb

[07-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I know its calling this function, because adding `valueSat` to the vin part of an import allows it to show the amount on the explorer page

[07-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before it was 0

[07-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now it is 2

[07-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess the easiet way to dso this might to make non sensical JSON outputs fromt he RPC itslf .... and just call teh txid address üòÇ

request url is the ui talking to the api to get the details

[07-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I will try and add prints to the API part

[07-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306
to the api

[07-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306
just add console.log("jok3r") here https://github.com/StakedChain/insight-api-komodo/blob/master/lib/transactions.js#L56

[07-Jan-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still dont understand why the bitcore part cant print to console ü§∑

[07-Jan-19 09:59 AM] Mylo#8306
browser console or bash console

[07-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bash

[07-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I clearly just dont understand how it works... gets really frustrating lol

[07-Jan-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks for the help

[07-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Mylo#8306
doesn't sound like it should be too hard to just push some data there.

[07-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think console.log is thw wrong call in this case

[07-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every other print is using log.info

[07-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might try that first before I go making a hundred test commits to the other repos

[07-Jan-19 10:02 AM] CMaurice#1685
nope, gone backwards @CrisF  `[CFEKX] Synced on block: 0`

[07-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you guys have to be on the wrong commit ...

[07-Jan-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it makes no sense

[07-Jan-19 10:04 AM] Mylo#8306
if you're looking at bitcoind.js & referring to the log.info calls, look at the top of the file.
log = index.log
and looking above this
index = '../'
which  is coming from https://github.com/StakedChain/bitcore-node-komodo/blob/master/lib/index.js

well even this isnt working so I am assuming it cant see is_import

[07-Jan-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to try something else

[07-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is, this stupid language never declares anything it just amkes it up üòÇ

[07-Jan-19 10:08 AM] Mylo#8306
which one isn't working, bitcoind.js or insight-api/lib/transactions.js?

[07-Jan-19 10:08 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah it's my least fave language ever

[07-Jan-19 10:08 AM] Mylo#8306

if ijust run install-explorers.sh i will have a working env for CFEFX?

[07-Jan-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to have the chain running... and the changes to the getrawtransaction call are not pushed

[07-Jan-19 10:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
js is a bitch with knowing what is doing when

[07-Jan-19 10:10 AM] Mylo#8306
that's cool chain is running.
no probs, if you just make a gist with the patch

[07-Jan-19 10:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
have you tried console.log in the browser console?

[07-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because I am seriouslly contemplating remoing is_import and just recoinstructing a valid vin using the burtx... the geetrawtransaction output itself then will be abolkustly non sensical but at least the explorer will work

[07-Jan-19 10:11 AM] Mylo#8306
do what you want, i'm going to install an explorer from repo script and ask you questions seeing as you're so dogmatic with bitcoind.js üòõ

[07-Jan-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ive pushed it

[07-Jan-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what I am using right now

[07-Jan-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can try it

[07-Jan-19 10:12 AM] Mylo#8306
sweet cheres

[07-Jan-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop the chain
remove the conf file
run install-explorers.sh
then update the damone and start the chain again

[07-Jan-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start the explorer

[07-Jan-19 10:13 AM] Mylo#8306
cool, stopped CFEKX whilst dependencies installing phew

a block with imports in it is : http://192.168.0.111:3002/block-index/3310

[07-Jan-19 10:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I don't know how to set that up :/

[07-Jan-19 10:16 AM] CMaurice#1685
I see now

[07-Jan-19 10:16 AM] CrisF#3405
It's a dropbox kinda thing I think.

[07-Jan-19 10:16 AM] CrisF#3405
How can I set up a way to make it wget-able?

[07-Jan-19 10:17 AM] CMaurice#1685
If I start CFEKX manually, with connect=[oneoftheoriginaladdnodeips] it seems to proceed normally, but output ends with `CC Eval EVAL_IMPORTCOIN Invalid: non-canonical spending tx fce81040459bd12a4e8c2d9c349209f91501a648c685

a bunch of these

wrong commit ... that bug was fixed ages ago

[07-Jan-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your node has not updated

[07-Jan-19 10:18 AM] gt#2812
what's the best way to get to the right commit

[07-Jan-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wipe the whole thign and reinstall it from scratch (keep KMD blockchain)

[07-Jan-19 10:18 AM] Mylo#8306
```
then update the damone and start the chain again(edited)
then start the explorer
```
can you clarify cmds for these two steps

[07-Jan-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rebuild the komodod from latest tip

[07-Jan-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
start the chain (using staked these 2 stops are :./start.sh CFEKX noconfig`)

[07-Jan-19 10:19 AM] Mylo#8306
staked/update_komodo.sh

[07-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./start.sh CFEKX noconfig`
`CFEKX-explorer-start.sh`

[07-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from diff folders obviously

[07-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Mylo#8306
yup.

[07-Jan-19 10:35 AM] Mylo#8306
cool status shows, and from the status page the last block i can read tx.   but the blocks page just stalls on "waiting for blocks"  no biggie, but any ideas?

seeing as i can see the latest block info from the status page, i can see the transactions for that block.

were you just stopping the explorer, making changes, then starting explorer?

nice output üòÑ

[07-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I got it working by changing the :"source" in JSON to "address" but the links are all screwed

[07-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Mylo#8306
in browser dev tools?  or in a file

[07-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
huh?

[07-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i dunno man... I am jsut cahnging the bitcore node.js aprt

[07-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not touchign the browser I dont understand it

[07-Jan-19 10:37 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - have you got that tx id?

[07-Jan-19 10:37 AM] Mylo#8306

I have this so far ... What we need to do now, siu change the link of CFEKY

[07-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so that it points to at the very least at this stage the txid of the VIN

[07-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont actually work, because there is no CFEKY explorer though.

this is working for me...

[07-Jan-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My onlyu guess here is that the node.js stuff wasnt even recognising anyt of my code chagnes at all

[07-Jan-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so fuck it

[07-Jan-19 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this si good enough

[07-Jan-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it shows what chain it came from, and the amount

are you using getrawtransaction?
