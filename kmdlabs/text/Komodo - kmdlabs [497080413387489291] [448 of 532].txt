I'm still trying to wrap my head around the winner logic

[11-Jul-19 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it makes any difference or what

[11-Jul-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
Is it possible that you win with the 0.00000000 bet ?

[11-Jul-19 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
if probability is above 0 for such a bet, maybe you should do 1000 000 times the 0.00000000 bet 😃

[11-Jul-19 09:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
as blackjok3r said it's easy to cheat at this time, but it doesn't really matter

[11-Jul-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
coins that we can win are not on any exchange ... so everything is only a test I guess ... but the test can be fun (I still laugh about the 0.00000000 bet)

[11-Jul-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r need some direction as to what I should try to break and what is known to be broken

[11-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Alright#0419
made it to where I can create as many bets from new pubkeys easily. Made 50 bets, let me know if you want more

[11-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r `komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKLOTTO1 cclib status 17 '["cfe07d1142c3831e37f8187947a4f6d6b7ee911005ae8e0dfd541f0542403f70"]'
`
will segfault

[11-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
created a new plan and bet against it about 50 times normally then 20k times with 0 sat bets

[11-Jul-19 11:55 PM] Alright#0419
started segfaulting when the time expired

[12-Jul-19 12:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when it breaks because you made 0 value bets, that's not a bug that's karma 😛

[12-Jul-19 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
no validation to stop 0 sat bets
name of plans are not unique
can spam the list method by creating many plans cheaply(txpow maybe?)
no validation to check that end time timestamp is in the future 
can create plans with a negative timestamp, ~~assuming this means they will stay in the list indefinitely~~ just overflows
found many different ways to make status segfault, definitely a problem with `custom_hasResult`. Will give you backtraces and steps to reproduce if you need them

[12-Jul-19 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r

[12-Jul-19 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
need a limit on "name" size for create method, needs to be limited by script size

[12-Jul-19 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks man. I knew you would find things I didnt think of. I was mostly focused on making the transactions work. That was tricky seems there was no example to work from.

[12-Jul-19 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The amount bet does affect your chances of winning

[12-Jul-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not concerned about the list method, it doesnt really serve any purpouse really.

[12-Jul-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0 sat bets should not happen.

[12-Jul-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes build things will be an issue, I tried my best to amke build.sh work. It worked for me, but other nodes are diffrent, diffrent deps etc.

[12-Jul-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[12-Jul-19 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to reproduce the crash. I know of 1 crash in hasResult. I thaught after it was past block 100 it couldnt happen though, will check this out.

[12-Jul-19 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`need a limit on "name" size for create method, needs to be limited by script size` yeah thaught of this one after I launched the chain.

[12-Jul-19 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man you guys got this up pretty faast, should ahve set finish time sooner 😄 thanks!

[12-Jul-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
joker and I just crashed the whole network on CFEKLOTTO1 it seems

[12-Jul-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
we were expecting it to happen, and actually helps us quite a bit as we needed to hard fork the chain

[12-Jul-19 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
let us finish some sanity checks, and we'll let you know when to ./start.sh again

[12-Jul-19 04:50 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant please `./start.sh` to restart your CFEKLOTTO1 nodes

It should be working for autobuild on all nodes now, but it's not a nice fix. I expect more hard forks on that chain lol

Looks like the cclib isn't updating fuck that shit is annoying

Try to delete libcc.so from komodo/src and rebuild

i keep waiting for a PR that allows to specify what cclib to use (default to stub) during build process

[12-Jul-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is working... Can you try to `./listassetchainparams.py` and start eh chain manually? 
Ive rebuilt mine now like 4-5 times and have no problem so its very hard to fix.

[12-Jul-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@zatJUM

[12-Jul-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  I can ahrdly get it working with hardcoded dependancy paths let alone something like that.

[12-Jul-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its really nice when making the CC locally, but once deployed updating is extremly hard, with an automated script like we use.

[12-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully someone who is good at build systems can do this, i  too am not good at all with build stuff

[12-Jul-19 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I have to keep battleig with this the whole time, I will probably port this CC into an inbuilt one, but Id much rather get this working reliably. Because its just so much quicker to get something working at first.

[12-Jul-19 08:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
also don't forget to use komodod on lotto branch when start CFEKLOTTO1  manually

[12-Jul-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Blockindex may have got corrupted from Alrights transaction. So you may need to sync fresh. My notary and mining node are working fine, and that is the longest chain. So it should sync up to it, if it does not, then the cclib is not updating for you and you will need to investigate that.

[12-Jul-19 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it comes to it we will just need to start another chain, but that should not be required.

[12-Jul-19 08:32 AM] zatJUM#9924

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you never updated to CFEKBET1 then just update it should sync fromscratch to my notary node as thats the seed.

@blackjok3r you see anything wrong with the tx in 860? That seems to be what he's stuck on

[12-Jul-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, the last tx in that block is a CC tx. Likely his cclib didn update or he needs to try::

A bet need to confirm before it will show in status. There is no mempool checks and things yet.

doesnt always hit 100% tho, some seem to be perpetually at 99.999999

[12-Jul-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think as long as its over 98 it can be considered synced.

[12-Jul-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only when longest chain isnt found for a few iterations

I removed BET1, if you do start.sh without doing stop.sh first, you will need to manually stop that daemon

[12-Jul-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but just doing start.sh will not hurt. Just leaves BET1 running in background
