one is the bitcore node that gets the info from the daemon, one is the website and one is the API

[07-Jan-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Getting it to recognise imports isnt going to be super difficult, though may take a fair bit of time, to get it all to disply correctly in each of the diffrent repos.

[07-Jan-19 07:47 AM] Mylo#8306
10kB opreturn.  noted from other conversation.

[07-Jan-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```  "vin": [
    {
      "is_import": "1",
      "txid": "d67f38a3af5fca3d97bd8316d5e955bac9b21efd61ba2a28a47ec95c854ca4b9",
      "amount": 2.00000000,
      "source": "CFEKY",
      "sequence": 4294967295
    }
  ],
```
Just have to figure out how to get this into the explorer display

[07-Jan-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than showing address in, it will need to show txid only, hopefully later downt eh track this txdi can be linked to the other chains explorer to show the export tx in full.

found a nice hacky way to get it in there ... set every feild for vin as txid üòÑ

this nod.js shit is really frustrating

[07-Jan-19 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
So is this networking, haha :abusedsmily:

[07-Jan-19 08:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Let's get this done and start blasting and breaking.

[07-Jan-19 08:57 AM] CrisF#3405
(intentionally breaking üòã )

[07-Jan-19 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bahaha this isnt even like a needed thing.... but it would be really nice for people to be able to trtack the txns across chains with explorer.

[07-Jan-19 08:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, be nice for people just coming to watch, like if it's used in scaling.

Once I can just figure out how node.js assigns variables this willl be quite easy... but it just make things up out of thin arir all the time... nonsense languange

[07-Jan-19 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha

[07-Jan-19 09:02 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm going to try out Proxmox.  See how that goes.

[07-Jan-19 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would probably try that, at least its just a webpage to manage it all.

[07-Jan-19 09:04 AM] CrisF#3405
Looks like quite a page.  As always, the guides I checked out make it look fairly easy.  Based on past experience I'm quite suspicious.

i'm still getting stuck on block 1211

[07-Jan-19 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have synced both chains from scratch liuek 20 times and cant replicate that sync issue some of you are seeing üò¶

[07-Jan-19 09:06 AM] CrisF#3405
A node i had on a fork resynced today, @gt.  Wonder what is causing it.

[07-Jan-19 09:08 AM] CrisF#3405
If I make a bootstrap would it just need `blocks`?

[07-Jan-19 09:10 AM] gt#2812
not sure but it could work

[07-Jan-19 09:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if CMaurice managed to sync but maybe he could use it too.

[07-Jan-19 09:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Will make now.

[07-Jan-19 09:19 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt Was it `X`?

[07-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
boot stap is only covering over the problem

[07-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works for them, then ok... BUt I cant see them being ablie to validate the longer chain if they cant even sync it.

[07-Jan-19 09:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, few people having it.

[07-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
worth a shot though

[07-Jan-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Interesting to see if it works.

[07-Jan-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't there s bad block in PRIATE?

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this one is very strange ... what happneed wsa genie mined a fork and it got notarised

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so there is 2 notarised chains

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the daemon cant figure out what one is real

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the right block arrives first

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it will sync

[07-Jan-19 09:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh.  Isn't that the situation that was being discussed in ask-jl777?

[07-Jan-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if your seed node was on the fork... then likely the issue is now resolved... if they try and resync again üòÇ

[07-Jan-19 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
(a while ago)

[07-Jan-19 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, so I mined it?

[07-Jan-19 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Sry notarized

[07-Jan-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
possibly... not sure whats happened tbh, but the problem with stuck sync is its locking onto the wrong chain and stops

[07-Jan-19 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Yesterday smk762 managed to resync past it.

[07-Jan-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
these things happen when we ahrd fork things.... as long as the network is progressing enough for us to test a few things, hopefully who ever has node on the fork realises soon and truns them off.

[07-Jan-19 09:24 AM] gt#2812
yes x

[07-Jan-19 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I also got stuck on 906 and a stop/start worked for me.

[07-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Mylo#8306
what's the explorer repo @blackjok3r ?

[07-Jan-19 09:24 AM] Mylo#8306
url

[07-Jan-19 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll make a bootstrap.

my issue app[ears to be in the UI part... I make changes and nothign happens... I need to rebuild the minified files or some crap.... getting there slowly thanks to jorian post in dev-general

[07-Jan-19 09:27 AM] Mylo#8306
yep saw it, i was going to ask pbca but i think we'll be able to manage

[07-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jorian#4555
what do you need to change bj?

[07-Jan-19 09:27 AM] Mylo#8306
can you start the ui without all the other stuff?

[07-Jan-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive added some prints to the back end to amke sure the new data is actally there

[07-Jan-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Jan-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its int eh js

[07-Jan-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
search for : `Unparsed address`

[07-Jan-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for `is_import` is true we need to chage this to the chains name

[07-Jan-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then hopefully the vin txid can be made to hyper link to another explorer

[07-Jan-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm so close ... we had to change the internals of how the burn tx is even made to get this working..

but you want to replace parts of this view don't you?

[07-Jan-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[07-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where is says No Inputs
thats for coinbase

[07-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
import is diffrent

[07-Jan-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already changed the GetRawTransacion call so the `valueSat` is there.... so it at leas has the imput amount

[07-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I cant get any of the new fields to print anything

[07-Jan-19 09:35 AM] Mylo#8306
yes but the html needs to change.   {{ tx.address }} e.g. needs to be {{ tx.vin.txid }} or something

[07-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Mylo#8306
{{tx.vin[0].txid}}

[07-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was just going to use the JS stuff to pss it the right data in the same feild it already expected

[07-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I might not even be getting this data from teh right place at all tbh ... my console.logs are not printing anything

[07-Jan-19 09:36 AM] Mylo#8306
hmmmmm disgustingly hacky :abusedsmily:

{Reactions}
rum 

[07-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Mylo#8306
like in #dev-general duke had to add to the existing data structure, let's add to it, and change the template - if tx.vin[0].txid exists, display that

[07-Jan-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first I need to work out where the hell its fetchign this data from because it does not appear to be getrawtransaction]

[07-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Mylo#8306
are you looking at this file https://github.com/StakedChaihttps://github.com/StakedChain/insight-api-komodon/insight-api-komodo/blob/master/lib/transactions.js

I think its working because before there was no amount of coins in the VIN

[07-Jan-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now there is...

[07-Jan-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the console.log("); doesnt print anything at all

[07-Jan-19 09:46 AM] Mylo#8306
In duke's case for changing the view:
1.  he needs to fill the existing data structure with notarized tx id:  https://github.com/StakedChain/insight-ui-komodo/blob/master/public/views/status.html#L85
2.  he then needs to update the view to know there is changed data structure : https://github.com/StakedChain/insight-api-komodo/blob/master/lib/status.js#L54

[07-Jan-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the data is tehre in the RPC call... stupid JS catn see it though

[07-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Mylo#8306
it's not stupid, it's just not transformed.

[07-Jan-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I gave up on that part of it... just simply trying to console.log what it can actually see...  doesnt work

[07-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Mylo#8306
put in a console.log("jok3r")  here https://github.com/StakedChain/insight-api-komodo/blob/master/lib/transactions.js#L56
and load up block.  it should log to console  for each transaction in that block

im not using ther API

[07-Jan-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im just doing the back end part

[07-Jan-19 09:51 AM] Mylo#8306
but the ui talks to the api to get the data.

[07-Jan-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wher it fetches the RPC

[07-Jan-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its liek ti never calls getrawtransaction
