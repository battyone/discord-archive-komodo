[30-Mar-19 06:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[30-Mar-19 06:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just spent 3 days cleaning the house and yard, not keen on seeing all my hard work go up in flames üòÑ

[30-Mar-19 06:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Glad things turned out ok there, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator !

[30-Mar-19 06:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[30-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Mylo#8306
how do the labs update scripts work?
```
mylo@labs:~/staked$ ./update_komodo.sh master
update_failed
```

[30-Mar-19 07:23 AM] Mylo#8306
i just went to `$HOME/staked/StakedModo` and did a `git pull` then went to `$HOME/staked/install/` and `./buildkomodo.sh`

[30-Mar-19 07:25 AM] Mylo#8306
& gonna use notary from `url = https://github.com/KMDLabs/SuperNET.git` branch `staked`

[30-Mar-19 07:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
update scripts check `lastbuildcommit`  in branch subfolders of `~/StakedNotary/komodo`

[30-Mar-19 07:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
A while back I had issues updating, but deleting `lastbuildcommit` made it work. Issue hasnt happened for a while tho

[30-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
does that start komodod as well?

[30-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
can't find any scripts that manage that, nor what $1 & $2 are üòõ

[30-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
in places.

[30-Mar-19 07:50 AM] Mylo#8306
iguana starts, but i need to import wifs.. but need kmd started.   thanks re: lastbuildcommit

[30-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Mylo#8306
i don't have a `lastbuildcommit` in ~/StakedNotary/komodo

[30-Mar-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`cd master`

[30-Mar-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or whatever branch you're tryna work with

[30-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Mylo#8306
, waiting for `.start.sh KMD` to return...see what that does.

[30-Mar-19 07:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`$1` is branchname (for update_komodo.sh)

[30-Mar-19 07:53 AM] Mylo#8306
$1 = branchname ok.  i'll keep that in mind.

[30-Mar-19 07:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wif/pubkey/Radd defined in config.ini

[30-Mar-19 07:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should be an config_example.ini in ~/StakedNotary

[30-Mar-19 07:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`cp config_example.ini config.ini & vim config.ini`

[30-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah got config.ini sorted.

[30-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Mylo#8306
KMD started

[30-Mar-19 08:04 AM] Mylo#8306
ACs not starting, funnily they were running before.

[30-Mar-19 08:04 AM] Mylo#8306
`.start.sh CFEKORKL` will this start just CFEKORKL chain?

[30-Mar-19 08:06 AM] Mylo#8306

hehe no.
looks like there's a workflow that i don't know how to follow.

[30-Mar-19 08:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah afaik, but I've generally only ever used ./start.sh or loaded manualy with chain params

[30-Mar-19 08:06 AM] Mylo#8306
because i'm using `~/StakedNotary`, is my `~/staked` directory now redundant?

[30-Mar-19 08:07 AM] Mylo#8306
can i start without it checking for updates?

[30-Mar-19 08:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've only really used StakedNotary, even on non notary nodes lol

[30-Mar-19 08:07 AM] Mylo#8306
ok i'll get rid of it

[30-Mar-19 08:07 AM] Mylo#8306
does StakedNotary have explorers installer?

[30-Mar-19 08:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can, but if not updated mght not notarise. worst case, itll poison notarisations.

[30-Mar-19 08:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure we got explorers up. I had a pool up, but needed that node for CC qa testing so took it down for a while

[30-Mar-19 08:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I forget if/who put their hand up for the explorer

[30-Mar-19 08:11 AM] Mylo#8306
`./assetchains` starts the ACs, `start.sh` dies with the please help human msg

[30-Mar-19 08:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
on which chain?

[30-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Mylo#8306
all & any  (except KMD) ACs.   `./start.sh` something wrong with  the `if [ ... ]` return from `./assetchains` i think.

[30-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Mylo#8306
`./start_iguana.sh` works.

[30-Mar-19 08:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
try `./assetchains.sh -reindex`

[30-Mar-19 08:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and/or `rm -rf ~/StakedNotary/komodo`

[30-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Mylo#8306
they start, just not with `./start.sh` script.

[30-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Mylo#8306
`./assetchains` starts them.

[30-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Mylo#8306
i just need some CFEK* coins to split, then wonder if i'm in the notary elected file üòÑ

[30-Mar-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if existing symlink to komodod, might be a conflict ü§∑

[30-Mar-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can send some CFEKORKL

[30-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Mylo#8306
cool, send 1 to `RXN4hoZkhUkkrnef9nTUDw3E3vVALAD8Kx` plz

[30-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Mylo#8306
does KMD split to 10000 assetoshis?

[30-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Mylo#8306
ooh rich

[30-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Mylo#8306
dw, iguana is dead.

[30-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Mylo#8306
can't split.

[30-Mar-19 08:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sent a bit extra, can stake but probably not a good idea on NN

[30-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
k thx - havn lunch

[30-Mar-19 08:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[30-Mar-19 09:27 AM] Mylo#8306
iguana is dead.  cannot split.   will troubleshoot another day

[30-Mar-19 09:27 AM] Mylo#8306
haha

[30-Mar-19 12:27 PM] Mylo#8306

for rolling dice?

[30-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Mylo#8306
well...not yet, you can set up a table on it under "contracts", but you need funds.    and it's totally open and insecure

[30-Mar-19 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, that browser security is a challenge

[30-Mar-19 12:31 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I thought about knocking up a gateways demo web portal with some valueless tokens

[30-Mar-19 12:31 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but the pubkey side of things makes it incomplete

[30-Mar-19 12:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe half web based, with instructions for user to do the other stuff through agama cli or terminal

[30-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Mylo#8306
easy to move the rpc calls from the web ui to the backend.  just a PoC for a local setting, not for web use.   if there's enough requests i can make mods...but i don't want to do much on it - it's just a sample/starter...

i toyed with the idea of porting it into this https://madewithvuejs.com/epiboard which is a chrome app....like metamask-ish

[30-Mar-19 12:33 PM] Mylo#8306
i just needed something that was easy to make docs in, so i needed to test out framework doc tools last year

[30-Mar-19 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, demos are def worthy for a few reasons. Will look into the above, keen to bridge the gap.

[30-Mar-19 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I looked at Vue last year for a wekk or so before getting stuck into django

[30-Mar-19 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Might hit the surrounding neighborhoods too

[30-Mar-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo  your complicating it so much. You just do start.sh and it does everything for you

[30-Mar-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
did era change?

No

Said to leave labs until election is over, ppl need to focus on test net and stuff

[30-Mar-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
who said?

[30-Mar-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
I mean I do agree

[30-Mar-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
just can't lose all of it's momentum. We're getting seriously caught up on a feature that we aren't very much interested in to begin with

[30-Mar-19 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
we had momom pretty stable and out of no where, it's being rewritten quite a bit

[30-Mar-19 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
for something we have very little interest in

[30-Mar-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not anything I can fix. Talk to jl I guess

[30-Mar-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We can always revert it

[30-Mar-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But that means we cannot PR back upstream ever

[30-Mar-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO just leave this and get other things done. Momentum is already lost

[30-Mar-19 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
fuck that man

[30-Mar-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Should have launched it weeks ago when  i wanted too
