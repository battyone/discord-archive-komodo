It shows vote now, but I saw no txid to even track confirms of - or am I just hopelessly missing something somewhere?

[27-May-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
you just want it to print the txid of vote tx after you do it?

[27-May-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
or show vote txid in results?

[27-May-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

the results thing is still using a workaround for the oraclessamples bug that was fixed

[27-May-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
once I removed the workaround, the results should show instantly without a conf

[27-May-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 you want txid for vote shown in results?

[27-May-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
or you want the vote txid to show after voting?

[27-May-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
some way to know that the vote is "in process" and the user is actively waiting on "something" in order to see they did it and that it's not some error that isn't showing
so, most likely the `or you want the vote txid to show after voting`

[27-May-19 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
like I said, once workaround is removed, the vote will show it results immediately

[27-May-19 02:34 PM] Nabob#5004
and also can we prevent registering twice to vote poll

[27-May-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
it doesn't matter

op err is powerful

[27-May-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I came to the conclusion trying to make things that account for all possible op errors is impossible....

It's someone claiming to be Cris. Most likely is as it was able to produce a signed message from his NN key.
I will hop on a voice call with him though to be 100%

Just noticed this part `oh that account is showing as online O.o

Please note, the `CrisF` account is down until, at least, further notice.

what the the exact error printed?

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could be... ``Error: You must register to this poll before voting. The register txid must be confirmed as well.`

[27-May-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is only 1 poll.... so I registered for the right one

do list polls and take txid from there and use oraclesinfo on it

just started update incase... that will take forever 游땐

[27-May-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
voted subjective in the poll, just to see if it worked. After update it worked.... Hopefully vote passes without my yes.

[27-May-19 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
half way there already

[27-May-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
just want to say, that it's an NN's responsibility to determine if a bounty claim is fair. Don't just jump in with the rest of the crowd, go with your gut

[27-May-19 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO, the vote was based on something subjective.... Not sure it should like that... like, "I fixed this problem" is ok, or "I found this problem" 
But "to use as he pleases, isnt really correct" 
Again my oppinion, but Im just thinking for future, with a CC, it must be objective choice.

[27-May-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That said, this is an ecellent thing for us to start with, so we should do it anyway 游땏

[27-May-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
"to use as he pleases" objectively says it's subjective :troll:

[27-May-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_thinks that maybe a future requirement would be to make the proposer, and not the voters, do math_

`1% from blocks 10080-10080*2`

1008 LABS

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
nope

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] blubbi#0643

[27-May-19 04:20 PM] blubbi#0643
100800 Labs a week * 1%

[27-May-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the reward isn't 1

[27-May-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
unless I misread the params

u missread the params !

I seem to be retarded, someone plz show me how/when it lowers to 1....

[27-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
10080 blocks per week * 10 coins per block = 100800
100800 * 0.01 = 1008

[27-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
am I missing something? 游뱎

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
10080-10080*2 is a way to show "week 2"

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
`10080*2-10080*3` "week 3", etc

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
for some reason I saw his 1008 as 108 and that he said 'yes 1' when I said 'not 1' just feked my brain all up 游땥

[27-May-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is 1% "extra coins" avalible for bounties... It can be used or it cant, for the first project we test, tony wants all of the bounty for a prize. Im cool with that, it wil be fun.

[27-May-19 04:33 PM] Alright#0419
just to clarify, it's not actually 10 coins per block. It's 8 coins per block and 1 coin every 5 blocks for notarizations

[27-May-19 04:34 PM] Alright#0419
and to clarify even further, it's *up to* 1 coin every 5 blocks

[27-May-19 04:35 PM] Alright#0419
that's the maximum, but it can be below that if notarizations aren't exactly every 5 blocks

[27-May-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`8 coins per block and 1 coin every 5 blocks`

[27-May-19 04:38 PM] blubbi#0643
but still 100.800 Labs a week ? 游뱂

[27-May-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
the absolute maximum would be 101808/week, this assumes that a notarization happened every 5 blocks and the full bounty amount was claimed

[27-May-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
it will almost always be less than 100800 because notarizations don't happen every 5 blocks sometimes

[27-May-19 04:42 PM] blubbi#0643
now im confused

[27-May-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
if its 10.080 blocks a 8 Labs and 2.016 blocks with notarization nd bounty

[27-May-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
im far away from 100.800

[27-May-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
ok, assume a week is 10080 blocks(1 minute per block)
every single block 8 coins are made no matter what. This is the POW/POS distribution.

Now, notaries are paid via the ac_notarypay mechanism. Meaning every notarization they make, whichever notaries made that notarization, split 1 coin. The quickest notarizations will happen is 5 blocks.

I wrote in detail how it works here

but notarizations can be slower than 5 blocks

that make sense @blubbi ?

[27-May-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
every reason my point was that instead of
`1% from blocks 10080-10080*2`
vote proposals should read
`approx. x coins total taken from blocks 10080-10080*2 in the form of y%`

[27-May-19 04:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
I hope thats a joke joker

[27-May-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's easiest to just say cap is 1008/week for bounties

I think it's much simpler to simply say the cap for bounties is 1008/week rather than literal 1% on top of emissions
