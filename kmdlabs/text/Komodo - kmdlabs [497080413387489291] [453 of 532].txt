(trying mining as getting  `no ( -> CFEKLOTTO1) utxo: need to fund address.(ADDRESS) or wait for splitfund to confirm`)

[29-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice are you using the same komodod binary each time?

[29-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
start.sh will use `~StakedNotary/lotto/komodod`

[29-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
try launching with that komodod and see if p2p port is still different

[29-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
if so, params are wrong somehow

[29-Jul-19 01:17 PM] CMaurice#1685
yep ¬¨~/StakedNotary$ ./komodo/lotto/komodod`

[29-Jul-19 01:18 PM] CMaurice#1685
checked through this several times now, must be something I'm missing

[29-Jul-19 01:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Could you please tag me if you guys figure this out?  I think I'm experiencing this, or at least something similar with THC on a regular node and NN (KMD). ports and magic were both different.  üôè

[29-Jul-19 01:59 PM] CrisF#3405
In my case ‚òù only difference was one used -pubkey=, and one didn't.

[29-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
different magic/ports *always* means you're either using the wrong params or different builds on the daemon with differing code

[29-Jul-19 05:07 PM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, I left out the -supply somehow. sigh.

`komodod $(./listassetchainparams | grep $coin) -pubkey=$pubkey &`

You can send less than 3 UTXO to each segid, but following redistributions may not work as expected (when you have enough coin gain to change your plan.) on LABS I have tried 1, 2 and 3 with no obvious change in success for my amount of coin.

[30-Jul-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
@psychedelete having a very hard time understanding what you wrote there

[30-Jul-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
are you saying that the split function in pos64staker hung for 9 hours?

[30-Jul-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
should happen in less than like 10 seconds, not even

[30-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
this is osx?

[30-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
it's reproducible?

[30-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Alright#0419
happens every time?

[30-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
what branch are you on?

[30-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
this sounds similar to something I experienced in restart branch, which is fixed(I thought üòÖ ) in macwintest branch

[30-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
`git branch`

[30-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
while you're in the pos64staker dir

[30-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Alright#0419

then try it again please

[30-Jul-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419

LABS now has utxo cache... pls dont sendtoaddress

[30-Jul-19 09:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@blackjok3r `pls dont sendtoaddress` so now we have to use `sendrawtransaction` to send out LABS ?

[30-Jul-19 09:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly

[30-Jul-19 09:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you sendtoaffress it could spend

[30-Jul-19 09:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
and what is utxo caching ? Please explain if you don't mind üòÖ

[30-Jul-19 09:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can fix but it seems not imporant

[30-Jul-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[30-Jul-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana needs 10000ksat utoxs

[30-Jul-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
daemon saves all of them in a vector

[30-Jul-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then pops_back

[30-Jul-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181

takeas 3 start.sh;s

[30-Jul-19 09:52 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so it's more like a stack ? does the daemon pushes utxo in the stack based on the the time order it is splitted ? for example the most recent utxos will always be found on top of the stack ?

[30-Jul-19 09:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it justtakes all utxos

[30-Jul-19 09:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then filters them

[30-Jul-19 09:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so that only 10000sat

[30-Jul-19 09:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
