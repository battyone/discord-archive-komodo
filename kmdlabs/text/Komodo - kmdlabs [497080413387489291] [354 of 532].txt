i have a pos64 question...let's say i have 64000 COIN

which is it better to do...

1 UTXO of 1000 in 64 segids
10 UTXOs of 100 in 64 segids
100 UTXOs of 10 in 64 segids

[14-Apr-19 04:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi  @ph03nix üëã
There are a few different strategies out there.  I haven't tested anything seriously yet, so have just been using a combination.
Also keen to hear what others have to say.

[14-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
@ph03nix you need to think about "will this UTXO stake within 1 month?"

[14-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
then make as many of that size as possible

[14-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
1 month is the age cap, so after that it doesn't become more likely to stake

[14-Apr-19 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
takes a bit of stats gathering and intuition to find a good size

[14-Apr-19 04:50 AM] ph03nix#3115
thank you ü§î

[14-Apr-19 04:52 AM] ph03nix#3115
how would you determine if an UTXO will stake within a month?

[14-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Alright#0419
previous staking stats and intuition

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  @CrisF  And anyone else you huys know sho is staking CFEKORKL can I please have a wallet.dat. Dont stop the node. Just copy it and contact me via DM. 
I need it quite urgently to fix a possible bug. I am 100% sure any node that has been staking for about 2-3 days getting a lot of blocks will 100% be in the state I need it to be in for this job.

[16-Apr-19 02:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got one staking heavy

[16-Apr-19 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice. I may need 2 copies. Do one where you dont stop the node. and then stop it and copy the wallet.dat again. 
I hope you used new keys for this lol

[16-Apr-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not hat i'll steal anything, but this will probably be the fastest way for me to fix this.

[16-Apr-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IUf indeed there is any problem

[16-Apr-19 03:02 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll  have a look. Think my staking node has crashed. Will check and send if have.

[16-Apr-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm if it crashed that may be even better. Just double check the keys are worthless. Between both of you one of them will be in a corrupted state.

[16-Apr-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No specific rush, but id like one by at least tomorrow.

[16-Apr-19 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Saves me making a staking chain just ti get a wallet.dat which could take a few days

Not sure whats happening. was aled to do a merge but it cant be done.

[17-Apr-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to kill entire cluster most likely as we need to totaly re fork from KMD at this point.

[17-Apr-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to be a while until I can sort out this mess. Not sure if things are working or not  if they are not done stress too much. In the next few days I will be launching a LABS test chain and 1 0BR chain to go with it.

[17-Apr-19 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely on a newly forked KMD branch equal with FSM that contains tokesn and gateways import code.

I have merged the entire LABS current master to here :https://github.com/zuluplatform/komodo/pull/2
If anything happens to it. And anyone is looking for any commits it should be here. Wont be touching it yet, as I need to get 0BR notary pay sorted still. 
We should be able to run the current chains on FSM branch of my KMD fork. Started a new branch there called `newLABS` 
I will be porting the notarypay 0BR stuff there and hopefully getting it to work without reindex.

Got index stuff working for staked chains only. No more reindex KMD required. Means we can also push this upstream I think without breaking anything. 
Once the tokens stuff and gateways stuff has been sorted out by dimxy and its merged to FSM, I will bring it to my new branch. And we can wipe out the cluster and start some LABS testnet chains for heavy testing ready for launch ü§û

This is the new branch for now. Have to wait for the merge before I can do anything to the LABS repo.

I stopped mining all the chains, it seems one or 2 have forked or something. I think I know what it was. But cant be 100% sure on it. Dont care in anycase as they are no longer required.

[17-Apr-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe the old chains could provide a final service?
Is there any anything regarding the wallet (filter) that could use testing?
Quite an honorable sacrifice to go out in a stream from the txBlaster üòâ

Hello guys, if I am elected as NN operator, I'd like to help and support you. As I wrote "Additional server for kmdlabs for testing (details to be discussed)" in my proposal, I'd like to discuss a little bit the details

[18-Apr-19 06:54 PM] phm87#7395
To be short I was thinking about using TeamCity on the server pointing to the sources repos that you want with automated integration. I played a little bit with docker but I'm noob with it and I think that you're using it.

[18-Apr-19 07:59 PM] phm87#7395
Another idea would be to pay a smaller server for kmdlabs and give some amount of KMD to support financially. Currently, I'm having a lot of fun on the 2019 NN testnet. Alright said to me that kmdlabs is an incentivited testnet of notarizations

[19-Apr-19 02:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@phm87 mostly we have a sever or two each to notarise and test things. LABs is kind of like testnet but not just ranked by notaristaion count. Chains being notarised change more often, and specific things get tested like fungible cluster coin migrations. We get the new things and try and break them üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 02:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
In terms of funding support, a few ideas have been mentioned but I'm not sure anything is difinitive just yet. Bounties for testing stuff, finding where and how it breaks and also working on the fix are pretty important

[19-Apr-19 02:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Things like maintaining the website, organising the admin side of tests and payments, and probably also some docs for reference to let more get involved are also important.

[19-Apr-19 02:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Bounties can be offered for any of the above, and there is also a multisig address that can be contributed to which will be used to fund bounties as determined/proposed and vote on by signatories and the community

[19-Apr-19 02:24 AM] gt#2812

Thank you guys. There is no emergency to define your needs here. I didn't want to write simply "give x% to kmdlabs" because I'd like to be involved (whatever it is focused on TeamCity, branches, testing or else) and help if possible. Alright and others explained me that at kmdlabs, you are paid when you break stuff so maybe a rough donation may help you more, I don't know.

[19-Apr-19 09:20 PM] phm87#7395

or use it yourself to directly help the project ofc

do you mean that a server with continuous integration won't help ? (maybe you already have enough server and your own CI stuff)

[19-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
we'll have a fund dedicated to KMD txfees, beyond that, it's up to you

[19-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
and again, it's entirely up to you, no *need* to pledge towards txfee fund

[19-Apr-19 09:25 PM] phm87#7395
If I am elected, I think that the first task will be to make the NN setup notarize fine. I heard that one month is lost doing this. So as the first month I won't have time for anything else, I think that I will send sth into the fund

Looks like the branch I pinned is ready for us to test. Need to launch a new cluster though. If anyone has time to help with this please let me know and I will sort out the github. It means a reindex/sync/CHMEX bootstrap of KMD aswell, as we are no longer incompatible with KMD chain.

if someone is avalible to launch a pair of chains for me. I will get the code ready for that. Im working on paymentsCC few days behind there and havent really got time to do that.
