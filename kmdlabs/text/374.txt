@Draeth is bimetal an option? E.g.. nickel with copper veins?

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator It is, i'm currently making a preliminary design and shot a message to some of my contacts at several manufacturers to see if what i'm wanting to do is viable

[08-May-19 02:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
personally, I'd love a gold/silver bimetal, but understand minimum mint run would make that pretty expensive all up.

[08-May-19 03:18 AM] Draeth#3300
yea, real silver alone is mad expensive. from the manufacturers i've talked to, a run of 50 coins, which is a minimum at most places that are really good at what they do, costs anywhere between $2800-$3400

[08-May-19 03:18 AM] Draeth#3300
i can only imagine what it would cost adding real gold to that would be

[08-May-19 03:33 AM] Draeth#3300
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator can you send me a link or images of your logo and other assets?

[08-May-19 03:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@CrisF would be the best bloke for that, he's done the bulk of work on website etc

[08-May-19 03:34 AM] Draeth#3300
gotcha

[08-May-19 03:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I might be interested in some dragonhound coins at some stage tho lol

[08-May-19 03:35 AM] Draeth#3300
lol

[08-May-19 03:35 AM] Draeth#3300
i'm game

[08-May-19 03:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
gezz that's a fair premium over silver spot for mintage, but the cost of making the stamp etc is fair enough. You'd need thousands of coins minted to spread that out. For these tho, not looking at nusmatic collector value, more of a faminly heirloom üòÑ

[08-May-19 06:04 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Draeth ,I'll get you a logo in a little bit.

[08-May-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`You received 2107571.36946405 in the last snapshot`
Seems to be working pretty well so far. Guess need to decide a cut off time for the game to end.

[08-May-19 07:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nice haul. How leaderboard?

[08-May-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that may be a problem lol

[08-May-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because there are so many address its hard to know who sent what to where... Would take a pretty comprehensive bloclchain analysis to work out. Have to get the list of starting address then follow each vout until u get to chain tip

[08-May-19 07:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
guess can only tell if everyone merges to main address or posts it here. chain analysis seems a lot of loops otherwise.

Nice... So someone got it working with pools and GPU then?

[08-May-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From the looks of that @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  your going to well and truly win if we don't let the game continue for a decent amount of time.

[08-May-19 07:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it was either automate or not sleep üòÑ

[08-May-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well that was what I figured everyone would do. Its defiantly a game that would be dominated by bots if it were to become a thing. I guess I should either restart it now ppl know what to do, or call the end a week from today or maybe a few days less.

[08-May-19 07:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
script is nothing more than using parts of `shrapnel` to act on `getcurrentranks` data

[08-May-19 07:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if my lead is high enough, will PR it üòÑ

[08-May-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hahaha... No worries with you winning, was going yo give u some labs anyway. Do we know how many ppl actually split? I haven't really checked it much.

[08-May-19 08:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how many addresses created at start of game?

[08-May-19 08:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I have no staked4 airdrop, so gotta catch up!

Thie prize for this will be more than my staked airdrop, haha.

[08-May-19 08:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
http://oracle.earth/payments_game/ was a decent rough early warning system

[08-May-19 08:02 AM] CrisF#3405
I've split every day.

[08-May-19 08:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Got my first payout on the last drop.

[08-May-19 08:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
based on that graph, 13 addresses not split

[08-May-19 08:03 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I've tried - but we'll behind the curve and no automation.

[08-May-19 08:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Back to the grind so busy as.

[08-May-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK. Well I guess we call it in 2 days. I'll need to figure out what block you should merge back to your starting address by a bit later on and post announcement here. I would say smk has a lead that cannot be beaten so continuing for too long is just wasting peoples time.

[08-May-19 08:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
awww, I was enjoying domination

[08-May-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a good first try, but I wasn't organised enough at all, far too rushed.

[08-May-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It did test payments though enough to know that chains sync and keep consensus with daily snapshots and releases.

[08-May-19 08:17 AM] gt#2812
are we snap shotting latest labsrc or going with staked4?

[08-May-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will be staked 4, but I will be distributing some of my labs, 10k to winner here and probably 1k for anyone who actually tried to play, need to do some math on that though first.

[08-May-19 08:20 AM] gt#2812
participation trophies üèÜ

[08-May-19 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha yeah, I figure its a fair way to get some labs to they guys who were not around in staked days.

Last snapshot will be at block: 11,520
That is 3 more snapshots from now. There will be snapshots with air drops at the following blocks: 8640, 10,080. 
After the 10,080 snapshot and `paymentsrelease` has been made please send your total balance over all address back to the address you started with. 
The top address will take the prize of 10K LABS, if that is smk762, he said he will share with 2nd and 3rd in post above, so its still worth participating if you have not already. I will not get a place for a prize, I am exempt from winning anything. 
I will also give a total of 5k LABS split over everyone who actually participated. If your balance has not been split for the airdrop @ 8640, you do not get anything üòÉ That leaves approx 12H from now to split to be elegible to get a participation award üòÑ

Did u put up an address? If not ask @CrisF  for a private key

I have a public key for the game if you'd like @CMaurice .

[08-May-19 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
(I'll also know the key, so you'll have to play some trust.)

[08-May-19 12:41 PM] CMaurice#1685

set your address and variance in script, and make sure your list.json has more addresses than script needs for sending around the cluster

Hey all! Here's what I was thinking for the front of the coin. The black portions are the raised parts of the coin, and the gold is like the gold in the reference picture that runs through the metal. What do you think? https://imgur.com/fRihewp

@Draeth you said `costs anywhere between $2800-$3400` for silver coins

[09-May-19 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
what exactly was that quote for?

[09-May-19 12:15 AM] Draeth#3300
for a .999 silver pirate coin i'm making

[09-May-19 12:16 AM] Alright#0419
how many are you making, estimate on price/coin?

[09-May-19 12:16 AM] Draeth#3300
total of 50 coins

[09-May-19 12:17 AM] Draeth#3300
the die cost alone for both sides were like $1800

[09-May-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
just tell me to fuck off if you don't have it priced out yet, just wondering silver/coin and price/coin

[09-May-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
and are you individually numbering them?

[09-May-19 12:22 AM] Draeth#3300
I'm probably going to sell them for about $75-$80/coin
