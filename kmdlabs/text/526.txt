[29-Nov-19 07:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[29-Nov-19 07:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that your address?

[29-Nov-19 07:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and the explorer says different
"RVsqc6bkCEju9XVNcBG1xjo69zvKFgVENn",

[29-Nov-19 07:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
did the send output a tx hash?

[29-Nov-19 07:27 PM] daemonfox#6136

[29-Nov-19 07:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[29-Nov-19 07:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like I need 11 blocks to do all the  txs

[29-Nov-19 07:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
CG script says it -- so It  has to be true

[29-Nov-19 07:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Finding UTXOS in 258890 blocks to consolidate ...
Found 9430 UTXOs.... 6 seconds
This will take 11 transaction(s) to complete....

[29-Nov-19 07:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
ahi so it isnt done

[29-Nov-19 07:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i thought it was magically automaticlly there in 1 block

[29-Nov-19 07:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok - maybe I should start  over

[29-Nov-19 07:55 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

will fix any nodes that weren't updated when the fork happened

[29-Nov-19 09:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Does that help?

[29-Nov-19 09:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll figure it out

[29-Nov-19 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy do you have a node that forked?

[29-Nov-19 09:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
think that was aimed at me...

[29-Nov-19 09:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
we were talking about KOcean latest binaries and LABS

[29-Nov-19 09:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
I synced it from scratch but ti hangs at 10-31 blocks from the HF

[29-Nov-19 09:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah  -  i  was  - im still working on getting KO to load with parameters

[29-Nov-19 09:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
in linux

[29-Nov-19 09:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
im resyncing my staking win node again from scratch with the OG binaroies from HF

[29-Nov-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`what does consolidate.sh do again? `
 it takes all of your UTXOs and transfers them to 1 address in as few UTXOs as it can

[29-Nov-19 09:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
found  that out -- lol -- now I have stuck raw transactions I have to deal with -- I  think Im getting it

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think  they need signed and resent

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
this is my guess

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`now I have stuck raw transactions I have to deal with`
are they showing on the explorer?

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
nope

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
only showed up in the bash  output

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then what makes you say they are "stuck"?

[29-Nov-19 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but I reset my  computer

[29-Nov-19 09:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
umm they never went into my wallet

[29-Nov-19 09:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
in explorer

[29-Nov-19 09:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and sendmany said  i didnt have enough whatever

[29-Nov-19 09:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
listunspent only showed 2  transactions

[29-Nov-19 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
>are they showing on the explorer?
>>nope
>>but I reset my computer
then they do not exist, they aren't "stuck"

[29-Nov-19 09:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[29-Nov-19 09:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just got back to the system

[29-Nov-19 09:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i need to look at the status

[29-Nov-19 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you close your wallet and a transaction isn't in anyone's mempool, then it's as if you never made it

[29-Nov-19 09:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok --- so ---everything should be alghight now as soon as LABS syncs  again

[29-Nov-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you should have your full balance; if not, then run daemon with `-zapwallettxes`

[29-Nov-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that will do a 100% rescan

[29-Nov-19 09:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like its here -   still  waiting

[29-Nov-19 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in the future, never restart your computer in the middle of doing things 游땥

[29-Nov-19 09:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
says  18  hours behind

[29-Nov-19 09:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[30-Nov-19 12:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
