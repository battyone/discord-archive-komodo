does anyone see `"notaryname"` in getinfo on their NN?

[25-May-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 `so with these params -ac_reward=0,0,800000000, it means no block reward until 3rd era? and 3rd era is after block 10080 -ac_end=128,10080,0?`
ac_halving=1 set for an era is a special case

[25-May-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
so ac_halving 1 for era 2 makes it grow linearly from 0 to 800000000

[25-May-19 08:14 AM] CrisF#3405
not here.

[25-May-19 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
so 
block 1, STAKED4 coins
block 2-128, 0 BR
block 129-10079, grows linearly from 0-8 coins
block 10080 onward, 8 coins

not sure cris, how long have you had it up?

[25-May-19 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
anything interesting from iguana output?

[25-May-19 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice are you having trouble staking as well?

[25-May-19 08:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
@Alright yeah, but it's probably a technical issue: from the pos64staker tutorial I don't see how to restart a daemon with the required parameters

[25-May-19 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
what tutorial?

[25-May-19 08:30 AM] CMaurice#1685
I mean start the daemon while keeping the NN daaemons running on the same machine

[25-May-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
are you using restart branch or master

[25-May-19 08:31 AM] CMaurice#1685
@jorian advised I could use -datadir to run separate daemons

[25-May-19 08:32 AM] CMaurice#1685
master

[25-May-19 08:32 AM] jorian#4555
well i posed it as a possibility

[25-May-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
I haven't maintained master branch in months

[25-May-19 08:32 AM] jorian#4555
i advise to just use another machine, but it's possible to do it on the same machine

[25-May-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
the TUI should be relatively simple to set up

[25-May-19 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
just need to copy assetchains.json from StakedNotary to pos64staker dir

[25-May-19 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
copy LABS komodod to that dir as well

[25-May-19 08:33 AM] CMaurice#1685
oho will give it a go

[25-May-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
then install dependencies, start `./TUIstaker.py` 
select `start a chain from assetchains.json`, type `LABS`
open up LABS menu, do `genaddresses`
fund the node then do `RNDsendmany`
then do `restart daemon with -blocknotify`

[25-May-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
wait for it to come up and do `setgenerate true 0`

[25-May-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
probably need some hacks or starting it manually with blocknotify if you're doing datadir thing

[25-May-19 08:50 AM] CMaurice#1685
yep, but I think I have a ruined pip install: `You are using pip version 18.1, however version 19.1.1 is available.`

@Alright tuistaker is asking for a staker.conf?

[25-May-19 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
hmm I'll have to fix that

[25-May-19 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
oh are you starting from assetchains.json

[25-May-19 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
then it's saying that?

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
`echo [] > staker.conf` should do it

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] gcharang#6833
start a chain from assetchains.json -> I don't see this option
```
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'staker.conf'
No staker.conf conf file, specify a chain to begin:
```
is what I am seeing

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
yea that assumes you added another coin already

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
I can fix it

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
if you just do add/remove first

[25-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
type LABS

[25-May-19 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
then do it again, it'll work

oh, you're getting that immediately after running it?

[25-May-19 09:02 AM] Alright#0419

It was just this:

after adding staker.conf with `[]`
