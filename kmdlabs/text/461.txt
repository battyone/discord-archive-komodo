@blackjok3r will kmdlabs need a planned update (everyone stops, change of port, everyone updates and starts) ? Or will we update asap when we are notified ?
If a planned HF sould be done on mainet NN, maybe we should also do a planned update on kmdlabs NN

[08-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS will hard fork frist... Its much better to break LABS than KMD üòÑ

[08-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still having problems with nodes not starting dpow rounds at the same time...

[08-Aug-19 03:59 PM] phm87#7395
I agree abt labs before kmd.
But last time, each labs nn updated but not on the same time. I though that on mainet, we should do it at the same time (jl777 talked abt a period without nota between old and new iguana)

[08-Aug-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it must be at the same time becuase its hard forking... Probably need to do half the nodes first or something, depends how much testing we can do before it needs to go live.

[08-Aug-19 05:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
Let me known in advance so I can inform Graviex if the daemon needs to be updated

[08-Aug-19 05:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think daemon does... its all in iguana.

`NOOB warning`
Hi, I'm trying to make a script an having trouble finding info on how to do it.  I don't know what search terms to use to find answers.
I have a `.txt` file of data I'd like to use.  I'm trying to figure out how to make a script that will use the data.
for example:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=${<COIN NAMES FROM .TXT>} getbalance```
so it will show results for all coins I add to .txt.

[09-Aug-19 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cat txttile.txt | while read coins; do
        echo $coins
        komodo-cli -ac_name=$coins getbalance    
  done

[09-Aug-19 02:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Thank you üôè

[09-Aug-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
np. I litterally just wrote something that does that a few hours ago

Yeah I've been planning to do this for ages but things keep coming up...

[09-Aug-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like forgot most of it... spent most of the day looking though old scruipts and picking random stuff out. Its not pretty but, I can launch an entire notary network with like 64 nodes in a few hours now. üòÉ

[09-Aug-19 02:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, one of these days :abusedsmily:

[09-Aug-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo  
I have a testnet notary network up with 22 nodes and I need to increase that. What was it exactly that you wanted to test out, maybe we cna kill 2 birds here? I have 90% of the stuff automated so its not that bad, the worst part was copy pasting all the IPs from AWS website into my script.

This branch sees the notarisations. 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST1 getNotarisationsForBlock 4753`
Interesting pattern which nodes are chosen.

no worries mate, should be able to setup today, will check code

[10-Aug-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@blackjok3r your example above uses `TEST1` chain.

[10-Aug-19 05:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Which chain(s) do you want visualised?

[10-Aug-19 05:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and is this LABs native yet or still on your personal NN network? If the latter, I'll either need to join it or give you code to push json to an oracle

Yes its still running on teh network I made on AWS. I can give you a node if you need one I have 58 of them üòÖ  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[10-Aug-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For now just TEST1.
`https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/StakedNotary/blob/master/assetchains.json`

[10-Aug-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should have almost enough notas if its still working to be able to conclude a result.

[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[10-Aug-19 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@blackjok3r which chain am I supposed to be running `getNotarisationsForBlock` on?
tried 20 blocks of TEST1, but got no info returned. Running on KMD gives me standard ecosys coins, different edpending on block, but cant see TEST1. Running on LABS gives me KMD/LABS in some blocks, but thats about it.
``` komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST1 getNotarisationsForBlock 6230
{
  "KMD": [
  ],
  "LABS": [
  ]
}
```

[10-Aug-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
YOU need to use the nn_testnet branch of komodo

[10-Aug-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I put the notary keys into it, in place of LABS NN

[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
updated and rebuit, but KMD still running from before

[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we can determine that its working as intended, then I think we can move to implementing it on LABS NN and shutdown this network. Everything seems to still be wokring fine still. NO node crashes and all nodes are keeping in consenus well.

I assume not all blocks return data, only ntx blocks

[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how best to determine which to query?

[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. I was just using the stdout prints. eg. 
```[TEST1] ht.6232 txi.1 signedmask.1bff81 numvins.13 numvouts.2 <<<<<<<<<<<  notarized
[TEST1] matched.1 VALID (TEST1) MoM.34baf8c07f50160b3fd9ea4ece6a32e91227f8af9858cee304b45b480d3af4eb [6229] CCid.0
[TEST1] ht.6232 NOTARIZED.6230 TEST1.0022e94843caea4eaf36bea327fe27f054e540e290ec873e0cc37493d15189f0 KMDTXID.b281d2f52f2c04b05419be850be8814f7c2959ea06c456e7ce89dc46e1fd61d3 lens.(110 113) MoM.34baf8c07f50160b3fd9ea4ece6a32e91227f8af9858cee304b45b480d3af4eb 6229

ah cool üòÉ

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it would need a resync to see all previous blocks

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll just code it to loop over blocks until one is found

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
adds it to the DB as its syncing

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, that is the way to do it.

[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
First nota was after block 4000

[10-Aug-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are at 6200, so more than 2000 blocks of data, should be enough to see if there is something wrong

[10-Aug-19 09:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, gimme a bit I'll get a summary then vis it. then work on live updates.

[10-Aug-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
network itself is quite stable if if the banned node doesnt participate... May need to test that a bit more yet... Not 100% required, in any case, if it doenst work great I will just disable it for now

[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just need a tally of counts, and maybe some way to see easily if the nodes chosen for bestmask are rotating properly.. I saw that it was starting at some node number, for the first vin in the tx, and slowly increasing this by 1 every round.... But the lower number nodes appeard to get more notaa. NOt enough sample size to know for sure though.

[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do bans show up in rpc output?

[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no banning happening atm. It is hard coded to just ban node 5. Which is turned off atm

[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The ban works, but I think it was having trouble reaching consensus when a node was banned.

[10-Aug-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
May be enough to just detect bad sigs and just notify the OP.

[10-Aug-19 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rather than banning..

[10-Aug-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We just never had any easy way to detect bad sigs, its was a manul process that took hours for each tx, so I automated it inside iguana itself using some magic code from nSPV.

[10-Aug-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
making a node actually produce bad sigs wasnt as easy as I thaught it would be, so I just banned node 5 in the code lol
