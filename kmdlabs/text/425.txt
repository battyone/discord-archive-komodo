that is very nice and fast!

Wow!

[12-Jun-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if this works relialy I can remove heaps of code iguana side aswell which will speed t up even more. Maybe I can get back cometetive my making MORE optimizations

[12-Jun-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
these kind of things are simplyt not somehting that can be merged to KMD/SuperNET either, it would break lots of other things.

[12-Jun-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said cleanwallettransacitons was never meant ot be merged and ended up in s astable enough state so who knows.

[12-Jun-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is on a 600GB SAS HDD aswell not SSD. which makes it even more impressive. With something like this in BTC, runnig the BTC node on a HDD to save many $$$ may be possible

Very impressive what you already have done I believe a year ago you started coding for the first time?

[12-Jun-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly. But I hadnt done it for many years. Did a fair bit of VB6 (like genie) in highschool. Made heaps of random crap, like a pong game and some other things that were not useful.

[12-Jun-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I estimate though, that I spent 2-3 years worth of time in the 18months I have been doing this, most days were more than 12H. And I didnt have that many off.

[12-Jun-19 01:42 PM] CHMEX#0686

yeah it really is struggling lately. The server hasnt been power cycled in nearly 200 days tough, maybe its just broken

on a staking node, how could my `getbalance` balance bes less than my `getbalance64` balance?

[12-Jun-19 03:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
Can you post and print?

[12-Jun-19 03:11 PM] CMaurice#1685
you want my balances?

[12-Jun-19 03:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
Getbalance and the first few lines of getbalance64

[12-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Nabob#5004
Make sure  you imported all addresss to your wallet while staking

[12-Jun-19 03:14 PM] CMaurice#1685
it was a fresh wallet, no imports

[12-Jun-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe they just take a diffrent type of listunspetn internally... like the depth in chain etc.

[12-Jun-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To test it properly, you would nede to take the balance at a height, and then import all the keys again using `stopat=` to sync up to the same height and see if the balances are diffrent

[12-Jun-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will tell you if the wallet "lost track" of any utxos

[12-Jun-19 03:31 PM] CMaurice#1685
thanks, hope I'll get time ot explore

[12-Jun-19 03:32 PM] CMaurice#1685

what version of pos64staker TUI works?

[12-Jun-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
apparently its the restart branch of KMDLabs

[12-Jun-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I never got it working mself... I just kept the script I first made and used them.

[12-Jun-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok sucessfully split 700 UTXOS on WLC and listunspent is still 0.07s 游땏 it actually works

this si the simplest solution to the problem ever, but it breaks most things. So we cant merge it to the main repo

yeah, that took me a day, depends on your Python install, 3.6 and pip3 install required

3.6.8

[12-Jun-19 04:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`python3 -V` must return Python 3.6.8 or above in order for it to work correctly, some VPS install Python 3.5 by default, this guide helped me switching the default python3  to Python 3.6.8 <http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/>

Well I used debian9 for basically everything now, maybe thats why I couldnt get it working

[12-Jun-19 04:17 PM] CMaurice#1685
pos64 TUIstaker works on my Debian 9, there's a problem with the Debian 9 installed python required for all the sys stuff so I compiled 3.6.8 from source, and created an env

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 have you tried virtual env ?

[12-Jun-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@gcharang vert or physical isn't going to stop it from breaking when someone decides to write a script that requires breaking the OS for no other reason than creating a random number

[12-Jun-19 04:29 PM] jorian#4555
can we bury CFEKBET1? can't even sync from another node i have

[12-Jun-19 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can stop BET1 if you like, but it cant be fixed if we stop it

[12-Jun-19 04:30 PM] gcharang#6833
virtual env in python is like nvm for javascript
it isolates the python/pip/module versions available for a specific directory without affecting the OS default Python versions

I too borked one ubuntu install trying to mess with python versions
but virtual env helped me

We will get back to it. Im pretty sure I broke it, when i tried to fix the sync problem everyone was complaningn about. 
I think Ive moved the validation to a place where it is missing some needed data. tricky thing to fix it seems

[12-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Jun-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  about the pos64 thing, I also had troubles with python 3.5 vs 3.6, I followed the link mentionned by PHBA2061 but I also had to add things:
```pip3 install python-bitcoinlib```
And if I have an error about permissions in red, I execute the same command with ``--user``

[12-Jun-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
I also added ``pip3 install bitcoin`` but I don't think that it is useful

[12-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jorian#4555
i bootstrapped cfekbet1 and now it's working

[12-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jorian#4555
anyways, what do we do with it? test it? has anyone tested it? :abusedsmily:

[12-Jun-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its broken now so I doubt it will work. Last time I checked it, after i pushed the change the chain forked, and the longer chain is printing millions of errors on every block

I have 16 LABS coins that I just mined, should I divide 16 by 64 then divide by a chosen size of UTXOs (10) to obtain ``the amount of UTXOs to send to each segid`` ?

[12-Jun-19 04:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no leave it at 1 utxo of 16

[12-Jun-19 04:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the utxo must be over 1 coin in size to stake

[12-Jun-19 04:54 PM] phm87#7395
oh ... so if I have less than 64 coins, I can't use the pos64 without tricks

[12-Jun-19 04:55 PM] phm87#7395
I'll buy some LABS to have 64 coins and do the pos64 thing

[12-Jun-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I split mine too low... sizes of between 50 and 100ish. I am not staking very much with that size

[12-Jun-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your better off having large utxos rather thn millions of small ones.

[12-Jun-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont NEED to split to all 64 segids... 
in fact I had some CFEK chains that staked over 50,000 blocks from a single address.

[12-Jun-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you just stake less, if they are not divided... 
If you have small balance, pick a few segids far apart and split a large amount to each.

[12-Jun-19 04:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
interesting to know
