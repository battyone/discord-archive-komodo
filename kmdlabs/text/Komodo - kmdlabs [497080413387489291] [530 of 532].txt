there is some code that was written for maramara that splits utxos across segids, trying to get this working for normal pos64. After that we won't need external scripts at all

[04-Dec-19 07:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ill  go back to watching  tv --

[04-Dec-19 07:04 AM] Alright#0419

ill  keep my eyes open for any  help  I can add

[04-Dec-19 07:05 AM] Alright#0419
you could help us organize an incentivized test for a CFEK chain

[04-Dec-19 07:05 AM] Alright#0419
been slacking on this a bit, need to do it similar to the original pos64tests

[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
what you mean

[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] Alright#0419
yea... I'll setup a repo for that now

[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] Alright#0419
but when pos64 was first designed, we held a couple competitions/stress tests

[04-Dec-19 07:07 AM] Alright#0419
it's where LABS was conceived

[04-Dec-19 07:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
awsome

[04-Dec-19 07:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill check it all out

[04-Dec-19 07:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have a HUGE realestate deal to try  to close tomorrow

[04-Dec-19 07:08 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have to scram

[04-Dec-19 07:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Make sure you pin whatever it is you need to be  done

[04-Dec-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
yea will have it ready in a few, just need to write out instructions

Hi @Oszy, re: `Can we ask graviex to change the name Labscoin to KMDLabs?`
Coin name is `LABS`, project is `KMDLabs`.  `KMDLabs(LABS)` has been used too.
Did you get and answer to who made the listing?

[04-Dec-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
will ask

[04-Dec-19 08:34 AM] Oszy#5734
üëç

[04-Dec-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
it's just their internal name for it, doesn't *really* matter

[04-Dec-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
but doesn't hurt to ask

[04-Dec-19 08:35 AM] Oszy#5734
Thought it would be better, if someone doesn't know the project, like when you claim from the Faucet. 
If you search for Labs coin nothing comes up in google, if you put KMDLabs in you find a lot of info.

[04-Dec-19 08:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Would something like this work, `KMDLabs(LABS)` possibly with a space, until we make a name for `LABS`? I got info with the full name and coin in duckduckgo.

[04-Dec-19 08:42 AM] CrisF#3405
We can use variations depending on the context.

[04-Dec-19 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
anyone have a few minutes to test something for upcoming pos64 comp?

[04-Dec-19 08:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I do.

[04-Dec-19 08:43 AM] Alright#0419
will push code in like 5-10 minutes for it, will ping you

if you get that far, let me know

[04-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
what's it's doing is creating a "dummy" daemon, generating addresses/keys on it then killing it

[04-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
after you run entercomp.py, you should be able to just do `git add participants.json` then commit it and PR it

[04-Dec-19 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
komodo-cli -ac_name=DUMMY stop

run entercomp again and let it fail 

then do `ps aux | grep DUMMY`

[04-Dec-19 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
does it output anything?

[04-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
oh `Connection refused'` would indicate daemon is up, but won't accept rpc call ü§î

[04-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
ok, daemon not up

[04-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
look at `/tmp/DUMMY`

[04-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
is it empty?

[04-Dec-19 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
does it exist at all?

`cat: /tmp/DUMMY/: Is a directory`#

[04-Dec-19 09:04 AM] Oszy#5734
empty

[04-Dec-19 09:10 AM] Oszy#5734
looks like it doesn't start.
`print('Waiting for daemon to respond, please wait')`
this line from stakerlib isn't showing in my output

[04-Dec-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF you seeing the same?

[04-Dec-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
don't understand how that's possible

[04-Dec-19 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
@Oszy chuck some prints in this function and try it again please https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/dd2a0933726692197557e2aad3ab570769189b0f/stakerlib.py#L534

it getting this far 
```
  File "./entercomp.py", line 20, in <module>
    print(rpc.getinfo())
```
means it got past that function but didn't start daemon

[04-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
need to figure out how, it should have printed *something* if it failed

[04-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
see how far it gets in that function if you can please

[04-Dec-19 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
none of my prints get shown from stakerlib

[04-Dec-19 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
in entercomp, it goes past both the daemon start and rpc call

[04-Dec-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is daemonized, it probably goes to the logfile

[04-Dec-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
print to stderr to show on screen

[04-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
yea, it won't show stdout of daemon that way, but something wrong with that py function if it's finishing and not starting daemon or throwing error

[04-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Oszy#5734
I used sys.stderr.write

[04-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
@Oszy you have all the depends from readme installed?

[04-Dec-19 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
still sorting out a server

[04-Dec-19 09:24 AM] Oszy#5734
let me check, I should have because i used pos64staker before on this pc

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Oszy#5734
everything is installed

[04-Dec-19 09:27 AM] Alright#0419

[04-Dec-19 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
what os?

[04-Dec-19 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
will try to reproduce it I guess

[04-Dec-19 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
still doesn't make sense to me though

[04-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Oszy#5734
Ubuntu 18.04.2

[04-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
if you put a print at the very top of start_daemon function, is it printed?

[04-Dec-19 09:29 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

[04-Dec-19 09:29 AM] Alright#0419
add them all throughout the function and see how far it gets?

[04-Dec-19 09:29 AM] Oszy#5734

[04-Dec-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
