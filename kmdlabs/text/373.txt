I think I'm on a fork, I'm using `KMDLabs/komodo` daemon, `master` branch, and launch the chain with 
```
komodod -ac_name=CFEKPAY -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenables=240 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_snapshot=1440 -ac_founders_reward=1000000000000000 -ac_founders=1440 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -earlytxid=ece9a5ecbcdedf1ec47ffa7e6fd7b7079780c1db36aa4b187e6a07f039105ae3

[06-May-19 02:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is there anything wrong ?

[06-May-19 02:37 PM] gt#2812
i find it easiest to build and launch from

[06-May-19 02:37 PM] gt#2812
```https://github.com/KMDLabs/staked```

[06-May-19 02:38 PM] gt#2812
you can start chain from assetchains.json with

[06-May-19 02:38 PM] gt#2812
```./start.sh 'chain' noconfig```

[06-May-19 02:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
thanks, will try it

[06-May-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
``` ./getcurrentranks.py
You have: 0 addresses within the range 383 - 553 in the current daily snapshot
Balance of bottom address: 2081789.00000000
Balance of top address: 1197278.00000000

Your address currently fall into the following range: 252-3993
Bottom balance: 1590175.00000000
Top Balance: 136601.00000000

There are : 7238 addresses on chain at block: 5487
This is the middle address right now: {'addr': 'RRsNeQWLpdY7G6SLXNJeNmMRKYeCb1o9rW', 'segid': 40, 'amount': '154558.00000000'}
You should use 3247.262286759862 addresses to cluster them in the middle, with your current balance of: 501890364.5170308
```

[06-May-19 03:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
hm, I think the problem is my node can't discover other nodes to sync

[06-May-19 03:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so it stuck at block 0

[06-May-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
k

[06-May-19 03:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
could you give me your node IP ? so I could try to add it manually

[06-May-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its in the json, so maybe it banned  you clearing in a min

[06-May-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
done

[06-May-19 03:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok it starts syncing after manually adding nodes

[06-May-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
does it get stuck at 2700 or so for you? seems to take an eternity to validate some blocks there for me

[06-May-19 03:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530
doesn't seem so, it's at 5499 already

[06-May-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
great üòÉ

[06-May-19 03:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok now I have to learn how to actually play this game üòÇ

[06-May-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well I can tell yoiu that the script I posted is wrong... it told me to make 3192 addresses so I did üòÇ  and its saying to make more now.... clearly wrong math

[06-May-19 03:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lol üòÇ

[06-May-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure ive covered the entire range perfectly... but it will only take a few tx as big as mine to toally change it

[06-May-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will ü§£  if the random number gnerates a really small range again

[06-May-19 11:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Range changes after you change the balance of addresses. So aiming at a moving target

[07-May-19 02:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
You win the pool @blackjok3r ?

[07-May-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure I went to sleep

[07-May-19 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just woke up lol, getting food and coffee then will check this out...

[07-May-19 05:48 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I really need to write down the RPC commands for this - something about payments

[07-May-19 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```
paymentsfund "[%22createtxid%22,amount(,useopret)]"
paymentsinfo "[%22createtxid%22]"
paymentslist
paymentsrelease "[%22createtxid%22,amount]"
```

[07-May-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Those are the relevent things.

[07-May-19 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Weird, it says that I have 1000 address in the range, but I didnt get anything lol...

[07-May-19 06:06 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I got 135.5K - I was looking to see what the release was

[07-May-19 06:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
looks like I got 232k and didnt notice because it was too small to change the first 3 numbers of my balance.

[07-May-19 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm maybe I did get something then lol

[07-May-19 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah got a bunch of 4300 payments. Seems range paid was liek 1374 address this time.

[07-May-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems we may need some additions to the script. There is some critical info missing from display output, will push an update shortly.

[07-May-19 07:11 AM] zatJUM#9924
I believe I had some too, this time: `500004372.14152137`

[07-May-19 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like you got 1 üòÉ

[07-May-19 07:21 AM] zatJUM#9924
`paymentsinfo` isn't supposed to tell where the airdrop went?

[07-May-19 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it only shows the range, you need to do `getsnapshot -1` to get the richlist then match up your address with that. the getrankings script tells you this/.

[07-May-19 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just trying to work out how to get the last snapshot txid easily... Then will update script with some more infos

[07-May-19 07:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
There's no information of where the payment went to? The only way is to analyse addresses balance vs snapshot -1 to calculate?

[07-May-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes im adding this now

[07-May-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt have much time to do that yesterday, just wanted to get someth9ing oput for you guys to spit properly

I think this now has enough info to play properly. I cannot win btw, so It would be good if you guys can work it out. Seem to have taken half the last release or so, using 1024 addresses.

```You received 0.0 in the last snapshot``` Seems false!

[07-May-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm...

[07-May-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Try git pull and run it again?

[07-May-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses list.json so if you changed your address allocations after the snapshot ti cant work out the balance any more.

[07-May-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easiest way to track it, will be to cron `getbalance` to append to a file each 12H or something I would say.

I see... I generated addresses but didn't fund them, and it's my NNLabs address that was in the range...

Hi guys,
I've contacted @Draeth about creating a Labs coin that would look something like what we talked about, and @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator found an amazing picture for: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497080413387489291/574832392385069075/Kintsukuroi.png

[07-May-19 12:29 PM] CrisF#3405
Before he spends much time on figuring out how to do it, we'd better decide how serious we are about making an order.

[07-May-19 12:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I believe the minimum order is 20 coins.  Is that correct @Draeth ?

[07-May-19 12:31 PM] Draeth#3300
Yep that's correct

[07-May-19 12:31 PM] Draeth#3300
Well, mimimum of 20 spread among however many orders

You can check out the  KMD, PIRATE & VERUS coins he's made on his website, `https://physicalcryptocoins.com/`

[07-May-19 12:35 PM] Draeth#3300
I also just designed one for k64 and hempcoin

[07-May-19 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah those looked really good too!

[07-May-19 12:37 PM] CrisF#3405
How would you make a coin that has the look of the bowl in the picture?

[07-May-19 12:42 PM] Draeth#3300
Essentially,  I'm gonna add color to specific parts of the coin that are also reversed on the opposite side,  so it looks like it goes all the way through

[07-May-19 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool, would the color be metal?

[07-May-19 12:45 PM] Draeth#3300
Im thinking shiny silver,  with a duo-tone shiny gold in certain areas that are shown reversed on the opposite side to make it look like it goes through the coin

`./komodod -ac_name=TESTDP -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_reward=10000000 -ac_nk=96,5 -ac_blocktime=20 -ac_cc=2 -ac_snapshot=50 -ac_sapling=1  -testnode=1 -gen -genproclimit=1 -pubkey=02bcc4d2734c923e67fc20e821d13ebd4b161efc4c0ad7910ddaae8cee71821cba`
Anyone can use this chain to test the merge RPC. Just untar the tgz in ~/.komodo and then run komodod from this repo and branch: https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/tree/jl777
The goal, is to fund the payments plan with paymentsfund RPC, then merge and prevent a paymentsrelease or burn coins.
The merged utxos should lock for an extra 10 blocks, giving enough time to make a paymentsrelease, beofre someone merges again. Also try to send to another address and burn the coins.
Try to txflood the payments plan üòÑ

what is this merge rpc

[07-May-19 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[07-May-19 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
probably told me when I was half awake already

[07-May-19 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
rough couple days üò´

[07-May-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it merges all utxos in the 2 payments address to the txidpubkey address. Because without this extremly la4rge airdrops cant happen, 3999 vout and 1 vin is the limit.

[07-May-19 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
Ah right

[07-May-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
what is txidpubkey address?

[07-May-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to do some tricky shit to get it to work, surprised it works tbh. lol

[07-May-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
no idea how to debug it

[07-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
how to reproduce: run your pool on KMD :troll:

[07-May-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when you create the payments plan, it makes a txid... this is taken and reveresed and converted into a pubkey with an unknown private key. Using a 1of2 CC, the payments global address can spend it based on validation

[07-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
idk if it's the pool even doing it

[07-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
but it happened again

[07-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
need to keep better logs from nomp and wait for it to happen again

[07-May-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems to be caused by a wrong clock... like the pool hasnt fetched a new blocktemplate fast enough, OR the getblocktemplate is returning the wrong time.

[07-May-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with changes to 200 nExpiryHeight a lot of these weird bugs will just go away

[07-May-19 09:17 PM] zatJUM#9924

I am just dumb - has anyone released the payment, or what's the sequence?

[07-May-19 09:38 PM] CrisF#3405
smk has released it a few times. I think Blackjok3r might have too.

[07-May-19 09:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
or did they burn it - sorry too slow typing, one above

[07-May-19 09:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Afk will send release notes later unless someone does first.

[07-May-19 09:43 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - I was a block too early - the transfer just showed up.

[07-May-19 09:51 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

Hey all, I'm available to answer any questions about the physical coin you have. @zatJUM to answer your question from earlier, it is not made of real silver

[08-May-19 02:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I released first two, asleep on next 2. Got a bit this round but much less now others are competing. Managed to automate a last minute balance distribution tho, just need to tweak variance
