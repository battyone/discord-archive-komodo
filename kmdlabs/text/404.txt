just think of something, if every 2 months 2 NN spots are added based on the outcome of the lottery,  then how could we prevent people from cloning their accounts in order to maximize their winning chance , as  there are no cost to enter the lottery ?

Ah guess it's a good time to test out barterlly üòÉ

[26-May-19 03:24 PM] CMaurice#1685
Ah, @Alright , to stake on NN do I need to put my NN pubkey in the LABS.json and use it to restart the daemon with? Perhaps this might not be advised?

[26-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
staking on NN will likely be a mess

[26-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
either pioneer it and let us know how it goes or don't do it üòÇ

[26-May-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
you need to consolidate the utxos to >1 coin utxos first of all

[26-May-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
without messing up the 0.0001 coin utxos

[26-May-19 03:26 PM] CMaurice#1685
hehe, ok, again I won't do it for a bit, but will give it a go if the opportunity arises, before a machine rebuild or something

[26-May-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
it will work by itself, but your wallet is likely to bloat to all hell

[26-May-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
using pos64staker will definitely cause problems with it

not sure, I will try it eventually, but would not recommend it for now

fyi, mangling an upgraded pile of 18.04 from 16.04 into something operational required  removing `libcurl3-gnutls` and the useful programs depending on it like git and weechat, then reinstalling them after apt-getting libcurl4-gnutls-dev

shouldnt matter... hust going to git clone and rebuild again

mkay but you may have the same problem

[26-May-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that wont work

[26-May-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the clone is broken itself

[26-May-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its KMD build issues... I wasnt allowed to merge my hacky fixes there, so I have to keep manualyl reverting them after every merge. Maybe I forgot it.

[26-May-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  pushed fix. Git pull and build.sh

[26-May-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[26-May-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes then start.sh can just flag it to build.sh üòÉ

[26-May-19 03:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
hey random thought...

[26-May-19 03:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
Can you run RoW threads and stake at the same time in KMD now like in VRSC?

[26-May-19 03:49 PM] zatJUM#9924
tri-coloured in big is great, but in small I doubt it looks fine

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] zatJUM#9924
Perhaps this one is more "KMD" compatble? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/497080413387489291/582196603012775946/image5.png (I mean whith the rebranding stuff)

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no but I did work out how to do that... I ended up deciding it wasnt worth the hassle at this point in time... Its unlikely CPU will get any coins on this chain anyway. 
I may be wrong but I think you can run a PoW pool and stake on the sme daemon

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok... to stake have to setgenerate true 0

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At least I vaugly remeber adding that code, but I dont think I tested it. yes

[26-May-19 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
but to PoW gotta be 1+

[26-May-19 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats it üòÉ

[26-May-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
so... can setgenerate true 0 with many UTXOs on a single addy manage to NN?

[26-May-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
or only in PoW?

[26-May-19 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
build made it past last fail point so looking better

[26-May-19 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
there it goes GG

[26-May-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah will try to make makefile flag for those changes so that stops happening.

[26-May-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt advise staking on NN ... you can try it... but it may or may not break everything.

[26-May-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also know how to fiux that, but its a fairly large amount of work... and the way it is, we are forcing there to be heaps of nodes üòÑ

[26-May-19 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
notary back up thanks much @blackjok3r

[26-May-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
np thank you üòÉ

[26-May-19 04:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
id tip you but the KMD bot isnt online... is that not working anymore?

@Alright  pushed possible PoW hash/s calc... it kind of works, its coming out as a negative number now but its about 60k rather than 4 or 5. I think to do it properly we need to writea new function  how important is this? May be halfa  days work at most I guess.

[26-May-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
there is about 1msol on it right now

[26-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
possibly more

[26-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
1msol at genie's pool last I checked

[26-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
2.16 MSol/s (Now)

[26-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
that's just at his pool

[26-May-19 06:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@Alright I too noticed it, but I am just displaying what the daemon is telling
I think the actual meaning of "notarized" in getinfo is not the highest block that has been dPoWed but the block in which the dPoW tx got confirmed,
if what I said above is true, then I will have to do  `-1` to display it 
but there are ways to game it 
- say if the notarization txn didn't get confirmed for 2 blocks, then I would show a block not notarized as notarized

[26-May-19 06:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r can you clarify:
```
I think the actual meaning of "notarized" in getinfo is not the highest block that has been dPoWed but the block in which the dPoW tx got confirmed,
```

[26-May-19 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its notarized height not the block tx was included in.

[26-May-19 07:01 PM] gcharang#6833
check this txn:"  a6693b1229f1c2226f747159c895cb41f4011f2c066ca71174e7f715896e878b 
not notarized based on confs
but notarized block height is its block height

[26-May-19 07:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
confirms is 1 block higher than notarized height

[26-May-19 07:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that transaction is dpow confirmed. It was in the block that was notarized

[26-May-19 07:07 PM] gcharang#6833
ah even though it has 
confs:1 , it is dPoWed?
ok, then I will take notarized height into account to change the state of the txns

[26-May-19 07:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe its best to just wait for 2, not sure. But the block height 3305 cannot be reorged. So that tx is protected

[26-May-19 07:09 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, may be I will write 1 dPoW conf and then say full notarized when > 1 dPoW confs

[26-May-19 07:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
technically that is actually correct. A notarized notarization is the safest.
