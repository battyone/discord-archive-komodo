@Alright can you give the simplest params for a chain on which `selfimport` can be tested, also it doesn't require notarization to test correct?

[10-May-19 11:51 AM] Alright#0419

literally `-ac_import=PUBKEY` btw

I was confused by `-ac_import=PUBLIC`

[10-May-19 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what PUBLIC is meant to be

[10-May-19 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
there's ac_import=GATEWAY ac_import=PUBKEY

Cool, let me try. Will let you know how that goes

[10-May-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
think PUBLIC might just be a typo, don't see any references in the code

unless dimxy has his own branch for it somewhere

`The chain must have the custom parameters -ac_import=PUBLIC and -ac_pubkey set to a pubkey which is allowed to create coins.`

[10-May-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
PUBLIC=pubkey

I'll start working on the lottery mechanism in this TUI. It'll basically just be a way to verify it's provably fair. You'll have to input the BTC blockhash yourself, the new entries can be logged via oracles on CFEKORC

[10-May-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
Holy crap, that was so much easier than I expected

[10-May-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
@Decker if you have a minute, can you look at this please? Am I missing something here? It seemed too easy üòÖ 

Plan is 
```
 1. We announce a future BTC block height. This block's blockhash will act as entropy for the lottery. 
2. Participants entering the lottery will post some data to an oracle prior to the block happening. 
2.5* participants must post a signed message from the same key to discord/github
3. We do sha256(blockhash+participant_data) (maybe sha256(sha256(blockhash)+participant_data) ?) 
4. Whichever 2 participants are closest to 0 get the open spot.
```
We plan to use this mechanism to choose our notaries. So if we have 5 people that want a position and only 2 open positions.

[10-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
basically is there some way to influence the outcome of `sha256('user defined data' + entropy)` so it's more likely to be closer to 0? My brain tells me no, but I'm no cryptographer

[10-May-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
user data must be defined prior to entropy being known

Once smk has confirmed his address I will make sendmany on LABSRCTEST chain, and save the sendmany, for LABS real chain launch. 
Looks like all but @PHBA2061  are LABS notaries, so I will send LABS to the notary address at chain launch.

I'm using getsnapshot -1 for the daily snapshot which is what I said I would be using. It seems some people maybe dont quite understand how it works still. Will post instreuctions on how to verify the results I have.

[11-May-19 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If its wrong, np  to change it.

yeah thats me

{Reactions}
‚òë 

[11-May-19 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This will give the top 20 address iun the daily current snapshot.  
```#!/bin/bash
lastsnapshot=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPAY getsnapshot -1 | jq .addresses)
for i in `seq 0 20`
do
   echo $lastsnapshot | jq .[$i]
done
```
Last snapshot will be at block: 11,520. The balances at this block height are the ones I used for top 3 rankings. You can still get these by just running the script before the next snapshot happens. 
The elegibility for a participation award were: ` If your balance has not been split for the airdrop @ 8640, you do not get anything`
To check this, start the chain on fresh sync, with -stopat=8650 for example, then run the script. This will give you the tio 20 address at block 8640 daily snapshot height, It rewinds backwards from this block height to the last notarized height. Its  not a snapshot at this exact height.

[11-May-19 06:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  If any mistakes are found in my method, please DM them to be so I cna check it. I did the things manually, ie got ranks, then cheked which addresses had the origional balance, and removed them from the contest.

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] gt#2812
understood, i didn't realize the results would be from the snapshot at the last one. congrats to winners !

Starting `05/13/2019 @ 2:45am (UTC)` there will be 1 week for new participants to submit a ticket for the lottery via a CFEKORC oracle. The entropy for the lottery will be the first BTC block's blockhash after `05/20/2019 @ 2:45am (UTC)`(after a couple confs, forks/reorgs will not affect it)

[11-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
Launch is looking like 21st or 22nd, we won't be setting a specific time as it's quite a bit of work, might take a few tries to get it perfect. There is 1 week slow start(block reward linear growth from 0-8 over 1440*7 blocks)
