I suck at printf
"%0.8f" = what?

[24-Dec-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it wasn't my code, my code doesn't have change 😛

[24-Dec-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that was just me using <<< instead of your echo |

[24-Dec-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[24-Dec-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
feken blind leading the blind here :trollface:

[24-Dec-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`    change=$( printf "%0.8f" $(bc -l <<< "($amount-$SPLIT_TOTAL)") )
    change=$(sed 's/^0*//' <<< ${value//./})
    echo "amount $amount change $change"`
gives me
`amount 4499.9825975 change 1027000000000000`
so, it's wrong somewhere

[24-Dec-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```    change=$( printf "%0.8f" $(bc -l <<< "($amount-$SPLIT_TOTAL)") )
     echo "amount $amount change $change"
    change=$(sed 's/^0*//' <<< ${value//./})
    echo "amount $amount change $change"```
```amount 4499.9825975 change 4499.98059750
amount 4499.9825975 change 1027000000000000
```

[24-Dec-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`echo is our friend`

[24-Dec-18 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```amount 4499.9825975 change 4499.98059750
amount 4499.9825975 change 449998059750```

[24-Dec-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now stop following @blackjok3r and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 with copy/pasting shit 😛

[24-Dec-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
take off the 0. ? "%8f" ?

[24-Dec-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why?

[24-Dec-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless I need more ☕ ...
`change=$( printf "%8f" $(bc -l <<< "($amount-$SPLIT_TOTAL)") )`
=
```
change=$(echo  "$amount-$SPLIT_TOTAL" | bc -l )
change=$( printf "%8f" $change)```

[24-Dec-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_needs to send some small amount to a non miner addy to test this because he can't see the sub-1 stuff_

[24-Dec-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that means I have to like fork it and shit; I'm too lazy for that 😛

[24-Dec-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```amount 1 change 0.99800000
amount 1 change 99800000
```
looks right to me

[24-Dec-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's all for test so I only did 5 KMD anyway 😛

[24-Dec-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is a cheap bastid that way_

[24-Dec-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol sounds Luke u guys had as Mich fun as me, went in circles trying to get a more update android and just came full circle back to where I was, although I have discord working g without google play services now :D

[24-Dec-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess this is how this pho e stays until it commits suicide like my s5

[24-Dec-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Lol sounds Luke u guys had as Mich fun as me`
can't tell if phone or normal :trollface:

[24-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol phone and one that keeps freezing at that, doesn't seem it like running with a spoofed google play services very much. 😆

[24-Dec-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At least it doesn't save my location in the cloud like every other "smart phone"

[24-Dec-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I would think that all of that "help the NSA" type stuff would be expected when you use a goggle OS 😛

[24-Dec-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly... The os itself is free of all that stuff, but tbh its almost useless without the closed source play services, I'm not even totally sure how this spoofer thing even works bit at least its open source and most apps still work. Still rather just not have a phone lol

[24-Dec-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_uses a dumbphone and avoids all those issues_

[24-Dec-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
YeH if I still had one of those it was an option but sadly this was the only one we had layi g around, screw buying one, ppl throw them away constantly needlessly upgrading to the latest and greatest invasion of privacy.

[24-Dec-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, if it weren't for the fact that the nearest anything is 45-60 minutes away and you never know what can happen on the road, I'd not even own a cell phone at all

@Alright the Z-transaction was cli.

[24-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
Do you remember how you did it? Were you intentionally trying to pay a larger fee?

[24-Dec-18 11:12 PM] CrisF#3405
It was a normal Z-transaction as far as I know. The ones before and after went through as normal.

[24-Dec-18 11:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Didnt try anything regarding fees.

[24-Dec-18 11:16 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm afk now so hard to check, but what found I have to do to pay a 100% fee?

[25-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Alright#0419
It shouldn't have been possible @CrisF

[25-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Alright#0419
Not unless you removed some error message from the source code

[25-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Alright#0419
Should have thrown rejecttomemorypool absurd fees error

[25-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
Can you send the txid if you have it please

[25-Dec-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a PoW locked daemon on CFEKED.... No idea how its gotten like that, and not sure how to track it down. Genie reported something similar to this, but this daemon isnt even mining. So maybe its a diffrent issue to his.

[25-Dec-18 12:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cannot work out why those god damn seeds are still there, our deamon never decrypts them I've look ed thourgh the code 20 times now tryin to work out where its adding them and cant. 😦 Maybe I just need to add a filter to the connect part, for all those IP's and return true if the IP being addded is them or something.

[25-Dec-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesnt appear it was the miner that locked it, you can start and stop mining threads and it responded to that.

[25-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Locked about 1H after I started it, all the rest of the chainsa re fine, 20H of CPU time 🤷

[25-Dec-18 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Has to be some LOCK(cs_main) somwhere I guess.

[25-Dec-18 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This is my debug.log, if anyone has noticed something like this please let me know.`
I had that this morning and that was the last bit of the log and the same locked result (both CFEK and CFEKED, the other 2 were fine)

[25-Dec-18 01:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for me it was running a day or 2 before locking

👌 

[25-Dec-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool thanks, seems to indicate a lock in the networking code I think.

[25-Dec-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At least I have somewhere to start

[25-Dec-18 10:12 AM] CMaurice#1685
Quick flick through debug.log didn't show those in last 12 hours

[25-Dec-18 10:12 AM] CMaurice#1685
Do get `ERROR: CScriptCheck():` periodically

Merry seasonals

[25-Dec-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as your daemon didn't dead lock, ie hangs when issuing RPC calls.

[25-Dec-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol some prick broke into my dads house and took all his money, knew where it was too, didn't touch anything else. Some people... On the middle arvo on Christmas day

Lucky it seems we have a finger print this time,but that means dealing with the police so likely nothing will happen. :(

would it be difficult to implement a method for us to stop passing a bunch of bad addresses and continually checking them?

Agreed... I already tried to do this

[26-Dec-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it did not work

today I need to go to a farm to play silly games and drink beer, once I get home from that... I will be home for weeks and we can try again

Found - log has ``invalid octet`` re-pulled and it now runs

[26-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
however - it is taking forever to be mined.
Has the mining fee been removed (did it ever exist??) from the transaction?

[26-Dec-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fees are irrelevant and https://github.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary/blob/master/splitfunds.sh is the new splitter

OK - no wrapper for that one yes?
Needs to be individually run for each asset?

[26-Dec-18 11:24 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Oh - and fees can be relevant depending on the number of people trying to send free transactions

[26-Dec-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
splitfunds and utxosplitter are crosslinked
as long as you have the latest pull and utxosplitter as a cron, you shouldn't need to manually do either of them

[26-Dec-18 11:29 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool - thats what I have - just strange as to why it stopped working yeaterday

[26-Dec-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was your balance more than 1 for that chain?

[26-Dec-18 11:30 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
No - have been running on ~0.5KMD since start

[26-Dec-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD was the issue chain?

[26-Dec-18 11:31 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Yeah

[26-Dec-18 11:32 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
All stopped as KMD ran out of UTXO due to the octet issue

[26-Dec-18 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what was the balance when it broke?

[26-Dec-18 11:33 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
0.5955

[26-Dec-18 11:34 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
or ``0.59551716 KMD`` precisely

[26-Dec-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure why it decided that 0.54551716 was "dust" 😕

[26-Dec-18 11:35 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Or why a stop / pull to the new script fixed it

[26-Dec-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, if "pull to the new script fixed it" then it's because you had an interim version
so it's all working now? (I had read that 1st bit earlier as you're still having an issue)

[26-Dec-18 11:39 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I tried the re-pull after smk said his was working - saw the updates and ran stop/start

[26-Dec-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, it's currently working for you or no?

[26-Dec-18 11:40 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
thought it was still broken - but just took 5 or so blocks to mine

[26-Dec-18 11:40 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
so it now works

Should I use `splitfunds.sh` now instead of `utxosplitter.sh` ?

[26-Dec-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, use same setup as before; utxosplitter now calls splitfunds instead of using iguana
