Oh, I thought that we shouldn't `clean` on this version of iguana.

[12-Oct-19 10:55 PM] gt#2812
i thought we changed that but 🤔

[12-Oct-19 10:57 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm not sure.  That was the last I remember seeing.
I guess if people have been cleaning it means it's OK, and I have a very, very dirty wallet :abusedsmily:

`Oh, I thought that we shouldn't clean on this version of iguana.`
not wile iuana is runnin, but nor sould you reset 😛

[12-Oct-19 11:07 PM] CrisF#3405
I've had these kind of errors, `Invalid amount for send` on my other NN when doing a send to self, @zatJUM.
Usually sending smaller amounts, not the full balance at one time,  got it to the point where I could send all.
Not sure if that's the case here.

[13-Oct-19 12:17 AM] CrisF#3405
It's `listunspent` for me

[13-Oct-19 10:14 AM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhhh my KMDLabs notarynode was turned off until now (I needed the server to test CHIPS with new iguana), I'm trying to restart it with start.sh but I encountered the same error as @CrisF had (on the 12 October 2019). In addition, the only chains that are launched are KMD and LABS (I don't see MYLOFEK chains not the other ORACLEstuff). I'll backup everything and begin again with a fresh install.

[13-Oct-19 10:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah mines like that too - not my NN, my staking / stats node

[13-Oct-19 10:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

@Alright @blackjok3r have the MYLO chains been retired? or should I PR the stuff above back into assetchains.json ? not sure what happened 🤷🏽

@Nariya|MagicLand&CryptoDerby 👋

[13-Oct-19 01:33 PM] phm87#7395
thank you @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I performed the change you suggested and it seems to start now 🙂 If I have other errors, I'll clean everything and I'll start fresh again (I changed SuperNET and komodo folders contents recently to test chips and so on)

[13-Oct-19 01:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the current master branch of KMDLabs/StakedNotary doesnt have those chains in the assetchains.json
not sure where they went

[13-Oct-19 01:35 PM] phm87#7395
joker played with several branches and I didn't follow everything about StakedNotary and iguana (I followed some commits on KMD and the new iguana)

thanks CG, all coming back to me now...

[13-Oct-19 03:30 PM] phm87#7395
I don t see iguana in process list so there is nothing to kill. I will try again later

[13-Oct-19 03:32 PM] zatJUM#9924
iguana port is no more 7776

[13-Oct-19 03:34 PM] zatJUM#9924
Seems to be 8222 now

[13-Oct-19 04:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
8222 is p2p port, 7776 is rpc port

[13-Oct-19 04:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
oups

[13-Oct-19 04:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
😉

[13-Oct-19 04:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
this command will show port usage by iguana, if it is running
`sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN | grep iguana`
the number of port shown after `0.0.0.0` is p2p port, accept connection from all IP
the number of port shown after `127.0.0.1` is rpc port, only accept connection from local host

[13-Oct-19 04:48 PM] zatJUM#9924
So iguana port is now `6789`. @phm87 perhaps you don't have the same version of iguana than me?

[13-Oct-19 04:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah it should be 6789

[13-Oct-19 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wen all else fails, just look it up <https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/many_iguana/assetchains.json#L24>

[13-Oct-19 05:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Well, lost my `APOW`, mined some, and splitfunds.sh worked.  That is after resetting wallet earlier tonight.

[13-Oct-19 05:33 PM] phm87#7395
yes I have an old version, I didn't update since a while ... I'll try to move all folders and start fresh

[13-Oct-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator sorry not sure, both of us just prepping for the hard fork, haven't checked on any of the CFEK chains since I left for the trip

[13-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
kill them all 🤷

[13-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Alright#0419
no idea what any of them are for atm

All I was using them for was to make pretty graphs 😄

[13-Oct-19 06:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but I think at least some of them were for testing Joker's iguana tweaks

@phm87 save yourself a lot of time and confusion and look at `starting.sh` 😉

[13-Oct-19 06:55 PM] phm87#7395
CG : yes but I was looking at starting.sh in the master branch (as readme says) and no in many_iguana branch (as the last important pinned msg says). Now it is all fine, everything is running fine it seems

[13-Oct-19 06:56 PM] phm87#7395
the change of branch from master to many_iguana is not automated (starting from master), I think that's why joker asked us to update and pinned the msg

[13-Oct-19 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤐

[13-Oct-19 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's almost as if he took the time to lay out the exact steps (and made it easy to find) on purpose or something

[13-Oct-19 07:57 PM] phm87#7395
I'll adapt the readme later (as other folks may join)

[13-Oct-19 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nothing really to "adapt" since we're in a testing phase while joker reworks iguana
unless you just like editing for the sake of reediting later 🤷🏽

[13-Oct-19 08:34 PM] phm87#7395
I think that it is on the 31st October and I have other things to do before

I think I finally fixed the iguana memory leak, which also causes it to stop working after some amount of time.

[15-Oct-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can some of you please try out, the latest. 
```shell
cd ~/StakedNotary
git checkout many_iguana
git pull
pkill -15 iguana
./build_iguana blackjok3r
./start_iguana.sh blackjok3r
```

I am seeing less than 100MB RES in `htop` and VIRT `(1782mb)` is no longer constantly increasing until the OS refuses to let iguana make more threads. Of course, needs testing on nodes other than mine to be sure.

[15-Oct-19 10:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`./start_iguana.sh blackjok3r` to be precise 😄

100 KMD per valid bug report on the new staker
possibly more based on my discretion 

Test hard fork went fine. I've tested it pretty thoroughly, but I'm still not convinced there aren't edge cases.

[17-Oct-19 07:57 AM] gcharang#6833
is 2vCPU (shared), 4 GB RAM and 80 GB SSD too low for now? (my komodod running the KMD chain is crashing constantly)
can I get the minimum recommended specs?

[17-Oct-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
8GB ram right now, unless you just run LABS and KMD, then 4GB should work. I think we can remove some chains soon. My notary is about 8GB ram used, but is mining all chains.

[17-Oct-19 08:10 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, 8 gb ram it is
80 GB disk should be enough, correct?

[17-Oct-19 08:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I notice that `stats` is taking much longer time than before to execute, and whenever I run it I have a huge chance of komodod crashing

👆 

[17-Oct-19 08:13 AM] PHBA2061#2530
also on 8Gb btw

[17-Oct-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying to fix the utxo cache  right now. The reason that stats takes longer, is because the wallet.dat is allowed to be very large now, lots of tx takes a long time to process. Easy fix is to limit the amount of tx it pulls here:
