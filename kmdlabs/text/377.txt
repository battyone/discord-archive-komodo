[09-May-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man I've broken so many things.... It hurts the first few times, but eventually you releaise it just comes with changing shit, it breaks... The mroe you break it the better you will get at not breaking it again 😆

[09-May-19 12:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its even more fun when its not borken but you think it is so you actually do break it and somehow put it back together better

that should return something, right? @TonyL

[09-May-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
that's your latest batontxid shown in oraclesinfo

[09-May-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
try dev vs jl777/FSM with unit tests, dev doesn't have changes, jl777 and FSM do

[09-May-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419

maybe some other change recenty caused this. .could be my faul, or jls even...

[09-May-19 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it looks like adding multiple publisher with same pubkey

if datafeee not change, it gets confused?

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
Would be a good thing to test

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
quite possibly

[09-May-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Will make proper research on my side asap

[09-May-19 01:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still empty with same pubkey after registeing with higher datafees

[09-May-19 02:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
kmdlabs.io a good place to start? you lot were too active to try and keep up

[09-May-19 02:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what you tryna start?

[09-May-19 02:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[09-May-19 02:26 PM] mrlynch#5735

true that

[09-May-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
@mrlynch there is a organized test running for payments CC right now, you're a bit late to the party for it though

[09-May-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
think it ends in a day or two, not entirely sure though

[09-May-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
you could try to break the cc(or any other cc) in the mean time though

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll have to learn what this is all about first and get a better understanding of CC

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
can give you some tips, just lmk

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
soon ™

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
maybe i should document how I've broken ones in the past

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Your call returning nothing to me as well
I'm calling other one:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclessamples 68c78190c91f45d7dacff72281226a075a9a14f0ea60efd4edda15c6edea947a 8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0 3
```

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just hack the RPC swith random changes and see if it lets the tx through 😄

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
that would be helpful

[09-May-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
would definitely help with the learning process

[09-May-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
basically there are two parts of every CC

[09-May-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
the validation and the tx creation

[09-May-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
you need to look at validation code, look for a hole

[09-May-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
then edit tx creation code to fit a tx through that hole

[09-May-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as a dev you have 2 options... make really good validation, or make it really hard to find a hole 🤣

[09-May-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
for best results, try un-intutive things 😂

[09-May-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
if it looks like it's not going to work, try it anyway

@Alright https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/mg8HbVPv8H/  things step by step.
Broadcasted two oraclesdata, second oraclesdata transaction is mined and on blockchain but only one sample in oraclessamples (it's with kmdlabs master daemon)

[09-May-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
What interesting is that datafee reduced for both samples

[09-May-19 03:31 PM] TonyL#3577
There was only one oraclessubscribe so it's not the clue

[09-May-19 03:32 PM] Alright#0419
what does that return

[09-May-19 03:32 PM] Alright#0419
to clarify, 0 should return all oraclesdata's up until the baton txid you provide

[09-May-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
so for all oraclesdata's ever, you must provide latest batontxid

[09-May-19 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I've called old baton. That have sense

[09-May-19 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
With last baton it works correct

[09-May-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oracleslist` for a list of all oracles
`komodo-cli  -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclesinfo <oracle txid from oracleslist output>` this will output a list of publishers and their batontxids

[09-May-19 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
take that batontxid for a given publisher and do
