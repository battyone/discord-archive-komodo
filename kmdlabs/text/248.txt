never bothered yesterday because of hiccups and stupidly thinking no one else was looking at it yet

[26-Jan-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
I think joker and I decided that LABS won't have very many CCs at all, and instead PAYME will be the place for battle tested CCs to be added

[26-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
it's in notaries best interest to keep PAYME running 24/7, so we figure it'd be the best chain to hard fork if we must hard fork one of them

we can use it to test burn validation for adding chains

so burntxid will be in assetchains.json

@Alright is the 17k disparity one of the 6 or are we just getting different amounts somehow?

~17k was left in CC addresses at the time of snapshot

[26-Jan-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Bar_F1sh_Rel if you set a limit in or out, the top end of that limit is the limit of P2P "peers" you will have
because P2P

[26-Jan-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
"peers" are the same as "connections"

[26-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
on a default daemon the limit is 'self initiated peers' unless you explicitly tell it not to accept incoming requests - or block the incoming port.

[26-Jan-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you leave default you get 8 max, if you set `maxconnections` then you get *up to* `maxconnections`

[26-Jan-19 02:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
run peerinfo on another chain

[26-Jan-19 02:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
unless you explicitly set maxconnections

[26-Jan-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`unless you explicitly set maxconnections` <- you get the hard-coded 8

all yours are on port 42091 for LABST - so they are all outgoing.
