@TonyL  Getting this error while running py migration v2 script
```Import transaction on KMD not created yet, waiting for 10 seconds more
(6, 'Could not resolve host: user97th6elayywh5hpyfegcr')```
btw CFEKX to CFEKY

[13-Jan-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just copy pasted his code pretty much everywhere 😂

[13-Jan-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It took a long time to read it all

[13-Jan-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Nabob  yes .. edit the komodo.conf file to only use letters and numbers for the rpc creds

[13-Jan-19 02:43 PM] Nabob#5004
Scripts fails  if  there "/" In user Id, as we generate userid randomly

[13-Jan-19 02:44 PM] Nabob#5004
hm

[13-Jan-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the bash file that generates the komodo.conf in staked notary didnt limit to only letters and numbers now it does .. fixied it earlier

[13-Jan-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to fix it manually if its already generated

[13-Jan-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@Nabob I've never tested code after changes with parser stuff, so not sure why you get this error

[13-Jan-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems like username using as server somewhere

[13-Jan-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577

But have to set manually data for connection and your wallet (lines 72-79)

[13-Jan-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
`migrations.py Classic` hahaha

[13-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Nabob#5004
Thanks, let me check

[13-Jan-19 02:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Did script from Staked repo worked fine on your side with password without `/` @Nabob ? If yes - I think it's better just to change password 😃

[13-Jan-19 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
gave my node a clean start on my intel machine... wish i had stuck an SSD in that thing FML its slow

[13-Jan-19 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
BUT, I chose to let it all sync from scratch to see if it would without failing... been loading KMD for ~14 hours now

[13-Jan-19 02:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Since guys made great  UX commits and in general this version will be updatable in future

[13-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Nabob#5004
userid has `/`, I need to stop all chains restart,  I ll consider this in few mins

@daemonfox Hmm, do you have good internet connection?

[13-Jan-19 03:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Gbit fiber down with at least 300 Mbit up

[13-Jan-19 03:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
i think it just hit fully synced... the other daemons are also eating up disk and CPU now

[13-Jan-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kmd is horrible to sync from scratch now

[13-Jan-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed it as good as I could

[13-Jan-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  I found the milit with nvme and lots of ram to be CPU... 2700X at 2.3Ghz wasnt enough...

[13-Jan-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
took half a day easy

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator that was a good read, thanks

[13-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got the withdraw script working 😄

[13-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I commented where it can be improved... its mostly the filters, about how you choose the utxo to lock.

[13-Jan-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
optimal is, some combination of age and value...

[13-Jan-19 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Wow missed this article from mobile - it's so informative and interesting to read in the same time @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator :treasure:

@blackjok3r what is this withdraw script?

[13-Jan-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I pushe dit to staker repo... its well commented

[13-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
is for withdrawing from a staker node without mucking everything up?

[13-Jan-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its to withdraw funds from staking node... meant to leave oldest and biggest behind, and filters a percentage from each segid

[13-Jan-19 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs some improvements .. but it works pretty good...

[13-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, good shit

[13-Jan-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it took a while...

[13-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
is the def_creds different from the one in staker lib?

[13-Jan-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure.. we changed it a lot

[13-Jan-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I used tonys rpc thing... its way simpler

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
` ac_dir = "dont have windows machine now to test"` gotta love how this was in a PR from months ago

{Reactions}
😂 

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
and like 10 people have used this code since 😂

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a windows VM ... but too busy to do that yet lol

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
Yea I need to look at this rpc

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its very easy

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
I liked being able to look at all the arguments 😦

[13-Jan-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
easier than whet yours was... you dont need a function for every call... just define the rpc object and every rpc is a function

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rpc_cfek.getinfo()

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or rpc_cfek.sendtawtransaction('hex')

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
ok will rework my scripts to match when I have some time

[13-Jan-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it took me like maybe 45 mins to change all of those

[13-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
`from stakerlib import def_credentials, genvaldump` little nitpick

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt do that .. my version had the whole thing in every file...tony fixed it earier havent tested it yet

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
when this gets more complicated, I think it's best to do `import stakerlib` then call the functions as `stakedlib.def_credentials`

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
so you can see immediately where it came from

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
maybe there is a reason not to do that though?

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no ...

[13-Jan-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how it should be done... I just did it wrong when I tried... and coudnt be fucked battling with it... so just copy pasted the whole thing into every script

[13-Jan-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tony changed it to that, from what I asked him to do.. but it should be an object yes

[13-Jan-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
`from stakerlib import def_credentials, genvaldump ` @Alright These functions were copy-paste duplicated 3 times in different scripts so I've put it to separate file

[13-Jan-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, if you like this proposal idea you can import whole lib later when it will be huge

[13-Jan-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
And possible to create a stakedlib module and upload it to PiPy, so will be possible to use as dependency in other projects/tools just as `pip install stakedlib` + `import stakedlib`

[13-Jan-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe someone pin @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator's article to not miss it in routine? (I can't do it 😦 ) Imo it may be a very good head start and overview for newcomers in spot of migrations

can you do it in other channels?

[13-Jan-19 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
No, I cant anywhere (before I was able). I guess there was a rework in permissions policy with latest Discord reorg

[13-Jan-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, this permission was there for team members and that's why i said you were supposed to be able. i'll re-check

As for the Windoz folders etc - if anyone was *really* wanting to try this on a win machine...
komodo.conf should be in %appdata% then komodo - which I think is accessed with ``ac_dir = '%s\\komodo\\' % os.environ['APPDATA']``
However, we have no idea where users may have stored the git repo to take the assetchains.json etc.

[13-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
first time trying to break exports/imports in a long while, is this a typical error message? Do I need to just wait longer or did I break something? `Failed merkle block->MoM`

[13-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r ?

@TonyL ?

[14-Jan-19 01:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Was there a delay between `sendrawtransaction` and `migrate_creatimporttransaction` to allow time for confirmation?

[14-Jan-19 01:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or maybe too much of a delay so that more than one notirisation had passed?
