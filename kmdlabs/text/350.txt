When you need to resync... just dont use start.sh

[02-Apr-19 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and import your keys manually

do we have enough nodes for era change?

[02-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its notarizing

[02-Apr-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think

[02-Apr-19 11:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
it is yes

[02-Apr-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive got 7 up here without CrisF, and genie has his node ready to role

[02-Apr-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah as soon as Cris node went down the errors stopped...

[02-Apr-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we need to add something to iguana on its init... to scan the walelt and call gettxout on each utxo.. and refuse to start dpow until the issue is rectified ü§î

[02-Apr-19 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That at least stops people doing it by accident

`error -1`

[02-Apr-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181

-26 is a very general error, it means the transaction is malfromed

if one happens here and there, its probably form a node restarting

Thanks. I think after most of us update it should all work pretty smoothly... Guess restart of iguana inside era gap is going to be something we need to just do... Its not that big a deal though really as I think it can be crontabed.

We need to wait for ~200 notarizations on CFEKNK... It should stop notarizing at just over 200. 
iguana will print an error message telling you to send coins to an address. Please dont do that. Let it stop.

[02-Apr-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
notarizations cost 0.5 each?

[02-Apr-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be 1 coin, I sent 200 coins to the "burn" address its not actually a real burna ddress but the pubkey is 020000000000000000000000

um what happens, is notary pay pays 1 coins per nota

[02-Apr-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it tallies this in the blockindex

[02-Apr-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it gets higher than the balance in the burn address it refuses to let iguana notarize the chain

[02-Apr-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until someone sends the address more balance

[02-Apr-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
