I think it wont matter though as its onlyt removing an extra peice

yeah go to your kids birthday man, this can wait

everything restarted

[06-Feb-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stops lock up but still gets stuck once it sees an old notarisation

Pushed fix for notarisations that are invalid...

[06-Feb-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt need to change consensus code... Wass a nice dinner too 😄

`Pushed fix for notarisations that are invalid.`
fix is invalid or fix is for invalid notarizations ? :troll_king:

[06-Feb-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisations dont propagate to every single node at teh same time, so if block happens quite fast (which is ALL THE TIME on PoS64 chains) then its possible a notarisation can be confirmed before the last one. So I made it so that if it creates a block with an invalid notarisation it flags the txid as invalid to a static variable. CreateBlock can only be called in lock cs_main so if it tries to create one block and it fails, it then saves the txid, and next time it tries to create the block it adds the out of order notarisation as a normal tx but does not create the coinbase.

👍🏽 

[06-Feb-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So then the block will pass the validation

[06-Feb-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure its working properly... and ive pushed PoW to 51% and cant find any more blocks lol

[06-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if anyone is mining these chains please update to lates. 
I dont relly understand why it does what it does 😆 
But this is the best thing I can come up with. It will flag the notarisation tx as invalid then create and mine a new block without it, then if for some reason that notarisation is then valid after it mines the block (dont understand how this happens but it did) it will reject that block and try to mine a block with the notarisation again. Really strange... The only other option it so have it not include the notarisation, whcih seems dangerous  for MoMoM we really need every notarisation on chain to prevent gaps.

[06-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Allowing the coinbase to pay out for out of order notarisations will screw the coin emission 😦

[06-Feb-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  I think you need to update seeds again please sorry.

[06-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
My nodes are on a fork. Can't get past 522

[06-Feb-19 01:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Nn seems OK though

[06-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Or its just a sync thing - I deleted the chains on those nodes

same thing on LABST3

[06-Feb-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r 
the miner seems to be off, getting a bunch of
`ERROR: ConnectBlock(): Notarisation is not in TX position 1! Invalid Block!`
from PoW blocks I'm making (with daemon miner)

[06-Feb-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Are you on latest... the very latest ?

I am mining LABST2 here ... just fine...

[06-Feb-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Feb-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes appears to be the last commit :S

Im mining LABSt2 here ok ...

[06-Feb-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
me too, but 3&4 aren't 2 😛

[06-Feb-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing I can think of here is if the code I am using to validate a notarisation doesnt always return the same result

[06-Feb-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries... nothing should be any diffrent syncing those chains now

[06-Feb-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
syncing doesn't change that it's invalidating its own blocks

[06-Feb-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It is supposed to do that in some circumstances ...

[06-Feb-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until i figure out how to fix it properly

[06-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only other fix we can try is to not add an invalid notarisation to the block at all...

[06-Feb-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's *supposed to* burn CPU cycles repeatedly creating blocks that it will not validate?

[06-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can push this if you like to try it ? not sure what unintended concequences tat may have for MoMoM though

[06-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now yes... sorry ... it wont stay liek that ... but its seems more importnat that the cahin can move than waste some PCU mining... it cant staay liek that with high hash rates I understand

[06-Feb-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how can it move if we're creating invalid blocks?

[06-Feb-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
someone else will make a valid one ... not all nodes have the notarisationa at the same time

[06-Feb-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyway syncing them and seeing what happens here so I can try to fix it

[06-Feb-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, if I want to send a tx and the diff is low I can't just create an on-demand block, I have to wait 15-20 minutes for someone to hopefully, maybe block it for me?

[06-Feb-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
look its just how it is right now... It wil work once we figure out why it see the notarisations as valid when they are in face invlaid or vice versa...

[06-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the exact same loop of code seems to return diffrent values depending when you call it

[06-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[06-Feb-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then call a different loop 😛

[06-Feb-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know or understand how it validates it at all.. it took 3 days to work out what to even call to check if a notarisation was valid or not

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It works 99% of the time

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I could make it accept notarisations out of order. but then the coin emision would be random

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it hasn't worked 1 of the 99 times it's blocked here 😛

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one it gets stuck it stays stuck it seems

[06-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
should I kill them or leave them

[06-Feb-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just leave it... Im not sure if it will be abe to mine or not at this stage.. I nede to stop talking and sync the other 2 chains ..

[06-Feb-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well I got all 3 chains up and running, at least
Will check back later, I'm off to learn QT (because I'm not involved in enough already, I guess)

[06-Feb-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ther are blocks with times of like 5000s and shit somethign is very very wrong

[06-Feb-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that the  lwma difficulty algo is flat out not compatible with PoS64

[06-Feb-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to see if verus hash works with equihash difficulty

[06-Feb-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I had worked ok with 50% ot 90% PoS but if you decrease pos % to 20% the PoW ramps the ddiff up super high then a bunch of PoW blocks have incredile diff because of the close target window, and I think it has some possible afjustmetn from 1 block to the next.. It looks liek the VerusPoS implemetation uses a totally diffrent difficulty calculation for PoS blocks all together.

LABST2 seemks to be working fine with the latest miner though which is a plus

[06-Feb-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
diff isn't the issue

[06-Feb-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fix the bit where the dameon miner creates a block that the daemon will not accept because of 2 notarization txes and it will roll on

[06-Feb-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why is it working ont he other chain?

[06-Feb-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant get it to PoW mine any blocks because PoS isnt happening

[06-Feb-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
diff is too high

[06-Feb-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was able to make it do what you are saying... so I added more prints and restarted

[06-Feb-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now there are no notarisaiton in my mempool and I cant see anything or mine any blocks

[06-Feb-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I cant get it to PoW mine any blocks because PoS isnt happening`
on which chain?

[06-Feb-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
3/4

[06-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS is "stuck" at 19% and the chain wont move... there wwere no notarisations in the mempool and it still catn find any blocks

[06-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to make local chain with equihash difficulkty adjustment and see what happens. LABST2 is working fine for  me

[06-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so 99% sure its ok

[06-Feb-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the notary pay that is

[06-Feb-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've literally created hundreds of PoW blocks on 3

[06-Feb-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Feb-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's where 3 is sticking here
it blocks them and then invalidates the block

[06-Feb-19 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm i5t shouldnt add 2 ... or at least it can do that, as long as the valid one is in position 1

[06-Feb-19 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it extremlyt hard to debug when I cant get it to do it

[06-Feb-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  pushed possible fix for that

[06-Feb-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a bug there, where it could choose 2

[06-Feb-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think something is off though... my LABST2 chain went on a fork... I think its possible for a notarisation to be valid on some nodes and not on oothers... checkiung it out but likely need to sleep to fix it

seems complicated
