I've used Graviex and Barterly 👍

[08-Jun-19 06:34 AM] zatJUM#9924
CFEKBET1 again on a fork?

[08-Jun-19 06:45 AM] zatJUM#9924
No when I restart the chain CFEKBERT1, it `Segmentation fault (core dumped)` 😦

[08-Jun-19 06:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had that too last week, rebuilding daemon fixed it.

[08-Jun-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I pushed fix for bet1 a few days back so it would sync

[08-Jun-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If any bugs with that please let me know

[08-Jun-19 07:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
Someone has an IP for me to sync from?

my last CFEKBET1 block was 11h ago (2734) - anyone further than that?

[08-Jun-19 08:25 AM] zatJUM#9924
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I sync'd from scratch like 2 days ago

[08-Jun-19 08:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
one of my nodes doesnt loke blocks for kmd, so resyncing now

[08-Jun-19 08:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
labs NN ok, but dragonhound server having trouble

[08-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@zatJUM - what's your latest CFEKBET1 height?

[08-Jun-19 08:32 AM] zatJUM#9924
2734

[08-Jun-19 08:33 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
hmmmm stuck on 2730

[08-Jun-19 08:33 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ooops - no thats notarisation - but it has been on 2734 for hours now

[08-Jun-19 08:38 AM] zatJUM#9924
Something's strange with stats: says I got last nota 1h4mn ago, but lastblock 11h28m ago!

[08-Jun-19 08:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah mine looks funky too

[08-Jun-19 08:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[08-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I've put a core on it - it's moving now on my chain.

[08-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
so it looks like a stall. Not sure I want to put the energy into a chain that will be stopped soon though.

[08-Jun-19 10:26 AM] PHBA2061#2530
my node stuck on block 2735 too ...

[08-Jun-19 10:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mines on 2744 now

ahh great, thanks

[08-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM is that segfault reproducible?

[08-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
latest pricescomp branch might have the fix if you weren't on latest

[08-Jun-19 01:39 PM] AkiraX#8269
Is there a calculator for labs

[08-Jun-19 01:39 PM] AkiraX#8269
Mining calc

[08-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
no, guess

[08-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
we can't even estimate network hashrate properly yet 😂

[08-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
just have to mine it and see

[08-Jun-19 01:43 PM] AkiraX#8269
When can I start staking it

[08-Jun-19 01:44 PM] AkiraX#8269
What's the current supply

[08-Jun-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can stake after 100 minutes iirc

[08-Jun-19 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686

[08-Jun-19 01:54 PM] AkiraX#8269
Is there instructions on how to stake

[08-Jun-19 01:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
I'm running windows

[08-Jun-19 01:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
So I need to download git

[08-Jun-19 01:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
Or can I put it on a laptop. Elementary os

[08-Jun-19 01:56 PM] AkiraX#8269
Does the staking machine need to be online?

[08-Jun-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Does the staking machine need to be online?`
yes

[08-Jun-19 01:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
You need to download linux... just joking
Search for zexo windows staking I believe somebody made a tutorial

[08-Jun-19 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
It's no mining calc...

[08-Jun-19 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
But LABS on genie's pool shows 16-17Msols average... even if that is wrong it can be "used" to compare.

[08-Jun-19 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136

@AkiraX  not sure, but you might be able to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux

It'll give you a taste of what you're missing 😉

[08-Jun-19 02:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
only issue wth my numbers is I think genie is also still paying notarized blocks too???

[08-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Alright#0419
po64staker should be windows compatible if you install the dependencies correctly

[08-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Alright#0419
namely python3.6 or greater and the pip packages

[08-Jun-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
@AkiraX i can confirm what @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator linked... I started with the Ubuntu version for Win 10, and though it had issues, it worked. I learned a ton and moved on to a dedicated node of Ubuntu VMs

[08-Jun-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only issue wth my numbers is I think genie is also still paying notarized blocks too???`
yes, yw

[08-Jun-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
i know... you gonna stop bleeding coins sometime soon... i almost feel bad one of those payouts for me was huge!

[08-Jun-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my staking more than makes up for it 😉

[08-Jun-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
atm it's worth the small loss to keep doing what I'm doing and come back to that code later

[08-Jun-19 02:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
windows ubuntu subsystem is a gateway drug. soon you'll be messing with a small VPS, then another and another. Then you'll say fek it, I'll get a dedicated server, run for notary nerd elections, and start drooling over building my own based on the alien spec hardware Shossain has

[08-Jun-19 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
YES!

[08-Jun-19 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
My node still doesnt quite compare to his... but its damn close now

[08-Jun-19 02:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
and when the Ryzen 7 3900X launches, ill be dropping that into the node

[08-Jun-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[08-Jun-19 02:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
it served its purpose

[08-Jun-19 02:29 PM] AkiraX#8269
ok

[08-Jun-19 02:29 PM] AkiraX#8269
so i have to download the komodo-cli

[08-Jun-19 03:11 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have 8 connections on CFEKBET1 but somehow my blocks stuck at 0 😭

[08-Jun-19 03:15 PM] AkiraX#8269
so i have to isntall mingw to set up komodod-cli?

[08-Jun-19 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
You got Win 10?

[08-Jun-19 03:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
and at least 4 cores 8GB ram?

[08-Jun-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
If yes and Win 10 Pro, id suggest using Hyper-V

[08-Jun-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
and make some small Ubuntu VMs

[08-Jun-19 03:22 PM] AkiraX#8269
so i installed ubuntu subsystem

[08-Jun-19 03:22 PM] AkiraX#8269
but i have no idea what to do now

don't be root 😛

[08-Jun-19 03:31 PM] AkiraX#8269
yes but that doesnt solve my problems

[08-Jun-19 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since you're root, `apt-get update` and then try the install bits again without sudo

[08-Jun-19 03:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
funny.  i just did that as you typed that message

[08-Jun-19 03:33 PM] AkiraX#8269
im not a completely noob after all.  maybe 1 level up.

[08-Jun-19 03:34 PM] AkiraX#8269
but pretty close

[08-Jun-19 03:35 PM] AkiraX#8269
thank you for your help

[08-Jun-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

there's no need to add sudo when you're root
