yes saw that!

[18-May-19 07:32 PM] Strob#3417
pubkey is the 66 characters one right?

[18-May-19 07:32 PM] Exile13#4458
1 min

[18-May-19 07:33 PM] Exile13#4458
`1.  ./komodo-cli getnewaddress  (this gets a new address)
2.  ./komodo-cli dumprivkey <ADDRESS FROM ABOVE>  (this gets the wif)
3.  ./komodo-cli validataddress <ADRESS FROM STEP 1> (this gets pubkey)`

[18-May-19 07:33 PM] Exile13#4458
then pubkey is 3rd from the bottom

[18-May-19 07:34 PM] Exile13#4458
on the return in {}

[18-May-19 07:34 PM] Strob#3417
ok validateaddress! that's the one I was looking for

[18-May-19 07:34 PM] Exile13#4458
looks like 
`"iswatchonly": false,
  "isscript": false,
  "pubkey": "03d14e810f3458ce760a83c2c2193cf4ac9b1df774e7267193d66238cb38c0e25c",`

[18-May-19 07:36 PM] Exile13#4458
im still mining lmk when you've registered

[18-May-19 07:36 PM] Strob#3417
CFEKORC started!

[18-May-19 07:38 PM] Strob#3417
I was looking at the paper wallet to get the pubkey and it gives 1 with 130 and 1 with 66 char. All in caps. But the command (validateaddress) gives it in lower case (66 char) so I guess it's not case sensitive

[18-May-19 07:40 PM] Strob#3417
Do I need to import my private key too in CFEKORC?

[18-May-19 07:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the shorter one is compressed, the longer one is uncompressed, either one should work

[18-May-19 07:40 PM] Strob#3417
ok good to know. I knew there was one compressed but good to know they both work

[18-May-19 07:41 PM] Strob#3417
synced!

[18-May-19 07:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I did import my wif, not sure if it works w/o privkey or not, probably not because you need to sign tx later on

[18-May-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
uncompressed will not work

[18-May-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
and yes, it's case insensitive

[18-May-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
use the one that starts with 02 or 03, that's the compressed pubkey

[18-May-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
if it starts with 04, that's uncompressed

[18-May-19 07:50 PM] Strob#3417
ok tx

@Alright are you sure uncompressed keys won't work ? I can import both uncompressed pub & priv keys though üòï

[18-May-19 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
don't think `-pubkey=` will work with uncompressed

[18-May-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont

[18-May-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
at least not supported now

[18-May-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason to use p2pk is to save space on the blockchain

[18-May-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
using uncompressed keys defeats that purpose
