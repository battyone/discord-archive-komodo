Can send to self but not split.  Usually sending to self fixes duplicate tx error

[25-Nov-18 04:55 AM] Mylo#8306
I reckon this is a good place to collab on simple GUI, like dice.  I‚Äôm using smk staked dice scripts for reference

[25-Nov-18 04:56 AM] Mylo#8306
And I like the idea of separating NN for dApps

[25-Nov-18 04:57 AM] Mylo#8306
Same with simpl GUI for webcam streamer testing. Hope that happens in this channel

[25-Nov-18 05:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Blackok3r's wallet cleaning stuff should automatically split.

[25-Nov-18 05:03 AM] CrisF#3405
The `duplicates tx` is usually solved with the send to self...

[25-Nov-18 05:11 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah not working.  Was fresh resync of kmd so it is surprising.  Working from iPad so not ideal for troubleshooting today

@daemonfox

[25-Nov-18 09:40 AM] jusoaresf#3291
is there still a place in here?

[25-Nov-18 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Does anyone know the latest?  @Alright ?

[25-Nov-18 09:42 AM] gt#2812
if i had to guess there might be one left but not 100

[25-Nov-18 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
There are only 17 on the pinned list, but I know that at least 2 more have notarized since then.

[25-Nov-18 09:43 AM] gt#2812
might be worthwhile to try / maybe someone will step out

[25-Nov-18 09:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
I just notarized myfirst one. Not sure if there is still one left. I guess we can go and check the notarization address and figure out

shame the pad isn't working anymore

[25-Nov-18 10:26 AM] jorian#4555
@Mylo do you know if anyone is working on that atm?

[25-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I have the original info if you need, @jorian .

[25-Nov-18 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
it's not about that, it's more that in situations like these we could use a pad

[25-Nov-18 10:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, for sure.

@daemonfox - I am assuming your R address was ``REScxcZm3dsWmERSax1yVgoPPadh8BYQ6k`` as this was the only unclaimed in the notaries file.

[25-Nov-18 12:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yes

[25-Nov-18 12:56 PM] daemonfox#6136

@daemonfox - you were number 19 by my reckoning - first duck at 5:30am

[25-Nov-18 01:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup i see the pastebin info

[25-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
Did we hit 20? Are there >3 people that aren't in the pin that have notarized?

[25-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
I see CHMEX has notarized

[25-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
@daemonfox what if your notary address

[25-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
Ah great, exactly 5 didn't notarize. That makes my life much easier

[25-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
Can always try again next cycle if you didn't get a spot!

[25-Nov-18 02:32 PM] Nabob#5004
confirm the spots once again, so you are referring that paste.bin posted above

[25-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
I don't have to confirm the times since exactly 20 notarized

[25-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
updated the pin

[25-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Nabob#5004
ahh, Nice

[25-Nov-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
Looks like mylo and CHMEX fought it out for the last spot :/

[25-Nov-18 05:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
Also, I guarantee my IP changes next week...

[25-Nov-18 05:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
I move into my new place and will ahve a new ISP

[25-Nov-18 05:43 PM] jorian#4555
my isp doesn't give me a fixed IP

[25-Nov-18 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
same here...

[25-Nov-18 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
but i have one ready for me at the new place!

[25-Nov-18 06:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@blackjok3r  I commented out #${cli} cleanwallettransactions ${txid} in  walletreset.sh and renamed it utxokick.sh - it does the right job for the utxo bug and keeps your notr count  without rescanning

[25-Nov-18 06:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`So now what happens???`
You continue to notarize chains until you're no  longer a notary

[25-Nov-18 06:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
commented out  # echo "[${coin}] ${txid} confirmed, running wallet cleaner..."

[25-Nov-18 06:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and changed this line to -    echo "[${coin}] Resetting ${coin} UTXOs - ${date}"

[25-Nov-18 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You should not need to do that

[25-Nov-18 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless there is some problem with it

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I have not had any issues on latest veraion

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
im showing zero utxos --- I know there is a problem

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
in ./stats it shows 0

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u win that script it will merge all utxo

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
in utxosplitter.sh it shows plenty

[25-Nov-18 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Requiring a new split

[25-Nov-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Stats might be counting wrong.. Or it could be something else

[25-Nov-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2am here will check it out tomorrow

[25-Nov-18 06:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i wanst nota some chains until I self sent my balance

[25-Nov-18 06:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
then resplit

[25-Nov-18 06:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
then it started woring

[25-Nov-18 06:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and thats what that edited script does

[25-Nov-18 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once it splits once it should just work.. Don't make transactions with komodo-cli ever .. Al all for any reason and it will never break

[25-Nov-18 06:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill keep an eye on this because i never used komodo-cli

[25-Nov-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326

will there be a stats site? or is it already available?

[25-Nov-18 08:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
pinned

[25-Nov-18 08:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
When I look for my R address in the explorer that is pinned, I find 98 tx, whereas ./stats indicates 95 notarizations for CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[25-Nov-18 08:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
There's 1 tx not counted for the fund of this address, but there are 2 tx more

[25-Nov-18 08:14 PM] Nabob#5004
@zatJUM  Did  you run walletreset script any time ?

[25-Nov-18 08:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
not yet

[25-Nov-18 08:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
that would count 1 tx each time?

[25-Nov-18 08:18 PM] Nabob#5004
i think stats script not shows accurately if we do walletreset, @webworker01  once discussed we may need to rescan the wallet or resync the wallet

[25-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM not every tx to the wallet will be a notarization

[25-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
funding tx, utxo spltting tx, etc

[25-Nov-18 08:21 PM] Nabob#5004
‚òù

[25-Nov-18 08:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
How can one look (and count precisely) its nota?

[25-Nov-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
look at what the stats script is doing

[25-Nov-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
should be accurate

[25-Nov-18 08:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
Can't do it from explorer?

[25-Nov-18 08:23 PM] zatJUM#9924
To find how many nota any address has done?

[25-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Nabob#5004
`asset-cli CFEKLAMEDUCKS listtransactions "" 99999999 | grep RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA | wc -l`

[25-Nov-18 08:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
On the explorer, this address shows 309 nota, for the 20 staked notaries I presume
