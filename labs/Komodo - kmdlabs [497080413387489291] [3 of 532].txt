each oracle only shows coords, so minimal linked personal data

[06-Oct-18 04:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Something like this would certainly attract a wide audience, outside of crypto, to showcase Komodo tech.

[06-Oct-18 04:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and only the oracle owner knows what is being tracked. I like it.

[06-Oct-18 04:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, me too.  Doubt goggle et al. would be impressed üòÉ

well if you're deep into channels, I'm gonna look at oracles. Not sure I'll get much donethis weekend, main focus now that dog is home is to finish up flir2qr before flight on monday.

I have things to do around the house today too, 2 year olds bday tomorrow. I think @Alright  has started on oracles so might have some pointers there. Channels seems unfinished, but getting used to it and trying it out is definatly a good use of our time.

[06-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I love the idea of a dog tracker posting to oracle... thats freeking cool lol.

a dog oracle! i dont think I would have ever thought of that one. very cool

[06-Oct-18 05:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, Think that it would be very good for exposure, appealing to a very broad audience, and viral potential. Cover general internet users, with the underlying message of privacy. (no corporate data collection).  That could make for a very multi-focused marketing campaign.

[06-Oct-18 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Has anyone tested the new `start.sh` and noticed any issues? if not I am going to move it to the done list on trello.

[06-Oct-18 05:10 AM] CrisF#3405
I've used it and don't recall any issues.  I'll restart node and check again.

[06-Oct-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main thing, I think is if you start a node right from scratch.

[06-Oct-18 05:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm still using a custom version

[06-Oct-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When it has never been run before.

[06-Oct-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries, custom verison are welcome.

[06-Oct-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never would have been able to make that one without changes you suggested in PR.

[06-Oct-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To test it 100% properly we nned to force it to do things like start a chain with no internet connection and try to sync when there are 2 competing chain forks.

[06-Oct-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Under normal curcimstances, it will always work.

[06-Oct-18 05:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
havent looked at your new one yet, but will soon enough. Plenty of distractions lately... but if the hound's wanderlust leads to kmd promo and more tech to avoid survailence thats a great outcome!

[06-Oct-18 05:13 AM] CrisF#3405
(when time available)

[06-Oct-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its not beyond the relm of possibility to make at all, which is cool. But not sure how much time it would take though lol... We have already spent a lot of unproductive time here, but we are all learning so its not all lost.

[06-Oct-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure reallyt cris.. I think I can test that stuff on one of my nodes, but I wrote it, its always better to get people who didnt write the code to test it.

[06-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I did to test it when i wrote it was just force it to return 0 values for thigns instead of polling the deamon, so I cant see why it wouldnt work.

[06-Oct-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can move it to done, and just hope if anyone has an issue they report it quick smart and I cna take a look at it.

[06-Oct-18 05:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Would you like to set up a more formal test, like set up some kind of problem (fork) and test that?

[06-Oct-18 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think we need to do that, at some point that will just happen as we use it.

[06-Oct-18 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the main thing will be on a very new chain under a few hundred blocks, it might not return longest chain and then the script wont be able to add the chain automatically.

[06-Oct-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or if there are nodes on wrong versions, but we have ways to stop that, when we hard fork we cna increaes STAKED portocol verison wihtout it affecting KMD minimum version, so as long as we know the change being pushed is hard forking, and we have enough notaries online at once to all restart at the same time, it will work without a hitch.

[06-Oct-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the work Alright is doing on oracles, we *might* even be able to issue a command via an oracle to the notary nodes nad tell them to auto update, that would be optimal if it worked.

[06-Oct-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there was one thing left, and that was to check komodo comits and build hte deamon automatically, and also allow having a chain to use a seperate deamon, incase one chain wants to test a contract that we dont want compiled into all the chains.

[06-Oct-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But that seems it can have many issues where things can go wrong

Starting work on this, as my next mini project for staked. It builds out on the new start.sh to also update komodod, and will allow a staked chain to use a seperate branch of komodod, which allows a single chain to take a CC contract without having all chains require it to be activated.
```1) check git for latest commit / commit we are on.
2) if needs update build komodo with this update, and if successful then continue with start.sh.
3) add parameter to assetchains.json and make sure all scripts are backwards compatible, should be able to add to exception for freq.
4) check the new branch for latest commit/commit current staked chain is on, and build if required. Save the commit hash with the compiled binary below.
5) copy each komodod built to StakedNotary/komodo/$chain/komodod and komodo-cli 
6) make start.sh start each chain with the binary needed, and change asset-cli and assets-cli to work from the correct path.```

[06-Oct-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its more a PoC for now, but this will allow the staked cluster to basically auto update totally on its own, via a cron task calling start.sh

[06-Oct-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or from a trigger from a trusted oracle

[06-Oct-18 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Along with what Alright is woring on with oracles, which will store the assetchains.json on the blockchain we can add chains to the cluster without all notary operators having to update at the same time.

[06-Oct-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this project is fast outgrowing what I thaught it would be when i agreed to work on it. Its been really great so far and I hope we can all keep pushing boundries together. Sorry I am not on channels with you @CrisF  and cant be of more help. I hope you can get he advice you need to keep testing that from @TonyL  or @jl777c

Thank you!

[06-Oct-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Added a butt load of logic to `checksync` function in `start.sh`
There is now pretty much every combination of pass/fail I can think of. So adding a new chain should be seemless, there is no chance dPoW will be called or the coin added to iguana if longestchain cannot be found. This seems to be the best way to know if the chain is in a stable condition. From earlier tests we also know adding dPoW to chains  under 128 blocks is a bad idea, so it wont allow chains under that to be added. 
I am assuming that `start.sh` is something that will be rn periodically. so if a chain has an issue, it will just be added on the next round provided that issue has been resolved by some person that noticed the chain add failed and rectified the issue.

[06-Oct-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this requires only 1 operator to be active on each update rather than all of them.

It all works, but I have 1 reproducable bug, when it updates master branch and kills KMD with iguana still running, as soon as iguana tries to call `unlocklockunspent` it crashes... not really that big of a deal, as it restarts it again later on and still works. No problem for adding coins on a seperate branch though. It might be best to restart iguana if master is updated anyway. Will investigate tomorrow.

going to make a trollbox chain based on KV, I made it to where the diff never raises. We can use an on-demand blocks chain, so all txs are mined almost instantly

don't use chain for now, will figure it out

[06-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
fyi i use Makefiles to do `make vps` and `make acnet` for making vps and docker nets for acs. which are simple "bash like" execution.
i think it would be handy here...like
1) `make current` for starting a chain for current testing #kmdlabs wide
2)  `make testXYZ` for starting a chain testing XYZ feature
3) `make jok3rXYZ` for starting a chain for jok3r's pet for the week
etc. etc.

i'll demonstrate how it will be useful here this week, because i can imagine several chains being tested concurrently in this channel.

[06-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Mylo#8306
easier to manage with a makefile is the benefit imo

[06-Oct-18 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really. The branch is in assetchains.json

[06-Oct-18 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If there is no branch then then it uses master

[06-Oct-18 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All you do is add the chain and its branch to assetchains.json then run start.sh

[06-Oct-18 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

there are consensus rules changed in it, so testing would accomplish the same

its an integer ü§∑

[07-Oct-18 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the function clearly is defined as `unsigned int`

[07-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it print the value of that functions return

[07-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from block 0

[07-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when the diff is 1

[07-Oct-18 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then just made the function return that as a static value

[07-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and commented out the entire `unsigned int GetNextWorkRequired` function

[07-Oct-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once this works, I will also disable `getblocktemplate`  so that stratums dont work, although i doubt there will be anything stopping someone removing that change and flooding empty blocks anyway.
