and combined with stake allocations, get a very good idea of the active stake

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everything is there for ppl to build these tools. Just nobody did it.

[08-Jul-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's a shitton of ajax and js to add to the existing spaghetti 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so display segid balances and recent segid staked blocks

[08-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be a dedicated app

[08-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
PoS64 is designed as a strategy game, with chain coins the prize

[08-Jul-19 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
YASSS!

[08-Jul-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I added RPC calls to extract the info very fast from the daemon, but nobody has built anything using them. Thats not what I am good at, and it would waste increadible amount of my time.

[08-Jul-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not for a core dev

[08-Jul-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is for a GUI dev

[08-Jul-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it should be a dedicated app`
Which brings us back to the same major problem as with "everything" else:
a shortage of qualified web devs and designers 😦

it just needs someone to make a decent enough bounty, this doesnt require much blockchain knowledge

[08-Jul-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basically none at all really

[08-Jul-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the PoS64 visualiser can just be a non-wallet GUI display

[08-Jul-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
can even animate funds moving from one segid to another with each block

[08-Jul-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, who's up to pay the $30-50k so that noobs can enjoy staking? 😛

[08-Jul-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
Damn thats ice cold

[08-Jul-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[08-Jul-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
but it is a game of accumulation

[08-Jul-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not as cold as being the one trying to get shit done and being given prices in that range 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol freelance devs are so wiley!

[08-Jul-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
i dont blame anyone... i disliked all the UI work i had to do in school

[08-Jul-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
at leat in PHP it made sense to me

[08-Jul-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if someone wrote up a detailed spec of what is needed and how to get the data, i doubt it would cost that much. without a spec, this wont go anywhere

[08-Jul-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`at leat in PHP it made sense to me`
so, do it in PHP 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 02:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
i was already half a step there... new VM spinning up i have an idea

[08-Jul-19 02:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
CHMEX and weby linked me stuff earlier

[08-Jul-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1) call getsnapshot every X blocks (someting reasonable like 10 or 20 would likey be fine) 
2) call getlastsegidstakes Y blocks 
thats just about it. 
that will give you how many coins are in each segid. 
and the amount of blocks staked by each segid in the last Y blocks.

does not give utxo number per segid... but I dont think thats hard to add form my end if its required

[08-Jul-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
just wanted to write that I can make buttons and text labels

[08-Jul-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
utxo number wont matter much

[08-Jul-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577

what is this bounty being discussed? tl;dr?

[08-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
I do agree that staking should be easier for noobs, but I also agree with joker in that the person who puts more time into their strategy should be rewarded more

[08-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
I think being able to generate an address in each segid, splitting coins between these and `setgenerate true 0` is enough for a noob

they were refined, but not published cause I was alone to test

[09-Jul-19 12:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
(launch agama just to have the daemon running, launch the script that gets addresses and priv generated to save, then decide the amount and split auto with preformed sendmany, tweakable amount possible, as the preformed just assume a /64 split, but it s an inputbox to change on each address/segid xD)

[09-Jul-19 12:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Alright the goal was to trivialize the segid stuff to any guy just wanting to stake on any platform, I even released videos to explain how it worked, shitty videos but yet, working stuff based on pos64splitter

[09-Jul-19 12:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
it was just a few hours of shitty powershell gui building :D

@blackjok3r - Crashed my LABS Staking daemon.
```152 seconds until elegible, waiting.
0d4cc66e0eb438c025b653e8d75b4da339cd55c7a7402498c326bed1180334df mined LABS block 62355!
komodod: coins.cpp:564: const CTxOut& CCoinsViewCache::GetOutputFor(const CTxIn&) const: Assertion `coins && coins->IsAvailable(input.prevout.n)' failed.
PubKey not set. Exiting```
Nothing in debug.log.
It's been staking fine for weeks - until yesterday when it hang after mining an orphan block.
Restarted, mined a couple then as above.

[09-Jul-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm thats a diffrent one lol. thanks. Will check it out

[09-Jul-19 08:52 AM] CMaurice#1685
here notice to myself to produce a LABS staking doc aiui  in the next few hours

[09-Jul-19 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  I cant be 100% sure, but I think this crash is related to the known bug. My guess from that line of code and where its being called from, is that your node selected a utxo it thaught was unspent, however it probably was infact spent. 
I think a -rescan after such a thing happens would be a good idea to make sure it doesnt happen again, at least for a while. This is preobably something I should focus on with this many staking chain now live. Its a very rare bug, but it could be pretty annoying for people to stop staking if they are not monitoring they staking node.

[09-Jul-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its all down to how the stakeing chains have to handle reorgs. The staking tx needs to be cleared from the wallet, otherwise it gets inserted back into the mempool, and hte utxo becomes  is not elegible to stake for 100 blocks or more.

[09-Jul-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The simple fix is probbly to call gettxout on the selected staking utxo before using it, but I dont think thats a very nice fix.

[09-Jul-19 09:20 AM] CMaurice#1685
is there a cli environment for komodo on Windows? with PowerShell or whatever?

[09-Jul-19 09:21 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think I get what you mean. After the orphan the node was stuck (tx at -1) so I did a full wallet and chain delete. Re-imported address list and reset. The the crash was 24+h later.

[09-Jul-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh... hmm

[09-Jul-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really need to try and work out how to handle reorgs properly. Because they are quite frequent, at leats early chain, I am seeing far less of them on my node now than I was, but they do still happen.

[09-Jul-19 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CMaurice  @Deleted User  was just talking about such a thing a few posts above.

[09-Jul-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel  damn, so its not what I thaught it was if you did that, that kind of sucks.... Might be hard to track down, stupid asserts, you cant even use GDB to backtrace where it was called from, becuase assert shuts it down, not crashes it. Maybe you can try to comment out that assert and run it in GDB, not sure you will see it again though.

User Verus agama... and the Debug menu has a link for the exe folder. There you can manually launch coins with the konodod.exe and call the daemon with komodo-cli.exe right from command line

[09-Jul-19 01:19 PM] CMaurice#1685
yes I know, and won't ever use Windows, jus for he purposes of a doc that Windows users might read

ive had ZEXO trying to stake with the cli in Win 10  like this but no luck yet

[09-Jul-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`MGNX goes nuts and stakes just fine`
likely because 3 people stopped staking it long ago 😛

[09-Jul-19 01:24 PM] CMaurice#1685
I used to squashfs entire systems to LiveCDs to run in ram so as to have a deterministic sys

this is talking about a new way for iguana to select utxos. I will be merging this to LABS sometime soon for use to test and debug it/

thought you had a kind ogf ramstaker script

[09-Jul-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a-team has been running it for weeks with no issues, but its no where near production ready. OP error will break many things.

[09-Jul-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ramstaker is builtininto the daemon when you have more than 500 utxos
