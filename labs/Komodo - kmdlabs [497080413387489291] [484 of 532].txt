⚠ Warned `kevinkatovic#1278`

[11-Oct-19 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic I'm not selling my LABS any time soon, so I give 0 feks what the current market price is

[11-Oct-19 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll still profit when I sell them

[11-Oct-19 06:41 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
whilst he's trying to dump immediately we're focused on accumulating it

[11-Oct-19 06:41 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
cant argue with him lol

[11-Oct-19 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic 
I don't need "more frequent" payments

I just take a larger portion of existing because I have a larger portion of the hashrate (that's how mining works)

[11-Oct-19 06:44 PM] kevinkatovic#1278

is it just me or the world is getting crazier? 🤡

[11-Oct-19 06:50 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Is coinsquare trying to steal the bitcoin I puchased?  I've never had a withdraw delayed like this what has just changed for me.  Why has this become a loser suddenly?

[11-Oct-19 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you just notice it more now @mrlynch

[11-Oct-19 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic this is neither the place for coinsquare (wtfever that is) or BTC

[11-Oct-19 06:51 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Its suddenly a obstructing piece of shit.....

Well 1.5% loss on your fiat is moderately better than 20-30% loss when going to bitcoin hence I chose coinsquare however suddenly it seems to suffer from brain damage

`your obstructing my bitcoin deposit`
how stoned are you?

[11-Oct-19 07:11 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
I dont know I have never had my withdraw take this long before and since I reported 2 felons that have accepted payments from me in the past perhaps they are insistantly expecting all deposits be monitored and maybe that leads to coinsquare going under criminal charges perhaps?

@kevinkatovic  this is not on topic for kmdlabs please use other topics

[11-Oct-19 07:13 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well what is on topic?  Do you use criminals to generate bitcoin for kmdlabs?

[11-Oct-19 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
neither KMDLabs nor LABS "generates bitcoin"

[11-Oct-19 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what you do with private 3rd parties is on you

[11-Oct-19 07:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no. you are admiting to funding felons. we do not generate btc for anyone. take your conversation to the appropriate channels, you have been told twice, and are close to being muted.
