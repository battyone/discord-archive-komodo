@blackjok3r because I'm too lazy to keep tabbing:
Would DEX still be such an issue if the fork were shorter? If it were just a few blocks, it would switch over fairly quickly, no?

[24-Aug-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, if the real chain is longer that is what it will follow

[24-Aug-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notarisations stop the chain from reorging, but if it follows the longest on on initial sync, it never goes backwards

``[nSPV2] ABORTING!!! failed to update please build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh to see what problem is! Help Human!`` as there is nSPV2 in front, should I perform ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh or sth else ?

[24-Aug-19 03:59 PM] CMaurice#1685
Yep  ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh

[24-Aug-19 03:59 PM] phm87#7395
``~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh -j6`` went fine manually

[24-Aug-19 04:01 PM] phm87#7395
maybe I should git checkout nspv2 branch before, I'm not sure

[24-Aug-19 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
When the output says `please build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh`, I usually find it helpful to build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh

[24-Aug-19 04:02 PM] phm87#7395
I did and it worked fine

[24-Aug-19 04:18 PM] phm87#7395
but maybe I should first checkout this https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/tree/nSPV2 then build it

weird that it does not compile with the script

[24-Aug-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's not really "weird", sometimes when switching from branch to branch there are different dependencies and running the build script again gets them

[24-Aug-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it suffers from Gitus Imperfectus

[24-Aug-19 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
mmmhhhh whatever it have all binaries, if fails after launch now, I see in process list that there are 2 LABS : one with ac_name in lowercase and one in uppercase ... maybe it needs one per iguana

[24-Aug-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
I though it would be one KMD per iguana or a trick to use only one KMD node

sure its not `-ac_cclib=labs`?

[24-Aug-19 05:35 PM] phm87#7395
Yeah but I saw 2 processes with ac_name=LABS but now I found the error and it notarized coins so that s fine. Thank you

[24-Aug-19 07:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i could be wrong but the trend i see is that these nodes are doing the most of the notarizations on average and they are in the bestk most of the time.
```
new PENDING BESTK.9( 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, )
```

[25-Aug-19 06:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The bestk stuff will take thousands of notarizatons to even out. As its randomly chosen. 
Also because f updates, not all nodes are in recvmask for long enough to have any meaningful result.

[25-Aug-19 06:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might take a few days even a week to know if it works as intended. One Thing I cna say for sure is its 100x better than it was.

[25-Aug-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have bearly minsigs nodes online, so mostl of the time the same nodes wil be chosen, because they are the only ones that comitted to the recvmask.

[25-Aug-19 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I need to add some logging on the iguana side, to log which nodes are in the recvmask each round. 
That will give us something to filters out nodes with lower counts that were not actually  up the entire time. 
The bestk rotates via the block height, but it does not notarize every 5th block,  so it takes many days to average out to the same numbers.

[25-Aug-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  please read the document pinned in #priv-notarynode , it explains how the bestks and best mask is chosen in great detail with examples, if it is not doing what this document describes, then it is a bug, and I still have not fixed it.

[25-Aug-19 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
(fairly quick scan)

[25-Aug-19 11:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, ok, found a few.

[25-Aug-19 11:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Only see it with `KMD.1 more blocks` in the ones I've found

[25-Aug-19 11:49 AM] CrisF#3405
and there's a `2 more blocks`

[25-Aug-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that KMD suppress thing is the bane of my existance... I tried sooo hard to make all nodes agree on it, and they still dont sometimes

[25-Aug-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im really thinking it needs to me removed...

[25-Aug-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe only enforced for ondemand chains

[26-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  @daemonfox  @Bar_F1sh_Rel  
Your nodes are not working it seems. The rest of the nodes are all quite close, but these 3 are lagging very far behind for some reason. If you need any help please ping me.

[26-Aug-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say as a guess that you are not in recvmask, but I dont have my node up to check rn.

[26-Aug-19 12:14 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r can't play RN - but I suspect still having network issues.

[26-Aug-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK no worries. Just letting you know whats up.

[26-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
What are the most important ports

[26-Aug-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
8222 that is all now. 
ONce this CFEK test is over, I will merge everything back to master branch etc... Dont want to change it while most nodes are up, we need to collect data on counts

i have a dust TX stuck in my KMD wallet and I cant get the reset to run... assuming its cuz that dust tx  is listed as my first unspent in listunspent... and the send calc is not using a proper mining fee...

[26-Aug-19 12:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
but I can figure out the proper way to send it all with the right fee...

[26-Aug-19 12:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
sometimes it sells me how it costs extra so this is the fee... I do math and send it and somehow dust is still left

[26-Aug-19 12:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
and reset still cant figure out how to send it with proper fee

[26-Aug-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

counts are onyl slightly down.

[26-Aug-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rescan the wallet
`./komodo-cli rescanwalletfromheight 1000000`

[26-Aug-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that RPC in in LABS.

since that last update mine are way diwn and i hadnt cleaned it ina  while

[26-Aug-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have some other problem.. its not utxos

[26-Aug-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
i know it isnt UTXOS

[26-Aug-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
but your telling me the wallet bloat doesnt matter now...

[26-Aug-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bad counts can only be causeed by a bad recvmask, its a network issue or you simply dont have any utxos at all

[26-Aug-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you get "insufficient funds" from a raw, you feked something hard
