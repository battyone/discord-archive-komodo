Need some feedback, what pairs should we be going after on CEXs?

[19-May-19 11:55 PM] Alright#0419
should we concentrate all volume to KMD/LABS?

[19-May-19 11:55 PM] Alright#0419
or should we have BTC/LABS KMD/LABS ARRR/LABS etc

[19-May-19 11:56 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  on KMDLabs, you explained to me that you don' notarize KMD on BTC but did you ever discuss to notarize KMD on testnet of BTC ?

[19-May-19 11:57 PM] phm87#7395
I have no clues about volume things except that more pairs will lead to arbitrage or techniques similar to arbitrage (see "smith poloniex bot" article for an example) then more volume

[19-May-19 11:58 PM] phm87#7395
Personnaly, I prefer to have LABS/BTC and LABS/KMD

[19-May-19 11:58 PM] phm87#7395
if LABS is minable on equihash algo, I can add it on my pool but I need LABS/BTC price to have proper graphs

[19-May-19 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
it's 49/51 POW/POS

[20-May-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
equihash

[20-May-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
so a LABS/BTC pair is important?

[20-May-19 12:00 AM] phm87#7395
Cool

[20-May-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
I had planned to market make on KMD/LABS, but I'm not sure I can do it on BTC/LABS

[20-May-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
guess I'll *have to* if we have one

[20-May-19 12:01 AM] phm87#7395
some guys are expert to do this (its a job)

[20-May-19 12:01 AM] phm87#7395
I heard

[20-May-19 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
I've been practicing ðŸ˜ˆ

[20-May-19 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
I'd like to pioneer mm2, but I think CEX listings are still important

[20-May-19 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
I'm hoping most of our volume can eventually be on mm2, but it takes a bit of bootstrapping to establish a market

[20-May-19 12:04 AM] phm87#7395
performances of CEX are still better than DEX right now and everything I read about game theory of CEX vs DEX doesn't say that DEX will suceed. I don't believe anything and I'm just waiting for either DEX or CEX to grow

[20-May-19 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
DEXs aren't likely to support high frequency trading without introducing some degree of centralization

[20-May-19 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
on chain DEXs might be able to do high freq trading, but on chain orderbooks introduce a lot of problems
