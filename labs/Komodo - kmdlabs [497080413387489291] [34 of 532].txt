Naa this is just for my personal use/testing üòÉ Just thought you guys would know a lot about doing so!

[14-Oct-18 12:33 AM] CrisF#3405
üòé

[14-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
we can add any chains you guys like during testnet phase

[14-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
after that notaries will have to decide what gets added

[14-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka trick to running a chain on a single server is using different users and different ports for each

[14-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419

[14-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
who is that?

[14-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
just saw your messages, wasn't paying attention to the chat

[14-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
you need to do `komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 kvupdate 03e9a1d8692006b173d9ac24a797d8b05ddb6df84a56c01984861fde601da91648 <USERNAME> 1000 <password>`

[14-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
and the name you set will show up in chat

[14-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
I'll get chat history along with timestamps working sometime this week

[14-Oct-18 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
if anyone knows anyone capable of writing a discord bridge bot for it, please tell them to contact me with a quote

[14-Oct-18 02:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright 1648 is me.

[14-Oct-18 02:21 AM] CrisF#3405
I did kvupdate but no change. Will try again when back.

[14-Oct-18 02:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Is @polycryptoblog the one who does it for new chains?

[14-Oct-18 02:23 AM] CrisF#3405
(discord bridge)

[14-Oct-18 02:25 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[14-Oct-18 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might have a go at discord bot... Getting the messages from the chain and making a bot post them here should be easy enough, but the other way will be  much harder.

[14-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be that hard

[14-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Alright#0419
discord has an api for this exact thing

[14-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Alright#0419
am I missing something?

[14-Oct-18 02:39 AM] Alright#0419
bot can just have it's own pubkey and show [DISCORD:<USER>]

[14-Oct-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah found a few bots already... just the alias and stuff seems harder to

[14-Oct-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might be the only way to do it.

[14-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
who is this `[03e9a1d8692006b173d9ac24a797d8b05ddb6df84a56c01984861fde601da91648]:maaaa`

[14-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
@sclear ?

[14-Oct-18 02:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[14-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
no idea when these happened

[14-Oct-18 02:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Was waiting for better instruction for oracle

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
needs timestamps

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
joker, did you script setup?

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ok ... I think I should finish the scripts

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I tested earlier today

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
thought I saw them but I looked for them and didn't see them

[14-Oct-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
needs that before btot

[14-Oct-18 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made some very simple ones, just each command and gets address from config.ini

[14-Oct-18 02:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ran into trouble adding my pubkey

[14-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
can you take a look at the PR I submitted on stakedchain/komodo

[14-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
that's a hardfork, yes?

[14-Oct-18 02:51 AM] CrisF#3405

[14-Oct-18 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
if that's not you, something is bugged

[14-Oct-18 03:04 AM] CrisF#3405
I see that too.  Not sure why.  I'm still using a different pubkey on this node than the pubkey I set for TROLLbox.

[14-Oct-18 03:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Works well enough.  Something changed overnight.

Thx

[14-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
I'll make it default to that for the time being

[14-Oct-18 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For rooms, all you do is oraclescreate right ? and we can use the same trick with KV for the room name as you did for username ?

[14-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
the room name is the name of the oracle

[14-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
you can add a description too

[14-Oct-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is there an oracles list ?

[14-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
yes, `oracleslist`

[14-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
I have a script to print the name too if you want it

[14-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
oraclescreate name description format

[14-Oct-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you would need to iterate over that to extract all the names ?

[14-Oct-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
format has to be S for chat room

[14-Oct-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
`oraclescreate <name> <description> S`

[14-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
can't find the script >.<

[14-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
I'll recreate it tomorrow if I can't find it

[14-Oct-18 05:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, it's not for public I figure.  Only optional.

[14-Oct-18 05:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll figure out a way to encode the data so only auth can read it

[14-Oct-18 05:07 AM] CrisF#3405
If to test aimed at private chain and oracle.

[14-Oct-18 05:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
