[23-Nov-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this can be an automated timed operation I am 99% sure of that after today, it went pretty well over all.

[23-Nov-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes yop unede to kill FEKING

[23-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and sync from a known good node with connect =

[23-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seemed the only way to get it unstuck here

[23-Nov-18 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
How can I start a single ac in StakedNotary?

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just stop the one you want to start

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then run start.sh

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
give it some time to actually stop before runnign start though couple of mins at least

[23-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to wipe data dir for it aswell

[23-Nov-18 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.

[23-Nov-18 12:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, so I understand why you need this chain. For testing purposes etc. 
But... the main question I have is that this coin/token will also be used to pay the devs. The main problem I can see arise here is what will give the Token itself value, so the dev will do the work in exchange for the LABS token. 
As I understand from discussion in #team-business-dev LABS will be PoS and created from thin air by NN when a contract is fulfilled. (who will decide the size of the bounty? Notaries?)
Before starting to test, a dev will need to think about the task and the possible bounty they can earn. 
So let's say JL wants to have a smart contract tested and puts it up for testing on the LABS chain. The notaries then say ok, testing of this contract will have a 1000 LABS reward. 
Then the dev has a decision to make, is 1000 LABS enough to put his time/effort into testing the contract.
My main question/concern: LABS isnt worth anything, because there is no demand for it, as it is created from thin air. Nobody will need to buy labs for any reason whatsoever, because the rewards are created from thin air.
Problem: If LABS isnt worth anything because nobody will buy it, why would a dev put in time/effort into testing if they are paid with worthless tokens.

How will you make LABS worth something and is this the best way to incentivize devs by paying them in LABS?

[23-Nov-18 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
cryptocurrency is created from "thin air"

[23-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
your understanding of how the bounties work isn't exactly correct

[23-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
there is a weekly(maybe monthly) limit on how much coins can be created for bounties

[23-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
a limit, doesn't mean all will be created

[23-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
it also does not roll over

[23-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
the notaries will have to be well informed about the current value of LABS and how severe a bug is

Readme updated just now Genie

[23-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
just run start.sh @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[23-Nov-18 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all you need to do is start.sh

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
proveded you ran all the install scripts and they compelted.

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Cryptoon Is your question question what gives LABS value?

{Reactions}
‚úî 

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
earn LABS, learning as you go. Earn enough to launch your own project needing testing paid in LABS

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
the innovation and work put into LABS is what gives it value, no gimmicks otherwise

[23-Nov-18 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
work being the key factor

[23-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But you want to attract devs? Then they need to be incentivized with something, incentivizing them with LABS that doesnt really hold value will not work

What gives KMD value? BTC value?

[23-Nov-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why do you have changes to readme.d

[23-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
work put into it and utility IMO

[23-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What BTC gives value is someone asking 10.000 of them for a pizza.
If nobody is offering anything for the LABS they earn, then it doesnt matter

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`git reset --hard`

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
I will buy all the LABS you earn üòõ

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I"d wager LABS might also get some airdrop love by grateful projects

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`why do you have changes to readme.d`
Because something you wrote changed it

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just git reset hard  and try again

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you say a project that wants stuff tested needs to buy LABS, then it makes perfect sense

@Cryptoon It's not the coin or money that provide the incentive.

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works... plenty of people used it today

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because having to buy it gives it value

[23-Nov-18 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
They do

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But you said it was created from thin air :p

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] jorian#4555

How is KMD created?

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
mining/rewards

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] CrisF#3405
This is going to fast for me, haha.

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notary nodes create just like they do with KMD .... but here they need to vote and deocide who earnt it

[23-Nov-18 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
mining being work, rewards being very similar to POS

[23-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I get the feeling somehow we are close to saying the same thing but going in circles

[23-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can also mine/stake it

[23-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
we have POW and work in the sense of finding bugs

[23-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
