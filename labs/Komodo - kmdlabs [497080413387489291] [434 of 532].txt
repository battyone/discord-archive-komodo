still nada

[17-Jun-19 05:59 PM] phm87#7395
if the 'help human' error happens after a new start.sh when AC and KMD were stopped, it means that KMD is taking too much time to start. You should do ``komodo-cli getinfo`` until KMD is started then you can launch again start.sh

[17-Jun-19 06:00 PM] phm87#7395
but maybe I am wrong on this one : your error have [master] in front so maybe it is not related to KMD start

[17-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Exile13#4458
oh ok THank you @phm87

does `cleanwallettransactions` work with pre-sapling transactions?

sorry couldn't help myself 😄

[18-Jun-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only thing I can think of of the top.of my head is the wrong pubkey is on the code. Can't check this anytime soon, maybe tomorrow I'll have time

[18-Jun-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Even that makes no sense. Everything should load from config.ini

[18-Jun-19 02:34 AM] CrisF#3405
`CrisF's problem is his LABS daemon was running with a different pubkey than the one in config.ini `
Yes, I didn't set the incorrect pubkey manually though. Not sure how it was set incorrectly.

How can I see what utxo I have for an address?

[18-Jun-19 03:31 AM] Don King#8901
Thanks!

[18-Jun-19 03:39 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli listunspent | jq '[.[] | select(.address=="RVAddyxxxxxxxx")]'` if you want utxo from a specific address

[18-Jun-19 03:52 AM] Don King#8901
What is the best way to combine lots of small utxo from mining, to get better results from staking?

[18-Jun-19 03:55 AM] zatJUM#9924
Send the whole balance to yourself

[18-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Don King#8901
So send from my mining address to myself again? Can I pick which utxo to combine?

[18-Jun-19 04:17 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, thanks!

[18-Jun-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`listunspent 6 9999999 "[\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"]"`
much faster than invoking jq 🤷🏽

[18-Jun-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it's even in the help reply 🙃

[18-Jun-19 04:34 AM] PHBA2061#2530
wow I didn't know that, used jq because it allows to select any field 😂

[18-Jun-19 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I guess I should add that "much faster" is relative to the number of addys and UTXOs

how to set  wallet win

[18-Jun-19 05:33 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not sure what you mean by "set wallet win"

[18-Jun-19 05:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
without interogative punctuation, it might be a statement. The lack of a second sentence seems to imply it cant be done. I disagree.

[18-Jun-19 05:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
BTW, I was compelled to write some powershell scripts for KMD last week. This could be applied to creating a variant of LABs scripts for Windows users.
I dont use Windows, and I'm not enough of a Windows fan to do it for free, but could perhaps be motivated to do so if it was considered a bounty worthy endeavor.

[18-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Not sure what it is `can't be done` ?

The only reason I can think of is to lower the entry barrier to those that dont know anything beyond windows.

I'd still encourage they evolve to Linux tho....

How to install Labs wallet for window

{Reactions}
☝🏽 

[18-Jun-19 07:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bamby, depends what you want to do

[18-Jun-19 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can use Verus Agama as a basic GUI window

[18-Jun-19 07:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you want to have fun in CLI though, I'd recommend installing Ubuntu and learning Terminal

[18-Jun-19 07:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can use powershel or command prompt, but it wouldnt be any harder to go linux native

hey guys, haven't been able to follow this channel for a few days. Finally coming out of my KMD fork prep hole 😅 If there is anything that needs doing/looking at, please let me know. Will pick up work on prices CC chain this week. Still trying to work out what we're doing for user wallets as well. Either have to work out something ourselves, ask VRSC to add LABS to their Agama or wait until KomodoOcean is updated to latest codebase

[18-Jun-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
Also, made a bit of progress on a fork of the electrum desktop app, should be able to use it as our lite wallet. Has ledger and trezor support 😄

[18-Jun-19 05:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
an ideal might be to dogfood kmdlabs: investors pay devs to dev pricesscc to something that doesn't have the house, like Amoveo, for example

don't want to step on any toes, no idea what anyone's obligations are

[18-Jun-19 05:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
just an idea

[18-Jun-19 05:46 PM] CMaurice#1685
spin it up, a few rounds of pretend betting, testing and management

[18-Jun-19 05:46 PM] CMaurice#1685
see if it can go off on its own

[18-Jun-19 05:48 PM] CMaurice#1685

It's a good idea @CMaurice.  Some will have ideas, but not the devs.

[19-Jun-19 09:11 AM] CrisF#3405
There have been a few people who have come in looking for that sort of help already.

[19-Jun-19 09:11 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe one dev is/was working on a project coming from that.

[19-Jun-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is just a very bad time for most of us. Not a bad idea, hopefully in a month or 2 after fork labs can get going and actually do some stuff

Has anyone here looked at the PBaaS and merge mining Mike put into the latest VRSC Agama?

[20-Jun-19 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
I think taking that and finding a way to use it to move your non mining chains would be an easy way to solve that problem.

[21-Jun-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I have and its not really useful, changes too much stuff.

It was supposed to be listed at launch but wasn't for some reason, not that I deal with those kind of things, left all that to alright.

how can you send LABS from a KMD address? if the addy was made in a mobile wallet?

[21-Jun-19 06:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
then you need to extract the privkey from the wallet first

[21-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Exile13#4458
i have the WIF

[21-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Exile13#4458
use the KMD QT Wallet?

[21-Jun-19 06:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't think there is any wallet that support LABS yet, you have to use komodo-cli

[21-Jun-19 06:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS importprivkey Uxxxxx

[21-Jun-19 06:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
then send from it with sendtoaddress

[21-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Exile13#4458
started komodo there

[21-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Exile13#4458
but the command doesnt work

[21-Jun-19 07:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yes you need to run komdod with LABS

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] PHBA2061#2530
easiest way is import the privkey in you notary node

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
but Idk if that will mess up your notarization or not

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you have a 2nd node, then launch komodod with the parameter of LABS here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json>

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Exile13#4458
Ya idk about notaries

I just have one

[21-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Exile13#4458
@PHBA2061 would i put that info from the .json you posted into the config file?

[21-Jun-19 08:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hi @Exile13 - I take it you want to send LABS from a running labs full node

[21-Jun-19 08:33 PM] Exile13#4458
end result is trying to send LABS at all from CLI, the Radd was made n a mobile wallet

[21-Jun-19 08:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Give me a sec - switching to pc from mobile

[21-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Sounds like you sent LABS to an R-addy created in KMD and now you want to send it out - so you will need a full LABS daemon running

[21-Jun-19 08:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
If you have a 'Staked' github repo installed you should be able to start the correct chain.

[21-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you will not need KMD running, you will need the LABS version of the KMD daemon (I think we are still a couple of merges away from a 'standard' Master KMD branch)
