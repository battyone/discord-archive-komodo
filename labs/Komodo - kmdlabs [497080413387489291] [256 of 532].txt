you specify the name and evalcode along with all the methods, a bit of help and the number of params

[29-Jan-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then there is the handling of the rpc method and validation that of course needs to be done. to get this working I implemented a sudoku CC today

[29-Jan-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
still need to do validation and the claiming of winnings from solving the sudoku. it is an -ac_script chain going to the CC address, from where the sudoku games are funded

[29-Jan-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a solver is included, but will be using timestamps to verify it has human like solve times, ie. solving the sudoku will serve as the captcha

@Alright 
Did this on CFEKPOS51 with validation, my node validated it and then started  being baned by peers. I think we can start a chain

we can list on barterly which is easier :troll_cool:

[29-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
spoke with 2 CEXs, have the money to cover both listings, but I'm not sure it's great for the project to be listed immediately after launch

[29-Jan-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
if we did list immediately after launch, it'd likely be on a single CEX to concentrate volume

*if* trying a "final run" at bdex, I'd suggest we (presumably "I" unless someone else offers assistance) revamp the BarterDEX GUI to, at a minimum, have coin features as 1st screen and not buried in a n00b confusing labyrinth (unless it's already been changed since last I used it)
