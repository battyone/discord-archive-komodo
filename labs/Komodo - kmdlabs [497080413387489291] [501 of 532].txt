^ this was the priginal output fromt he DAPP using the ! at the end of the message

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
thjats what the PR has

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
is not what the PR had

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
and when i checked a min ago... thats the output I copied to paste here right from DAPP

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem a bug in the dapp

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
just pasted a txid where you shouldn't have

[28-Oct-19 08:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i pasted badly somewhere

[28-Oct-19 08:51 PM] Oszy#5734
@Alright in the dApp if you go step by step, it does not clear screen so step 4 tx id is still visible then step 5 signed message is printed out, that's how @daemonfox copied both together

[28-Oct-19 08:52 PM] Oszy#5734
I didn't have this problem because I kept changing between steps and my tx id was cleared by the time i got to step 5 游뗵

[28-Oct-19 08:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thx! I see exactly how i screwed that up now. No bug just human error.

[28-Oct-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
screen should clear

[28-Oct-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
every time it outputs something, clears it first

[28-Oct-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
so kind of a bug if it isn't

[28-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Oszy#5734
i clearly remember things like tx id  staying on top of the window, i can try to replicate if it doesn't mess up anything now

[28-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
can't break it now

[28-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
it's just based on the terminal you're using

[28-Oct-19 08:55 PM] Oszy#5734
maybe ubuntu GUI terminal bug

@LabsAssistant setting a deadline for changing keys, +8 hours from now
PR to https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/participants.json if you need it changed 

"signed_msg" field should be a signed message from your previous key, "pubkey" field should be your new pubkey

Just throwing it out there...

[28-Oct-19 09:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
That same message also failed in the AGAMA CLI

[28-Oct-19 09:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
Fun the KomodoOcean parsed it no issue

[28-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
worked in py, don't worry about it

[28-Oct-19 09:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
i did that first

[28-Oct-19 09:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
bash failed

[28-Oct-19 09:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
then tried KOcean cuz i had it open

[28-Oct-19 09:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
figured id check agama too to see

[28-Oct-19 09:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
bash "fail" is likely just a parse/escape issue

[28-Oct-19 09:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
right... i didnt format the string to accomodate the ! through bash... but py took care of it

[28-Oct-19 09:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
so QT also apparently accounts for it

[28-Oct-19 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
not so much that QT "accounts for it" as that it's a functional character in bash

[28-Oct-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
computers are stupid and they do what they think you're telling them to do (which may or may not be what you think you're telling them to do)

the people I trust the most with power care so little about power that they don't know how much power they have

[28-Oct-19 09:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly...

[28-Oct-19 09:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```Instead of a split RPC and writing heaps of code, I  added this.
For example:
utxovalue = 30;
30% of the value of the staking utxo is added to the coinbase the same as fees,returning the remaining 70% to the address that staked.
utxovalue can be adjusted from any number 0 to 100 via the setstakingsplit RPC.
Can also be set with -splitperc= command line arg, or conf file. 
0 means that it functions as it did previously, and you can use external scripts.
100 means it automates the pos64staker in the daemon (current default), combining the stake tx and the coinbase to an address. Either to -pubkey or a new address from the keystore.
Mining with some optimal % inbetween and without pubkey will over time create varied sized utxos, and evenly distribute them over many addresses and segids.```
Does this sound useful for PoS64?  I already made it and it works perfectly 游땏

[28-Oct-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
all good CHMEX
