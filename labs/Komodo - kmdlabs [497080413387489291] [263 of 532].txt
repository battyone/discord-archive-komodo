With enout notaries... crating an invalid notarisation becomes just about impossible... with a small amount its likely

[01-Feb-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, back to me being me:
Make the pool do what's needed and not make the daemon slave to an antiquated pool that was written for BTC 5 years ago

[01-Feb-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that wont help

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the notarisation is determined at the last step of connect block...

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the actual last

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is no way to invalidate it ubntil then

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My first idea was to change block version for notarisation blocks... then teh mempool could be purged of that tx

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but @jl777c  said I cant do it that way

[01-Feb-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you set up your pool with code that doesn't work for our system, then you get assed out
I'm not seeing the "won't work" part

[01-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the invalid notarisatino thats the problem

[01-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant know its valid

[01-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until the end

[01-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and how do you stop it propagating to another block?

[01-Feb-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, it would be handled just like any other bad block that the daemon refuses to validate

[01-Feb-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until the notarisation is put back in the mempool and priotitised to tx 1 of the next block that was mined

[01-Feb-19 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
do you understrand the problem?

[01-Feb-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that happens that tx needs to be invalid

[01-Feb-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without changing its version.. or the blocks version that is very hard

[01-Feb-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All a node receiving that tx can see is the tx.... not the ones pervious... you only have that data when you connect block

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do you understrand the problem?`
no, I don't
`node_modules/stratum-pool/lib/pool.js:255:                        emitErrorLog('Daemon instance ' + result.instance.index + ' rejected a supposedly valid block');`

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and with dPoW once that happens then that connect block cannot be reversed

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
miner sends invalid block to nodes.....

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Look I dont think you get it

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the tx taht invaldiates teh block...

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you cant know its valid

[01-Feb-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until its conencted to the tip

[01-Feb-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so when that happens that tx cannot be put back to the mempool...as its invalid notarisation

[01-Feb-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If my daemon cannot tell that it's invalid, then how can anyone else's

[01-Feb-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they cant... until they connect block...

[01-Feb-19 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
o conenct block they will all agree

[01-Feb-19 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
provided

[01-Feb-19 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the block hash

[01-Feb-19 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
matches the correct block has for the correct height

[01-Feb-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if notaries never create a notarisaation with the wrong block hash then this can never happen... with enough noptaries this goes away

[01-Feb-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm lost as to how the daemon can send out a block that passes consensus checks but doesn't pass consensus, so I guess that one is up to you and maybe @jl777c ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do it...

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im telling you... I wrote this code.. and thats how it works

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It can only know what it knows... cant pull info from thin air

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Im telling you... I wrote this code.. and thats how it works`
then unwrite it and do it right

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant be done

[01-Feb-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you determine a block as valid due to a tx in tehat block...

[01-Feb-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that tx must be not be resent to mempool when block is invlaid

[01-Feb-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can add notarisation validation to the miner... but someone can use a diffren miner wioth out it

[01-Feb-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You have data at places.... you can only use what you have....

[01-Feb-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blockchains are no gods

[01-Feb-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still stuck on the bit where my node is retarded and everyone else's node knows more than mine
to me that's anti-consensus

[01-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just stelling you how this works.... I did it with the best of my ability and tbh... I doubt anyone else could ahve done it in that much time a better way....

[01-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
A notarisation is valid at the last step of connect block... all nodes at that time have the data to know its valid...

[01-Feb-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if we let a "half valid" nootarisation be a valid one... for payment purpouse... notarties can make as mach of them they like

[01-Feb-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, maybe it's me that's retarded and not my node
Why am I sending out a block to the network without doing the same checks on the block that everyone else is going to do on it (and please explain this to me like I'm 6 because I'm just not getting it)?

[01-Feb-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 that's not sarcasm, btw; I'm really not getting what you're saying and I need you to explain it on a lower level

[01-Feb-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK someone can corect me if this wrong... but:

[01-Feb-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1) to determine a notarisation the miner chooses the tx... based on the inputs being valid notaries
2) it make this tx number 1 of that block
3) it mines this block creating a coinbase that pays each notary
4) This will pass every check... on their node...
5) when it gets to connect block the OP_RETURN is decoded
6) This determines if each node sees it as a valid notarisation, if its not based on that data it contains
7) THE BLOCK IS INVALID, because the notarisation is invalid

[01-Feb-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This tx

[01-Feb-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is then sent backj to the mempool

[01-Feb-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whoich is included by the same rules

[01-Feb-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as tx 1 of the next block

[01-Feb-19 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
By adding checks to miner if OP_RETURN is valid... you do nothing

[01-Feb-19 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because someone can use a diffrent miner wit hout that check

[01-Feb-19 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once again.... it takes notary collusion ... or a bitg in the notarizer to happen.. bnut it could happen

[01-Feb-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because someone can use a diffrent miner wit hout that check`
but that would require them to use a modified daemon and why do we care that someone that isn't following consensus gets rejected blocks?

[01-Feb-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it wouldnt be a vialoation of consensus ifminsigs of notaries created the tx

[01-Feb-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to accept the block a node can only know if min sigs was followed.... AND that ie was to the RXL address.. it cant check vins on processblock

[01-Feb-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it wouldnt be a vialoation of consensus ifminsigs of notaries created the tx`
ahhh, now we're on the same page
all this time, I thought you were looking to "protect" (for lack of better words) pools from having their blocks invalidated

[01-Feb-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Excelleent thank you

[01-Feb-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🙏

[01-Feb-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
someon gets it

[01-Feb-19 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now... back to my first thing... If a notarisation could have a diffrent version of tx.... it coul be invalidated and not added back to mempool

[01-Feb-19 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
use a flag taht already exists

[01-Feb-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
version is int32

[01-Feb-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a HUGE number

[01-Feb-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Last MoM height = tx version

[01-Feb-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it rotates up

[01-Feb-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or someething like that... there has to be a way to invalidate the tx

[01-Feb-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or this cant work

[01-Feb-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only other solution is to some how have a CC address with funds that notaries can spend if they make a notarisation

[01-Feb-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this solves lots of issues...

[01-Feb-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont know how to make it

[01-Feb-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This all said... with enough notaries.... the entire problem just goes away... as you need too much consensus to determine a valid notarisation

[01-Feb-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT you cant assume that one is NEVER crated

[01-Feb-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
soalr flare etc

[01-Feb-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Welcome to being a pioneer, you stand on the edge of the abyss staring into a land where only 1 or 2 people (if any) have any notion as to where to step next 😛

[01-Feb-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i';m the only persopn left working on MoMoM 😂

[01-Feb-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which makes a grand total of 2 people in this channel that ever have 😛

[01-Feb-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott

[01-Feb-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤣

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*3 if he ever comes back 😛

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he did a great job btw

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there were few bugs

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they in retrospect were easy to find

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is politics 😦

[01-Feb-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
surely not :troll:

[01-Feb-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since more NNs would make it less of an issue (or go away), could we reliably get more NNs? That seems to be the question with a new project

[01-Feb-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have broken LABST .. i had most of the staking weight and when I came home my computer had only a mouse that coudltn clck anything and i had to restart it after 6 days  uptime... not being able to get it back staking without bthe command lol 😆

[01-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If we have 64 NN ...

[01-Feb-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LABST is working fine here (although only my NN is updated)

[01-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then there is like no problemn... but still abug couuld exist

[01-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just stoipped minneing it...

[01-Feb-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will recover

[01-Feb-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think like hell... we should just do it
