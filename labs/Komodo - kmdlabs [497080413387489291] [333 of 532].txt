[13-Mar-19 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I wrote threaded migrations script with ordered queues for each step few months ago - but it worked quite slow

[13-Mar-19 03:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I think this is a version of that.

[13-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
you know...

[13-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
we don't need to do v1 v2 v3 v4 v5....

[13-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
isn't this the entire point of git? üòÖ

[13-Mar-19 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
No, it's not I think - mine multithreaded code gone to abyss because I not published on github :)
I changed script version long time ago to v2 because they worked different and was possible to use for different cases

[13-Mar-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
v1 was just port from jok3r shell script which worked exactly same and made 1 import per run

[13-Mar-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
v2 was version which blastered transactions

[13-Mar-19 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So these different scripts had different use-cases thats why I separated to different files

[13-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
Ah understood

[13-Mar-19 07:09 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
V4 is threaded and handles re-start of failed transactions

[13-Mar-19 07:10 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
also contains the sledgehammer momom fix

[14-Mar-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
v4 is likly the only one that works

[14-Mar-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that sendraw getting a number

[14-Mar-19 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is a bug

[14-Mar-19 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seems to pass, Ive tried to fix it a few times... that part of the script is very compilcated

[14-Mar-19 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1170 migrates complete here

[14-Mar-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its already fixed in the latest script?

[14-Mar-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
found one errror with resume fixing now and then will push it and start another migrate blast

[14-Mar-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just about completed 2000 migrate blast.

[14-Mar-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The next set of chains will need to be PoS cluster, but as we need to wait for cross chain non-fungible tokens support it makes little sense to start anything until that is ready.

I will get iguana working  to change eras without a restart tomorrow so Mylo can also join and we can change era.

started 5000 loop with 1s delay üòÑ just for lolz

[14-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder what kind of thoughput it can handle at once haha ... My guess is at some point the daemon wont be able to accept any RPC calls

I'm re-setup and waiting on MoM notarizations on first loop of 3 migration.  Try a 5000 if that goes through.

[14-Mar-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I kicked out a 762 migrate earlier, not sure it fifnished tho... just seemed to exit

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  just resume it

[14-Mar-19 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has a print when its fin ished... I seems with vast numbers some threads crash, when the daemon is overloaded

[14-Mar-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pass it the exports file as arg1 on command line.

Nice :treasure:

[14-Mar-19 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, it needs some work before it could be used as a service, but its 90% there really. 5000 with a 1s gap is too many, likely a 2s gap 5000 would be ok.

[14-Mar-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Either that or I need to modify  slick RPC so that it doesnt crash when it fails to amke a connection.

[14-Mar-19 12:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I has 1 sec gap. btw, might mention the time value input is in seconds in the script console readout.

[14-Mar-19 12:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and fwiw, I added auto log dir creation

[14-Mar-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah the interface isnt great... but that wasnt really my concern at the time.

[14-Mar-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have git access now ?

[14-Mar-19 12:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
look out üòâ

[14-Mar-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hah no worries. That script has code from so many ppl in it lol ..

[14-Mar-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I still remember linking TonyL to the RPCs he setup after I got them from Alright lol

[14-Mar-19 12:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Been meaning to expand that to completion. added quite a few extras while working on oracles etc.

tryna get my head around gateways atm, got one through to finish yesterday, but going over again to let it sink in. It's üÜí AF.

[14-Mar-19 12:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe get it to the stage I can make a gateways.earth üòÑ

labs (2) 

[14-Mar-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I want to try some of that out, but I really need to get onto making a CC ASAP, trying to wrok out exactly what we have left that needs doing so I can launch LABS then start one.

[14-Mar-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have an idea for bounty payment that seems like it should be quite easy to implement.

[14-Mar-19 12:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had a chat with sui about a geofaucet which would be cool to test. basically need to validate by location rather than captcha or whatever.

[14-Mar-19 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Decent way to onboard biz etc by putting faucet QR on site to get users connected

Yeah, I'll make a faucet that you can cahnge the size etc as my first CC ... faucet2... then expand on that for bounty payment mechanisim.

[14-Mar-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I just had mine stop  too the 5000 üò¶ seems it has some problems. Maybe the threading module cant make that many threads... Still I dont think running more than about 500 at oce would ever really happen.

[14-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Python threading isn't actually threading - it's just scheduling a single thread. You need the multi proc module to actually thread.

[14-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ah thanks. That explains it then. Doint really need that for this. Its using almsot no CPU or ram, even doing thosuands at once.

[14-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only issue seems to be forcing too many though at once... So I just slowed it down a bit.

[14-Mar-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still havent had any migrates not be able to be resumed and competed... So it seems to be working finally.

[14-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pushed some updates to the script to slow down export processing to prevent slickRPC crashing.

[14-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Adding queue works well - you can limit each stage to keep it moving.

[14-Mar-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I think that wouldnt be that hard... not sure tis worth it though

[14-Mar-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe someone else can add that later on. I think I should finish off the stuff with iguana next so we can cahnge era without restarting it.

[14-Mar-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we can launch I think.

[14-Mar-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I made a very silly CC in customcc.cpp/.h makecustom

[14-Mar-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it shows how to make a CC with minimal work, but the example CC is braindead, useless and wrong

[14-Mar-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks üòÉ I think that is helpful for me.

[14-Mar-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
see if you can figure out what is wrong with the customcc.cpp example

[14-Mar-19 10:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
ah good... python i like... C/C++ i haven't touched in a decade, might need to take a tutorial on it :troll:

[14-Mar-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
@mrlynch trying to give you some inspiration
maybe try to think of what useful data you could push to an oracle so it could be displayed here http://oracle.earth/

[14-Mar-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
that site is LABS specific right now, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on other chains with oracles CC activated

[14-Mar-19 10:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
i need to finish reading up on CC's and oracles first üòÑ

[14-Mar-19 10:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
but thank you for the homework. i find it easier to learn/do things when i have a somewhat defined objective

[15-Mar-19 03:50 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think there needs to be a cc-dumbass channel... where people that were smart 30 years ago are now proven ignrorant....over and over again....all recorded on the blockchain.....forever

[15-Mar-19 03:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
We can call it cc-dumb

[15-Mar-19 03:53 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll be first to be recorded

[15-Mar-19 03:56 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy I have someone working on a bot that will post anything pinned here to an immutable oracle, does that work?

[15-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise, every message on a dpow'd trollbox chain is immutable

[15-Mar-19 03:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Probably.....if I didnt think an oracle had something to do with a movie

[15-Mar-19 03:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[15-Mar-19 04:04 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
There needs to be a dictionary for ALL of this to be  understood....I only keep up 60 days a year... I need more info... WTF is an oracle??..something to do with Zion?
