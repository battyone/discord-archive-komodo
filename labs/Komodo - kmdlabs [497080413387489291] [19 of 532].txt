...

[12-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
how'd you get that?

[12-Oct-18 09:04 AM] CrisF#3405
Went through as normal till that point.

[12-Oct-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah wtf ... let me update mine and see that happens

[12-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
joker I haven't test your update yet

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright  `git pull` `start` `oraclefetch`

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Seemed all good.  Then...

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
want to do `git pull` `oraclefetch` then `start`

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did git pull give an error?

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it did for me

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
but I have a feeling it has something to do with what just changed

[12-Oct-18 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
No, allready up to date.

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because oraclefetch had overwrittten the json

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
yea we need to change how git tracks assetchains.json

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
had to git reset --hard to get it to pull

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
that's why I wanted to delete it from the repo

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] CrisF#3405
tried oracle fetch first but error.

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
just need to ignore it

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cant delete it until there is somewhere else to ge it from

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it breaks everything that isnt a notary node

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
what if I just make a bootstrap script that gets it

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
ran before anything else

[12-Oct-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from where?

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
a chain

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems unnesary

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
sync a chain, grab latest assetchains.json, stop chain

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to sync a whole chain .. what if you dont want that chain

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
then it's ready

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will make it fetch from a url I cna do that

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will still be the on chain json

[12-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
why have centralized server when we can grab it from on chain

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because I dont want it so you have to sync every staked chain to test just 1

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
you don't have to man

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats unfreindsly to useers

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
what?

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
who is using the assetchains.json in StakedNotary other than notaries?

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright This is what I got trying `oraclefetch before `start`
```./oraclefetch.sh       â”‚kmdacfirewall~

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that we have made so far pulls it form github

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
and why can't they run a bootstrap script to get it?

[12-Oct-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
byw

[12-Oct-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am making a url to fetch assetchains.json from

[12-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
....why

[12-Oct-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
heaps of shit we have made needs it

[12-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
we can grab it from on chain

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not chaging everything we already made for no reason

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't change *anything*

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its been wayyyy too much work

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
just run the bootstrap script before you do anything

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
NO@

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
I will make it

[12-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
Why not?

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make it

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
there's two options here, grab from centralized server or grab from on chain

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will make my url

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
user chan choose

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
one seems objectively better

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no.. one is slow and one is fast

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if one fails use the other

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Alright#0419

[12-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
if we can't bootstrap from on chain, we're still trusting a single person to give us a good assetchains.json to begin with

[12-Oct-18 09:13 AM] CrisF#3405
restart worked.  Up and running. made a notarization.

[12-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to make all notaries push the onchain json

[12-Oct-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so your just trusting the notaris which you alreday do

[12-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once you have fetched it the first time, if your running the chain that its on ...

[12-Oct-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can just fetch from chain... if you dont need that chain use the url

[12-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
ðŸ’¡

[12-Oct-18 09:14 AM] Alright#0419
how about centralized server that grabs latest? ðŸ˜„

[12-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
so fast way is to trust that server is showing the latest from a publisher

[12-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
slow way is to sync the chain and grab it yourself

[12-Oct-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
keeps them in-sync too

[12-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats exactly what I was going to do ðŸ˜•

[12-Oct-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[12-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so server will always show exactly what cli would show then?

[12-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
simplifies it a lot

[12-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[12-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
ok that sounds good

[12-Oct-18 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
infact it could fetch it in real time ... but that seems unssary ...

[12-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to update my seedndoe to be able to use multiple branches ..which is easy... I'll get onto that next, and make it serve the assetchains.sjon from there just for now

[12-Oct-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its been super reliable all year... but can have some downtime .. to get it working though that will beasy

[12-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
should I make a separate repo for this chat stuff

[12-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
or use kvtroll?

[12-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Alright#0419
the scripts can be ran from anywhere

[12-Oct-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was using staked repo which has TROLL sub directoy

[12-Oct-18 09:19 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter where we put them

[12-Oct-18 09:19 AM] Alright#0419
ah, ok I'll do that
