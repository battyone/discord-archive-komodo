just changing the DB isnt that bad ... As most of it is C++ objects based out of 2-3 files. ... LONG ones though

[05-Dec-18 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo no one has done it because no one thinks the benefits outweigh the time/code factor, not really an issue of "close to impossible"
I mean it's not like bdb has some "magical powers" that store data

[05-Dec-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the largest issue seems to be "backwards compatibility"

[05-Dec-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
bug for bug compatible

[05-Dec-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the actual DB could be changed pretty easily I think .. but Im only saying that because I've read most of the wallet code in the last few months, and its all a wrapper ... you technically could use a diffrent DB ... but the data expects to be stored in some way, and thats likely the main proble, rathet then just what DB is used.

[05-Dec-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but for a new chain, it wont have much constraints

[05-Dec-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Id prefer not to touch it ... it works ... and there are ways to make it go fast if you need to for a specific purpuse

[05-Dec-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Id prefer not to touch it ... it works ...` <- 99% of the reason Core hasn't ever updated (the other 1% being that the 1 guy still running a 1990s PC shouldn't have to upgrade his hw)

[05-Dec-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha in BTC's case ... making the wallet "go fast" is a terrible idea as their netowrk cant handle the TPS from just a couple of wallets as it is 😂

[05-Dec-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[05-Dec-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is the true reason why they dont fix this

@jl777c  
I had an idea today about how we pay 10% of coinbase to a multisig address. Currently that means that address is going to fill with utxos of 1 coin in size when it comes the the notary payout ... we will need to merge these utxos before making payment... being a multi sig tx (and likley a manual process at first) this will be a bit annoying>
I was wondering if you could have a rule instead where it only paid such amounts each 100th block so 100 coins when `nHeight % 100` is true (I htink thats how you do it)

[05-Dec-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to me like it would work as long as the code was in the miner and the validation

[05-Dec-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Havent had a chance to try it yet though

[05-Dec-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810

```While database corruptions are reported relatively frequently these days, my belief is that it's mostly hardware failures or driver issues. Bitcoin Core tends to stress disks, memory and CPUs far more than most software, which makes otherwise invisible issues pop up.

the "official reason"

[05-Dec-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like its all back to normal ... and the code to make the founders reward a periodic payment seems far too simple to even be right 🤣  Think I will test it before I sleep just to make sure, because this cant be this easy.

[05-Dec-18 03:11 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
finally got the pool back up 😃

[05-Dec-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Bar_F1sh_Rel you can try migrates again now. I am pretty sure they should be working

[05-Dec-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once again sorry about all that ... upside we are ready for sapling activation in KMD now.

[05-Dec-18 03:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Thanks for sorting for us lol

[05-Dec-18 03:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all good. now its working I'l push an update, but I'm not sure it'll run off  a clone without some afterwork

[05-Dec-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats ok ... as yor mostly running it atm... I think its fine. as long as we have 1 public pool up for launch we cna get more later.

[05-Dec-18 03:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so hows the fees thing work? paid to a multisig notary address?

[05-Dec-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha

[05-Dec-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently on LAMEDUCKS the block rewark has ~10% paid to a multisig address

[05-Dec-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just changed it so that ever X blocks it pays the reward by X and no reward the rest of the time.

[05-Dec-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because other wise every 2 months we nede to consolidate 89000 utxos of 1 coins

[05-Dec-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before we cna pay the notaries... and we need y% of notaries to sign the tx ... its really not practical...

[05-Dec-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it a definable period.

[05-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
say every 2 weeks notaries get paid, we cna may it pay every 12H

[05-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of every minute ... so every 1 weeks ony 1 tx needs to be made

[05-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works that is

[05-Dec-18 03:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah far more efficient

[05-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this once and for all make all stratum pools totally incompatible with LABS 😛

[05-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
excpet the one I made wich doesnt follow the protocol

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
hehe, so I have a zero fee monopoly 😂

[05-Dec-18 03:21 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and nothing to lose if anyone competes

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can take fees

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it takes it out in the payment processor

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so is the goal here to make it so it cant be mined unless notaries get share?

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of ...

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
does same apply to daemon?

[05-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The notaries need to get paid some how ...

[05-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a consensus rule

[05-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
of the chain... every block must have 10% of the block reward paid to the multisig address

[05-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with this change, it just pays what ever the block reward is at every X blocks Y times  at once.

[05-Dec-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should still work with halvings and such as well

[05-Dec-18 03:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what sort of load is anticipated on pool on launch? VPS at the moment is 2 core 4gb, just enough to run all current chains.

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say thats fine tbh

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
does it stress once z9s hit?

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using a very small one for ZEX... I doube we will ahev many chains at launch.. maybe 1 to 3

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nope

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no diffrence

[05-Dec-18 03:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[05-Dec-18 03:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lemme know which of the new logos @CrisF brought it to use on site. Just checked and the old one fell off, but no point fixing that

[05-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah Cris has all that stuff ready to go I think..

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 does your stratum work with ac_period yet? :trollface:

[05-Dec-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
8 lines of C code ... I still dont get how easy that was to do ... anmd will save many many hours of stuffing around trying to merge utxos

True story:
It's completely impossible to add new features and case/if statements into a stratum implimentation

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It hsa  avarying block reward

[05-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a very simple implementation

[05-Dec-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but at some point that tx will pay the notaries automatically

[05-Dec-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
removing th multi sig completly

[05-Dec-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and a properly coded stratum gets reward from the template, so I don't know what you think is the "killer" part....

[05-Dec-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... I guess if you are actually using the coinbase txs the daemon gives you ... it might work... but no stratum I have seen does that

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hence why I keep saying "We need to stop using other shit written for other shit and have Komodo stuff for Komodo"

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
eitehr way ... adding a diffrent exeption to the startium for every combination when you dont need to is just pointless work

🚀 

[05-Dec-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need "a diffrent exeption to the startium for every combination"
if x then y

[05-Dec-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the stratum only need concern itself with 1 tx at a time
as long as it follows the format of that tx, then the "chain rules/options" are moot (with few exceptions)

[05-Dec-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think that 99% of the issue is that you're overthinking the process and thinking that a stratum needs to be more like a wallet daemon than it is
If my reward is x and I want to put 1% into addy1 and the remainder in addy2, the only difference between that and only addy1 is 1 vout vs 2 vouts (or 2 vs 3 or 3 vs 4, etc)
nothing more, nothing less

[05-Dec-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r methinks you broke something or I'm confused
on an assetchain (CFEKLAMEDUCKS specifically) a notarization is valid just through a tx? even if a nn didn't block it?

[05-Dec-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what?

[05-Dec-18 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
notarizations don't require a NN to mine the block it's in

[05-Dec-18 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
so yes, is valid just through a tx

[05-Dec-18 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is lost, doesn't understand why his miner is notarizing but his NN isn't, says "OK", and goes back to what he knows/understands_
