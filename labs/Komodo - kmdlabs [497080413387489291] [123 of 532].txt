its not been right

[24-Nov-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I told @kmdkrazy  that ... he notarised 5mins later

[24-Nov-18 03:32 PM] zatJUM#9924
Now that I'm in, you'll have to explain to me the mask stuff again @Deleted User

[24-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
cat in it before

[24-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll do it yeah, but first I need to NTRZ

about the recvmask

[24-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
it is basically tthe connectivity from the node sending the recv PoV

[24-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
every NN is represented by a flag

[24-Nov-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
recv = connected + utxo

[24-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
if the masks is near 000000 : not much connectivity

[24-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
if it goes to FFFFF for example : everything is fine : good connectivity

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
your goal is to have the best mask

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
to be able to trigger a nota and have it as bestmask

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesntr work like that with only 20 nodes 游땭 thats why the sript doesnt wokr

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
about flags

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
no complain from my side. seems my tiny VPS is notarizing fine

[24-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
but about NN selection for nota round, it should act the same

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stop cheating @SHossain

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
:trollface:

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well ... tbh

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a huge flaw with iguana

[24-Nov-18 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so having the most notarisations .. really can t be a perfect metric

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
bestmask is the same for a few people, it's because they are the ones that have established a consensus?

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bestmask ...

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is the maks the nodes in recv agreed on

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007
i just followed your instruction in gh and ran the same commands required

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to make the notarisation

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but in out script that tells u it ... it wrong I think

[24-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
does anyone have an higher  ips.17 CFEKLAMEDUCKS NOTARIZE.5 ?

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
ips.17 may mean I m safe still

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that sounds about right

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not all nodes r up

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
and its just about waiting to be included

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can t stay more, or she ll kill me

[24-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I ll rely on my faith that I ran everything ok

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
and that it s just about waiting

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
So the only way to have a good recv is to not lack of utxos and a good connectivity?

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
good FW

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
And bestk, what is it?

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
and good timing response

[24-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
UTXO selection optims can help you on this too

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
best.k

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is the thing what determines best mask

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its calcualted from recvmask

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
the best node with best recvmask that s sending

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
not ?

[24-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
starting point for the nota

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
foe the one with best recv ?

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you want to be in every other nodes recv as fast as possible

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then you are included in best/k

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
theat all node use

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I htink to make it "more fair" there needs to be some delay in recv -> .k

[24-Nov-18 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I have no idea how that cna be done

[24-Nov-18 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

my last shot

[24-Nov-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are you using the VPS I gave you with debian9 or did you deploy your own? Genien

[24-Nov-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
atm, still yours

[24-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool

[24-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cna use it until main chain... then I am gonna ned a VPS ... sadly my node in Perth isnt gonna be able to compete in current rules

[24-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181

I really liked the thing about having a node under a carpark in a bunker in the most isolated city in the entire world ... but its just to far form other nodes 游땭

Once Monday rolls around I'll get a couple of these; like I said, my main issue was that I thought that we needed NNs for streamer and the bandwidth cost was my real issue with having n+1 servers

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  theer is a spot!

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
@blackjok3r is a static IP needed to notarize?

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
go gpo gp

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
would a blast on DUCKS help me pushing the chain faster ?

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it helps

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a lot
