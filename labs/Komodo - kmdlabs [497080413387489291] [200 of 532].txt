its just ignoring any changes to the code that I made totally... like the are not there... Im reverting it all back how it was.

[07-Jan-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wasted an entire day on this.... I ahve it at least showing something now where as before the explorer basically said coins appeard from thin air.

[07-Jan-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep reverted everything and its the same... simply ignored my commits. üòï

There is a link the burn txid here.... just need to move where it is and work out how to make it point at a diffrent URL and this should do it.

[07-Jan-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think passing it CFEKY as the address isnt so bad.... but the links are all wrong....

[07-Jan-19 11:05 AM] Mylo#8306
that's fixable

[07-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I'll push this fix... it gets you all the data you need into the front end

[07-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without having to moidify the bitcore stuff

[07-Jan-19 11:06 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm displaying tx id of import in that screenshot

[07-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... that txid is there for me too... iuts just you have to expand the view to see it

[07-Jan-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is no address  for the import

[07-Jan-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we can just put source chain name in address feild

[07-Jan-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and change display accordingly

[07-Jan-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dunno how you tel its an import though ü§∑

in simple view on line 237 of tx.html
<span data-ng-show="vin.notAddr">{{vin.items[0].txid}}</span>
will get you txid of that import

[07-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Mylo#8306
so just put a comment that `{{vin.items[0].txid}}` will get you the tx of the other chain.   we can work on the logic for linking to that explorer in, some other way.   that requires a bit of smart-thinking

[07-Jan-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah Im faar too annoyed at it to do any more atm lol....

[07-Jan-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no possible way to identify its an import without someone telling me how to make comits to the code do something

[07-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Mylo#8306
have you put it in your explorer to dbl check it fetches the txid ?

[07-Jan-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything is there... itys just in teh wrong places... i git it in the by tricking it... So if you cahnged the links etc... it will break all normal txns

[07-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there needs to be a way for it to tell if its an import... liek it does with the coinbase

[07-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but code wouldnt do anything.... ready to take hammer to it

[07-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Mylo#8306
if it's not a normal tx, then the {{vin.addr}} is not set.   if it's not set, it's going to be an import.

[07-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed that so it is

[07-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
othewirse you cant get the source chains name in there... I had to put it inside the address feild

[07-Jan-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont get why changes to the code don't do anything... they do with znomp

maybe its not even usign my repo üòÇ

[07-Jan-19 11:29 AM] Mylo#8306
yes i agree it's confusing, and i don't konw in the api codebase does the "optimization"
however
The UI -> The API
The API doesn't give you raw data.
It transforms it so the UI only calls the API once, for stuff that at the CLI level is in different places and requires sometimes 1 or 2 calls.
It's cheaper for the UI to call it once, and the backed to get the data in one go and cache it.   In caching it it creates tranformed "virtual" stuff.
Yes a bit annoying.
e.g. CFEKX-explorer/node_modules/insight-api-komodo/lib/transaction.js does a bunch of stuff.
Once worked out, we can create our own extension to the api with the object we want with the stuff in there.

[07-Jan-19 11:30 AM] Mylo#8306
if we really need the stuff....which down the track would be handy

[07-Jan-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might delete that repo re-fork it and try again changing that line in package.json

[07-Jan-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I can jsut get it to print something to console

[07-Jan-19 11:31 AM] Mylo#8306

[07-Jan-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is... its pulling my repo... then installing deckers, when it reads `package.json`

[07-Jan-19 11:32 AM] Mylo#8306
anyway i think pbca will be able to sort it out

@blackjok3r its not merged yet - can you plz validate if it works for you https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/commit/2b5fdc0f11af8367d411bced1a682319106df02c - i noticed that just upgrading might not be that easy. i.e. zcash is still using 1.0.15 too and we re using a modified version for the darwin build. I ll test a 1.0.17 based build shortly and will let you know how it goes.

commit is literally just an URL "fix" - zcash has the same "issue" but no one noticed since they re using fallback URLs for libraries that cant be fetched from the primary source. We removed that some time ago for sake of security, etc.
