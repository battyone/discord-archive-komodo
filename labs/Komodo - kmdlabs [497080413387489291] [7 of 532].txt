once you learn how to make hashtables, you will indeed become dangerous

'we restrict this section, but the main parts are open to everyone' is something that I think would be perceived well

[08-Oct-18 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_played with pseudo hashtables in mIRC back in his IRC days; they can be quite useful_

Can someone send me the link of how to create a coin

[08-Oct-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm not sure they've gotten to the point of making a how-to for creating coins under STAKED yet

[08-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no the whole network is still in testnet

[08-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however you can create a normal KMD assetchain by following @Alright's document here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/example-asset-chains.html

[08-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The main thing you need to work out, is what your coin is for?

[08-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once you know that, then the rest is easy. Just creating a pointless token with a massive supply seems pointless as there are plenty of those chains already. But if you want to create a chain to test things or create a dApp

[08-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then go ahead.

[08-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  is anyone about to test the STAKEDTROLL chat blockchain ?

[08-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Nothing great in this world was ever created by anyone that never talked to themselves

[08-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I can check it out in ~2 hrs if you give me git link, params, and tell me what you're looking to have tested

[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was just going to have a chat on it with someone... Alright should be around by then but its getting very late here.

[08-Oct-18 03:22 PM] CMaurice#1685
I'm about now

[08-Oct-18 03:22 PM] Mylo#8306
what do i need to do @blackjok3r ?

build komodo from that branch

[08-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Mylo#8306
ok.

[08-Oct-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodod -ac_name=STAKEDTROLL -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=103.6.12.112 -pubkey=<a pubkey> `

[08-Oct-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then do yourself a faucetget to get 100 coins... the entire chain supply is in the faucet. you need a pubkey set to use CC, but I guess you already know that.

[08-Oct-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ping me when you are ready to use it, I started on working on another bug, as it affects main net aswell

[08-Oct-18 03:25 PM] CMaurice#1685
how do you manage multiple komodod's on a  machine?

[08-Oct-18 03:25 PM] Mylo#8306
Pinned a message.

[08-Oct-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for StakedNotary it builds each branch then copies the `komodod` and `komodo-cli` to a new folder

[08-Oct-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will port that logic to another repo in PoS_Scripts that will load all chains, but I need to make it so that you can choose what chains you want from the cluster.

[08-Oct-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as for this specific chain,

[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need stdout to use it

[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Mylo#8306
ah should i use `~/StakedNotary/install/buildkomodo.sh` script or just use my own workflow?

[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Mylo#8306
after changing branch

[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] CMaurice#1685
kk, thanks, will sit out the test and read on

[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
buildkomodo.sh will only build you master branch, and is specifically for StakedNotary

[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I definatly need to make some scripts for controlling this chain, even using it atm is a bit tedious.

[08-Oct-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would just clone the repo to a seperate folder and work from inside there

[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
No need to limit who can mine chains

[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
especially not if it's not in the cluster

[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
they're disposable

[08-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
go ahead and fuck it up, we'll make a new one

[08-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Bappo#0069
what is the website of how to create a coin?

as an example, each of those make "targets" is just a cmd.

[08-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Mylo#8306
it's glorified bash script

Ok thank you

[08-Oct-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright I think somehting like that will be useful, but for now I havent made it.

[08-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
there are services that will do it for you if you don't want to figure it out

[08-Oct-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What is working is very good for now

[08-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
PTYX and siu both run chain creation services if you would rather pay someone to do it for you

[08-Oct-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ondemand blocks, and a consensus rule that blocks only with coinbase are invalid.

[08-Oct-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think notaries can be updated, just did 2 of mine with no issue.

[08-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
For what purpose?

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also the lockunspent crashing iguana when KMd is not running, is a lockunspent bug, and also affects mainnet notaries.

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to get onto fixing it asap

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Bappo#0069
Ok I don't know what any of this mean

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
Well I'm getting off into about 2 hours, just got on to check in on some things

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Bappo#0069
s

[08-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
after that, ~5 days MIA

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
need anything before then?

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure about the purpouse exatly but it seems useful to protect a chain for dev testing on staked .

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Bappo#0069
If I don't know anythigna bout making a coin can I still do it?

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
you can just add txs to blocks

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Bappo#0069
I dont know what that is

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
YES @Bappo

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but thius chain is ac_perc

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
it's 2 commands

[08-Oct-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so startum doesnt work, so you need to moidfy the daemons miner

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its better than nothjing and with 0 BR

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i dont see why anyone would bother

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Bappo#0069
Ill ask the questions I need when I get there

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
just need to put a tx in your mempool when you want to mine a block

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
make it RejectFromMemoryPool for other nodes

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
put it on a cron and leave setgenerate true

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes....

[08-Oct-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my point was to stop GPUs super fast mingng blocks

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because if static diff

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
of 1

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Alright#0419
well ac_perc will accomplish that for now

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I forced tat

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and made the BR and ac_perc always 0

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
evey block has 2 vout in coinbase of 0

[08-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Mylo#8306

console will print any errors when you try to broadcast it

[08-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Mylo#8306
i have 100 coins though.   no problem.  i saw -26 sig verify failed and panicked

[08-Oct-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes you need stdout for this chain

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can only do it 3 times

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and ht address must be new... as this is a new chain any address you use will be empty

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it should work
