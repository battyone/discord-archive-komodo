I do it as Komodo team member, as KMDLabs member I only maintain NN + contribute to python stuff sometimes so I think it will be not totally correct/fair if community initiatives counting on this page

[11-Mar-19 07:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

[11-Mar-19 07:31 AM] CrisF#3405
The ones there now should have been tested or worked on to some degree here.

[11-Mar-19 07:31 AM] CrisF#3405

Oh, except for maybe multisig.

[11-Mar-19 07:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll remove that for now.

[11-Mar-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did musig

[11-Mar-19 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it was for james....

[11-Mar-19 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont mind that being put down though

[11-Mar-19 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll put that back.

[11-Mar-19 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
I have MoMoM and momom (twice).

[11-Mar-19 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
One as a cc and one as a technology.

[11-Mar-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol this fucking MoMoM thing ü§£  put it down 100 times

[11-Mar-19 07:37 AM] CrisF#3405
When I asked before was told it wasn't a cc, but now apparently it has become one (?).

[11-Mar-19 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not exactly a CC ... but it does have an EVAL code

[11-Mar-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its was the very first thing to use CC code in any way in komodod

[11-Mar-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Leave it as is?

[11-Mar-19 07:38 AM] CrisF#3405
(not exactly 100, but...)

[11-Mar-19 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once is really fine, I dont think I need to go into detail exactly how we fixed it too much, as its been well described in komodo articles and that...

[11-Mar-19 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem was that its wasnt working how it was described to work

[11-Mar-19 07:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Yea, there is no description, just a list of things worked on so far with links to info on it.

[11-Mar-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah ok cool.. I can givee some broad over view of what was needed to be fixed.

[11-Mar-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the script is a little buggy.... IO need to work out how to return diffrent error codes or soemthing to the python script from the daemon to make it work properly. Hopefully its not that hard

[11-Mar-19 07:43 AM] CrisF#3405
It won't need that kind of info on this page.

[11-Mar-19 07:43 AM] CrisF#3405

[11-Mar-19 07:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Might be good to get it sown at some point as a record though.

[11-Mar-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well the rate at which things are changing making docs isnt yet a great plan. still need to update the notarypay with the altest bug fixes.

[11-Mar-19 07:44 AM] CrisF#3405
If you every find the time to blast it out I can findd a place tor it.

[11-Mar-19 07:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, thinking more of a record of what has been done.

[11-Mar-19 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Nothing urgent and maybe no necessary.

[11-Mar-19 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
You've been doing so much might be nice to have a record somewhere though.

[11-Mar-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, I tried to write one of them for my notary proposal the other day, my team member told me right at the start if I was going to start helping out to keep a recod of it, and I didnt... so 90% of the stuff Io have done I have fogotten üòÜ

[11-Mar-19 07:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, yeah.  There is Trello for some of the labs stuff.

[11-Mar-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trello was good at the start, we should try to keep using that, or git issues to track whats being done better in the future.

Script is comming along nicely, but it will need heavy testing by you guys to fully test evey path. Trying my best to force it to take as many code paths as I can, but there will no doubt be some edgecases. It took weeks to catch all the possible errors in the bash script.

[11-Mar-19 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I actually hope we can get a failed export with the sledgehammer import code, so we can test the notary backup system.

@Alright 
Hi,
I'm trying to run komodod for CEFKDIMXY3,4 and could not see any peer (empty peer list).
tried also telnet 195.201.20.230 or 195.201.137.5 to ports  18293 and 52208 - no connection
(maybe the ports are different or fw issues?)

[11-Mar-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try 103.6.12.112 as peer ?

[11-Mar-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my ports are open

[11-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
I'll check the nodes in a moment

[11-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
Those ports seem wrong,  not in front my computer atm though

[11-Mar-19 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405
DIMXY3```  "p2pport": 41221```
DIMXY4```  "p2pport": 41746```
is what I show, @dimxy

[11-Mar-19 09:27 AM] Alright#0419
Could you double check the params make what is in assetchains.json in the StakedNotary repo

[11-Mar-19 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
I may have given you messed up params or its possible you're copying them wrong

there are lots of prints still at this stage. You also need the latest commit from KMDLABS/komodo for it to work properly

[11-Mar-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
being pretty noob at python, I think it can likely work better... but this has the correct logic to sledgehammer a migrate to complete in what should be close to 100% reliability.

[11-Mar-19 10:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool üëç Anything need to be set up for it (logs etc)?

[11-Mar-19 10:26 AM] Mylo#8306
can someone describe the process for the noob operator so i don't have to ask again.  i'm on a call, so easy to follow

[11-Mar-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo 
```git clone https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary
cd StakedNotary
<edit config.ini>
./start.sh

[11-Mar-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
readme in the repo should still be current

[11-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo you aren't currently a notary, do you want to be?

[11-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Mylo#8306
still syncing kmd i think

[11-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
we need to do an era change to add you back

[11-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo please don't try to notarize yet, we have some coordination needed prior to you being able to

[11-Mar-19 12:26 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r ```Tried to broadcast 90 times

[11-Mar-19 12:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Do you need the logs?

[11-Mar-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@dimxy  We have a fail apparently...

[11-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  not exactly. We need to use this failed import... You can DM me the JSON saved to file so I can try to resume it here?

[11-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it fails for me, then we can use this to test the backup

[11-Mar-19 12:59 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, DMed.

[11-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r is there no better way than simply trying 90 times to broadcast it?

[11-Mar-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[11-Mar-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt actuallly think this was possible.. trying to resume the import now from here,

[11-Mar-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It instantly imported here ü§∑

[11-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
that is Cris's failed import?

[11-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
it just worked when you tried it?

[11-Mar-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... I had to add errors from the daemo

[11-Mar-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe his didnt ahve the right update?

[11-Mar-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its on KMD that most of the changes are (if not all) so start.sh doesnt work for that on `staked` repo

[11-Mar-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the fix is actually quite simple as usual, but getting it to work wasnt easy

[11-Mar-19 01:10 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll update again.

[11-Mar-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll make sure I pushed it lol

[11-Mar-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep

[11-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I feel there must be a better way to determine a failed import other than trying to broadcast it 90 times

[11-Mar-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was quite hard to get the sledgehammer on KMD side to work, espeically if your running off chian tip, it seems more reliable once you resume it later

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
we'll have this same situation over and over

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
"I have a failed import"

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
then we broadcast and it's fine

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
we need to figure out a way to know for sure that it is failed

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no possilbe way to determine if the import is possible other than try to send it

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
besides it simply not broadcasting after 90 attempts

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless we make anoher RPC that returns the same thing

[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
well

[11-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
what is it waiting for? a notarization of source chain to go to KMD then have momom that includes this notarized to target?

[11-Mar-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue is super low down... its scannoing every MoMoM hash it can see, uintil it gets  a match ... it only knows it didnt find a match, it cant know anything else

[11-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
can't we look at when the notarization that *should* include it?

[11-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
and if this is already on chain we can infer that it is a failed import

[11-Mar-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no the notarization that *should* include it was never in the right place so we hit it with a giant hammer and loks at all MoMoM hash in 100 blocks previous scanning foward to a max of 1440 blocks

[11-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the fix is to generate more MoMoM hashes that incldue the correct MoM hash

[11-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until you find a match

[11-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see any other way to make it work

[11-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Does the script check KMD is running and synced first (if it is still needed)

[11-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
if we don't have a mechanism to provably verify that an import is failed how do we prevent this "baggage claim" mechanism from recreating coins for a claimed failed import that is not actual failed

[11-Mar-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD is needed... I would say its an error if it cant see what its looking for and will just keep trying...
