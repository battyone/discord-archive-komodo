trying to find things to do Alright has 1000 ideas... but some of them are just ridicuous tbh... however most of them are half solved

[10-Oct-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but, honestly, I think it's a great thing that I have no idea where you're at; it means you've done things üëçüèº

[10-Oct-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will get a readme done now and hopefully theres some people able to test it for me... I think its fairly noob proof... although you need tmux/screen to split the terminal.

[10-Oct-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or reun two ternimals I guess...

[10-Oct-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`although you need tmux/screen to split the terminal.`
then make me a readme for that too :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 01:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
does new address mean not the same address as I used for other chains?

[11-Oct-18 01:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
almost noob proof

[11-Oct-18 01:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or does the faucet take some time?

[11-Oct-18 01:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
a used address will not work no matter how many times you try it.

[11-Oct-18 01:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill make a new  address and try again

[11-Oct-18 02:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
up and running -- had to start komodod to getnewaddress - not sure if I needed it - I couldnt start TROLL with  komodod running - not sure which instance it was looking for - Cant use special characters at all -  instructions are wrong "To mine your faucet get transaction you need to have the chain running with a valid address/pubkey/wif in your config.ini and run the ./`getfunds` command in this folder. Remeber this address must be empty to claim your STAKEDTROLL a used address will not work no matter how many times you try it."

[11-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
change to run this command from the TROLL folder

[11-Oct-18 02:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
its a great prototype

[11-Oct-18 02:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and my pubkey was wrong and it still worked

[11-Oct-18 02:33 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe you need a new channel for TROLL

@kmdkrazy  are you still around. your problems are unclear.

[11-Oct-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I agree the needing a config.ini set up manually is a pain in the ass. Still trying to think how to solve it... maybe have a blockchain with random params, and no IP to connect to that generate the address and chucks it into the config.ini ü§î then stops it again.

[11-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
> `does new address mean not the same address as I used for other chains?`
No I should clarify this I guess.

[11-Oct-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as it has not been used on STAKEDTROLL it will be vaild.

[11-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont like the idea of the coins having value.... the idea is this is free service.

[11-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As soon as you give hte coins any value at all, you open up attack vectors

[11-Oct-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I personally love the fact we have a chat inside out testing enviroment now... just needs people to use it. Definatly can do wiht improvemnt, 100% should ahve written the TROLLBOX in python...

[11-Oct-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bash version works, but is not good.

[11-Oct-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need to change james faucet....

[11-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only bad thing about this PoC is the limitations on the faucet

[11-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the way it checks for new address is just stupid.

[11-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant work out how to make it check for a new address BEFORE you do the PoW to create the transaction.

[11-Oct-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It always checks it after this .... and returns no error value

[11-Oct-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I will reduce the amount of the faucet, so it only gives 10 coins.

[11-Oct-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and remove the limitation that it needs to be a new address, because IMO its broken.

[11-Oct-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This way anyone can juct mine the faucet for coins.

[11-Oct-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
similar to normal mining.

[11-Oct-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I might be able to make the faucet fund, just always return true... so that it it can create unlimited coins forever, this way nobdy can even spend the few years it would take to mine the faucet dry for 0 reason.

[11-Oct-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will figure this out this afternoon. but it will require making a new chain I think

Hi, I wrote up  `Blockchain Dog` for marketing and was wondering who I should send it to.  Any suggestions?

[11-Oct-18 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo ?

[11-Oct-18 09:16 AM] Mylo#8306
DM'd you mate send it there.  and we can voice chat about it if you want next week probably best.   over discord, phone or whatever.

I am going to hard fork kvtroll branch soon.

[11-Oct-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKEDTROLL chain will break.

[11-Oct-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thaught about this a fair bit and I think what I ended up doing is fine, and was also pretty simple.

[11-Oct-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will test this out on 2 nodes first, then remove STAKEDTROLL and add STKDTROLL to notary nodes instead...

[11-Oct-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok seems to be working... removed address check and reduced faucet get to 10 coins ... next thing I might try is how big I can get the supply, I think a trillion is probably enough, but might try 9 trillion and see if that works üòÇ

[11-Oct-18 10:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Go big, haha.

[11-Oct-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the higher the supply the less incentive someone has to try and drain it just to be a prick.

[11-Oct-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even at a trillion coins it would take multiple years to empty with a single node

[11-Oct-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically what I did was move the PoW to creating faucetgets instead of creating blocks üòÑ

[11-Oct-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but before it was too easy to do the PoW for a faucetget for no valid reason, it seems if the work has been done the reward should be given.

[11-Oct-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than letting the work be done, then giving some abbigious error

[11-Oct-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that offers no real explination to why, as eveything is in stdout ... and i cant have prints there.

[11-Oct-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the errors returned as JSON to the cli call, it wouldnt be as bad... but i think for this case, we have no need to limit it to new address, all that does is make it horribly hard to use.

[11-Oct-18 10:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Mining 9 trillion coins would certainly show some perseverance.  You'd really have to be a dedicated prick.

[11-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even mining 1 trillion 10 at at time would be hard. the average faucetget takes about 20-30s and I am just testing now. it seems its limited by the amount of utxo in the fucetfund how many can happen at once.

[11-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on STAKEDTROLL I sent like 1000 utxo to the faucet

[11-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so 1000 faucetget can happen per block, but this time I will limit that to maybe 10 utxo, so 10 faucgetget of 10 coins per block.

[11-Oct-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Oct-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
900,000,000 faucet gets be enough ?

[11-Oct-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems it can be even bigger than that üòÇ

[11-Oct-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
77,662,796,314 is the max supply it willl let you use

[11-Oct-18 02:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
which statement did you not understand? @blackjok3r

[11-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont worry, i looked at the troll box and got most of it there üòÑ

[11-Oct-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have changed how the faucet works

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
nice!

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
there is money to be made here

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked out what the maximum AC supply can be , over 77.5 billion coins, filled the faucet with 100 utxo so 100 paralett faucet gets can happen per block.

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
dont be a pussy

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ney

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
free service

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
serious?

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its one art of staked...

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok brah

[11-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED has value ...

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becaus of cool things like this working on it

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do it for free

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no other project has them

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this type of chain can be launched to run for barterdex/hyper dex troll box, but they dont with with SPV,... SPV sould slow it down to unueable

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have always loved this KV thing - it has much potential

[11-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its cool

[11-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just launchign the STKDTROLL chain now

[11-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and will update all my notaries with it and the staked repo soon.

[11-Oct-18 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then its ready for teting... thank you for testing the other one...

[11-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was valuable imput ...the restriciton on new address with fauct was needless complication

[11-Oct-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now you can just spam faucetget as much as you like but it will still take months of not years to drain it

[11-Oct-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Basically I moved mining from the creation of blocks to get coins, to the faucet TX generation

[11-Oct-18 02:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
This is the slang term for "bro" which is slang for brother..a slang inside a slang 8) THIS ORIGINATED IN THE STATE OF HAWAII! for those who think that it originated in southern california or where ever, your are miss informed. It is the pigeon (english-hawaiian slang) word that is used state wide in Hawaii not only by surfers but by all people born and raised in hawaii of all racial groups. and it pains me when i hear cali haole tourist say it.
sup brah 
howsit brah 
a' brah we go beach 
ho brah where you stay

[11-Oct-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mining is now instant and has no difficulty or block reward at all  ... but the faucet takes 10-60s to generate 10 coins on a fast CPU, longer on a slower one.

[11-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There might be a way to paralell faucet get... but it would require a lot of effort ... 100 users can all faucet get at the same time and it will still work

[11-Oct-18 02:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think the potential is worth more than you think - its worth more than free

[11-Oct-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so block generation and coin generation are on demand

[11-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not so sure... someone hasnt tried to break it yet

[11-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it could likely be broken very easily

[11-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I know there doesnt exist a blockchain with no difficulty adjustment

[11-Oct-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems dangerous

[11-Oct-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@blackjok3r I'm building a vm now to start playing (since you kept komodo-cli name, I don't want to pollute)

[11-Oct-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, I should probably change that?

[11-Oct-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem like its an issue really to change it to staked-cli ?

[11-Oct-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
cant run side-by-side if both have same name

[11-Oct-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am about to make a bunch of changes to switch it to the new chain anyway
