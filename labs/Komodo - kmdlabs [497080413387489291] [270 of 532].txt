mine too

[03-Feb-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok.. I guess an @LabsAssistant  Might be requried... 
I will tery and figure a better way to handle this aprt... this is a major flaw in both main net and us... more so for us because we change so often.

[03-Feb-19 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Please run start.sh

[03-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol jsut got a ntoarisedtiona s soon as i post it

[03-Feb-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
should stop PAYME NOTARYTEST and CFEKY if you just run start.sh

so did it work?

[03-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to ahve

[03-Feb-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
yes 😄

[03-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one just happened

[03-Feb-19 10:32 AM] jorian#4555
yeah i was in it

[03-Feb-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will seee how it goes over 24H

[03-Feb-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There may or may not be problems in miner... creating blocks that dont pass validation... but all in all the consensus code seems solid do far

nice

[03-Feb-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think now min sigs is diffrent maybe stats script wont work ?

[03-Feb-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats possible @webworker01  might know more

[03-Feb-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwie can try to figure it out later on

[03-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
So LABSTPAY proper stalled at 286 blocks - or have I crashed?

[03-Feb-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
yea it's stalled, no worries

[03-Feb-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
joker going to work on it when he's back

[03-Feb-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
2 notarizations in mempool caused the miner to produce invalid blocks

[03-Feb-19 12:35 PM] jorian#4555
yay

[03-Feb-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CFEKY = deded and I can stop it?

[03-Feb-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Fek y had a big ass fork

[03-Feb-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was easier to let it die

[03-Feb-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yay free threads 🙂

[03-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because of this fork I found an issue not possible to see otherwise...

This week, I'm likely going to fumble my ignorant way around iguana with valgrind and hope I can find something else for you to fix

[03-Feb-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
A syncing node can follow a bunch of headers... And end up on the wrong chain... Then it passes the max re org limit

[03-Feb-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought we knew that

[03-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
By using the temp file fix I noticed it would reject blocks from the competing chain early on then delete them, seemed it chose correct chain more than wrong, disable that , and then it picked the other one more often... But when it went on the fork on the temp file fix node it used all the ram and crashed it

Already spoke with mike tout other day about this possibility for the pos attack... And that's the one thing that he said this solution can't cover, vybrandom chance it happened from something else 😂

[03-Feb-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to be a solution tho

[03-Feb-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There can't be too many pos blocks in a row...

[03-Feb-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is always in favor of limiting PoS_ :troll_king:

[03-Feb-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol... But how do we decrease pow difficulty based on time?

[03-Feb-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because of the diff wall

[03-Feb-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because the pow needs blocks to calc its diff and pos goes on time... So it can always mine easier

[03-Feb-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stop doing the wall and and devise a better mousetrap (because it's just that easy :troll: )

[03-Feb-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahj so your saying that the wall needs to go

[03-Feb-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And make staking easier and easier as the pow goes up

[03-Feb-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
jokes aside, I don't have any real suggestion on how to do it better, if I did then we'd likely be doing it already

[03-Feb-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's can be done... It what the implications are are not great... Because if u change the staking diff... Then pow can't be calculated until connect block either... And anyone can spam pow or pos blocks that are fake 👎

[03-Feb-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The temp file kind of helps with that.. But if the node follows the wro g headers....

[03-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As much as I hate the wall, I've not been able to come up with any idea that's real-time responsive enough if small rate chain is buzzing along mostly PoS and someone dumps 40M PoW on it

[03-Feb-19 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well the wall needs to exist... Hut in both directions

[03-Feb-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The staking diff is like linear until 5min pass then its exponential... All the time... Pow is exponential  in both directions

[03-Feb-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All the time

[03-Feb-19 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's never been both because "well, what if there are no miners, then PoS needs to keep the chain going"

[03-Feb-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's not true

[03-Feb-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not possible because you can't calc the pow diff and the pos % until u have the last 100 blocks

[03-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If we can work out how to not follow too many wrong headers... Then we already fixed it

[03-Feb-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ns we can now do that

[03-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100 is more accurate than 50, but I'm not getting how the rules of math cease to function at 99, 90 or even 50....

[03-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well it uses 100 blocks

[03-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's what it uses

[03-Feb-19 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its cinsensus

[03-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U can't use less and mine a valid block

[03-Feb-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it uses what the programmer tells it to use 😛

[03-Feb-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With verushahs we can make it use 50... But that doesn't change the fact the node can't have all of those 50 blocks until it tries to connect it to its chain

[03-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Right I'd someone sends u 1 valid block then sends headers that are valid from that block and u can't check pow or pos....

[03-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will follow that chain until u crash

[03-Feb-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u reject even the second or third block... Its fin u ban them

[03-Feb-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`U can't use less and mine a valid block`
why not? How can we even get the 1st 100 blocks then, ever? different rules for early?

[03-Feb-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To calcu wjatbthe percentage is which is what the diff is based on u need a data point that all nodes agree on

[03-Feb-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
too complex to use notarization as point?

[03-Feb-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Notarization determines diff?

[03-Feb-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems dangerous.... Having enough trouble paying a coinvase with a valid notarisarion

[03-Feb-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`u need a data point that all nodes agree on`
by definition we all agree on notarizations

[03-Feb-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
True

[03-Feb-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so that's 20-50 data points in 100 blocks

[03-Feb-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Op return has some extra data about the last 100 blocks it saw with the percentage? And that has to be the diff use until the next notarization?

[03-Feb-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Fixes the % into blocks of 5/blocks

[03-Feb-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That sounds too BTC for me 😛

[03-Feb-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not so bad actaullyt

[03-Feb-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As it stands now... The first 10 blocks are 0pow and when it gets to 120 blocks it stops dead for a while

[03-Feb-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In theory, it's not "bad"; in practice, however, a time locked diff punishes users if hash/staking is dramatically reduced (UNB is great example of how bad that can go, albeit less evil on dual chains because PoS helps)

[03-Feb-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Locking diff makes lots of problems man.. I don't thinks its a great solution

[03-Feb-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Notarizations don't always happen

[03-Feb-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
agreed

[03-Feb-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We shall have to just see what works... And try it... I think if we can make it so that u acnt receive x blocks from a node in a row the whole thing goes away

[03-Feb-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like I said, as much as I hate the wall (and I don't dispute that I'm biased on the subject) I haven't thought of anything better

[03-Feb-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean when do u ever sync from a so gle node right?

[03-Feb-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe a flag to disable it if u red to do that 🤔

[03-Feb-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like right this can work hey?
When u request a header and deem it valid then u request block..  So u never request more than 5 blocks from one peer

[03-Feb-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can't follow invalid chain

[03-Feb-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[03-Feb-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I mean when do u ever sync from a so gle node right?`
depends on the chain
all my labs chains are connect to my NN :troll:

[03-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well if u use connect= it ignores the rule

[03-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Easy

[03-Feb-19 04:20 PM] barv#0867
Hi. If a company would like to get started with an asset chain, what would than be considerations to use dpow lite i.o. dpow? And how does it work?

[03-Feb-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
`master` branch not compiling it seems

[03-Feb-19 04:52 PM] SHossain#0007
(for me)

[04-Feb-19 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
@barv Not sure I really understand the question. It's literally just dpow with notary nodes the project can control itself.

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Feb-19 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
best way to think of it is DIY solution for dpow. We didn't quite design LABS with this in mind, but it should be very easy to reuse our code

[04-Feb-19 01:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@barv this is the channel for future designs of blockchain usage. Get in on the future...KMDLABS has many solutions for many use cases... The incredible DEVs here can make your project work or point you in the right direction...in my best opinion KMDLABS is the future for everything.  forgive me if I am wrong

[04-Feb-19 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems all I had to do to notarize was ask about it and it magically started working 😛

[04-Feb-19 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I started mining the LABSTPAY chain and it jsut "fixed" itself
