I know *how* to stop it ina  broad sense.... hoe viable it will be to implement I'm not sure

[07-Feb-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
libscott wrote a notariser that does exactly what we need... but it w3as never finished for MoMoM stuff...

@blackjok3r - I blasted the entire LABS set of directories, no-sync issue went away.

[07-Feb-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it was a fork.... At least we have a moving chain atm now... I think 99% fot he issue was that the miner bug Genie found letting 2 notarisation into a block.. However not to take any chances I re wrote it anyway to be able to handle if it sees more than one ntoarisation as valid... as if it adds them in the wrong order to the block it can screw thigns up.

[07-Feb-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This new way, it saves the info it needs for all notarizations int he mempool.

[07-Feb-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and chooses the oldest valid one, so that they are *msot of the time* confirmed in the correct order. and if they are not in the correct order, at least there is only 1 in a block so a node cant decide that the notarisation NOT in position 1 is the valid notarisation.

[07-Feb-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its working.. Its working at lest when it sees 1 notrisation and I cant see any flaws in the logic... Cant be any worse that it was so pushing new version. 
Can as maany ppl as possible stake and mine LABST2 (even if you need to PoW on notary, just do it... we need lots of miners)

[07-Feb-19 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This update kills ST3/4 they will no longer sync I will remove them from assetchains.json to prevent start.sh complaining for you guys üòâ

not sure Notaries need to update... only do so if you plan to mine on notary.

[07-Feb-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also had another idea, to stop the risiculoud block times of PoS making multiple notareisations hang around the mempool we can run a freq = 1 , and just limit it to every 5 KMD blocks.

[07-Feb-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This does have the effect of if KMD stops... we stop too.. but really thats a problem anyway as our notarisaations cant confirm on KMD if thats the case.

[07-Feb-19 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
`we stop too` means just notarizations right?

[07-Feb-19 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Or would changing the freq stop all?

[07-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes only notarisatios ... to be fair KMD hasnt stopped in a LONG time

[07-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well right now we use freq 5 with min 3 KMD blocks I think it was

[07-Feb-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so when blocks happen really quickly on PoS chains it delays until 10 blocks have past

[07-Feb-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changin ti to every 5 KMd blocks and freq 1 means that it will be closer to a notarisation every 5 mins regardless if block times are fast or slow.

[07-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This should solve many issues.. but its a change that requires everyone to update...We can see how it goes over next few hours with a few miners, wait for genie to show up etc.. then maybe we can try it on this one chain to see how it behaves before launching a cluster again tomorrow to retest migrates.

[07-Feb-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405

lol its l;ooking pretty good now bar some giant exploit being found

[07-Feb-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
VerusHash 1.1 is working almost perfectly here, but only 350 blocks in.... I think its safe enough to start some new 0BR chains... so we can retest migrates. 
Can't see any problem with migrtates as all notarisaations are now definatly placed on chain, it just only enables one per block, and the oldest one is forced to be mined first... Appears to work well... but there seems no way to make mining a notarisation first a consensus rule... Dont think it matters though, as it can only notarise and pay notaries if the notarisation is in tx 1 and is valid.

[07-Feb-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks liek the fork was caused by a node not running latest... Or the miner including multiple valid notarisation in the same block, somehow... but no sure how that did anything, as Genies node that did that rejected its own blocks. Guess a few days will tel us if it will happen again

[07-Feb-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
By doing the validation first then working backwards... we prety much can gaurentee that everyone is on the right version now... They might just not be able to mine if they didnt update.

[07-Feb-19 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm.. still no joy with the mining node.  rebuilt z_cutils a few times.  Latest attempt has been to -addnode from staked/komodo/master  ahhmight havee just figured out my mistake...

[07-Feb-19 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
Just had an interesting thought. Fungible chains can allow for private/offline blockchains which are then made fungible at some point in the future

[07-Feb-19 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
as long as the chain properly syncs with consensus rules and the premine amount is burned

[07-Feb-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
we would need height activated ac_notarypay, but other than that, pretty sure this concept "just works"

[07-Feb-19 12:10 PM] CrisF#3405
If that works, it is very, very cool.  Useful af.

[07-Feb-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wee need height activated ac_notary pay anyway for the main chain üòâ

[07-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
would help if that doesn't affect magic for 0BR chains

[07-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
similar to ac_ccactivate

[07-Feb-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be made to do that

[07-Feb-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think...

[07-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
allows for chain creator to take their time before they make it public

[07-Feb-19 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
I know we've basically been doing it already. Not sure how I didn't think about it like this

[07-Feb-19 12:52 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright would only the premine amount need to be burned, or all the amount of all the coins on the chain at the time of becoming 'public'?
`the premine amount is burned`

[07-Feb-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
`LABST5` chain is live and ready to start being notarized.  You `MUST` be on the lastest update from a few hours ago or this chain will not work. It is 100% incompatible with old code bases. `VerusHash v1.1` that uses the equihash difficulty adjustment to make it work with PoS 64 reliably.  I think I finally have it tuned to be useable.  The difficulty on these chains with just 1 CPU core is INSANE! I encorage ppl to mine it with a core, if every notary mines this chain with just 1 core it will really help us test the notary pay is working without forking the chain.  Once again PLEASE make sure you are on the latest, I dont think it can sync past block 50 without it so we should be quite safe.

yes with 0 BR and the wallet filtering 0 value utxo.. all notaries can mien all 0BR chains if they have a core free... This secures them and keeps them moving. Notaries get paid by the notary pay to do this. Chain createor is responsible for PoS (or users can stake when using) seems to work well. ü§û  it keeps working this time üòÑ
