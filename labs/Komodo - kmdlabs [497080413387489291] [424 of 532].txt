sellimport would work to create the coins on demand....cool ....now just sendtowalllet <address> or send to home address...then trade ...the FTC though.....hmm

How to process the order with out saving bank account info?

[10-Jun-19 01:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Coin base has no big problems

[10-Jun-19 01:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
There are several secure shopping carts....what's wrong with teathers? .....bank account thing might be easy with big investors.
But that's alot of back end (future) step 3 - I was building PayPal system at the same time paypal was...I only had 1 18 YO programmer and then eBay stopped us from giving the service...
I know we can connect to banks to get "in" without Elon stopping it this time

@kmdkrazy mobile pay coin lets you build a shop with crypto

[10-Jun-19 04:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm talking something totally different @Exile13

[10-Jun-19 04:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
But I'll look at that ...

[11-Jun-19 08:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, one (of the few) things I used Agama for was sending from a specific address, rather than `""`.  Before I used `z_sendmany`.  
What can I use for this now (cli prefered)?
Only thing I could come up with is importing privkey into an empty wallet and sending from there...

👀 🤦 

[11-Jun-19 08:36 AM] PHBA2061#2530
you want to send from a specific output ? then you need to use `createrawtransaction` ,  `signrawtransaction` & `sendrawtransaction`

[11-Jun-19 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool.  I've only used rawtransactions for CCs.  
Not sure how I'd use them for this purpose.  (not sure what to do to send funds).

[11-Jun-19 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Interested to learn about this.

[11-Jun-19 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Will check out the docs.

[11-Jun-19 08:40 AM] CrisF#3405
If you have any resources I could look at I'd be grateful!

[11-Jun-19 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There's many scripts people have written over time that do this, u just need to filter the listunspent correcty

[11-Jun-19 08:46 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli help` is where I started with, the template of a `createrawtransaction ` looks like this, you pick the`txid` & `vout`  from `listunspent`
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME createrawtransaction "[{\"txid\":\"xxx\",\"vout\":1},{\"txid\":\"yyy\",\"vout\":4}]" "{\"RReceiver1\":0.4991,\"RReceiver2\":1.3195}"
```

[11-Jun-19 08:49 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it will return a serialized transaction, which you need to sign with `signrawtransaction` then `sendrawtransaction` the signed one

[11-Jun-19 08:50 AM] PHBA2061#2530
usually `RReceiver2` is yourself (change address)

[11-Jun-19 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I've seen how to use rawtransactions, but it's getting the values that might cause me trouble, haha.
Can see how this will be very useful to learn

[11-Jun-19 09:02 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yes it is very useful, I was forced to learn this to clean my BEER dust 😂

[11-Jun-19 09:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, the testnet was very useful wasn't it!!

[11-Jun-19 09:47 AM] PHBA2061#2530
sure is

[11-Jun-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it's getting the values that might cause me trouble`
listunpent and 'getrawtransaction some_hex 1' will be a good friend to you

[11-Jun-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you already know txid, then getrawtransaction works much better than gettransaction for getting vouts, other info you may want, and amounts

guys, what's the price of Labs nowadays? 😄

[11-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what about the OTC price

[11-Jun-19 07:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
anybody selling?

[11-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
do you remember his/her price

Difficulty is changing over time (do not look at units, units are not accurate), is it normal ?

and how can I get POS blocks ? I have some LABS coins

[11-Jun-19 08:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
setgenerate true 0

[11-Jun-19 08:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
and for best results you might want to use the pos64staker

[11-Jun-19 08:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
Can't sync LABS: a lot of ```komodo_segid ht.4 couldnt extract voutaddress``` and stuck at block 540

[11-Jun-19 08:23 PM] phm87#7395
I was also stuck at block 540 using a "normal" komodo daemon, then I used komodo daemon compiled using KMDLabs/komodo and it works well

[11-Jun-19 08:24 PM] phm87#7395
(for my mining pool I mean)

[11-Jun-19 08:25 PM] phm87#7395
@CHMEX  thank you, I'll try this on another machine. Guys of KMD explained me a little bit the pos64staker during the Breaking Bitcoin conference

[11-Jun-19 08:35 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm using the one compiled by the ./start.sh script (I believe so! Checking...)

[11-Jun-19 08:40 PM] phm87#7395
@zatJUM  Did you use the old guide used by @Dr.Terminus  or the new one that I linked (from SHossain) ?

[11-Jun-19 08:41 PM] phm87#7395
Edit : I'm writing in the wrong channel and I'm confused between LABS and NN conversations ... Please disregard my last message where I pinged zatJUM and Dr.Terminus

[11-Jun-19 08:42 PM] zatJUM#9924

[11-Jun-19 08:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks for the hint: I probably wasn't running the right komodod 👍

[11-Jun-19 09:00 PM] phm87#7395
I did the same error ... I'm confused by the many different versions, branches and repos here

[11-Jun-19 09:08 PM] phm87#7395

_waits for alright to ask if you synced ntp_

[11-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 the way pos64 POS works is that it calibrates the POW diff to match the target POS%

[11-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
it looks at the previous 100 blocks, if >51 were POS, it lowers POW diff, if >49 were POW, it raises it

[11-Jun-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
also, I can find you a guide for pos64staker if you like. You should use the `restart` branch of that repo. You'll need to add LABS to the assetchains.json it pulls as well. Let me know if you need any help with it.

[11-Jun-19 11:01 PM] phm87#7395
ok I'll try thank you

[11-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
@zatJUM you're on a pretty old build, that was fixed in jl's repo shortly after launch. Any of his branches other than master will work fine. 
`komodo_segid ht.4 couldnt extract voutaddress` can be ignored, it's just printing because there is a tx with no outputs other than OP_RETURN in block 4

[11-Jun-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
Do you have a bitcointalk annoncement ? As LABS is launched and on exchanges, an ANN should exist

[11-Jun-19 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
slacked on it, need to ask @CrisF how far along that is

[11-Jun-19 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
also @Gordon Komodo there is a KMD market on graviex as well, barterlly has LABS as well. Nicehash is another option

[11-Jun-19 11:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what is the max supply

[11-Jun-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
when I search for an interesting new coin to add on my pool, I'm looking in bitcointalk annoncements so other pools (out of KMD ecosystem) may complain if it is annonced late. I think that LABS can be a promising project but it is sad that there is not yet an annoncement while there is a website, a team, huge work done during a year. Some Equihash pools may complain of the late bitcointalk annoncement

[11-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 yes I understand

[11-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
we've been here for almost a year though, the launch was no surprise to anyone even remotely involved with KMD

[11-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
@Gordon Komodo there isn't one

[11-Jun-19 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
Pirate had a very late ANN, and look at it now 😛

[11-Jun-19 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
not trying to justify it, we have slacked on it. It was planned to go up prior to launch

[11-Jun-19 11:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @phm87, that ANN is waiting on approval (confirmed as accurate). It'll be up shortly afterwards.

[12-Jun-19 02:13 AM] AkiraX#8269

sorry, no more time for troubleshooting this now. you can try to do a full resync

stop the daemon, remove all files other than wallet.dat and the .conf file

Seems all you guys are totally chopping me on LABS notarizations, todya I decided to make a listunspent cache daemons side. 
Waiting on KMD to start to I can test how much time it shaves off listunspent.

I made it so that I can run LABS, a-team, and the new notary all at the same time on the same server. Its really struggling with it, but it was by far the easiest way to handle the change over.
