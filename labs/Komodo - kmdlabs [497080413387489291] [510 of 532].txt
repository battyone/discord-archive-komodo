Haha, you are a hard master, @kmdkrazy!
I put in 14 hours on various things yesterday and I'm sure others put in more :abusedsmily:

If you'd like some action here there are things that can be done.  I'm interested to test out Pegs for example.  Not sure if we can do it in here though.  Need to find out about the technical aspects of that.
I know Blackjok3r, Alright and smk762 are very busy atm, so don't want to ask right now...

[03-Nov-19 03:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have some time for testing- show me the destructions when you are ready

Hey guys, I'm trying to get together a list of proof of concepts of different CC's. Do you have any examples or github links I can check out? I've posted in all the CC channels for each one specifically and was told there might be something on MoMoM here.

[04-Nov-19 12:09 AM] CrisF#3405

Anyone interested in creating a simple GUI for cross-chain transactions?  It would be used as a reference GUI to demonstrate the cross-chain tech to non-cli users and to give an idea of what can be done with MoMoM.

is there anywhere to get a reasonable good estimate of current LABS network hashrate?

hahah..given who I am talking to, I would put money on it there is at least 1 solo miner on the network😜

mine are on the pool (the ones running at least, seems I had a power outage last night)

Saw 2x `update failed for block` since restart for LABS, is that normal?

made updating wallet ver 0.5.9-2 but still have the same error

[04-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
@bamby you need to replace the komodod binary with the one in the pinned messages here

[04-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
won't be able to sync the correct chain if you do not

[04-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
What OS are you using? Not 100% sure where that binary would be

[04-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Alright#0419
on Windows, you can go to 
`Agama\resources\app\assets\bin\win64\`
delete the file there called "komodod.exe"
download komodod.exe from here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/dev-multios-0.4.0a-labs
and put it in that folder

make sure you you completely stop Agama and/or komodod before doing that

[04-Nov-19 07:18 PM] bamby#5307
i find where Agama\resources\app\assets\bin\win64\. i use win64

[04-Nov-19 07:23 PM] bamby#5307
i see, thanks

[04-Nov-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
all good?

[04-Nov-19 07:32 PM] bamby#5307
still have the same error.😩

[04-Nov-19 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bamby are you using the lite wallet?

[04-Nov-19 07:35 PM] bamby#5307
yes, i use lite walllet

[04-Nov-19 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then that's the problem, it's not connecting to the electrum server (if there even is one)

[04-Nov-19 07:45 PM] bamby#5307
yes, it inconnect

[04-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
there is a server, will test it myself later today

[04-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
@bamby for now, I'd suggest using native mode

[04-Nov-19 07:47 PM] bamby#5307
ok

[04-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
are you on the latest version on Agama?

[04-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
if not, update and try it again please

[04-Nov-19 07:47 PM] bamby#5307
ver 0.5.9-2

[04-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Oszy#5734
i have no issues with labs electrums

[04-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Oszy#5734
let me check Agama quick

[04-Nov-19 07:49 PM] bamby#5307
let me try native mode

[04-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Oszy#5734
Agama: electrum3.cipig.net:10019 no issues

[04-Nov-19 07:51 PM] bamby#5307
how to set this node

[04-Nov-19 07:51 PM] Oszy#5734
this is default in Agama so it should work for you out of the box too

[04-Nov-19 07:52 PM] Oszy#5734
you have firewall maybe blocking the port? other lite wallets are fine?

[04-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Oszy#5734
In settings SPV server list the are 3 servers for LABS

[04-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Oszy#5734
try to change

[04-Nov-19 07:57 PM] bamby#5307
Oszy; still have the same error

[04-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Oszy#5734
No idea then, it's fine here.

[04-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
@bamby did it work previously? if so, did you recently change anything?

[04-Nov-19 08:09 PM] bamby#5307
before it is normal, it has problem when labs chain is changed.

[04-Nov-19 08:09 PM] bamby#5307
im not sure

[04-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Oszy#5734
can you ping electrum3.cipig.net?

[04-Nov-19 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when labs chain is changed`
the chain hasn't changed in any meaningful way

[04-Nov-19 08:19 PM] bamby#5307
but i  dont understand why it has issue

[04-Nov-19 09:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
probably because your chain is forked and not reverting

[04-Nov-19 09:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
backup conf file and wallet.dat

[04-Nov-19 09:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
remove the blocks database and chainstate folders.

[04-Nov-19 09:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then launch LABS so it will resync from scratch

[04-Nov-19 09:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
I just did the same in AGAMA and had issues

[04-Nov-19 09:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
Resync is working now and seems stable

[04-Nov-19 10:56 PM] Oszy#5734

you're likely be better off if you dump your wallet and re-import it to a fresh wallet.dat, before it gets corrupted further
