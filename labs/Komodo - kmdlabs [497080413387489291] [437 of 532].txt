you need to clone the repo again

[24-Jun-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something has fucke up pr3etty badly that error should not exist

[24-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Exile13#4458
did i do this when i installed `staked`

[24-Jun-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you should definatly not ahve done that... It may be wise to woipe the entire thing and start again

[24-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Exile13#4458
uh oh

[24-Jun-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you can just remove StakedNotary and ~/komodo

[24-Jun-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure to vbackup config.ini.

[24-Jun-19 08:15 AM] Exile13#4458
i `rm -rf komodo` and `StakedNotary`

if you still get the ```{'error': 'source address or dest '
          'address has no privkey, '
          'importprivkey',
 'tag': '10405864651622283635'}``` error, you need to setup your config.ini

i probably fuxord things with the install of `staked` even though i wasnt running the `StakedNotary` they probably shared some codebase?

[24-Jun-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they shouldnt, but in future we should try to merge those 2 repos into 1. They both do much the same thing.

[24-Jun-19 10:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I've run both on the same node before without trouble. That was a while back though.

[24-Jun-19 11:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Glad it's up and running, @Exile13 👍

[24-Jun-19 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
@Exile13 btw, do you know how to check what mask you are in?

[24-Jun-19 11:34 AM] Exile13#4458
Idk what that means,  I'm guessing it's like the directory?

[24-Jun-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
It's more like stats.

[24-Jun-19 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
there is a script `checkmasks` you can run from StakedNotary.

[24-Jun-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Also you can use this `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]`

[24-Jun-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
That is the basic one I guess.

[24-Jun-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
It will give you an idea on how your node is positioned in the notarization round.

[24-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Exile13#4458
Ok ty

[24-Jun-19 04:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the `checkmasks ` script only includes seed nodes though

[24-Jun-19 08:24 PM] phm87#7395
If I want to stake 1600 LABS, should I split it in 64 addresses using the pos64staker script ? Or is it better to let everything in one address ? I tested with splitting to 64 addresses (UTXOs size = 4 and amount of UTXOs to send to each segid = 5) but how can we optimise these numbers for optimal staking with X labs ?

[24-Jun-19 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Your minimum "sort of optimal" is 1 UTXO per segid.
this can be swayed by UTXO size though, you really need to "establish" what your ratio to staked supply is (the higher the supply the larger a UTXO likely needs to be in order to be viable) and that's more of a guessing game than anything else
My personal method usually 20 UTXOs per segid and *not* setting a pubkey, then consolidate and resplit every time my holdings hit 2x

[24-Jun-19 08:39 PM] phm87#7395
thank you for your advices and explanations CG

[24-Jun-19 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for clarity, what I mean by "staked supply" is that if 1000 people are staking with UTXOs worth 20 and they all split their stakes across all 64 segIDs, then you will *generally* not fair as well with UTXOs of 1 coin than if you were close to their size.
Time since the UTXO was created plays a factor too, but the above is in an "all other things being equal" situation

[24-Jun-19 08:48 PM] phm87#7395
With 1600 coins, if I use 64 times 20 UTXO, I can set UTXO size of 1 maximum I think ... I'll try to find tools to analyse stakers in a network (I never did). I don't know if such tools exist

[24-Jun-19 08:48 PM] phm87#7395
but uxto size of 1 is very small

[24-Jun-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with 1600, you may have to start with 1-3 UTXOs per, see how well you do, and work it out from there

[24-Jun-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because luck is a factor, there is no "best" system to do

[24-Jun-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if X/coinsupply is less than 1/64, it might be best to just have it in a single utxo

[24-Jun-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
pick the lowest staking segid and put all into a single utxo in that segid

[24-Jun-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on one chain, there was someone (I forget who) that used a **ton** of UTXOs sized 1-5 coins and did quite well

[24-Jun-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this way, even a small stake can have a decent change every 64 blocks

[24-Jun-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you have more than 1/64th the coin supply, the optimal changes a lot

[24-Jun-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`yes, if you have more than 1/64th the coin supply, the optimal changes a lot`
I learned that with OUR; no plan I did well with on any other chain worked as well on OUR as it did on those others, partly/mostly because of small my total was

[24-Jun-19 08:55 PM] phm87#7395
metaphilibert also suggested me to try with one utxo and with 84 coins, I got 8 new coins few days ago with this technique (but maybe I was lucky). I also got 8 new coins when staking the 1600 LABS splitted on 64 x size of 4 x 5 utxo per segid

[24-Jun-19 08:56 PM] phm87#7395
I'll try with @jl777c  advice and I'll check tomorrow
```if X/coinsupply is less than 1/64, it might be best to just have it in a single utxo
pick the lowest staking segid and put all into a single utxo in that segid```

[24-Jun-19 08:57 PM] phm87#7395
thank you guys

[24-Jun-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one thing to keep in mind:
when you start out with 1600, 1 block a day isn't as bad as it seems (it's 3.5% gains on your investment in 1 week)

[24-Jun-19 08:59 PM] phm87#7395
and the crash that I had on this node, I think that I found why : I am using the same node for staking and mining and I read on this discord that it can crash if used for both. I tried to get the stackstrace for blackjoker but I don't know how to close putty without stopping dgb (I google but I didn't find how to close ssh without stopping dgb)

[24-Jun-19 09:00 PM] phm87#7395
CG : yes but the 8 new coins for 84 coins was better (unsure how I got that though)

[24-Jun-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`unsure how I got that though`
every UTXO that's mature is *possible* to stake; the rest is separating the "possible" from "what will work the best for me in the long run"

[24-Jun-19 09:03 PM] phm87#7395
How can I identify the lowest staking segid ? (I'm reading the python to try to understand, I'm new to staking)

[24-Jun-19 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd swear someone wrote a script for that long ago, but I forget when, who, or how long ago

[24-Jun-19 09:10 PM] phm87#7395
I'm reading the pos64staker

[24-Jun-19 09:11 PM] phm87#7395
but maybe it can be easier to start from the documentation

[24-Jun-19 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can go back x blocks, `getblock` for each, and read each segid

[24-Jun-19 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getblock 43020 | jq '.segid'
60
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getblock 43021 | jq '.segid'
52```

You need to back trace it or I can't fix

[25-Jun-19 10:04 AM] CMaurice#1685
looking into it

[25-Jun-19 10:08 AM] CMaurice#1685
how would I do that will all the gubbins in ./start_iguana.sh?

[25-Jun-19 10:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`gdb start.sh` or `gdb start_iguana.sh` depends on which binary you run

[25-Jun-19 10:11 AM] PHBA2061#2530
then inside gdb `run` , then when iguana crashes `backtrace`

[25-Jun-19 10:12 AM] CMaurice#1685
thanks, it ocurred to me to do that, but had no idea you could run a bash script like that

[25-Jun-19 10:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not sure it would work though 😅
