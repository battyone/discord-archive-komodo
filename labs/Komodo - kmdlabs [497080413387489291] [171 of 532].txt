On the plus side, my ignorance and looking like a dumbass is buried in labs and most people will not see it 🙂

Hey guys, sorry i went MIA with no warning. Had some stuff I needed to deal with. Someone able to get my up to speed with what has happened in the last week or so?

[23-Dec-18 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Webby made a better splitter for NNs
I made it better and worse at the same time
I'm an idiot
You're caught up

[23-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
@CrisF skimming through the last week or so of messages, how did you create that z tx?

[23-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
that paid 300 KMD in fees

[23-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
you used UI?

[24-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Mylo#8306
Not buried deep enough but good questions.  Template more reliable basically.  Reliable cos less complex.   My 2c
I just wanted to say not buried deep enough 😜

[24-Dec-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think you missed much @Alright the iguana splitfund is broken, and these guys managed to make a replacment in bash while both of use were not around. Great work guys... I am still a few days off, managed to get some inernet today to try and figure out why a--team ran out of KMD a few days back ... must be something wrong with my scripts lol. Maybe I can get this script on there in a short time.

[24-Dec-18 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
Incentivized momom stress test then launch?

[24-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
even in the event that momom burns someone's coins due to a bug, they could be recovered via bounty mechanism

[24-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
think we're ready man

[24-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Alright#0419
We've at least ironed out all the critical bugs. We'll have two months to figure out notary change mechanism.(the political side of it, tech side is ready)

[24-Dec-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I guess we can do that... However I am not really fully avalibe for a few days, and I assume being this time of the year, lots of others are not either. We should make sure the cluster is working, even make new chains for MoMoM test, to make 100% sure these chains are not causing some issues... LOTs of code was changed on these chains, its amazing they haven't died...

[24-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
Agreed, want to set a date for the stress test?

[24-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
need to talk about prize money, I'll PM. What's the best metric to pick a winner you think?

[24-Dec-18 03:14 AM] Alright#0419
just register an address then we'll count how many migrates that address had?

[24-Dec-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think breaking it should be the goal... anyone who manages to make it break and can reproduce it ? Or yeah, if it does not break, the person with the most migrates wins should be ok too.

[24-Dec-18 03:15 AM] Alright#0419
We have that ~17k that was left in contracts we could use. Can put up some KMD myself as well

[24-Dec-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used a single address to manage liek 25,000 mirates on CFEK* chains ... with 0 fails that I know of... but there wre times the chains stalled, and my VM crashed out, stuffing the data up.

[24-Dec-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we do need another formal test, the chains should no longer break and stall with all the changes to the staker I made.

[24-Dec-18 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
The limit we're going to put on weekly bounties... 1% sound about right to you?

[24-Dec-18 03:18 AM] Alright#0419
1% of emissions for that week

[24-Dec-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... Also I think that notaries should be more profitable than staking... I thaught about this a lot... and if they are not... then the inventive to notarise isnt there and they will just stake.

[24-Dec-18 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
why not both?

[24-Dec-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure you can stake on notary, maybe you can now that staking no longer hard locks the daemon... but its untested.

[24-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
it's just a different way of earning coins, nothing stopping someone from doing both

[24-Dec-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also with the new splitfund, maybe it will work, as it no longer should need a very specific type of utxo to split.

[24-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
you're suggesting we up the 10%?

[24-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its hard, but I think 10% over 20  nodes is a little low...

[24-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
Set a deadline for these changes to be decided, throw it into production and tweak as needed?

[24-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe 20% ... and less PoW I'm not really sure how it best should be done, but notary should really be the highest earner, as its the most important to the entire system

[24-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
needs to be set in stone before that deadline

[24-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PoW is not really super important, apart form distribution of coins

[24-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
phase out pow then?

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
gradually change the % to go to notaries instead?

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need it at least at the start so ppl can get coins, to be a notary or to stake

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
that's what most 100% POS coins do anyway

[24-Dec-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But that said, there is no way to change % based on heights that exists. We would ahve to make it, causing more delays.4

[24-Dec-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless we have 1 more set of chains, and hardfork and airdrop.

[24-Dec-18 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
will ac_era work?

[24-Dec-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think so... thats only for coin emmission...

[24-Dec-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It cna be done... but with my very mimited time avalie over the next few weeks, it wouldnt get done any time soon.

[24-Dec-18 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
hmmm, I think we can actually just change the ac_staked value

[24-Dec-18 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
it'll change the magic, so hard fork, but I think it'll be able to validate the rest of the chain once changed

[24-Dec-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess you will need to try it ...

[24-Dec-18 03:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Ill need to fund up if notarising as i missed the early rounds and only have valueless tokens.
BTW, i might be away for a day or two, rumours of fire teams being deployed to Bremer bay

[24-Dec-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, no problem dude... I think I will be airdropping some of my personal coins to a couple of ppl, and also notary is free for first round so You will get earnings from that.

[24-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
free forever, no? Didn't we decide against locking coins for a spot?

[24-Dec-18 03:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Sweet. Should know in next few hours whether im called out or not

[24-Dec-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We really need to work out how best to distributte the coins, notary and bounty are realy the power behind the whole thing... it will be a delicate balance... screw it up and we will need to totally scrap it all and restart 😆

[24-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
Would Feb 1 be a realistic launch date?

[24-Dec-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That sounds like a good goal to work towards here

[24-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
Ok, let's get this stress test done first or second week of Jan then work from there

[24-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
once stress test is done, really dig into game theory of it

[24-Dec-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds good... Provided none of th changes I made before I left for down here broke anything further we should be good to go even earlier than that, but it doesnt make sense to rush it though at this time on year, when everyone is usually busy.

[24-Dec-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There were some changes pushed for CC chains, that really need to be tested aswell... Has james spoken to you about that yet ?

[24-Dec-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can explain in detail what i changed if you want? As it very much needs to be tested and try to break it.

[24-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
Yea, that's my focus for the next couple days. Still going to need some help though

[24-Dec-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool.. probably best in DM, I will be here for a few hours, unknown when I will be able to get back online.

[24-Dec-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Miners and stakers updated here... turns out I wasnt staking any chains for many days, as I forgot to start it after doing a re-import of privkeys.

[24-Dec-18 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully the wallet is not corrupted again, when I get home 🤞  That means the changes to the staker have fixed it ... if not still looking for this problem, while not terrible, its still horribly inconvenian and annoying to deal with. Especially on a VM on a HDD... and over 100k txns on an address 🤣

[24-Dec-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Dec-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`type dc>/dev/null 2>&1 || { sudo apt-get install dc; }` I forgot the ;

[24-Dec-18 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're going to move it, I'd suggest putting it in the splitter that uses it or did you not put it there because most cron it and forget it?

[24-Dec-18 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either is about the same I guess, since it's only ever going to matter once

[24-Dec-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is there a single human on the planet that decodes base58 without that exact dc code? LOL
I've been looking around and it's like someone wrote it and the rest of the entire world said "perfect, let's never change it" and we all just pass it back and forth

😹 

[24-Dec-18 10:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, like so many other things, I guess rewriting it would require bothering and/or being able to understand it

[24-Dec-18 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, yes, 4 was last because 5 had issues

[24-Dec-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or `change=${change/#./0.}` ?

[24-Dec-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
/#./0. and scale=8 should fix any numeric issues if in the right place

[24-Dec-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
/#./0.  makes sure that .1234 = 0.1234
scale=8 makse sure that it stays 8 decimal places

looks working from  here
what error did you hit, exactly?

[24-Dec-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll have to pull it up again, not sure why you'd be "converting" anything

[24-Dec-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
silly question....
why are you using jq for math?

[24-Dec-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or `change=$(echo "scale=8; ($amount-($SPLIT_COUNT * 0.0001)" | bc -l) change=${change/#./0.}`

[24-Dec-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my bad, I forgot that the raw wasn't real numbers
everything I've posted in the last 22 mins was to get a real number 😛

I once wrote a MSN chat script in all regex (because I could); it was one of the worst, slowest scripts to ever run 😛

[24-Dec-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Wow, MSN messenger

I've used ICQ these times 😃

[24-Dec-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not messenger (although I played with a few of those too) 
MSNChat was MSN's IRCX version of IRC

Can't imagine how to debug a script fully from regex, sounds like a scary story 😃

Have no idea why Mail.ru bought ICQ

[24-Dec-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Just because they can I guess

[24-Dec-18 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
