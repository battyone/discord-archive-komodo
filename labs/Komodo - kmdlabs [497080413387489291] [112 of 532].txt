Oh!  ` 29170` is where @CMaurice  got stuck!

[24-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
`DisconnectTip trying to disconnect notarized block at ht.29170` this means it's trying reorg a notarized block

[24-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
not quite sure what you're doing, didn't really scroll up

[24-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
can someone please do a `diff` on that snapshot

[24-Nov-18 06:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I can, but don't know how.

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] CrisF#3405
What should I do?

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
`diff <mine> <your's>`

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, sorry don't have the snapshot.

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
no worries

[24-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
I'll just start my STAKED4 node again and grab it again

[24-Nov-18 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF yes my node was stuck in the same place.

[24-Nov-18 06:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Would it be on staked.cc?

[24-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
just want to make sure I didn't edit this for some reason and forget about it

[24-Nov-18 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 06:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got the hash of block and invalidated it, doesnt look like anything changed tho

[24-Nov-18 06:32 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright, I found a STAKED4 snapshot on the website.

[24-Nov-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok looks like all you can do is a connect=

[24-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that chain is fucked

[24-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  can we just remove it pelase

[24-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is unrelated to the chain sync issue

[24-Nov-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I broke this chain accidently when I hard forked the ERA's and protocol too quickly yesterday

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
is it longer than what smk has?

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
29170

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
just stuck?

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it far longer than that

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can force it to sync with conenct=

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
yea so how did we end up on unnotarized chain

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it never sees that notarisation as valid

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
or well we notarized a different chain

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there were two sets of notaries

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using diff pubekys

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarising ht esame chain

[24-Nov-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its my fault

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whats the full connect= command?

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain is just broken

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
remove all addnode

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
just as long as we understand how we broke it

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and add conenct=103.6.12.112

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
kill it

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know what the problem is

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
clear out the conf, k

[24-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but tbh we cna just kill it

[24-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont evne worry... we cna just remove it from assetchains.json

[24-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too much effort to try an revive it

[24-Nov-18 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wiat @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  try to just remove `komodostate` and `notarisations` folder

[24-Nov-18 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and reindex it

[24-Nov-18 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just taught of something

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just did connect= and it seemd to be ok

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ok cool

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
was that with a resync?

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or just starting it with connect=

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
n ah just manual start without addnode and with connect

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and that got it moveing

[24-Nov-18 06:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will kill and try start again

[24-Nov-18 06:45 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright ```diff ~/Downloads/STAKED4snapshot7633_WS.json ~/Downloads/STAKED4snapshot7633_AR.json``` showed no result.  `AR` is your version and `WS` is the version I just got from Staked.cc .

[24-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Alright#0419
kk ty

[24-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Alright#0419
I'll verify it against my STAKED4 bk anyway just to be sure

./start makes it go all `failed after select(): Connection refused (111)` again

[24-Nov-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those are normal

[24-Nov-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as its syncing

[24-Nov-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for some reason, KMD chains, seem to all try and use the KMD seed nodes (hard coded ones) for every AC, even if htey have peers ...

[24-Nov-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried disabling ti totally in the code, and it still did it ü§∑

[24-Nov-18 06:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, cos I noticed all chains doing it, but adding to tip also

[24-Nov-18 06:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
now I just gotta see an ntx and I'll be confident I'm ready

[24-Nov-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without enough nodes updated... you wont notarise, as your iguana will be ignored

[24-Nov-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is restarted ...

[24-Nov-18 07:02 AM] CrisF#3405
I restarted mine, too.

@Alright , I few people asked when the start today would be.  I told them 10am UTC was the last I heard.

[24-Nov-18 07:12 AM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, had my times messed up

[24-Nov-18 07:13 AM] Alright#0419
~3 hours

[24-Nov-18 07:13 AM] Alright#0419
right? üòÖ

[24-Nov-18 07:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, it something like that.

[24-Nov-18 07:15 AM] Alright#0419
Can we just burn that 17k? What do you guys think

[24-Nov-18 07:15 AM] Alright#0419
much easier solution IMO

[24-Nov-18 07:15 AM] Alright#0419
idk how we can fairly distribute it to people who helped

[24-Nov-18 07:16 AM] Alright#0419
burning it or evenly distributing in the airdrop seems fairest way

[24-Nov-18 07:16 AM] Alright#0419
or evenly distribute to notaries?

[24-Nov-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just give half each to chris and smk ?

[24-Nov-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or thirds with yoursef and them

[24-Nov-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems they are yours really

[24-Nov-18 07:21 AM] Alright#0419
They were mine and CHMEX's

[24-Nov-18 07:21 AM] Alright#0419
but I left them in assets contract at time of snapshot

[24-Nov-18 07:21 AM] Alright#0419
not going to change the airdrop to *give myself coins*

[24-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make a vote?

[24-Nov-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or just burn them if you cant be bothered to work it out .. i dunno how to pay hte peeople who put in all the time during the testnet though without them

[24-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I  will be donating some of mine ..

[24-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
