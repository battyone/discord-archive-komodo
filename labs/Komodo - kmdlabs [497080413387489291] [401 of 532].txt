[25-May-19 04:48 PM] jorian#4555
i too had way more staking than i ended up with

[25-May-19 04:48 PM] jorian#4555

[25-May-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
I setup a negative spread on assets CC orderbook with my own coins

[25-May-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
meant to cancel the orders prior to snapshot deadline, but I missed it

[25-May-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
purpose was to get people testing assets CC, they could just buy then sell it for immediate profit

[25-May-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
best part is that no one actually tested it 😂

Hi there. Noob here running LABS. On initiation I got a bunch of messages saying komodo-segid ht 4 couldn't extract voutaddress.  This ok?

[25-May-19 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
ignore it, I need to fix that sorry

[25-May-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
it's just because there is a tx in block 4 that only has an OP_RETURN output

[25-May-19 04:58 PM] allbits#5898
K thanks

[25-May-19 04:59 PM] allbits#5898
checking getinfo and I seem to be stuck on block 540 for a while

[25-May-19 04:59 PM] jorian#4555
oh, then you didn't update

[25-May-19 05:00 PM] jorian#4555
are you on latest for sure? because yesterday some people were stuck on 540 that didn't run latest

[25-May-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
need to use our repo of komodo

[25-May-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419

No I'm not on latest komodod. I run a pirate node on this vps. Will updating affect it? Sorry, total noob here

wait for this to finish

[25-May-19 05:05 PM] allbits#5898
So that would be an entirely different daemon than the one I'm currently running for pirate? And they won't interfere with each other?

[25-May-19 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
won't interfere

[25-May-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
it won't need a separate daemon for much longer

[25-May-19 05:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
are there more than what is listed in the readme?

[25-May-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@daemonfox was that the only failed or were there several?

[25-May-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
several in a row usually can be solved by less threads because of RAM constraints

[25-May-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
if i rerun the build, more errors waterfall so ill try fewer cores

[25-May-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
been doing j7 and j6 on 8 core VM

[25-May-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
but 4GB ram

[25-May-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then yes, try with like `-j4`

[25-May-19 05:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
hey it built this time with j6

[25-May-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
generally you want swap space if you only have 4gm of RAM

[25-May-19 05:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah as soon as Genie said that i realized 1GB swap was not enough

Ok, sounds good!

[25-May-19 09:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
something I notice about KMDLabs iguana TV: 
```
>>>> UNLOCKED KMD UTXO.(3d29171b407f170e33a77215fd9c4527f46d0d3f0a80bb44597c12c09f4f997e) vout.(1)
```
this will be printed no matter if you managed to sign the notarization transaction or not.
Compared  to the NN testnet iguana, the `>>>> UNLOCKED KMD UTXO (txid) vout(n) ` output is only printed when you didn't manage to sign the nota transaction and the locked utxo is then unlocked as a result.

[25-May-19 09:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
is the start.sh script supposed to output anything after the below...

[25-May-19 09:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
[KMD] : Starting KMD
Started Assetchains
[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...

[25-May-19 09:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
both daemons are in sync

[25-May-19 09:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[25-May-19 09:57 PM] gt#2812
yes

no output for me... both daemons got a thread pegged

did you split your funds ?

[25-May-19 10:17 PM] TonyL#3577
`  "balance": 0.00000000,` you have to fund your notary wallet with some KMD

[25-May-19 10:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Then split UTXOs

[25-May-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395

Thank you to @Mylo  to let me his spot until he have more availability

[25-May-19 11:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
I assume that means adding the WIF to config does not import the address during deployment?

[25-May-19 11:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just imported it manually to KMD since it still had my funds from original notary node

typo is inside the error message, utxosplitter.sh works well for me

yeah i found the typo

[25-May-19 11:19 PM] phm87#7395
I think that komodo-cli should be copied somewhere (or create a symbolic link)

[25-May-19 11:21 PM] phm87#7395
