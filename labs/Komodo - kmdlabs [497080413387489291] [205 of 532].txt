If you could please have a look when you have a chance I can send it to Alright and Mylo after a final confirm from Blackjok3r.

[08-Jan-19 12:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Everyone else is welcome jum in too!

[08-Jan-19 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
@Bar_F1sh_Rel I have managed to get further along with Proxmox.  Just found a new guide on networking for the ubuntu install on VM.

[08-Jan-19 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
It looks like it will be very useful when I get it sorted out!

[08-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Ahhh the yaml file??

[08-Jan-19 12:38 PM] CrisF#3405
That will be coming soon.  Not looking forward to that.  I hate yam 🥝

[08-Jan-19 12:38 PM] CrisF#3405
(not a yam, but I hate kiwi too)

Received time just changing on current time - and I'm not rebroadcasting it actually

`len(labs-cli help | grep getimports) == 0`

[08-Jan-19 12:44 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is the rpc active?

[08-Jan-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It should be

[08-Jan-19 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
CFEKY komodod daemon is up on my node

[08-Jan-19 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
What is labs-cli and where can I find it?

{Reactions}
❓ 

[08-Jan-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Is the explorer just down or whats the problem?

[08-Jan-19 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all, good call works just cant see it in the help list

[08-Jan-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
My import transactions not confirming

[08-Jan-19 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there's a staked-cli which is less lines of code

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
On CFEKY

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
O don't know how to add them to the help list

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just renamed it and did it more verbosely

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

{Reactions}
😝 

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know its needed

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But some of them show and some dont

[08-Jan-19 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
labs-cli looks very nice.

[08-Jan-19 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the help could do with a revist. seems wirtten by many, and not so standardised

[08-Jan-19 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
big job tho

[08-Jan-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea about explorer I'm on phone, I used a known tx to get things to display, it something is wrong please document of so I can look at it tomorrow

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577
If you're about my issue it's not related to explorer - my imports on CFEXY not getting into the blocks anymore
Exports from CFEKX are fine

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh are u logging what step its failing on?

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not failing

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Just not confirming

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In the past only the very last step has failed

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So they are both being mined?

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Try mining them

[08-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That means that block has no imports, maybe the display. Needs some work

[08-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Let me k ow what u need

[08-Jan-19 12:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so imports [] yet to be implemented? once we have the json format?

[08-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No the block is just empty

[08-Jan-19 12:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
total is cumulative since genesis?

[08-Jan-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
It have no confirmations on blockchain (getrawtransaction 1 - return no confirmation filed at all)

[08-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So try mining them? I've seen this before

[08-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The mempool can break when u send too many dependant transactions at once

[08-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's why I spread my migrates over days of time

[08-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get around it you need to create raw tx with lots of utxo inputs

[08-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And don't let the daeomon choose for u with fund

[08-Jan-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Are notarizations happening? Is there a fork? Etc...

[08-Jan-19 12:55 PM] CrisF#3405
there are notarizations

[08-Jan-19 12:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep all imports presists in my mempool

[08-Jan-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like his txs are not propagating the mepool

[08-Jan-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He's needs to mine them into a block

[08-Jan-19 12:56 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm just afraid to mine on NN 😃

[08-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will be fine

{Reactions}
👌 trollface 🤞 3040_kingpeepo 

[08-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I only sat not to because u fills the wallet with utxo that iguana can't use

[08-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For short periods its ok

[08-Jan-19 12:57 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pool is up if that helps

[08-Jan-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U need to see if they r propagating it may be a problem

[08-Jan-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had a mempool the other day with 2000 txs and miner wasn't including them in blocks

[08-Jan-19 12:58 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
when I was stuck on 1211, mempool had a buttload of oracle creationtxs not procesing

[08-Jan-19 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577

[08-Jan-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Get some others to check and see of they r sending

[08-Jan-19 01:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I get 211 from that call

[08-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Are you sending multiple tx in a single step with this migrate?

[08-Jan-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Imports don't depend on anything so they should propagate

[08-Jan-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% on that tho

[08-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
You may be overloading the free transaction limit

[08-Jan-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's true!

[08-Jan-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Imports don't have a tz fee

[08-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh

[08-Jan-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Is there a limit per block or ?

[08-Jan-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe? We can remove that limitation

[08-Jan-19 01:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Only if you want the chain to be open to spam lock

[08-Jan-19 01:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Test chains

[08-Jan-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for imports only it will be ok

[08-Jan-19 01:02 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
True

[08-Jan-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be home soon can look

[08-Jan-19 01:07 PM] TonyL#3577

@Bar_F1sh_Rel ^^

[08-Jan-19 01:11 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool. Another couple hours at work.

[08-Jan-19 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
But imports seems stuck in mempool now 😃

[08-Jan-19 01:12 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I'm running on separate nodes that are mining - that might help me include some

[08-Jan-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh cool 👍

[08-Jan-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will have a look at the mining code in a while just got home, have visitors do before bed see if its easy fix

[08-Jan-19 01:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
i  just tried sending a few migrates on CFEKY, not going anywhere yet... Waiting for confirmations (1812 sec)

                    CAmount nValueIn = GetCoinImportValue(tx);
                    nTotalIn += nValueIn;

[08-Jan-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not the mining priority

[08-Jan-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly an issue though... 632 in mempool, set mining on, 8 threads... only chose 3 tx

[08-Jan-19 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
My mempool is reducing on 2-3 txs each block

[08-Jan-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep same... I found a limit in the code .. investigating

[08-Jan-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the best solution will be to just let imports have a tx fee... if thats not too hard.
