if make clean ever fails with bdb message, just ignore it and go on

[13-Jun-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@blackjok3r that chain I was asking about earlier also fails with the same `Account has insufficient funds` message using sendmany64.py 游땟

[13-Jun-19 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
hmm, LABS showing `0` balance for me.

[13-Jun-19 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
uh oh...

[13-Jun-19 03:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
Swept key?

[13-Jun-19 03:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Just happened in the last hour.

[13-Jun-19 03:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Explorer showing empty too?

[13-Jun-19 03:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Looking into it now...

[13-Jun-19 03:37 PM] jorian#4555
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 this is so weird: i set up blocknotify on 1 machine where it worked. the script works, and i moved it to another machine, where it simply. doesn't. work. I can execute the script manually, but it won't activate upon a new block. you have any ideas? 
```blocknotify=/home/me/LABSstaking/blocknotify.sh %s``` is how i set it up in conf

[13-Jun-19 03:37 PM] CrisF#3405
Balance on explorer..

[13-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Exile13#4458
@CrisF that's weird

[13-Jun-19 03:39 PM] CrisF#3405
daemon crashed

[13-Jun-19 03:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that address in the wallet?

[13-Jun-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@jorian did you set permissions on blocknotify.sh to +x on machine #2?

[13-Jun-19 03:40 PM] CrisF#3405
usually get an error in stats if that happens

[13-Jun-19 03:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[13-Jun-19 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[13-Jun-19 03:42 PM] CrisF#3405
It's running, but not responding.  0 connections blocks

[13-Jun-19 03:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
How often are others running the walletreset.sh?

[13-Jun-19 03:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@jorian wrong path or try putting the path in quotes may be ?

[13-Jun-19 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
I set `-reindex` but didn't reindex.

[13-Jun-19 03:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`Account has insufficient funds` I remember running into this once, after messing up with Python, but don't remember how I get rid of it.

[13-Jun-19 03:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
I do... run listaccounts

[13-Jun-19 03:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
youll see "" "true" and "false"

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
I setaccount "LABSADDRESS" MAIN

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
now the addy with funds is in account MAIN

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
edit script to not use "" account and use MAIN account

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`"": -20662.07664858`
dafuq?

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
exactly

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Exile13#4458
That's that negative interest

[13-Jun-19 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
I pointed this out weeks ago

[13-Jun-19 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
the import script we used...

[13-Jun-19 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Exile13 it's a new chain and there is no interest on assets

[13-Jun-19 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
importprivkey XXXXXX true or false at the end

[13-Jun-19 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
made that shit happen

[13-Jun-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@daemonfox I manually did the import and it was only 1 addy 游땟

[13-Jun-19 03:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
I also have not been able to get sendmany to work, wrong sytax, usng the same script that worked in STAKED

[13-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Exile13#4458
*bad joke*

[13-Jun-19 03:50 PM] CrisF#3405
`z_sendmany` worked for me earlier.

[13-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Exile13#4458
referring to QE (quantitative easing-tighening)

[13-Jun-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@daemonfox so how did you fix the borked wallet?

[13-Jun-19 04:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
i didnt...

[13-Jun-19 04:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
i stopped staking...

[13-Jun-19 04:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
only notary is running for me now

[13-Jun-19 04:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
But... I was trying to find a fix... since i grabbed some ZEXO and am trying to stake as well

[13-Jun-19 04:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
so I got a new set of addys and will give this all another go today

[13-Jun-19 04:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh that reminds me... question for @Alright  was the LABS in the Verus AGAMA supposed to work? Chain on 3 machines dies at 540 blocks in Native mode.

[13-Jun-19 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the "fix" seems to be
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAIN listaccounts
{
  "": -20518.07654858,
  "Mine": 49460.15574716
}
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAIN move "Mine" "" 49460.15574716
```
and then is will send 游뱡游낗

[13-Jun-19 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
not sure if it will bork again later or not, but that got it splitable

[13-Jun-19 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@siu - Chainmakers

[13-Jun-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
nice and easy ty

[13-Jun-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  so sendmany ius messing up the depreciated account feature?

[13-Jun-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the other way round

[13-Jun-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
accounts messed send up

[13-Jun-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I had some problem with sending funds on the hack day, cant remeber what ti was now, I tink I used z_sendmany to send it instead

[13-Jun-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe it was z_sendmany that i couldnt use...

[13-Jun-19 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
游땲

[13-Jun-19 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whatever it was I used z_mergetoaddress to send the funds out.

[13-Jun-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
even though `getbalance` was returning the proper amount related to addresses in RPC, it was internally the send was using the amount associated with the account

[13-Jun-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so it failed

[13-Jun-19 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok got it i'll see if I can see anything...

[13-Jun-19 04:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
The two things I noticed @blackjok3r  were 1. I used the same import scripts as day 1 STAKED, importprivkey KEYKEYKEY false through all 64 and then true. It works but instead of it reading false as dont rescan and true as rescan, it takes them as account names

[13-Jun-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
2. the regular sendmany worked fine STAKED day 1... today the syntax will not take 64 addresses in the same format

[13-Jun-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have not tried z_sendmany

[13-Jun-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
For 1, after running that import,, listaccounts shows a "" account, a "true" account and a "false" account

[13-Jun-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
For 2, I tried with quotes encapsulating the addresses. using the escape /, and without any of it. None work now.

[13-Jun-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sendmany needs some trailing 0, 
Thanks for the other one, I think I understand what your talking about.

[13-Jun-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup

[13-Jun-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
am I missing something or is the issue that`rpc_connection.importprivkey(i[2])` lacks 2 elements?

[13-Jun-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
I am staking LABS, it worked yesterday and I got 1 block with staking 游땏 but the komodod -ac_name=LABS daemon crashed several times without reason, I used KMDLabs/komodo repo (default branch) that I compiled few days ago. I'd like to have an error displayed to show because without details, this problem cannot be reproduced

[13-Jun-19 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it scrashing you need to run it in gdb and give me the backtrace.

[13-Jun-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
gdb ?

[13-Jun-19 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looking at this import priv key code and getting really confused...

[13-Jun-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand how it can do what hes saying it does at all... it sets the account there to "" for everything

[13-Jun-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even if you add something to it

[13-Jun-19 04:41 PM] phm87#7395
How to run it in gdb ?

[13-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how did you import the key @daemonfox

[13-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
manyally or with some script?

[13-Jun-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
manually pasted script

[13-Jun-19 04:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
My balance went from 2945 to  1645 in a few hours after importprivkey. Is it the same problem you have?

[13-Jun-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can you give me the exact command that does that?

[13-Jun-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_used pos64 TUI to import_

[13-Jun-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it seems importing the keys maybe is settting an account...

[13-Jun-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which are probaby broken

[13-Jun-19 04:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
```komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listaccounts
{
  "": 1645.99995000
}```

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS importprivkey KEYKEY false
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS importprivkey KEYKEY false
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS importprivkey KEYKEY true

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
but with all 64 address keys

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
so 63 false 1 true at the end

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can you do a -rescan and see id balance returns please? 
I know why it does this crap, buts is a pretty hard thing to fix, and wasnt that much of a problem in past was rare... maybe wiht more ppl staking its more of a problem.

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS importprivkey KEYKEY **""** true/false

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
in STAKED 1, that stopped or triggered the rescan

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you just usedthe wrong command

[13-Jun-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not going crazy

[13-Jun-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok gdb

[13-Jun-19 04:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok...

[13-Jun-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I think pos64 is borking it through the same issue
