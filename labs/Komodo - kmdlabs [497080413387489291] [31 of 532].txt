You know, on that topic. Chinese scientists aided two female mice to conceive, and the baby grew up normally. They also aided two male mice to conceive, and the baby died within a couple of hours.

Don't ask me how, it was in the news recently though

[13-Oct-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*the news is usually lies*

Ahhh, you're one of those people üòõ

[13-Oct-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Oct-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181

```Chinese scientists aided two female mice to conceive```
not into that animal stuff myself.

[13-Oct-18 01:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I don't mind a bit of scepticism when I read things. If I want to find out further detail or prove it wrong/right, i'll usually do what @Bitcoin Benny says and Do my own research!

yes

[13-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they cover the ground with it and set it on fire

[13-Oct-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then plant seeds in it

[13-Oct-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and some roundup to be sure

[13-Oct-18 01:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh you mean they use diesel to start a fire to get rid of the old wheat crops?

[13-Oct-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[13-Oct-18 01:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Doesn't seem like such a bad practice? I am sure there are much worse out there.

[13-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
suffice to say I stopped eating anything made of wheat a feew years ago

[13-Oct-18 01:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm sure there are much better ways of clearing old crops though

[13-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
*dont eat grains*

[13-Oct-18 01:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

[13-Oct-18 01:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Depends where you live with the house price

[13-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no one want to live here

[13-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Oct-18 01:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think syd/melb its up there. Bris its about 600-700k. and Perth it depends where you live too

[13-Oct-18 01:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Perth was high as fuck over the last 10 years, but its rapidly dropping

[13-Oct-18 01:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

Encrypted messaging?

[13-Oct-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181

So what is the theoretical use case behind blockchain chat?

[13-Oct-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ummmm what u say cant be reversed?

kind of annoying to go through each oracle, get every single oraclessamples then put them in the correct order
