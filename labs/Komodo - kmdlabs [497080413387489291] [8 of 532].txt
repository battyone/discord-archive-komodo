do you have the stdout printing kvupdates from the mempool?

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no mempool crashes the node with a segfault

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the data isnt there

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
until the TX confirms

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but this chain has liek 5-10s confirms

[08-Oct-18 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its very fast

[08-Oct-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have very poor cpus on it, needs more miners to be even faster

[08-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
anything needed from notaries?

[08-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
are you dpowing it?

[08-Oct-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just update them, was about to do yours but you can do it if you want to

[08-Oct-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just gitpull stakednotary and then start.sh should work just fine

[08-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Mylo#8306
i'll set up dpow, only need to config.ini it

[08-Oct-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo is you have funds you can try some messages:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDTROLL kvupdate <username> <"message in quotes"> <days> <password>`

[08-Oct-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a few seconds after sending the command the stdout should print you a chat message

[08-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
what branch for that chain?

[08-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Mylo#8306
`k-troll` is my executable !!! so insensitive!!

kvtroll ... assetchains.json does all that automatically now for ntoary node

[08-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
going to test it from another server

[08-Oct-18 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh yeah, notary is usless as it has no stdout be default

[08-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Mylo#8306
check stdout

[08-Oct-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its working just fine as far s aI can tell... should be notarising soon too, although it might need a freq of 1 instead of 5...

[08-Oct-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that opens up a lot of problems though, I really need to get suppress working. have no idea why it wasnt working before.

[08-Oct-18 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works on KMD mainnet just fine üòï

[08-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r is your seed node down

[08-Oct-18 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no its not

[08-Oct-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just sent another message from it

[08-Oct-18 04:15 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Oct-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might help

[08-Oct-18 04:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its working and mylo is connected

Makefile will reduce the number of these types of errors üòÉ

[08-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Mylo#8306
let me demonstrate

[08-Oct-18 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think for testing nodes, your makefile and docker stuff will be very helpful

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries work great the way they are, but having a good way to test multiple branches without having user errors will be required for sure.

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] Mylo#8306
can config.ini have comments?

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure...

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah typos are too easy

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User

[08-Oct-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wrote config.ini and the python code that does the dpowassets.py i just removed most of it.

[08-Oct-18 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so that it only did dpowassets

[08-Oct-18 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright your notary has no KMD left

[08-Oct-18 04:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not working lol

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] Alright#0419
feel like sending one? don't feel like syncing a node

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] Mylo#8306
ah you need a `.gitignore` file in your staked notary repo to ignore `config.ini` so it doesn't accidentally upload privkeys

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol I can do

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do that?

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] Mylo#8306
i'll fork and add my 2 sats worth of comments üòõ

[08-Oct-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ...

[08-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just made config_exampel.ini and have been very very careful

Figured out how to make notaries mine to ac_pubkey so all 0 vouts will go to that unused address. Once the chain is created aI made a script to send all funds to faucet. and then there is no more coin creation ever.

[08-Oct-18 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but having notaries mine will needlessly bloat the their wallets. It seems with 10 miners the block time will be a matter of seconds

[08-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Mylo#8306

Some things i need to find out is if i can have prompt support in a build system (unlikely) like `Type your message: ` and that can be passed into.   But because makefiles wouldn't normally be used in this way, it's a stupid use case for it.
For stuff like starting daemons it is useful.  update one makefile, tell ppl to pull it and run `make staked5` and it connects to the staked5 network without having to put -ac_name=STAKED5 -addnode=xx.xx.xx.xx -ac_reward=YYY etc.

[08-Oct-18 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah nice will look at that tomorrow

[08-Oct-18 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking just something like `./start.sh STAKEDTROLL` to start chains.

[08-Oct-18 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`./send <message>`

[08-Oct-18 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
set a config file with password and username and days that send uses

[08-Oct-18 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also noticed that if you keep sending really fast before it confirms with a password set it wont work either prints a nuch if hex out and sig-verify error

[08-Oct-18 09:37 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah for sending, bash script is much better.   start.sh much more easy for more ppl to understand than Makefile.   I'll keep makefile to myself for docker/vps workflow :P
thanks for your opinion üòÉ

Whether it's as usable/working as you expect, YMMV üòÉ

[09-Oct-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of @jspook16 I would really like to see how you got the messages out of the mempool though as this chain is pretty silly, to make it fast enough I had to make the chain have a block time of like 3-10s

[09-Oct-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or even faster, who knows what will happen if lots of people try and chat at once

[09-Oct-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is many reorgs

[09-Oct-18 12:52 AM] jspook16#3059
I look in the mempool and get the raw transaction for each new tx id. I jq for opreturn and get it from there. If you want to look at it let me. I still need to implement multiprocessing so that the message area and write area update cleanly

[09-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool, I think we have like a 4s confirm time here anyway and also I am pretty sure that you cannot submit 2 messages per block, so it might be that this implementation is the onle one that will work.

[09-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or possibly a combination of both

[09-Oct-18 01:06 AM] jspook16#3059
From mempool has like a half second delay. Maybe less

[09-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we ca use mempool to dispay message and still use fast blocks chain, so that you can send a new one, should be pretty easy to script a wait for confirm before you are able to send again.

[09-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to check this better later on today when i have some time.

[09-Oct-18 01:21 AM] jspook16#3059
Well I'm checking mempool regardless if it's a new block so everything updates real time. Multiple messages. I just don't process tx ids that were in mempool the previous process

[09-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no you cannot send a message protected by a password, unless the last mesage you sent was confirmed in a block\

[09-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At least it seems that way from what I have tried so far

[09-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
displaying them faster is definatly better

[09-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but also being able to send fast or at least reasonably fast seems a good idea too.

[09-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we might need a combination of both methods.

[09-Oct-18 01:33 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh a password protected kv. Ok I'm tracking. I think it might be able to be done. I will try that this coming up weekend hopefully.

[09-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its already there

[09-Oct-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just add a password to the end of the kvupdate command

[09-Oct-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this way once you use a key once (which I made the username) its proected by a password, so noone can impersonate you.

[09-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trick is to get on chain as fast as you can and just use your wanted name.

[09-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then its yours for the life of the chain, or you forget the password you used.

[09-Oct-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also made a bunch of other changes that made the chat chain actaully viable, displaying messages faster from mempool, is a wanted extra to keep up the good work

[09-Oct-18 01:36 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh I see. Good idea

[09-Oct-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, I think using no password was a lot easier to get working, wasted nearly an entire day on this yesterday to get passoword KV working

[09-Oct-18 01:42 AM] jspook16#3059
No password was easy. I didn't even think password worked for kv.

[09-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah apparently it does, its just that the print for stdout was in the wrong place in the code... once I figured out where the appropraite data was actually avalible and moved it there it works fine.

[09-Oct-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took about 3-4h of trial and error and getting very mad at it üòÇ

[09-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it will affect your method of getting message from mempool, because its only used to send the message it doesn't encrypt it or  anything

[09-Oct-18 02:47 AM] jspook16#3059
Ok I'll keep at it and keep you updated

[09-Oct-18 02:48 AM] jspook16#3059
Also I got me a c++ bible so I'll be hacking at that as well

[09-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha, I dont use any books ... just trial and error and copy code from other places that loks like it will do what I want üòÇ

[09-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or google, statkexchange.com is very fast results too a lot of the time.

[09-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think to actually write CC's though I am going to need to read a C or C++ book at some point üò¶
