haha no worries

[06-Feb-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
First 2 months:    
    18 notaries do more than the threshold, 2 do under
    1 of these people was in hosptial, notaries vote to remove the other one.
    2 notaries are added. 

2nd 2 months:
    there are now 21 notries
    none of them fall under the threshold
    2 notries are added

3rd 2 months:
    there are now 23 notaries

[06-Feb-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this continues until we get to 64

[06-Feb-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at 64 ... only bottom notries are neede to be replaced.

[06-Feb-19 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the vote from what genie came up with is not by stake holders

[06-Feb-19 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because that make us only add our friends

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
what is the problem with 75 25 lottery once we reach 64?

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how to you determine that a person running i not running as multiple ppl with a lottery

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
my greatest fear is that we will end up with the same people running NNs ad infinitum with new comers thinking they have 0 chance of getting a spot

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I jut make 100 nodes and run for lttery I win

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who cares

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
how do you determine someone running for election is not a sock puppet?

[06-Feb-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire reasoning here is theat we need to have trustworthy notaries

[06-Feb-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are doing a good job, and making money

[06-Feb-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then they stay

[06-Feb-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are not making money they leave and the totla will decrese so the others are making money

[06-Feb-19 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`how do you determine someone running for election is not a sock puppet?` 
you dont... everyone does

[06-Feb-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
a group of bad acting notaries can easily negatively impact a single notaries counts by refusing to notarize with them

[06-Feb-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
then oust them in the next cycle

[06-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no they cant

[06-Feb-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
why not?

[06-Feb-19 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because its randomly chosen

[06-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§∑

[06-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
and if they just block IP or remove pubkey from json?

[06-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing that can happen is one notary can be bad by submitting incorrect sigs ... which an be coded around

[06-Feb-19 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the pubkey array differs then they will have wrong senderind

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
put a dummy pubkey

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so hash the array?

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this isnt a problem with anything we said

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
and if they just block IP?

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a problem all the time

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
it makes it easier for a group of notaries to oust an OP

[06-Feb-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why would they do that?

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they can do this anyway

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
to control more of the network

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no matter what method you uise

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant be prvented

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this only works with lots of notaries...

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] gt#2812
what about having a vote to see who gets to stay as low performing notary nodes (if say they contribute in other ways) and then have the other spots be a lotery

[06-Feb-19 03:34 AM] gt#2812
then its harder to conspire

[06-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how it was...

[06-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
low preforming then need a vote to be removed

[06-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when get to 64 then more need vote

[06-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if ppl want to still join

[06-Feb-19 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
ok let me explain what I thought we had agreed on. Please point out pros and cons of the two proposal.

We have a stake holder vote every 2 months. There are 5 options.
remove 2 notaries
remove 1 notary
no change
add 1 notary
add 2 notaries

This vote then determines how many spots are left to the lottery(which requires showing you're capable of notarizing before being entered into lottery)

[06-Feb-19 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
what exactly was the problem with this?

[06-Feb-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ask genie

[06-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[06-Feb-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think your saying the same thing as us... because teh vote was still supped to randomly choose the winners of the vote

[06-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
so we start with 20, after 2 months stakeholder vote determines we will add 1. 15 top performing notaries keep their spot. 5 bottom performing have the opportunity to enter the lottery along with any new comers. We would then have 6 spots that would be determined by the lottery

[06-Feb-19 03:40 AM] gt#2812
con would be that the number of notaries would always be in flux vs a "static" 64 as a goal

[06-Feb-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
or

we start with 20, after 2 months stakeholder vote determines we will remove 1. 15 top performing notaries keep their spot. 5 bottom performing have the opportunity to enter the lottery along with any new comers. We would then have 4 spots that would be determined by the lottery

[06-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
static 64 sint exactly goal

[06-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just the limit

[06-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the fgoal is that all notaries do a good job based on the amount of money they have avalible

[06-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is less money avalible.. then ther needs to be less notaries

[06-Feb-19 03:41 AM] gt#2812
to me triggering an election every 2 months for 5 spots sounds like a lot of moving parts for the beginning

[06-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed

[06-Feb-19 03:42 AM] gt#2812
new comers might focus of election logistics rather than the coin operation

[06-Feb-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
it would be centralized in implementing it, but publicly verifiable and provably fair

[06-Feb-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
a VOTE chain is not much work at all

[06-Feb-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we come back to the same shit tho

[06-Feb-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a stake holder (notaries) might nto vote to add more if they make less money

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you make it so that 2 are always added

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless osmone preformbs badly...

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or voluntarily leaves

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then they can tdecide to limit the number of notaries at any time

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until it gets to 64 ... by that tim eit should be someone elses problem :troll:

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] Alright#0419
what incentivize do notaries have to add more spots?

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] Alright#0419
"I want to make less money"

[06-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they simply have to

[06-Feb-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§∑

[06-Feb-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it increased in number until notaries start to not be able to survive

[06-Feb-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and drop out

[06-Feb-19 03:44 AM] gt#2812
as genie said, it's possibly in their best interest in the long run to have more people involved as it spreads out reach and adoption

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... that, but making them vote to increse is flawed...

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just make iit so they have to increase

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
Do you see KMD notaries encouraging others to run for election?

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
against their best interests

[06-Feb-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really.... but if you just do what I said.. then it doens matter

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
we can't assume that notaries interests will always align with LABS interests

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ppl droped out of KMD ntoary spot last year

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ppl will drop out if they cant make money/ have other thigns to do thats more important to them

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is always 2 spots avalibe

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if nonoe drops out

[06-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the number increases

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
I don't have a problem other than `After this stage, when we get to 64 (if we get there) we use a yearly election same as KMD.`

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
we need active notary involvement on a monthly basis for bounty payouts

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well that was more a what if... not a forgon conclusion

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the bountie cant invlove all 64 notaris

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
multi sig is capped at 15

[06-Feb-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the bounties would be the very top 15 notaris

[06-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
I expect we will have a different mechanism for them once we reach 64

[06-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
waaayyyy before that hopefully

[06-Feb-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
so we have 2 open spots every 2 months

[06-Feb-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
who determines who gets these spots

[06-Feb-19 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
stakeholders or notaries? lottery?

[06-Feb-19 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coimbination

[06-Feb-19 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
how?
