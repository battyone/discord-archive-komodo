All my wealth :treasure:

[01-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we chould make a decent premine on the staked test main chain, and just fund all notaries 1like 100k or something

[01-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we can test whatever we want without running out of coins

[01-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Alright#0419
large BR?

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want, im not going to mine or stake, only tresting migrates .. id like a nice premine to save time

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] Alright#0419
ac_reward=10000000000000

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] Alright#0419
I'll do 100k BR

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool one block will be wnough

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
waiting on merge and I'll start the chains

[01-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
oh I'll work on assetchains.json for time being

[01-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
Who wants a chain?

[01-Nov-18 05:34 AM] CrisF#3405
?

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
want your own chain for testing?

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
Ah forget it

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
we'll have to test adding new chains again anyway

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
do it then

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
we need to have notary check burn txids and such before notarizing

[01-Nov-18 05:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Be good to test adding later too.

[01-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just makeing sure ac_address branch compiles then will merge it in...

[01-Nov-18 05:37 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and we can test changing them later

[01-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make it so it stays on ERA1

[01-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until we need to change it

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
We should test at least one era change before mainnet launch

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
I know we have already, but still...

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
lots has happened since

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to do it with a pubkey change

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
Did you speak with duke about what he was trying to add for 3rd party coins?

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already did that ... all he did was move it to a seperate file, which I did early on

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was the ahrdest aprt üòÇ

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Alright#0419
yea but the way he made it sound was that it was a file we can just drop in and rebuild

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Alright#0419
I guess we're already doing that

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Alright#0419
just editing the file

[01-Nov-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ours is liek that already... we can pull 2 or 3 files from and oracle and then rebuild if we wanted to

[01-Nov-18 05:40 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant last chance to change your pubkey for the definitive testnet is in about ~15 minutes

[01-Nov-18 05:40 AM] Alright#0419
if you leaked your key or need to change it for any reason, we need to know now

Taking anyone who shows they're competent enough for a spot up until mainnet

[01-Nov-18 05:42 AM] gt#2812

[01-Nov-18 05:42 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 05:43 AM] Alright#0419

lol

[01-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Alright#0419
we need "ticker" for these test chains. Don't want to make them STKD/STAKED

[01-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Alright#0419
any suggestions?

[01-Nov-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do we want to merge in the mempool fix from DICE?

[01-Nov-18 05:47 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[01-Nov-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok im testing it on KMDICE atm now the pool is update and it seems ok ... I might hold off on it and just merge it to a single chain

[01-Nov-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just incase it has issues

[01-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
Oh yea joker

[01-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
do separate branch

[01-Nov-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we cna just kill the 1 chains

[01-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
and I'll put one of the 0 BR chains on it

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01-Nov-18 05:49 AM] Alright#0419

[01-Nov-18 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what am I setting freq to for each

[01-Nov-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5 for all chains, 10 for one

[01-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
I need you to change that +1 sat thing

[01-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
if we out right change it we'll lose ability to sync KMD

[01-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Alright#0419
10 for the main one?

[01-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so for is_STAKED = true then +1 sat is disabled ?

[01-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5 for main

[01-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
10 for one of the o BR

[01-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and anothe of the 0 BR will have mempool fix

[01-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Alright#0419
I need to ask jl about why exactly that is there, but I'd like it removed if it's just for backwards compatibility

[01-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now id rather not touch things I didnt amke, becasuse i dont know what they are lol

[01-Nov-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are already adding a heap of shit at once, and knowing why its broken, if it is , will be hard enough

[01-Nov-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  what exacly is in bj branch that you needed pushed to master ?

[01-Nov-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Nov-18 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Nov-18 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
I was just asking if there was anything

[01-Nov-18 05:59 AM] Alright#0419
the main chain will be on master, so figured it was a good time for a merge

[01-Nov-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actually it merges ok now ... and it has dpowconfs

[01-Nov-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will merge it to master

[01-Nov-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will be useful for a few things I think.

[01-Nov-18 06:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Name: Universe?  UNI?

[01-Nov-18 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
master has everything and blackjok3r branch  = master, going to merge the mempool fix to blackjok3r branch

[01-Nov-18 06:03 AM] Alright#0419
üëå going to start chains on master after rebuild

[01-Nov-18 06:05 AM] Alright#0419
oh shit, what are we doing instead of STKD/STAKED

[01-Nov-18 06:05 AM] Alright#0419
CFCK?

[01-Nov-18 06:06 AM] Alright#0419
CFEK?

[01-Nov-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
CFEK it is ü§∑

[01-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
`if ( (strncmp(chain_name, "STKD", 4) == 0) || (strncmp(chain_name, "CFEK", 4) == 0) || (strncmp(chain_name, "STAKED", 6) == 0) )`? @blackjok3r

[01-Nov-18 06:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so, its just in is _STAKED function, its only claled there/... to check you can search project for STKD

[01-Nov-18 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
that's the only place STKD is
