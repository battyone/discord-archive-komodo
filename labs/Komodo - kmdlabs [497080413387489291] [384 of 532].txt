hope its a one liner install

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
kind of is, but it'll require some debugging now and then

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] phm87#7395
I have few technical articles explaining dpow, do you have some to suggest @Alright  ?

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Anthony#6143
Do they docker it, or what?

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Anthony#6143
Or source  and conf

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
I think he understands the concept of dpow well enough

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
he's more interested in the implementation and running of it

[19-May-19 10:12 PM] Anthony#6143
I know dpow

[19-May-19 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
no docker containers

[19-May-19 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
a project for down the road, we have quite a few people who know it well

[19-May-19 10:14 PM] Anthony#6143
I dont like containers but I really like Dockerfile

I created a Dockerfile for CHIPS, I may create one for iguana if it doesn't exist yet

[19-May-19 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
@Anthony I don't understand your aversion to komodo codebase ðŸ˜­

[19-May-19 10:18 PM] phm87#7395
komodo have a Dockerfile on its github

[19-May-19 10:24 PM] Alright#0419
I think iguana had one set up at one point, not sure it's still used though

[19-May-19 10:25 PM] Alright#0419
how is CHIPS going btw? Haven't really been following it that closely

[19-May-19 10:29 PM] Anthony#6143

[19-May-19 10:30 PM] Anthony#6143
says i need the slickrick module

[19-May-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
STAKED was the original name of the project, there's a lot of references to that name in the code

[19-May-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3 libgnutls28-dev libssl-dev python3-pip

pip3 install setuptools wheel base58 slick-bitcoinrpc requests python-bitcoinlib
```

[19-May-19 10:32 PM] Anthony#6143

Ok register then join?

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
do you have the TUI up?

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
you need a balance first

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Anthony#6143
Yes

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Anthony#6143
What

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Anthony#6143
always something

[19-May-19 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
you can either do `setgenerate true 4` or post an address here and I'll send

looks like it took the vps out

[19-May-19 10:38 PM] Anthony#6143
I shoulda picked 5$ instead of 2.5$

[19-May-19 10:39 PM] Alright#0419
min specs are like 8gb 4 core, you can get by with 4gb with a bunch of swap space though

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Anthony#6143
its still running, was my internet

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
actual minimum is probably like 2 core 4gb with swap

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
but that's asking for problems

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Anthony#6143
We never ran rpc

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[19-May-19 10:40 PM] Anthony#6143
to use komodo-cli to import that address

[19-May-19 10:41 PM] Anthony#6143
or validate it, to see if it is in the wallet

[19-May-19 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
"we"?

[19-May-19 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
confused man, just use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC validateaddress <address>` to verify it owns the key for it

[19-May-19 10:41 PM] Anthony#6143
thats the trick.

[19-May-19 10:42 PM] Anthony#6143
-ac_name

[19-May-19 10:42 PM] Anthony#6143
without ac_name it defaults to komodo and not the asset chain

[19-May-19 10:43 PM] Anthony#6143
My balance is 10000

[19-May-19 10:43 PM] Anthony#6143
Success! Please wait for 9ca9ed39434efc37339c0749b0391f66d0071edb78c64e83fcb95686ed1e0f66 to be confirmed.

Blocktime is quite long? or is it until a certain parameter is met

[19-May-19 10:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it's long yes, 1800s

[19-May-19 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
it's not actually, it's 1 minute

[19-May-19 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
when i made it I wasn't aware that ac_blocktime wouldn't work with ac_algo=verushash11

[19-May-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
going to start a new chain after launch that is 30 minute blocks

[19-May-19 10:51 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, really dropped the ball on that ðŸ˜‚

[19-May-19 10:52 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lol

[19-May-19 10:52 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that explain why I actually felt the block time is much shorter than 1800s when I was mining on it

[19-May-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
just do `Join Lottery` option if the register tx confirmed

[19-May-19 10:58 PM] Anthony#6143
I did and it says I must register

[19-May-19 10:58 PM] Anthony#6143
so perhaps this sync isnt complete

[19-May-19 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
registering again won't hurt

The gettransaction of the txid shows a confirmation but it saying otherwise

[19-May-19 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
yea not sure, I can push some debug prints right now if you have a minute to debug it

[19-May-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise just register again and do Join lottery

[19-May-19 11:00 PM] Anthony#6143
So I got 7 raw confirmations, this is some PoS thing I assume

[19-May-19 11:00 PM] Anthony#6143
then we have 1 confirmation which has been 1 for more than a few minutes

[19-May-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
dpow thing

we tricked the CEXs into using dpow confs ðŸ˜‚

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
so like if their software says wait until `confirmations > 10` for example

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Anthony#6143
"rawconfirmations": 9,
  "confirmations": 9,

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
it will never be >10 unless it's notarized

yea there, it was notarized

CFEKORC

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Anthony#6143
the txid has 9 confirms and its saying otherwise

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Anthony#6143
this is a new register

[19-May-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
yea that's a bug, got a minute if I add some debug prints?

[19-May-19 11:02 PM] Anthony#6143
might as well just give you my desktop

[19-May-19 11:02 PM] Anthony#6143
I registered again
