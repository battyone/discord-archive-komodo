@jl777c  would that work?

[17-Jan-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe use the ratify mechanism?

[17-Jan-19 05:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blackboox does it alrady do that ?

[17-Jan-19 05:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found it very hard to follow and as it wansnt used didnt look much into it

[17-Jan-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, at 90000 it does, but i think notarizer doesnt support it anymore

[17-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe it does

[17-Jan-19 05:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its there.. I removed it in some fork of mine but I ended up reveting it

[17-Jan-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have to do a bunch of stuff, it might be easier to just ressurect ratification as it used to work

[17-Jan-19 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it used to work why dont we use it?

[17-Jan-19 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did you forget how it works :trollface:

[17-Jan-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it was too hard to get enough notaries to participate in time

[17-Jan-19 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh makessense

[17-Jan-19 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that can be solved by making that transacrtion the one that pays all notaries

[17-Jan-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
thats good idea. new slate gets elected and paid in the same tx

[17-Jan-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind this is pre-KMD mainnet code. i decided to use the hardcode method by then. maybe there are some issues

[17-Jan-19 05:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are no doubt issues... But its at least a start ... I find fixing existing code a bit better than writeing my own most of the time.

[17-Jan-19 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we willl launch with multisig as planned... mayube first CFEK on mainnet tries to fix ratification?

[17-Jan-19 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will you put up a bounty?

[17-Jan-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810

the early days of ratification.... i remember.

[17-Jan-19 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
though i wasn't particiapating on that time

[17-Jan-19 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
just been keeping an eye in slack

[17-Jan-19 06:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to me it seems like something needed

[17-Jan-19 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
we needed everyone to start

[17-Jan-19 06:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think to test it on CFEK we would use like 3 keys

[17-Jan-19 06:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once that works we can advance to LABST2 and use 5

[17-Jan-19 06:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the amount of keys seems quite irrelevent as long as the code is in loops like this:
```int32_t STAKED_era(int timestamp)
{
    int8_t era = 0;
    if (timestamp <= STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP[0])
        return(1);
    for (int32_t i = 1; i < NUM_STAKED_ERAS; i++)
    {
        if (timestamp <= STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP[i] && timestamp >= (STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP[i-1] + STAKED_ERA_GAP))
            return(i+1);
    }
  // if we are in a gap, return era 0, this allows to invalidate notarizations when in GAP.
  return(0);
};```

[17-Jan-19 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[18-Jan-19 12:32 AM] Mylo#8306
ah bugger.   it's the worst way to win, but a win's a win.   my kmdlabs box is up, not sure what it's doing atm, but happy to be injected into whatever is happening.   for proposal, i won't run for NN for labs because i have enough stuff going on with pioneers on the side, but happy to be tech support for any elected NNs or through testnet etc.

To the people putting up money for notarization tx fee cost, I think we already have it covered. If you would still like to donate to the dev fund for things like CEX listings or contests, this would be much appreciated.

[18-Jan-19 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
Joker and I have some funds set aside as our "dev fund". We can make this a multisig and make it public

[18-Jan-19 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy no worries, just don't forget about us!

[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Always lurking trying not to get so behind that it is impossible to catch up.

Streaming a website would be killer

[18-Jan-19 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
we could make a website that is just a dapp showing data from on chain, meaning the webserver could be hosted by multiple people or by yourself

@blackjok3r wouldn't these non-fungible chains be best suited for CFEK cluster?

[18-Jan-19 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand purpose of these LAB chains as opposed to LABS chains

[18-Jan-19 02:21 AM] Mylo#8306
so can i start a chain that is notarized to KMD via KMDLABS?

[18-Jan-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[18-Jan-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
if not, there's a bug

[18-Jan-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
everything was left backwards compatible and joker merges latest updates in pretty quickly

[18-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Mylo#8306
got a HOWTO integrate?   i'll start a chain next week for CAKESHOP dev demos etc.

[18-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
how to integrate what?

[18-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
I thought you meant will stakedchain/komodo sync normal asset chains

[18-Jan-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
if that's the question, the answer is yes

[18-Jan-19 02:27 AM] Mylo#8306
nah if i start a chain for developers to test on (CAKESHOP) i'd like it secured to BTC via KMDLABS if that's what you're building.

[18-Jan-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
That I'm not sure of

[18-Jan-19 02:27 AM] Alright#0419
personally, I'd like to keep our notary network exclusive to LABS chains

[18-Jan-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
encourage people to join the cluster with their idea rather than creating their own coin

[18-Jan-19 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright There were 2 people at the end. @Mylo and @jusoaresf . Not sure if one of them made a  notarization.

[18-Jan-19 02:29 AM] Alright#0419
I will check LAMEDUCKS chain when I get a chance

[18-Jan-19 02:29 AM] Alright#0419
90% sure mylo was the 21st to notarize

[18-Jan-19 02:30 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah you better check, i thought my nodes didn't notarize tbh

[18-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Mylo#8306
if juso is keen, he can take it no dramas.

[18-Jan-19 02:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I didn't hear anything after the time limit passed.

[18-Jan-19 02:32 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright would 21 bump up the number of sigs required ?

[18-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
kmdkrazy dropped out, so we're at 19

[18-Jan-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
I'm really not sure I understand joker's proposed tiered system

[18-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think it's a problem to allow broken contracts on mainnet as you can simply not use them if you choose

[18-Jan-19 02:35 AM] Alright#0419
and if you do break them, you can make a bounty claim

[18-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
so the way I imagine it, CFEK cluster would be first stop for brand new code. We knock out all the easy bugs then just throw it into production on LABS cluster

[18-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
if you find a bug at that point, you deserve a bounty

[18-Jan-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419

a question... multisig x faucet...
Would it be possible to build a merit-pay faucet instead of flat-pay?
An Excalibur like faucet only the elected could withdraw from and only for an amount for their recent deeds (notarization #)?

[18-Jan-19 08:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Interesting idea.  I wonder too.

[18-Jan-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I wanted to make that... But I havent really been able to work out how to enforce it properly.

[18-Jan-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
some of my ramblings from convo with joker
```
AlrightToday at 10:16 AM
so the way I see it at least
dev makes a contract, PRs to stakedchain/komodo, starts a CFEK chain
we do simple tests on it, like get all the easy bugs out of the way
then they are free to start a LAB/LABS chain with it
people can use it if they like, but should understand that it could be risky for their coins either by malicious code or broken code
people can also submit bug bounty claims if they can show a reproducible issue
I think bug bounty should only be paid once fixed
so the tester would have to work with the dev to fix it before they receive anything
that way if dev abandons it, we aren't making coins for bug fixes in their abandoned contract
also maybe time locks for the bounty
so if it's a significant amount of LABS, it doesn't get dumped immediately

```

dev puts escrow.   tester reports bug.   it gets accepted, a portion of escrow coins gets paid to tester once accepted.   when bug is fixed.   coins rewarded.

[18-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Mylo#8306
coins in escrow held for 1 month.  when testing done, dev gets coins back.  no bugs, no cost.   bugs, small rewards from dev, bigger rewards from labs.

@Alright `bug bounty should only be paid once fixed

What do you think of a smaller bounty for finding and a larger for helping to fix?  (not necessarily the same person) That might attract more testers by lowering the requirements to participate.
