we really need a way for people to see where they  rank... but this is mor for me about getting a chain up in each stage of development, so I cna sync them all to make sure adding new features hasnt beoken anything. I will hopefully have some proper scripts working today.

@LabsAssistant  @PHBA2061  @Strob  
OK I got something up for you guys to play a bit easier. 
I hope these scripts make it easier to know what the goal is. Remeber that someone must actually do `paymentsrelease` for teh airdropp to happen, its is not automatic. ;)
Latest master is working with these scripts for me. I think if 2-3 more people actaully join in, I will make the cut off for the 10K LABS coin, prize in 4 days from now.. If people dont join I may extend this longer until they do. Buit leaving it will only lose you possible coins to win.

There is some notes in teh README.md on what this script does. As always PR welcome... I just tried to get something that works up that you guys can build ontop of.

Good stuff! üï∫

[06-May-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that it will make more sense once you run the ranking script . Basicallyt the goal is to get as many address as you can into the middle of the rich list...

[06-May-19 09:20 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I broke mine - tried wallet reset and now can't split

[06-May-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... you tried to merge them back to a single address and it didnt work?

[06-May-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This game would not matter I think even if wallet.dat was multiple GB... Its not using the wallet, for anything except the split tx.

[06-May-19 09:22 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
this is a fresh vm for the game

[06-May-19 09:22 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ran walletreset for a single utxo

[06-May-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by leaving the wallet, just sending the balance back to your starting address before the last snapshot should be qwuite easy

[06-May-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just -rescan

[06-May-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I ahve thaught about this yes... not a hard change to make... For the game it seems not importnat though, because the person with the most address in the range is incentivsed already to release as many coins as they can before someone else, releases a small amount, locking the rest until the next snapshot

[06-May-19 09:26 AM] CrisF#3405
`komodo-cli CFEKPAY sendtoaddress <ADDRESS> (komodo-cli  -ac_name=CFEKPAY getbalance) "" "" true` worked well to merge my PAY, @Bar_F1sh_Rel .
