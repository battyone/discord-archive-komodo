@phm87 
`sudo apt-get install gdb`
`gdb --args ./komodod -ac_namee=LABS .....`
when loaded type `run`

[13-Jun-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
thank you blackjok3r

[13-Jun-19 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when it crashes, type `backtrace` and then post the output to pastebin and send it to me.

[13-Jun-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only 1 'e' though :troll:

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thats the proper syntax?

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
ty

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes and you can also add a block heigth as a 4th param

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to start the rescan from

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added that, and was wondering if somehoe it broke things

[13-Jun-19 04:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope just needed to know the syntax changes

[13-Jun-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
didn't we have this same "" issue with mm/iguana creation when we 1st started? 🤔

[13-Jun-19 04:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
that one seems straight forward why

[13-Jun-19 04:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
the sendmany has been driving me nuts

[13-Jun-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@zatJUM  
I'm pretty sure I know what happened there, it happens when the chain reorgs, atm, the code just deletes  the staking tx from the wallet, I think I know a way to fix it, but we need to put up with it for a bit, may need to rescan the wallet ever few days if its "losing: lots of funds.

[13-Jun-19 04:49 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[13-Jun-19 04:50 PM] zatJUM#9924
Next problem: no iguana connections 😦

[13-Jun-19 04:51 PM] zatJUM#9924
I let it run a few hours, but still no connections. I just pkill'ed it and reran. Let's see

[13-Jun-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
How do you check that there is no iguana connections ? (I wonder why my KMDLabs NN setup doesn't work since beginning, maybe I did sth wrong)

[13-Jun-19 04:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq '[.[] | select(.bestk > 0)] | . |length'```

[13-Jun-19 04:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
I added it on stats 😉

[13-Jun-19 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ip address?

[13-Jun-19 05:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
your bestk value might stick with  -1 up to 3-4 hours after launching iguana

[13-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
it's as if there exist 2 entirely different bash versions

[13-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
i basically have to rewrite my script

[13-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
🤷

[13-Jun-19 05:33 PM] jorian#4555
i should make this in a proper language

[13-Jun-19 05:40 PM] cipi#4502
`/bin/sh` != `/bin/bash`

[13-Jun-19 05:47 PM] jorian#4555
my scripts start with `#!/bin/bash`

[13-Jun-19 05:48 PM] jorian#4555
different `eval` behaviour, different `$()` behaviour

[13-Jun-19 05:48 PM] jorian#4555
i'm a bash noob though, but that felt really weird

[13-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jorian#4555
i use absolute path

[13-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jorian#4555
the script now works

[13-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jorian#4555
but the behaviour of the same script on 2 machines is completely different

[13-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jorian#4555
aka: doesn't work on 1, but does work on the other

[13-Jun-19 05:51 PM] jorian#4555
maybe bash versions are different?

[13-Jun-19 05:52 PM] cipi#4502
strange stuff 😃

[13-Jun-19 07:30 PM] blubbi#0643
WTS a good bunch of LABS

[13-Jun-19 07:33 PM] jorian#4555
price?

[13-Jun-19 07:36 PM] jorian#4555
or use barterlly

[13-Jun-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a good bunch ` to guyA = 200; to guyB = 50k 🤷🏽

[13-Jun-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blubbi how much are you selling and what do you want for them?

[13-Jun-19 08:02 PM] blubbi#0643
11k

[13-Jun-19 08:03 PM] blubbi#0643
0,15 kmd

[13-Jun-19 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
11k LABS for 0.15 KMD total, I'll take that deal

[13-Jun-19 08:05 PM] blubbi#0643
👏

[13-Jun-19 08:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
0.15 KMD `total` ? 😂

[13-Jun-19 08:26 PM] jorian#4555
i will pay 777 kmd

[13-Jun-19 08:36 PM] phm87#7395
I will pay also 15 KMD. I bought some LABS on graviex but the spread was soooo huge and nearly no liquidity (I felt sad)

[13-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jorian#4555
that's the effect of staking. you need LABS to make more LABS

[13-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jorian#4555
much less selling power

[13-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jorian#4555
in comparison to PoW

[13-Jun-19 08:39 PM] phm87#7395
some exchanges require a min trading volume. CMC also I heard

[13-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jorian#4555
do we want LABS to be on cmc?

[13-Jun-19 08:41 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know. I don't like CMC but many ppl like CMC

[13-Jun-19 09:04 PM] zatJUM#9924
When iguana starts, I have lots of ```curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7776: Connection refused```
I was used to `pkill -9 iguana` and `./start_iguana.sh`, but it doesn't work anymore.
Iguana port hasn't changed?

[13-Jun-19 09:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no, the rpc port is always 7776

[13-Jun-19 09:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
RPC is ok, but P2P?

[13-Jun-19 09:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
9333 is the p2p port

[13-Jun-19 09:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
I've restarted like 20 times and on the 21rst it works 🤔

[13-Jun-19 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do we want LABS to be on cmc?`
is cmc forevermore going to be lemming central?

[13-Jun-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if so, then "yes"

[13-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
be careful with eval

[13-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
kills while

[13-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000

`komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS lockunspent true $(komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listlockunspent | jq -c .)` might help some with insufficient funds error on pos64staker script

[13-Jun-19 11:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
unlocks everything, I need to use sometimes when running utxosplitter

[13-Jun-19 11:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
for sendmany64.py, I tweaked to consolidate to "default" account first, which also fixed insufficient funds error

@daemonfox is LABS in Verus's Agama? Had no idea

[14-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Alright#0419
if it stops at 540, it just means we need to update the code to the daemon

@AkiraX sounds like a corrupted chain

[14-Jun-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
is it showing that in getinfo?

[14-Jun-19 02:41 AM] AkiraX#8269
No. Just to run komodod

[14-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
that is a corrupted chain or hardware error I believe

[14-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
I need info as to how you ended up in that situation, what it is you're trying to do

[14-Jun-19 03:32 AM] AkiraX#8269
