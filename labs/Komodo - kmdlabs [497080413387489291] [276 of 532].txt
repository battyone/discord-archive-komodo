[06-Feb-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to get them off him and put it into somethign that makes sense tomorrow.. and make a Git issue for it so we dont lose everything

[06-Feb-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are a couple of known bugs, I will fix with these chains, I think both of them are related and shouldnt be too hard to do.

maybe a stupid question, but how do i do migrates?

[06-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
start two chains that are fungible, have some coins on one and run this

@blackjok3r do you know where this^ pulls assetchains.json from?

[06-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
is it still using the one at KMDLabs/staked

[06-Feb-19 10:38 AM] gt#2812
updated

[06-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
oh derp a ctrl+F answered that immediately

[06-Feb-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian you'll need assetchains.json at ~/StakedNotary/assetchains.json as well

[06-Feb-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
ty ty @gt

[06-Feb-19 10:39 AM] gt#2812
will run some migrations in a bit

[06-Feb-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
STAKED4 was airdropped to LABST2 if you need coins

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, not sure you had STAKED4, just try to mine some or message me

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
so i create 2 chains and test migration myself?

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
i have some

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
you need to use these chains

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
i think ðŸ˜‚

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
ah ok

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
i wondered

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
or create your own NN network :troll:

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
yeah, that sounds about right ðŸ˜›

[06-Feb-19 10:40 AM] gt#2812
so many layers of coins haha

[06-Feb-19 10:41 AM] jorian#4555
well yes, it confuses a bit

[06-Feb-19 10:41 AM] gt#2812
i have some staked4

[06-Feb-19 10:41 AM] Alright#0419
we've likely gone through 200 chains by now ðŸ˜‚

[06-Feb-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easliy

[06-Feb-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 2 VM that still has them all... but havent used it for the last 10 or so... it had about 30+ from STAKED1 onwards

[06-Feb-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably delted a few over time to free space though

[06-Feb-19 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not counting the 50 chains ive started here when trying to get VerusHash working

[06-Feb-19 10:43 AM] jorian#4555
no LABST2 here

[06-Feb-19 10:43 AM] jorian#4555
someone sent 5 though

[06-Feb-19 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5 would be for notary... you can migrate onnotary btw, just use the notary address.

[06-Feb-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and dont migrate all of your utxos ðŸ˜‰

[06-Feb-19 10:45 AM] jorian#4555
@Alright i think i imported my staked4 keys, but no funds appear. you sure it was labst2?

[06-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
ðŸ¤” let me check

[06-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
took a few times to start it, may have messed something up

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will fix migrate script now if Alright didnt do it yet... changing the orgiisation name had some unintended concequences with the assetchains.json there are scripts everywhere pulling if from old address

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which one of these can I spam with oracles now that CFEKX is gone?

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
I airdropped whatever the "lameducksairdrop.json" file on my VPS was ðŸ˜‚

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
thought it was STAKED4

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
maybe i lost my keys

[06-Feb-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main one LABST2 @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator should be the most rliable, but you can use any... The VerusHash ones are an experiment, and may not be there for that long.

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
spam em all

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers, will swap over dragonhound later tonight

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
they'll be dead in a week

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
you want us to keep CFEKX going

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
?

[06-Feb-19 10:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not spamming much, just need an oraclable chain to keep working on

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
I'd say use LABST, it's a good test that ac_ccenable work properly

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are notarisations going through

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
what the hell did we airdrop to CFEKLAMEDUCKS

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
LABST2? I dont see LABST anymore

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
STAKED4, right?

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
LABST deded

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Alright#0419
everything deded

[06-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
yay confusion

[06-Feb-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So much ðŸ˜•

[06-Feb-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian it really didn't matter what I airdropped

[06-Feb-19 10:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @jorian , yeah, that link Alright posted has the most up to date.  I'll add some more from a text doc later.

[06-Feb-19 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
did anyone get LABST2 from an airdrop?

[06-Feb-19 10:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Ducks should have been STAKED4 I thought.

[06-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
Airdrop is in block 3 on LABST2

[06-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
you should have any STAKED4

[06-Feb-19 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
ðŸ¤·

[06-Feb-19 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
guess i lost them

[06-Feb-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
You've imported them before?

[06-Feb-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
nothing has changed

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can import mine and send some LABST2 if someone needs coins? Maybe @jorian 's were the ones you stole?

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or did you not steal this time?

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
oh you're stealing now? great! ðŸ˜„

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
I didn't steal any from random addresses

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
oh ffs

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
haha jk

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
the airdrop *does not matter*

[06-Feb-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He did it so someone could make a script to check the airdrop was correct...

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No just daemon mine some coins I guesss ðŸ¤·  
Either way the notary is paying you quite a bit of cons per notarisation

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just wait a while until you ahve enough coins to migrate

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
I really think you didn't import it properly

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
can you confirm that you did?

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
am curious if it was a mistake on my part

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jorian#4555
i'm restarting first. i think i tested it before on lameducks

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jorian#4555
need to start that chain somehow

[06-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
I really wasn't paying much attention to the airdrop as it was the most insignificant part of all of this

[06-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
(also, stop.sh doesn't stop KMD)

[06-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
oh wait

[06-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
it does

[06-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
weird

[06-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
let me investigate
