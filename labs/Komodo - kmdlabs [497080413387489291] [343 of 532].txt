the normal address or CC address

[27-Mar-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I sent him some RLABS and an RLabsCC

[27-Mar-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wasn't sure what he wanted either 😛

[27-Mar-19 01:56 PM] Alright#0419
didn't really look at the code yet, but if it works the way I assume it does, it won't actually be sending coins to that address

[27-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
would need to be a CC address

[27-Mar-19 01:57 PM] Alright#0419
How is CC address derived from normal address for a given eval code?

[27-Mar-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
GetScriptaddress(coinaddr,CC1vout(...))

[27-Mar-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I don't think it matters what address you sendnit to because the validation should just say it can never be spent

[27-Mar-19 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks genie

[27-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
The coins wouldn't be sent to that RLabs or RLabsCC address

[27-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
they would be sent to the corresponding CC address

[27-Mar-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You could easily send them to any address just fine I'm sure

[27-Mar-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Right now they are sent to the cc unspendable address for custom lib... But can just add pubkey/address to the op return and write some actual validation.

[27-Mar-19 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Actually that's a sweet idea. It can take an address and amount and some payload of data. That way you can burn coins to any address... Seems hell useful

[27-Mar-19 04:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We don't actually need to private keys for those address genie made but they can be public to prove/test that it works

[27-Mar-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used 2 GPUs for 20 minutes just so you can burn shit?

[27-Mar-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well maybe... I'll check it out tomorrow, maybe you can make a cc address with them maybe not. Either way, making it use some validation to be more useful won't be very hard to do

[27-Mar-19 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either way it was a fun experiment for me to see the difference the case sensitive addition of 2 characters makes 😛

[27-Mar-19 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[27-Mar-19 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the set of RLABS addys (with 1 1080TI) was faster than I could hit ctrl+c and the single RLabsCC (with 2x 1080TI) took like 12 minutes

[27-Mar-19 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
geek-level math of the permutations is over my head, but I find it interesting nonetheless

[27-Mar-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
gonna ask the same question here i just asked in ARRR discord...

[27-Mar-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
Why does AGAMA not display TIME and CONFIRMS for ARRR in the tx grid?

[27-Mar-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
But blocktime is shown in the detailed info?

[27-Mar-19 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ComputerGenie 凸(⊙▂⊙ )凸Today at 11:36 AM
because Agama is a layer app on a timer?

[27-Mar-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
thanks Genie lol...

[27-Mar-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
this is something that can be upgraded I assume?

[27-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
Man I don't understand how it could burn to any address

[27-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
you need to send it to a CC address for it to follow CC validation

[27-Mar-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419
Each eval code has it's own set of addresses

[27-Mar-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why do you need to do that, he eval code is part of the script any address it lands in will call the validation function when someone trys to spend it

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@daemonfox I don't intend this to sound as reductive as I'm sure some will take it, but....
Agama is a glorified web page that polls the daemon through the cli, there's a certain level of "lag" that it will always have because of that

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
Hmm I guess any address might be a valid CC address

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
lag?

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can male it to that I'm sure

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
not sure if there is a checksum or something to check if it was made for that specific eval code

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems very simple t

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but the vout needs to be a CC vout

[27-Mar-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes as long as its a ccvout

[27-Mar-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not a p2pk, p2pkh or p2sh

[27-Mar-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It already is... I just sent it to a hard coded address

[27-Mar-19 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It can easily be any, I had trouble Gert ng the json input working at first but should be fine to do it now after figuring out the other RPCs

[27-Mar-19 04:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not sure what lag does to what im describing?

[27-Mar-19 04:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
the entire grid of ARRR txes shows NA for confirms and time

[27-Mar-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
see in pirate channel 😛

[28-Mar-19 02:01 PM] Alright#0419
but

[28-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Alright#0419
if you're just trying to build komodod with makecustom

[28-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Alright#0419
```
cd ~/komodo/src/cc
./makecustom
cd ..
make
../zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

[28-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Alright#0419
or edit the `./makerogue` line in build.sh to `./makecustom`

[28-Mar-19 02:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
hmm ok
basicly I just did ./start.sh    than I got the human help error and I did
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)   manualy and got that error.
Looks like also in jl777 branch of jl
I will try your steps now

@blackjok3r ?

@Alright i am debugging -ac_mineropret=<hexstr> 
this will allow you to specify any data to go into the opreturn, no need for the 0x6a or size, it will take care of that. still debugging

[28-Mar-19 02:18 PM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll be getting off for the day in about an hour or two. If you need some testing right now, let me know

[28-Mar-19 02:18 PM] Alright#0419

it will be a while, combining this with a few other things too

[28-Mar-19 07:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is there a fix for the build error that chmex had? I'm getting the same thing (./start on reboot lead to a pull that moofed something)

[28-Mar-19 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, the `./makecustom` is where it's failing to properly link bdb (be it manually or through the make files)

than edited start.sh to not try to update again

[28-Mar-19 07:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
not sure if it will notarize again so far no one yet

[28-Mar-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Mar-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well seems their is literally no reason to be keeping this working until u get the pull request I'm into really checking that it builds, nobody was told to update lol

[29-Mar-19 04:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, have there been any changes to `cleanwallettransactions` recently?
It wasn't cleaning our any transactions for 5~7 (?) days for me.  
It just cleaned out a large number of them now, si seems working again (?).

[29-Mar-19 04:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Also, mining on NN (DIMXY4) stops after some time. Chain stalls.

[29-Mar-19 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like I just said, I wouldnt really worry about anything here at this stage. chains 3 and 4 can really be killed tbh.They are only causing issues

[29-Mar-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cleanwallettransactions only works if all the transactions before some height are spent... if there is one single utxo that is very old it will not clean the other transactions... to force it to work, you need to send everything to yourself first

i can only get it to work on KMD if i ./stop, is that why ^

[29-Mar-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... I will fix the build now before I head to the city 😂

[29-Mar-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt think anyone would actually restart it unless they were asked too 😄

[29-Mar-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And btw that linker problem. I fixed it in the past by hard coding the path to the file... but evey time i do it somone seems to undo it upstream... I know why, because you shouldn't use hardcoded paths, but if it works 🤷

[29-Mar-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
killed 3/4 4 is deaded as dead very broken. We dont need them anymore. Will revert makecustom for now so you can update for no reason 😃

[29-Mar-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its fixed

[29-Mar-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just merged jl777 branch in, and reverted it back to makerogue ... We really need to fix that wallet linker for the other cclibs, as makeing a CC contract with cclib is about 100x faster than not using it .

[29-Mar-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess for LABS I can try to do some kind of hard code and try some git magic to prevent it being merged upsteam somehow....

[29-Mar-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO guys, pretty much ignore this project..focus on testnet notaries. I highlky doubt we are going to be doing much of anything around here until the elections are over unfortuantly. 😦

[29-Mar-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The new changes to tokens are extensive and I dont see it as something we can rush though. I was going to revert all the changes so we could launch, but I have decided against that. We waited this long whats a few more weeks.

[29-Mar-19 06:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nobody was told to update `
Well, that's not entirely true when you built the update into the start script 😛

[29-Mar-19 07:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.. anyway its in a stable condition now I think. We still need to test update era to add mylo lol ... but I I dont see the point of doing it when there wil be a massive hard forking update heading our way soon. Its just a waiting game, but with elections around the corner, we should probably hold off and let people focus on that, seems as there are so many of us running.

[29-Mar-19 07:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm back now so will be able to do more on the `how stuff works`.  The elections will take up time for sure.
😣  Mylo sounded really keen to get notarizing.

Hi @radix42 👋
Thanks for your help with Marmara!
I saw you were talking about similar things ☝  ( 🍓 )

[29-Mar-19 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u have any questions cris message me in DM, my phone isn't doing pings ATM but I'll try to fix it tonight. I'll be able to spend some time this weekend on stuff but will be mostly unavailable. Heading to city with the family.
