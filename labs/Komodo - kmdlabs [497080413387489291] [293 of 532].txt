[15-Feb-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810

[15-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
how about this idea:
partial payments based on prior notarization references

[15-Feb-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the MoMoM DB esists which removes and inputs all known notarisations. this DB could be used to create payments. But I'm not really surre how to go abnout doing that.

[15-Feb-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it follows reorgs

[15-Feb-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unlike dpow

[15-Feb-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which cant

[15-Feb-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
say you refer to 3 past notarizations in the notary tx. in the block that it happens if any of the 3 notarizations are valid, the payout is made

[15-Feb-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
now it can be validated based on the single block

[15-Feb-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is protected by the 3 deep referred notarizations

[15-Feb-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
chaintip needs to have all 3 being valid

[15-Feb-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
during initialization only 1 of the 3 being valid is enough

[15-Feb-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the different behavior during init is the key?

[15-Feb-19 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not really init .. its only a fresh sync... because of reorgs happening every 2-3 blocks when this attack is happening... the checkpoints are not created on a fresh sync in the same order as they are live.... 
The only solution to this I could see was to not use notarizxation check points... You can only referance the tx in the chain itself... Its like amost impossivble to know which notarisation protects which tx when your under this attack

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each block can easily referance tx inside it with 100% accuracy during this attack

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any other solution seems like it could be broken

[15-Feb-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however unlikely

[15-Feb-19 08:23 AM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r  Hi, I'm trying to build kmdlabs fork. I have 2 boxes Debian and  Ubuntu. 
On Ubuntu build is okay.
on Debian I received this:
-------------------------
Makefile:4265: recipe for target 'wallet/libbitcoin_wallet_a-asyncrpcoperation_mergetoaddress.o' failed
make[2]: *** [wallet/libbitcoin_wallet_a-asyncrpcoperation_mergetoaddress.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/admin/repo/kmdlabs/src'
Makefile:4988: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/admin/repo/kmdlabs/src'
Makefile:659: recipe for target 'all-recursive' failed
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
--------------------------------
Tried to repeat build several times but error persists.
Maybe i need to install some additional package?

[15-Feb-19 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hey not sure is this master branch? We are going to launch you your own branch to use and 2 of your won chains... because we cannot promise the chains I am working on will work. The 2 from yesterday died almost instantly

[15-Feb-19 08:25 AM] dimxy#2587
Sorry

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] dimxy#2587
incorrect branch (I mistakelnly used master

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright is going to help you with this 
No it should be master ...

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be working

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need error from higher up ?

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] dimxy#2587
not notary_pay_new?

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no taht branch is not working atm

[15-Feb-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well it should build

[15-Feb-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the chains are broken

[15-Feb-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry for messing you around.

[15-Feb-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
Do you have code you need to merge to our repo?

[15-Feb-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
@dimxy

[15-Feb-19 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
or do you just need two normal chains? Not sure how close our master is to FSM right now

[15-Feb-19 08:29 AM] dimxy#2587
I am going to make corrections into  rpc crosschain api,
and I need 2 notarized chains. That s why I want to use your src (JL directed me to you with this)

[15-Feb-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubt its close ... havent merged down in sometime... to avoid any problems with this curretn clusterfuck üòÜ

[15-Feb-19 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
are you making changes to the chain after it's started?

[15-Feb-19 08:31 AM] dimxy#2587
I haven't done any changes yet, I m just setting the repo forked from yout kmdlabs

[15-Feb-19 08:31 AM] dimxy#2587
As we agreed yesterday

[15-Feb-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
Do you want to setup your own notaries or use ours?

[15-Feb-19 08:31 AM] dimxy#2587
yours

[15-Feb-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so we can start two chains for you, but if you want to change the code the notaries are running after they are started, you must PR the changes to the repo

[15-Feb-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
Could you take a look at the KMDLabs/komodo repo and check that is has what you want to test? Are you relying on anything recent from FSM or jl777 branch?

[15-Feb-19 08:33 AM] dimxy#2587
I think i'm not going to change notaries,
I 'll be working on komodod rpc for crosschain

[15-Feb-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
all that is needed are two chains that are being notarized

[15-Feb-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
just rpc which wont be consensus changes

[15-Feb-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810

[15-Feb-19 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
much better than teh current script

[15-Feb-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the current method, it seems overcomplex

[15-Feb-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very much so, I thught about that myself... but seemed too much work to change when it was working already

[15-Feb-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and a way to tokensendtochain OTHER tokenid pubkey amount

[15-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so we get crosschain tokens, but we need two stable chains that have valid MoMoM notarized to test this

[15-Feb-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright can set that up, if there is a build issue from fresh clone and he can rewproduce I will fix it right away
