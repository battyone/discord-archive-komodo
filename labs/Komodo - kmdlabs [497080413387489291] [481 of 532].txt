@CrisF what does the Vote need to do exactly?

does it need to enforce the outcome on the blockchain?
are votes distributed based on coins held ?
why zero fee?

[29-Sep-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405
For the anonymous vote chain do you think a 0 block reward, privately mined chain that only gives voters 1 coin and enough for fees to make 2 txs would work?

[29-Sep-19 10:14 AM] gcharang#6833
so, a blockchain to conduct a private vote is needed
it just need to give the result
correct?

[29-Sep-19 10:14 AM] CrisF#3405
How can a Zero-Knowledge Vote be made using the Labs voting mechanisn?

(By Zero-Knowledge Vote I mean a vote that can be made once per issue, and only once per issue, by a private 'voting' key that belongs to a set of 'voting' keys (eg, Notary keys).  The vote would provably belong to the set of keys, but unknown as to which key it came from.) @gcharang

jl777 originally suggested ```you could send 1.0002 coins to each taddr. then each voter would do a t -> z to a tmp address and from there a z->z to the voting address
assuming everybody votes, it seems to work, but if some dont vote it could be an issue```

[29-Sep-19 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`jl777 originally suggested...`
that's about the only way I could see it being able to work

[29-Sep-19 10:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, emmanuel said that there was a y to make a no fee transactions though.

[29-Sep-19 10:17 AM] phm87#7395
@gcharang  about the privately mined chain, I had a look at  random places in the code yesterday including these places:
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/miner.cpp#L412>
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/pow.cpp#L838>
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/beta/src/komodo_defs.h#L182>
Then if we use a trick as Pirate is using for its mining pool then maybe it is possible ... but ppl will be able to sell votes in zonly world before voting

[29-Sep-19 10:17 AM] phm87#7395
So maybe we need to force voters to vote right after entering zonly world (t->z)

[29-Sep-19 10:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, the .0002 and a non-no-fee might prevent it though (?)

[29-Sep-19 10:18 AM] phm87#7395
Oh I have an idea to limit the selling of votes in zonly world, play with the min fee to be sure that it won't be worth it to sell votes (high fee per tx in zonly tx)

[29-Sep-19 10:19 AM] phm87#7395
Maybe it is what you meant with your message with the 0.0002, good idea then

[29-Sep-19 10:20 AM] phm87#7395
but if it is possible to mine blocks, maybe we can do a 0 fee tx, then mine it ourself. So the price of a block matters to protect the system

[29-Sep-19 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I was thinking that 0.0001 would only allow 1 tx.  I see fee adjusting is possible, so that must be wrong.

[29-Sep-19 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
A private miner that doesn't accept less than that should make that so, shouldn't it?

[29-Sep-19 10:39 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
@CrisF my idea was more about protecting the identity of the voter than to hide the voting process itself and its results from the external eyes. So in my case there is probably no need for using z-addresses to vote, there would be a need of z-addresses for the main coins. What do you think?

[29-Sep-19 10:41 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
So if someone wants to submits a proposal he'd need to pay the creation of one-time voting tokens+ necessary tx fees and then the z-addresse's owners should be enabled somehow to claim their voting tokens 1 for each main coin they are owning.

[29-Sep-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @johnwhitestar ,
In my case I want the same as you.  I want the process to be verifiable.  The z-tx is used to anonymize what the voter votes for.

- Voters are known (pubkey).  

- They are sent 1 coin + tx fees (enough for 2 transactions) each T-address

- They send the coin to a Z-address

- From the Z-address to the address that they vote for

One coin in the vote address coins as a vote.  

This needs to be modified with the new info from above.

[29-Sep-19 11:44 AM] phm87#7395
from my understanding, I agree that if 100% of blocks are mined by private miners (and not 75% of blocks as on KMD) and that trusted entities controls the miners'keys, I think that the txfee will be mandatory

[29-Sep-19 11:47 AM] phm87#7395
but voters can still sell their vote with the old method where you agree to vote for someone (whatever the reason) then you vote for him. We won't be able to forbid social engineering prior to election

we can't forbid social engineering in any election though?

[29-Sep-19 12:03 PM] CrisF#3405
I guess that is as as goods a result as can be expected.

Is it possible to use JUMBLR on SmartChain?

[29-Sep-19 01:17 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
I think that the voters should be unknown, so it's impossible to manipulate them and their votes.

[29-Sep-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant you just use a faucet like thing that gives out a vote... I guess its not possible then to stop people voting twice though... I think this is the main issue.

[29-Sep-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems easy enough to hide the identity of the voter, but in doing so, you allow 1 person to be as many people asthey like.

[29-Sep-19 01:18 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
the number of coins they possess should be corresponding to the number of votes they are given, they can split their votes in whatever quantity of identities, the result would be the same

[29-Sep-19 01:22 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
but are the tokens created upon coins with privacy also private?

[29-Sep-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i know what you mean, have X votes, for X people then send 1 to each registered address, that is then sent T->Z then to the vote address's/CC that does it. Vote CC is something I wanted to make for a while, but havent got there yet.

[29-Sep-19 01:26 PM] CrisF#3405
That's my want, but I think @johnwhitestar is after something different.

[29-Sep-19 01:26 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
I feel like you @CrisF

[29-Sep-19 01:27 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
My idea is that if I have X coins I have X votes.

[29-Sep-19 01:27 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
So it doesn't matter how many identities I have.

[29-Sep-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Well, if that 's the case it should be possible.

[29-Sep-19 01:29 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Of course I can't send voting coins to an address if I don't know how much coins are on what address, but I know how many was issued by blockchain so far, so I can issue voting coins and ask people interested to vote to claim them.

[29-Sep-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but how to you prevent one person caliming more than one?

[29-Sep-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or is that not a problem?

[29-Sep-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
by doing a T->Z->T you should anoynmise all the votes, as long as they are all done at the same time, like jumblr does.

[29-Sep-19 01:30 PM] CrisF#3405
My usecase is for an anon NN vote.

[29-Sep-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you could bverify the identity off chain and distrubute the coins, then have them all jumbled at some defined time after that. Shouldnt be that hard to do really.

[29-Sep-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doestn even really need a CC, unless you dont want ot make a new vote chain each time.

[29-Sep-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that's why I was asking about JUMBLR.  gcharang said it would have to beimplemented it in the source code thought

[29-Sep-19 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, this wil need source changes.

[29-Sep-19 01:32 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
@blackjok3r verifying offchain would be against voters anonymity.

[29-Sep-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see another way to do it using current tech we have really.. For something like NN vote, its qute easy as each key is known. But any thing else is more difficult.

[29-Sep-19 01:33 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
I see....

[29-Sep-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like if you dont care if people get more than 1 vote, then its no problem..

[29-Sep-19 01:34 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
no I care of course

[29-Sep-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the only thing that you care about is X votes are used to vote for Y/Z then its easy. But how to you protect anoyn and also prevent sybil attack?

[29-Sep-19 01:35 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
I was thinking, I don't know what address keeps what coins, but the blockchain knows...

[29-Sep-19 01:35 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
So in the claiming process it verifies whether the claimer has the coins he is claiming for.

[29-Sep-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but you some how need to know that you sent the votes only 1 to each person, but you cant ID them? So how is that possible, blockchain is great to track the votes after they have been distributed.

[29-Sep-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î

[29-Sep-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the vote is based on how many coins an address has? Like the KMD vote process, where it cost monetary value to get lots of votes.

[29-Sep-19 01:37 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
exactly, but I'm not thinking about monetary value of the vote, rather about involvement of the voter

[29-Sep-19 01:38 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
each address that has X coins should be enabled to have the same number of votes

[29-Sep-19 01:39 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
So i don't need to verify the identity of the owner of that address and those coins.

[29-Sep-19 01:40 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Is it already implemented in KMD?

[29-Sep-19 01:43 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Can an airdrop of some sort be used for that? ‚òù

[29-Sep-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, I guess paymentscc can do this exact thing, but would need to pay out tokens instead of coins.

[29-Sep-19 02:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, that maybe ok.  I believe he mentioned tokens in #cc-general.  
If tokens are ok  @johnwhitestar then you should check that and speak to Blackjok3r when he's back.

Thank you so much guys! Yes I'm thinking about tokens for the moment. I was thinking to create a token that will initially imitate the new consensus mechanism I have in mind, to see whether the people will like the project, before possibly investing into heavy coding.

[29-Sep-19 02:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Well, Blackjok3r is the best one to ask about it.
