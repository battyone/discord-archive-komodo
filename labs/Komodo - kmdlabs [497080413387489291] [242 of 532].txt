If I could get mastertest top build.... We will ahve an explorer for STAKED4 whoch should amke it easy to check

[25-Jan-19 06:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`first person to find all of them`
do we get to know the number of "all" so the we're not staring at a screen for no reason after they are found? 😛

93% PoS blows 🐐 🐐

[25-Jan-19 06:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r short of doing dehex math is there a way to know the current diff for PoW on a dual chain?

[25-Jan-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getblocktemplate should be showing komodo_POWtarget output.

[25-Jan-19 06:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in hex 😛

[25-Jan-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will change on every block

try that?

[25-Jan-19 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it fetches diff from getblocktemplate and calculates it

[25-Jan-19 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, the answer is "no"

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  did you want that hex math added to the getblocktemplate output ? I think we can add that without breaking anyting?

[25-Jan-19 06:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r I know how to do that (that's why I was asking if there was a way without math, like rpc), I still have the logs of how I spent 2 hrs trying, in vain, to explain it to @Alright  :trollface:

[25-Jan-19 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... that bash math was super difficult to work out

[25-Jan-19 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>just count the 0's, don't do math
he says
 🤦🏽

[25-Jan-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jan-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 0's is liek exponential

[25-Jan-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked that out lst few weeks... from 0 to 00 is like squared diff I think

[25-Jan-19 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that bash math was super difficult to work out`
Diff = Diff1.ToDecimal/Target.ToDecimal
what's so "super difficult " about that?

[25-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was in bash...

[25-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took hours to make it work...

[25-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@LabsAssistant we will be adding this chain to notary network in a moment. This is a dry run for launch. We will be adding an additional chain later today as well. STAKED4 was airdropped to this chain(FOR TESTING PURPOSES). I did some black hat things in the airdrop. First person who can show me all of the black hat things I did to it will receive 200 KMD. If you plan to claim this, we need your scripts for how you spotted each. These scripts should be able to verify the actual LABS launch as well. Please don't share what you find with each other until the bounty is claimed. We want multiple sets of verification scripts. If you think you have found them all, PM me and I will confirm.

@blackjok3r can komodod exist without libcc.so at all?

[25-Jan-19 10:33 AM] Alright#0419
think that could be the problem, it's building komodod, moving it but then when komodod is executed, can't find libcc.so

[25-Jan-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do `./zcutil/build.sh`  first

[25-Jan-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just got it to work with staked repo

[25-Jan-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not showing a StakedEra in getinfo tho... somethign si wrong

[25-Jan-19 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
I see it

[25-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wqait its ok

[25-Jan-19 10:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if relevant, but for libcc trouble I had before I had to `make` in `komodo/src/cc` and also `sudo apt install libsodium-dev`.

[25-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs a blcok to happen to activate it

[25-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I changed the MakeFile and build.sh

[25-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works now/... BUT it requires a make clean and build.sh to "reset" it

[25-Jan-19 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once this has been done once... cclib.so exists andit will make as normal

[25-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
does libcc.so need to exist for komodod to run or just for it to build

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt appear to no

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked repo is working fine

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
here

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
so that's a no to both?

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to do build.sh to create cclib.so first

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or make will fail

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is what the scripts use

[25-Jan-19 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just make

[25-Jan-19 10:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

its cclib.so

[25-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
