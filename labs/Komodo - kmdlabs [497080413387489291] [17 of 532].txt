the start.sh builds the daemon for you

[11-Oct-18 05:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
perfect

[11-Oct-18 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stop adding bugs and you'll stop having to fix them :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand what this bug is, but I made it *go away*

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
you should see my pet spider

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a feeling I know what it is... and I know how to avoid it happening in the future...

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then it wasn't a bug, it was a misplaced feature

[11-Oct-18 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just how I started the chain

[11-Oct-18 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it had a notarisation too early, or there were too many faucetfunds in a block

[11-Oct-18 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or the supply is too large, and it overflows somehting

[11-Oct-18 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
either way, does it matter is a troll box cant pass chainverify at level 2 🤷

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
stupid is as stupid does

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems wildly unimportnat to me

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you get some 💤 and I'll drop a tag if I find any issues

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
we make mistakes

[11-Oct-18 05:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

Could someone get me up to speed with what happened the past 3-4 days? Not back yet, just checking in and don't feel like reading ~500 messages

[11-Oct-18 09:45 PM] jspook16#3059
@blackjok3r got a staked troll chain working. I think a few guys have started testing it too @alright

[11-Oct-18 09:49 PM] Alright#0419
and how to test?

[11-Oct-18 09:50 PM] Alright#0419
Did he get it sped up? Hash rate make it faster or what?

[11-Oct-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
thanks but 
>not back yet

[11-Oct-18 10:10 PM] jspook16#3059
He made it an on demand chain and I think lowered the difficulty. Might have to get the full scoop from him

[11-Oct-18 10:17 PM] jspook16#3059
So any new message mines instantly

[11-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
did this yesterday, just sharing it incase someone wants to play with it for the time being 
```
#!/bin/bash
orclid=01c542e1c65724007b2a42d16d4b8a7b5d38acdc6e3be190f14f9afd1449a160
sub=03159df1aa62f6359aed850b27ce07e47e25c16ef7ea867f7dde1de26813db34d8
pubs=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesinfo $orclid | jq -r '.registered | .[] | .publisher')
pubsarray=(${pubs///n/ })
batons=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesinfo $orclid | jq -r '.registered | .[] | .batontxid')
batonarray=(${batons///n/ })
len=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclesinfo $orclid | jq -r '[.registered | .[] | .publisher] | length')

for i in $(seq 0 $(( $len - 1 )))
do
if [ $sub = ${pubsarray[$i]} ]
then
komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDB1 oraclessamples $orclid ${batonarray[$i]} 1 | jq -r '.samples[0][0]' | jq .
fi
done
```
Can pipe the output to assetchains.json then run it on a cron and it will update assetchains.json any time the publisher you set the value of sub to updates the oracle

[11-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
going to get it working with multiple publishers before we actually use it

[11-Oct-18 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
with this, we can cron this script and start.sh, and we'll have the ability to add chains to the notary network without notaries having to do anything

[11-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Alright#0419
works from the mempool too btw

[12-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  more hash rate speeds up the troll fast enough you don't need mempool parsing

[12-Oct-18 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless u want it as fast as discord but even then I doubt it will be as fast

[12-Oct-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent a long time yesterday fucking around d with the faucet because the new address limitation basically makes it unusable

[12-Oct-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the stkdtroll chain is working pretty good but it needs 10 ppl to try and chat on it at once to make sure the chain doesn't just break with lots of messages at once

[12-Oct-18 01:15 AM] jspook16#3059
I can probably test on it this weekend. I still plan on finished my troll too if anyone cares

[12-Oct-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think you should as yours works with normal assetchains this version is now so modified it needs the fork of komodo to work

[12-Oct-18 01:18 AM] jspook16#3059
I might be able to get it on GitHub this weekend. Just need about 8 hours on it

[12-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries, its always better to have different ways of doing stuff to get the best solution

[12-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant any notaries around willing to test something soon?

[12-Oct-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  we made some changes to assetchains.json so that it no longer has any spaces... that was a stupid and hacky way of doing it and broke lots of stuff... when  you have some time free I can explain what it is, you may not need to change to use `listassetchainparams.py` but that might still be the easiest way.

[12-Oct-18 03:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Thanks, due home in 4hrs or so. Gotta buy car this weekend, but aim to catchup.

[12-Oct-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are not that far in front. I spent most of my time on TROLL box all week and mainnet notary things

[12-Oct-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we just got oracle working for assetchains.json 😄

[12-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
notaries, please 
```
git pull
./oraclefetch
./start.sh
```

✅ 

[12-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
you'll start notarizing STAKEDARB

[12-Oct-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
you can cron both scripts if you just want to start notarizing anything I publish on the oracle

[12-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldn't cron it just yet... I need to fix a few things, granted they should not happen ever, but they have in the past so it seems a good idea to fix them.

[12-Oct-18 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`start.sh` and `vallidateaddress.sh` are now updated so that they will not get stuck in case of a chain getting a corrupted DB or wont actually start for some other reason.

[12-Oct-18 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pushed fix for era edge case where eras sometimes get chosen out of order

[12-Oct-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also pushed that assetchains.json from the oracle to git, so that other repos who depend on that file can still get the latest one. We need to figure out a way for external things, to fetch assetchains.json without a blockchain running... some centralised service that just serves the file seems ok, as long as it has redundancy.

crude as hell ... but VERY fast

[12-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Alright#0419
also let's the oracle act as a chat room

[12-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Alright#0419
the receive script will just print all new `oraclesdata`s for every publisher

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can I put these in StakedNotary?

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
or should I put them elsewhere

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not in notary please

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
do we have another repo that it would make sense in

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
put then in PoS_Scripts

[12-Oct-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will move them to staked, in troll box once it works better

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
needs some work to be able to be used.. we have no name, and that dupe is mighty annoying LOL

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
dude the whole mine blocks instantly can be very useful, but I don't think it's worth continuing with for a trollbox

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should run the troll box on that chain anyway

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
I can print `[<pubkey>]:` before each message

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it stops you needing 100 oracle subccribes

[12-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
then add aliases for known pubkeys

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the coins there are free so ppl will use it

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
just script the oraclessubscribe

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
super simple

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need coins though 😕

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you understand how noob unfreiendly thenormal faucet is ?

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its flast doesnt work

[12-Oct-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
>sync chain
>faucetget
>oraclesregister
>oraclessubscribe x(the amount of messages you'll be able to send per block)

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes use this on TROLL chain

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
set the orclid in the send and receive script

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you can faucetget without a new address

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
start receive script

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise the pubkey as name ... is broken out of the box if you run out of coins

[12-Oct-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this needs to be easy to use, or noone will use it but us

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
I can make this super simple to use

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
freaking sync the chain and run a script pretty much

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need the modified faucet

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so use the trollbox chain we already have

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
yea sounds good

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has oracles built in already

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
but it will work on any chain just saying

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just scrap the KV

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or just dont use it... its still there is someone wants to use it though

[12-Oct-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is better but

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just need a way to set your name to the pubkey somehow

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and not allow dupe names

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
yea man I can do that

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KV was good for that because of passworkd

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use a name with a password, done its yours

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
have an alias file, if you don't have the pubkey set to a name, it will just print the pubkey

[12-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
if you do have it set to name, it will print name
