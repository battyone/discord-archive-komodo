Hi Stakers,

has any significant testing been done with using CCs on z-addresses?

[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I'd forgotten about that.  It was on my list at one point.

[07-Apr-19 02:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Have you done anything with that, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator ?

[07-Apr-19 02:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not yet. curious tho

[07-Apr-19 02:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Me too.

[07-Apr-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so... BNU tI dont think they are compatible with each other.

[07-Apr-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like you cant send from a z address to a CC contract.... I dont think its supported, there is limitations with the mempool fix.

[07-Apr-19 03:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so a chain that is z-addr only is unlikely to play nice with CCs. I thought it might be...

[07-Apr-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it flat out wont work

[07-Apr-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, thought too much back end stuff inbetween that needs to know more than zk will reveal

[07-Apr-19 03:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I wonder if gateways might overcome this at all, but I'm doubtful

[08-Apr-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Workiing on the notarizations counter for main net, it was super easy to add LABS to it, so I did. üòÉ We no have a way of trackinga nd counting notarizations, although it will take some extra work to make it work automatically with eras.

[08-Apr-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This system only counts KMD ntoarizations not back notarizations, but combined with the scripts we have to track ntoary pay, we will be able to see exactly now if any notarizations failed.

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  Question for you.  How do I override this and force it to rollback to sync?

[09-Apr-19 02:25 AM] hypocalese#3688
2019-04-09 02:18:15 Error: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 374 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

[09-Apr-19 02:26 AM] hypocalese#3688

[09-Apr-19 02:26 AM] Alright#0419
how did you end up in that situation?

[09-Apr-19 02:28 AM] hypocalese#3688
Not entirely certain. My PoW miner went down for about 2 hrs before I noticed.  Then firing up the nodes I noticed this condition.

[09-Apr-19 01:22 PM] CrisF#3405

Updated the RPC call for notary stats, not working for LABS right now. But when I get some time I will fix it. I have some major code changes to merge down/up now. Not looking forward to doing that lol.

We need to test tokens migrates too guys. Not sure how best to go about it. With the election happenign atm maybe we should just wait.

[10-Apr-19 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Is anyone who is not involved in the elections available to test?

[10-Apr-19 08:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe we could do a larger scale test after the elections and have a few preliminary tests done in the meantime?

[10-Apr-19 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent even tried it... but dimxy reported it was working as expected on NK/KN

that doesnt mean it cant be broken... though

Hi @penguin , Labs is a place where you can easily set up a testing chain that is protected by dPoW notarization.

[10-Apr-19 09:04 PM] CrisF#3405
You can test CC contracts and other things here.

[10-Apr-19 09:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Please ask here if you have any questions.

Hi,

I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.

I could really use your support and votes.

My proposal `(node-9)` can be found here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`

Please send votes to me at this address,  `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`

and to other candidates who support KMDLabs, and need votes, at the addresses that they post.

üôè
