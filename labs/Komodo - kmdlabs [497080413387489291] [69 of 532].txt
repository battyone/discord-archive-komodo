boolean required.

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you must ahev balance

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, sry

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
perferably spread over 64 segids

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CrisF#3405
also true.

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CrisF#3405
thanks!

[03-Nov-18 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just re ./start ed

[03-Nov-18 11:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got gps transmitting basic coords over 3G, and retrievable via curl üòÉ

[03-Nov-18 11:10 AM] CrisF#3405
OH! Good stuff!

[03-Nov-18 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Isn't that the hard part?

[03-Nov-18 11:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh its taken very little coding to do that. I didnt even have to warm up the solder iron

[03-Nov-18 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the kit is embarraslingly idiot proof. well... average bloke proof anyways.

[03-Nov-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its just notarised CFEK I see

[03-Nov-18 11:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
now I just have to sort out why oracles wont listen to me, and then convince them to feed data to map

[03-Nov-18 11:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so far they feed the silence of my voicelessness fairly well, so I think it's just some ear cleaning to be done

[03-Nov-18 11:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and I'm gonna poke around kiva a bit to see if it'll work with the map

[03-Nov-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nice work man. üòÉ

[03-Nov-18 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah,  very cool!

[03-Nov-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes CFEK is now notarising and the freq was 5 onthe second one... so it seems I fixed it this morning with the change

[03-Nov-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
835 blocks without a notarisation üòÖ

[03-Nov-18 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I got 2 notaraizations on CFEK an others have them too, apart from ED and ING.

[03-Nov-18 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
I just sorted out my node on FEK. Wonder if that has anything to do with it.

[03-Nov-18 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Not staking though. pos64splitter won't split 2 coins.

[03-Nov-18 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Will fix ED node and see if that moves.

[03-Nov-18 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator How did you manually split?  Just a send?

[03-Nov-18 11:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I used the repo, but had to tweak it

[03-Nov-18 11:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I forget the errors, but slight code mode made it work for me

[03-Nov-18 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll look into the pos64splitter code.

[03-Nov-18 11:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I setup config.py manually, and for some reason list.py wasnt be created right so I did it manually too, then it worked.

[03-Nov-18 11:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
genaddress output the list to console, I saved it into lists.py, put pubkey etc in config.py and then üëå

[03-Nov-18 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Just a random pubkey from the list?

[03-Nov-18 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, from asset.conf.

[03-Nov-18 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I'll give it a shot!

[03-Nov-18 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Is there a way to see how many nodes are on a chain?  I've been notarizing ED since I finally got a node running on it.

No I dont think you ca get much other than connections

üëç 

[03-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And that difficulty is likely why the PoS % is so high

[03-Nov-18 12:14 PM] Alright#0419
I guess there is some threshold minimum amount of pow for algo to work properly?

[03-Nov-18 12:14 PM] Alright#0419
CFEK is at 100% POS

[03-Nov-18 12:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Why is the difficulty so high?

[03-Nov-18 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
is it?

[03-Nov-18 12:15 PM] CrisF#3405
`"difficulty": 634624.7887434503`

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405
might have changed a bit now.

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r did you remove any of the POS prints?

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
the stdout ones

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
the diff should be lowering with each block

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405
OH, it's dropped a lot!

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
as it's over the target POS%

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] CrisF#3405
`difficulty": 5384.822882475809`

[03-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
not seeing those prints though

[03-Nov-18 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
It's from getinfo for Blackjok3r's post and recent.

[03-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
hmmm, this 1% POS for 0 BR chains may not work

[03-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
Actually I guess it doesn't matter?

[03-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
looking at CFEKED, it's at 9% POS instead of target 1%

[03-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
but does that matter at all?

[03-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't right? just need to worry about the main chain?

[03-Nov-18 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Are many people mining?

[03-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
probably just my nodes

[03-Nov-18 12:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Is there a minimum # of coins for pos64splitter?

[03-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
shouldnt be

[03-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
might have problems with decimals

[03-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
was literally the first thing I coded in python

[03-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
haven't looked at it in months because it just works

[03-Nov-18 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
I had a look at the code.

[03-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The prints were removed ofn FSM branch thae we merged in

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I can try and revert those ?

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
put them back please?

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
that's pretty vital info

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The stats script ofmine gives all  that info

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just havent started any nodes with it yet

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
the prints that show the diff adjustment

[03-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
kind of need those to have some idea if it's working properly

[03-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
possible you can do it ?

[03-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can, but I cant remeber where they are exactly...

[03-Nov-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is now a disp flag

[03-Nov-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to figure out how to set that and they should all show again

[03-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
I'll find them

[03-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
just give me a bit first please

[03-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
What's current status of all chains

[03-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
all moving all notarizing?

[03-Nov-18 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
They started up just over an hour ago.

[03-Nov-18 12:36 PM] CrisF#3405
10 or 11 hours of no notarizations.

[03-Nov-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the iguana was wrong

[03-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt add the function to it, like we have in komodo it was just hard coded STAKED/STKD

[03-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fixed that this moening, then took all day for wnough to join/update

[03-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems there is 6 nodes in recv now

[03-Nov-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally figured out the compile issues I was having, and have a rolling list of notary Raddres, that updates with era changes

[03-Nov-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
working with setpubkey and -pubkey too üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The pirate exception, now just runs off the R address list directly, so we cna now add more things like that with out aving to worry about changing the code every ard fork

[03-Nov-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for pay per notarisation and stuff liek that, we need this Raddress list aswell, it should be super useful later on...

[03-Nov-18 12:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
./stats crashed CFEKLF

[03-Nov-18 12:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Me too

its the get transaction bug ... must not be in that brach lol

trust it's not a Line Feed 0x0A issue

[03-Nov-18 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
actually its definatly not
