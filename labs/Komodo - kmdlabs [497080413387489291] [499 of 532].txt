sorry to see you go @Exile13

[27-Oct-19 11:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not how the rules work... but we havent exactly followed them so far 😄

[27-Oct-19 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
man that is how they were proposed since the beginning

[27-Oct-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
read the "proposals"

[27-Oct-19 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was add 2 each 2 monhths regardless of how many left

[27-Oct-19 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it doesnt matter at thios point

[27-Oct-19 11:45 PM] daemonfox#6136

it's ok if you don't want to make exception and such...
i'm not fighting 🙂

[27-Oct-19 11:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
although i'd rather be here now 😅

[27-Oct-19 11:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That was the idea... Thats how stop sock puppets... ppl hav e to continue to be a fake person for 2+ months

[27-Oct-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
was meant to grow by 2 every 2 months if there were enough people

[27-Oct-19 11:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you were even here the day that was all discussed 🤣

[27-Oct-19 11:47 PM] Alright#0419
anyway, I really need to sleep, will validate results in the morning more thoroughly and start on the code for hf

[27-Oct-19 11:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know how you can do that? ar you simply forkoing the NN?

[27-Oct-19 11:47 PM] Alright#0419
😫

[27-Oct-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
man you moan at me about how easy it is
I say I'll do it 
"I dont know how you can do that? "

[27-Oct-19 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If all your doing is changing keys... its pie

[27-Oct-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
change era, set timestamp

[27-Oct-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
add era*

[27-Oct-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
oh no, there are already dummies there

[27-Oct-19 11:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ity has 4 empty eras as an example

[27-Oct-19 11:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
is there a sample DAPP template somewhere I can look at?

[27-Oct-19 11:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
poking around git hvent found what i think im looking for yet

[27-Oct-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
all of mine use the same general template

[27-Oct-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
is pretty shite, but works

[27-Oct-19 11:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i can us the NNvote.py?

[27-Oct-19 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
that's a "dapp", yes

[27-Oct-19 11:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill start to pick it apart see if I get it...

[27-Oct-19 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
gl

[27-Oct-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
can *kind of* code "consensus rules" into oracles

[27-Oct-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
ie, how we just came to consensus on who won that...

[28-Oct-19 12:01 AM] Old Man Phil#5934
Thanks @mrlynch .  I see you in a lot of the kmd projects discord channels. I feel bad that you didn't get a NN. Good luck going forward.

[28-Oct-19 12:10 AM] bishop#9773

will re-establish my local pool later today, but until then I'm mining in failover order

[28-Oct-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have pushed heaps  of code to master from upstream along with some prep work for our fork. Still waiting for @Alright  
It would be good if a few of you can update now, so we can test this build before we fork.

[28-Oct-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did a stop.sh and and start.sh on my node and it worked just fine...

[28-Oct-19 12:17 PM] daemonfox#6136

Yep @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  @Alright  if you can check that orcales still work that would be helpful. 🙂

[28-Oct-19 01:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
If someone had a set of "smoke test" steps we could run every hf or major update... id run through it.

[28-Oct-19 01:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
So is that something worth standardizing?

[28-Oct-19 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
and maybe having a script to test basics like that and report back pass fail?

[28-Oct-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions_oracles.py there is basic rpc calls tests for oraclesCC

been putting off looking here until i have time to redo dapp as gui next HF

[28-Oct-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I juast pushed some more changes.. Dont know anything about oracles lol.. . @daemonfox  it depends what the fork is for... Some things we cant do on LABS because cant make the code public... Definfatly helps a heap tho.. just merge shit here, and see if it breaks something 😂

[28-Oct-19 01:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh, I'll likely frankenstien together Alrights previous work with my stuff I've used on oracles.earth and in the cctools tui. Learning some pyqt5 right now, so hopefully next vote will either be via web interface or excecutable python app. No promises just yet, just hopes and dreams...

[28-Oct-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
While not originally scheduled for downtime (it's not hosted in Dallas), mininglabs.rocks will likely experience a few reboots today
Adding CFEK chains and a new import system to add ACs even-ish with NNs
and a few "upgrades" that no one but me will ever notice 😛
