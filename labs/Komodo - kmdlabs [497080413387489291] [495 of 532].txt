`Well you advertize the network hashrate as 50-60ksol but it doesn't make sense I don't understand why you do this. Its closer to 600 ksols usually`
This has been explained extensively in this channel, along with 14 ways we also came up with that don't work
If you can code a better algorithm to sort only PoW hashrate from the full chain rate, please feel free to submit a Pull Request

You're more than welcome to ask questions here
If you ask questions without being a dick and accusing everyone and every pool you've ever been in contact with of cheating you, then you'll likely get better answers

@kevinkatovic I staked over 300 LABS today, in AGAMA... on ~13K labs worth of UTXOs. The reason the pool goes for so long without a block has been explained. During that period, people staking are minting long stretches, and because people take hash power away during those times, you make your own issue worse and extend the time POS has to capitalize until it drives the PoW difficulty down again.

[26-Oct-19 01:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
It seems you chose to spend money in mining on this project without actually understanding what pos64 is really about and how to play the game.

[26-Oct-19 01:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
EVERYONE is manipulating this project. It is designed that way.

[26-Oct-19 01:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
And the reason everyone here is kind of loling... is they arent selling. This is a game of accrual... king big bags hold all the big D staking power and the more you hold and stake, the more you gain.

[26-Oct-19 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-ac_staked=51`
On average, 51% of blocks will be PoS and 49% will be PoW
no matter how much PoW miners dis/like it

`I can only buy about 1234 labs`
Then you shouldn't have dumped 70859 of them 🤷🏽

[26-Oct-19 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You mined 70859 LABS

[26-Oct-19 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you should have 70859 LABS

[26-Oct-19 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the point is that if you didn't dump 70859 LABS, then you could be staking 70859 LABS and not pissing the owner of the pool off crying about how you're getting "cheated"

good, so STFU about it

dafuq is a "paytiz"?

[26-Oct-19 02:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
@kevinkatovic we canmake it real simple.

1. There is way more hashrate on LABS now than when you started, therefore the 49% of blocks that can be mined with PoW (ASICs) is divided amongst more miners. Your share is diminishing in comparison to total net power. We know the cli hashrate is incorrect... its a calc against difficulty of the current block.

2. When so many PoW blocks have been found the difficulty sky rockets, and the LABS holders staking will mint most of the blocks via PoS. If you dropped a fuck ton of hash onto LABS while diff was high... you will earn shit while the stakers work through their stretch of blocks until PoW diff drops.

3. You chose to sell low before reading and learning what LABS and PoS64 is and how it works. Thats on you alone. If you did really have ~71K you should have been staking instead of dumping because this is a long term project, not a mine and dump like you have been buying into it sounds like.

4. Staking in AGAMA is EZ. Send LABS to a few different addresses in your wallet. Go to the triple lines top right, click and click Settings. Click the CLI section, make sure the pull down says LABS, and in the field below type the following phrase and click the  Execute button... setgenerate true 0

5. In the same field, delete and type getmininginfo and click Execute. The output below should have a line labeled staking:true and that means its going to do its thing. IT WONT BE IMMEDIATE you need a while to let age build before they will mint but THEY WILL MINT.

Has the hashrate changed since kevintonic showed up earlier?

[26-Oct-19 03:38 AM] CrisF#3405
It was mentioned more than once over the last few times he has 'contributed' here that people would dump hash on Labs.

[26-Oct-19 03:41 AM] CrisF#3405
It would be sad if anyone actually were manipulated into changing their mining/staking based on a clear :troll:
