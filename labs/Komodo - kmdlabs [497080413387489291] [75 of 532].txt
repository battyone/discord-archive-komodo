My lost test coins are approaching 0.5 :1M:, haha.

[06-Nov-18 09:49 PM] emma#2653
i am creating a aseet chain ..while running this on second node "./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 -addnode=<IP address of the first node> -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc) &"   ,,, there is option to  add ip address ..

1st. how this node know what port to connect on first node?


Last logs on the 2nd machine

[06-Nov-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you put the ip addr of the first node when starting the second node, otherwise the second node wont know where to connect to

[06-Nov-18 09:51 PM] emma#2653
I had done it.. 

1- when 2nd node connect to first node ..do we need to add port too? how 2nd node will know which port to connect

[06-Nov-18 09:51 PM] emma#2653
though first node p2p port is 14094

[06-Nov-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it knows the p2p port

[06-Nov-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
just ipadr

[06-Nov-18 09:52 PM] emma#2653
2nd node wallet should have mined coins ..correct?

[06-Nov-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter

[06-Nov-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but during the first 100 blocks, only one node should be mining

[06-Nov-18 09:53 PM] emma#2653
let me check logs what happening with mining

[06-Nov-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
during the earliest blocks if more than one node is mining, very easy for them to go off onto their own fork

[06-Nov-18 09:54 PM] emma#2653
no I have only two node running  only for now

[06-Nov-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but are they both mining?

[06-Nov-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly one node should be mining at first

[06-Nov-18 09:57 PM] emma#2653
I don't think so...i am little lost..let me ask few thing..so you are say 1st node should run alone for some time(till 1000 blocks) ....before i spin of 2nd node?

[06-Nov-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[06-Nov-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
get both nodes connected

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] emma#2653
ok

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
mine on one node

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not two nodes

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not zero nodes

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
mine on exactly one node

[06-Nov-18 09:58 PM] emma#2653
./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 -addnode=<IP address of the first node> -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc) &

this command will connect and start mining on 1st node correct?

[06-Nov-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but no need to mine with more than 1 thread

[06-Nov-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
-genproclimit=1

[06-Nov-18 10:00 PM] emma#2653
shit ... i had put that value 2

[06-Nov-18 10:00 PM] emma#2653
i got these logs first 

'Mining when blockchain might not be in sync longest.0 vs 11
'

[06-Nov-18 10:00 PM] emma#2653
then i stopped both daemon and restarted both

[06-Nov-18 10:00 PM] emma#2653
how to reset everything?

[06-Nov-18 10:01 PM] emma#2653
or should i create a new asset chain ...just by replacing asset chain name

[06-Nov-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
just launch both daemons

[06-Nov-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if they sync up, all is fine

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
dont freak out over every printout

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is verbose

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can know more details about what is going on

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] emma#2653
ok

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
not every printout is an error

[06-Nov-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
when in doubt, experiment

if you didnt specify a blockreward then it makes it an on-demand chain, will only mine where there is a tx to mine

Also use z_mergetoaddress on node without filter, to merge all "free money" into a single uxto, node with filter received as normal, as it sees they are from itself and allows in. SO far it seems its working perfectly.

Might need a user configurable size, hard coded it to 1 coin, but that not always going to be enough.

[07-Nov-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also it takes all vouts and does an everage size, as you cant just ignore a single utxo, have to add whole tx to wallet... Might be ways around this, such as ending 1000 utxo to 1 address and 1 utxo to the notary wallet... forcing it to add all the uselss utxos, need to investigate this possibility.

[07-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Acutally limiting tx to less than 10 vouts, seems a decent thing to add ..

[07-Nov-18 08:07 AM] emma#2653
what is an application you guys think that I can build using asset chain .. which suffice below conditions

1- By building that application, I have to touch almost all part of komodo core tech (so better for learning)
2- Application should have real world use case
3- If possible, I can earn something from that application
4- If possible, It will help komodo ecosystem too

[07-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some usecase for non-fungible tokens

[07-Nov-18 08:40 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
how bout something like twitter but on blockchain üòÑ , earn something from the demand of the coin that is used to post tweets to prevent spam. In essence the coin is a form  of prepaid subscription

Non-fungible token use would be big.  I like the idea of a secure mail-like service, too.

[07-Nov-18 08:52 AM] CrisF#3405
They both meet all of the requirements.

[07-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It will be a sensor free decentralized system , this could be huge. Also the coin can be private

[07-Nov-18 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
I guess the difference would be the first needing the usecase to start where the second would start mainly with the tech/dev.

Mylo(KomodoPioneers)Today at 3:36 AM
@Privatoshi i asked a similar question only yesterday about bundling unique digital assets
non-fungible tokens are possible right now with the tokens contract.
We just need to use 1 satoshi of KMD(or whatever base coin) to create the tokens, 
then only one token with an id is created (so it has a unique token id). 
Later, whoever has the token can add op-return data to it.
GUI side can deal with the rules on how the OP-return data is interpreted

creating bundles of assets can be done with another CC that enforces such restrictions

[07-Nov-18 08:59 AM] CrisF#3405
I saw that post,but didn't read back so far.  Was it more of a general ask, @ph03nix , or was there something more specific?

[07-Nov-18 09:00 AM] CrisF#3405
It would certainly be interesting exploring Tokens here.

I mean no harm .... current traffic on peepeth is 1k user per day.. if we have something better to offer then it makes sense .. Building just for the sake of building is developers heaven and we can peruse it without external motivation.. My question was more about more pragmatic use case ..

Who is using komodo asset chains in real world now and why they are using it?
