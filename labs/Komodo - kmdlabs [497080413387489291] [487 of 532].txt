@daemonfox Do you figure you could break things down into pieces that we could work on?

[18-Oct-19 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yes. But everytime i try to get involved here, work smashes me... and its doing it right now.

[18-Oct-19 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill start to export the data structures from the tables and clean them up

[18-Oct-19 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
I can also write up the user story for "Life of a Sale" but with blockchain as the focus so we can find the right UI

Work... Well, glad it's Friday :abusedsmily: 
Is there a basic piece that we could get set up and test out?

[18-Oct-19 01:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Good to start.  "Life of a Sale" then?

[18-Oct-19 01:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if data is in csv format, converting to json is simple enough.

[18-Oct-19 01:20 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what language are you coding in?

[18-Oct-19 02:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Here's an example of a UI one of the teams I mentioned is working on.  It's a totally unrelated field, but just an example of some of their work.

Their project is an app for point cards that allows you to transfer points and send them to others.  Quite good for people over here as even the tiniest stores are filling wallets with those damn cards.

[18-Oct-19 02:30 PM] CrisF#3405
The fact that it's done on a blockchain is basically hidden from the user.

[18-Oct-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
I can pull the data into many formats...

[18-Oct-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
it lives in an ODBC compatible data set

[18-Oct-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
and we replicate it to MSSQL but its clunky

[18-Oct-19 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
most of the structure is not needed for todays industry... its an old ERP app fromt he late 80s that got upgraded to the 21st century but still used the same accounting logic

but a CSV dump is simple enough

[18-Oct-19 02:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
Here is my one issue though... I need to be able to deploy this same solution, same asset names and modules side by side, yet keep them from clashing.

[18-Oct-19 02:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
As a whole solution... id need to be able to run 100+ iterations of the same deploymewnt, different configs,

1 for each unique market

[18-Oct-19 02:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
and @CrisF that last line of yours is the #1 thing id want to accomplish

[18-Oct-19 02:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
The solution needs to look the part regardless of its backnd

[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, it is quite important in many situations.

Only node below the threshold is dwy's

[18-Oct-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419

@Mylo and @gcharang both of your nodes are somewhat close to that threshold

above the threshold, but might lose the spot if they go down

I am running Mylo's KMDLabs NN spot/key @Alright

I think that threshold worked pretty well üòÅ

[18-Oct-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
anyone who actually tried kept their spot, was exactly what we were going for

[18-Oct-19 06:47 PM] phm87#7395
I had to stop the KMDLabs NN to have enough infra to test the new iguana with chips

[18-Oct-19 06:47 PM] phm87#7395
but I stopped one recently to be able to run again the KMDLabs NN

[18-Oct-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
wouldn't worry about it, only way you'll lose the spot within the next month is if you literally turn it off

[18-Oct-19 06:48 PM] phm87#7395
then yesterday my buddy migrated the VPN entry point (server with pfsense) so I lost access to KMDLabs NN and to Chips daemon on my pool

[18-Oct-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
@Exile13 are you definitely giving up the spot?

[18-Oct-19 06:49 PM] phm87#7395
tomorrow, it should be OK on my side

[18-Oct-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
if it's over server costs, I'll rent you one?

[18-Oct-19 06:51 PM] Exile13#4458
Yes server costs, I owe @blackjok3r for this last month

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
don't think he's expecting that back üòÖ

[18-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
is that the only reason you don't want to run a node?

[18-Oct-19 07:36 PM] Oszy#5734
I mentioned yesterday I'd like a spot if there's one available, let me know so i can sort out a server this weekend

[18-Oct-19 08:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
np @Exile13  didnt expect it back.

[18-Oct-19 09:19 PM] Exile13#4458
Yes

[18-Oct-19 11:26 PM] CrisF#3405
I believe @Mylo and @ mrlynch#5735 were planning to form a team, and run for a spot.

[19-Oct-19 12:32 AM] CrisF#3405

I'd like to discuss the possibility of using some of the Dev fund for securing infrastructure for Labs.  To start with, servers.

Servers to be used for hosting the website, possibly hosting a backup means of comms (Matrix server?) and some testing servers (VM) for Dev work.

[19-Oct-19 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```
1440 blocks a day at frequency of 5 gives a maximum of 288 notarizations a day per chain.
1 KMD does maximum of 10,000 notarirzations for each node for 1 chain.
We are at minsig 7 of a max 13,  using an average of minsigs == 10. 
10,000 notarizations takes 34.7 days. 10KMD every 34.7 days per chain. 
365/34.7 = 10.5 
10.5*10 = 105KMD per year per chain. 
Increasing frequency to 10 blocks or using a 2min block time, halves that. 
6000 KMD pays ~300 KMD per year in rewards. 
We need > 6000KMD to pay for notarizations for 3 chains until rewards end. 
Then the 6000 will last another 20 years :joy:```

@blackjok3r, about how many chains do you think Labs (not other projects) would need to support over the next year or so?

{Reactions}
PeepoThink 

[19-Oct-19 01:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Not an easy question, but would give us an idea of a funding target.  Could of course be changed as needed.

[19-Oct-19 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well, as i state there, just notarizing less makes it cheaper so if need be we can decrease frequency or increase block time on some/all chains to make it last longer, so its kind of a moving target lol.

before we break the dPoW value

[19-Oct-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there isnt one? it could be any value, we use 5, but its a bit fast really... We setteled on 5 blocks to make cross chain stuff faster because waiting to test stuff sucks üòÑ

Hi guys,
 
I'll be attending a talk by Neo4j and Cogent Labs on 24 October.  

There should be a chance to ask questions during and afterwards.  If anyone has anything they'd like asked please let me know.  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator, https://neo4j.com/ looks right up your alley.  @Mylo, you may be interested in this also. 

Also, if you have and ideas on what Labs and KMD could offer them in terms of tech (specifics) please let me know . 
üôè

`so if need be we can decrease frequency or increase block time on some/all chains to make it last longer`
have we (NNs) even spent 2 KMD each on notarizations in the entire time since we started?

[19-Oct-19 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have yes. But I never kept track of it exactly. Easy to get off chain though. Maybe thats a better measure ü§î

[19-Oct-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  You wanted to write some code, extract how much it costs to notarize LABS. 
My napkin math is a maximum possible amount, not what actually is used.  Splitting less will also save lots of txfees üôÇ

[19-Oct-19 03:44 AM] gcharang#6833
thanks for the headsup @Alright my komodod was crashing constantly in the last month because of low ram and my counts were low before that because of location(singapore)
upgraded the server to 8 GB RAM recently
should stay above the threshold

[19-Oct-19 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
counts should not / are no longer affected by location.

[19-Oct-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it is, then its broken. My node is doing fine, with 80,000 txn in wallet and in just about the worst place I can place it.

[19-Oct-19 04:59 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, it is no longer affected

ill say... since lifting to the latest build, my node seems to have stopped being a potato after 2 days

[19-Oct-19 12:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
betting mine was the mem issue

[19-Oct-19 12:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
though it wouldnt crash because I gave the VM substantial  on disk cache on the M.2 drive

[19-Oct-19 12:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
Where are instructions for someone to submit their key? I have a candidate and am helping them build their VM and node now.
