or CEX stakes coins for users

[01-Mar-19 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
and again takes a %

[01-Mar-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So its simply only there to provide a full daemon thats always online?

[01-Mar-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with a staking pool ... what is the goal of it? `
100 people with 100 coins ....
10000 split 64 ways stakes better than 100 split 64

[01-Mar-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no other reason?

[01-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly

[01-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
more utxo always stakes better than less utxo

[01-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but a single wallet/staking loop can onyl handle so much on a give CPU core....

[01-Mar-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it gets to a point where it takes longer to process the utxos than ti does to buil;d a block, and you never find anything

[01-Mar-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`more utxo always stakes better than less utxo`
Well, that was me over simplifying, the idea is that the sum will carry larger weights over each UTXO

still getting ` [CFEKDIMXY] ABORTING!!! failed to update please build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh to see what problem is! Help Human! 
`
what am i doing wrong?

[01-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Really what we need is a way to have multiple wallets, then pass the miner loop a wallet to use... so you can stake with X cores using X walelts. Then a single node can have a million utxo providede it has enough cores avalible

[01-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure it worked for me 😂

[01-Mar-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can I get remote access to you node to try and debug it?

[01-Mar-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Your account has a new invoice in the amount of $70.72.`
heh, 3 servers and 1/2 the cost of what I spend on 🚬 
remind me again why any of us owns more than 1  physical PC?

[01-Mar-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so that somone cant delete your account

[01-Mar-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sure, sure; be all realistic and burst my happy bubble ☹

[01-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
this time last year you were all about "I don't use hardware I don't own"

[01-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
or I think you said you don't use computers you can't kick

[01-Mar-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that was before joker showed me a cheap DC and I was paying $1500 a year per dedicated

[01-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
something like that

[01-Mar-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, it was also before I started running a public pool that I don't want tied to my personal IP 😛

[01-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I have 1 VPS with them for ZEX pool... has been solid as 😃

[01-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
apart form that I prefer to just add VMs to my server...

[01-Mar-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with my bandwidth, I've decided my local server is pointless (I have 1/3 the ping time I had in the Sydney test and still have less notarizations than Sydney had); going back to remote in the next few days

[01-Mar-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah a fast connection is required

[01-Mar-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man im having a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to implemnt a fix for the MoMoM problem

[01-Mar-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
call dad

[01-Mar-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im my brain ... I keep comming back to one thing

[01-Mar-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should not be using notarization data that isnt notarized

[01-Mar-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems a extremely large change to the code though...

[01-Mar-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure I completely understand the problem, so I'm not much help

[01-Mar-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its actaully quite simple what it turned out to be

[01-Mar-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when you make an export transaction

[01-Mar-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot proceed past the "sign on KMD step" until the needed MoM hashes are confirmed on KMD

[01-Mar-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but iguana doesnt wait

[01-Mar-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the last notarization isnt conformed it just makes a notarization with NULL as the MoMoM hash

[01-Mar-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then the next notarization it just skips them, as ti onlg looks for 2 MoM's to create a MoMoM

[01-Mar-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wouldn't the "simple" fix be to wait if not confirmed?

[01-Mar-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the failed imports line up excatly with the nul MoMoM hashes on the target chain.

[01-Mar-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of...

[01-Mar-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its confirmed it can still; be reorged

[01-Mar-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the proper fix is to use a notarization that has been notarized to create all MoMoM hashes

[01-Mar-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its only a KMD daemon change...

[01-Mar-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KMd is already very slow...

[01-Mar-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
adding more limitations will slow it down even more

[01-Mar-19 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c Do you have a few minutes to discuss this ?

[01-Mar-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since iguana is making the tx, why would the change be in the daemon instead of iguana?

[01-Mar-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana will need a small change... but the easiest is to use the daemon to return iguana some kind of error to make it bail out

[01-Mar-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahh

[01-Mar-19 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the daemon has all the required data avalible in RAM to make a decisision quite fast

[01-Mar-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
where as iguana knows nothing

[01-Mar-19 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its  stupid lizard

[01-Mar-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[01-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a good thing to add

[01-Mar-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the only way to fix it that will properly fix it... but Im not sure how to do it

[01-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
iguana depends on komodod for all the MoM* stuff

[01-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
can you detect when it is likely to cause an error and then send back some message to skip a step?

[01-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
right now the iguana asks komodod for the MoMoM data to notarize

[01-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
alternatively maybe we can sidestep the issue by adding another notarization delay

[01-Mar-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have seperated the entire MoM logic to the database... which is a good start. technically all it needs to do is ignore the first ntoarization returned in the database... but as its on KMD that isnt exactly correct, as it neds to be notarized by a KMD checkpoint not the assetchain

[01-Mar-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the database it has a KMD height saved... so it should return an error unless the 2 MoM hashes it has chosen are notarized by the last KMD checkpoint

[01-Mar-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(symbol, ccid, kmdheight, moms, destNotarisationTxid);`

[01-Mar-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so it can return all 0 unless it is ready?

[01-Mar-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is 2 place is calls that... they need to bothreturn the exact same data 100% of the time

[01-Mar-19 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it already returns 0 when tis not ready, but the first 2 notarizations on the chain need to be 0

[01-Mar-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
an easy hack is to just enable MoMoM after some set height and make sure the chain is notarized before this height

[01-Mar-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so it is just an initial conditions issue?

[01-Mar-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then cancel the notarization if 0 is returned

[01-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the first 2 notartizations need to be mull MoMoM or the iguana cannot reach consensus

[01-Mar-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo is counting the total notarizations per chain, so if ( total_notarization < 2 ) send null to MoMoM calc ?

[01-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that works yes.

[01-Mar-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can set this bool to a static variable? so the first time it need to scan the DB then after that it just knows it has 2?

[01-Mar-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
static across restarts?

[01-Mar-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after a restart it scan the DB

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait no... that doesnt really work.. as each chain would need its own staic variable 🤔

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
sure, why not, it shouldnt take that long to scan

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
in the sp-> struct

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
each chain has its own sp-> data structure for this sort of thing

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is on the KMD daemon not the AC

[01-Mar-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I may have disabled that path totally

[01-Mar-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
oh...

[01-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt being used

[01-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MoM only uses the DB

[01-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so I made it only use that

[01-Mar-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it appears to be able to scan a very laerge amount of DB entries in like a millisecond, so maybe its not so bad to check each time...

[01-Mar-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, how about this:
on the first and second notarizations for a chain, make a DB entry symbol.first <- notarization, symbol.second <- notarization
if both those exist, then 2+ have been done
and on new notarization if first and second are not there, make first. if first is there but second isnt, make second

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Mar-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems fine... implementation still needed but this is a good start

[01-Mar-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I could add an extra entry in the notarisation DB structure that is just a bool flag.

[01-Mar-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once 2 happened... sets to true

[01-Mar-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only have to scan back 1 notarization and if true, then MoMoM is calulated

[01-Mar-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if not MoMoM is null... 
if MoMoM is null when true tell iguana to cancel round

[01-Mar-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what about the timing of MoMom can we delay it by 1 notarization without any illl effects?

[01-Mar-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i was always nervous about the aggresive timing for MoMoM, i think making it wait for another notarization at a critical time, should make it a lot more stable

[01-Mar-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it simply needs to do this

[01-Mar-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no possible way to have it work pefectly without the data its using to be 100% relaible... ie. it must be notarized

[01-Mar-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, good.

[01-Mar-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its just a case of making sure both calls to `    uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(symbol, ccid, kmdheight, moms, destNotarisationTxid);`

[01-Mar-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are checking for the same condition

[01-Mar-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then in can never fail
