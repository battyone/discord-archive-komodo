[03-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Alright#0419
Hi guys, we've got this new thing called staked :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Alright#0419
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] Mylo#8306
why can't we call it STAKED1, STAKED2, STAKED3 etc...

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once libscott is here it will go back to that I think...

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we had to stop, until MoMoM was working perfectly

[03-Oct-18 04:28 PM] Mylo#8306
i meant channel names :trollface: 
when is libscott due back?

[03-Oct-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`why can't we call it STAKED1, STAKED2, STAKED3 etc...` Because April, May, and June has come and gone

[03-Oct-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe another week I think... The fix is known hes the onyl uy who can code it though

[03-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Mylo#8306
ah no problems.
so when you guys "bust a chain", you just spin them up.  you rarely rebuild from scripts?  i'm just asking to make a docker image, seems easy enough

[03-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, saw someone was just using the explorers

[03-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
restarting them, couple minutes

[03-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo what do you mean by rebuild from scripts

[04-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo this system is full automatic, you just start it and you have a new chain.

[04-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so far removing them is a little mor complicated, beause you have to stop it then start it again üòõ

[04-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright is working on an Oracles CC based DAPP where you just create your chain, then submit the chain params to an oracle and the notaries will automatically add it and start dPoW.

[04-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That could e some timeoff though, but is a very nice idea.

[04-Oct-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
List of jobs for today:
1) fix start.sh problems (longest chain =0 and on first run make sure iguana is built)
2) Repo for tesing, to launch the chains with std out etc 
3) Read up on CC + channels while waiting for everyone to update

[04-Oct-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I am really struggling with that change you pushed to `start.sh` like it doesnt even work at all LOL

[04-Oct-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand how it updates the progress part... is seems to be an infinate loop

[04-Oct-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I will just redo the whole thing from scratch

The longest chain could sometimes return 0 which makde the scrip bail out

[04-Oct-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and that was no good for autoadding chains

[04-Oct-18 05:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Latest of the first half is in startStaked under lazy folder

[04-Oct-18 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used "most" of your code but put it into functions.

[04-Oct-18 05:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I changed it to check blocks instead I think. Will have to remind self when home

[04-Oct-18 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, the version I just pushed is working, you saved me a lot of time, by already having all the logic, but I guess the merged verison to StakedNotary was missing some parts.

[04-Oct-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seemed to work, in production, but when I went making it not work on purpose it was flakey

[04-Oct-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been wprking through the scripts adding error checks based on problems Cmaurice had trying to get started

[04-Oct-18 05:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Yeah ive changed heaps of stuff since that pr. Been holding off on submitting more until i test / add readme to things

[04-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries. Look forward to more contributions üòÉ

[04-Oct-18 06:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Looking forward to contributing whatever's useful. Still a bit vague on channels cc, as my tests last night were with the undocumented master repo, so I just tried to figure out what the command order was and how it works. I'm sure tonight/tomorrow will be much more enlightening. I assume I'll need two separate nodes/wallets to test it properly. Fortunately I've got a spare for my `flir2qr` project which I can put Staked on. I've moved dev of that repo onto our corporate server so it's pretty much idle right now.

[04-Oct-18 06:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Will have to spend some time on it before monday before the next flight tho...

decided to foucus on squashing bugs for today before getting my hadns dirty on more stuff

[04-Oct-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems best to finish off other things first.

[04-Oct-18 06:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it's ok, in relative terms. I've definitely slaved harder for less, and probably 90% of the world does so I cant complain too loudly

[04-Oct-18 06:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my 3 tasks right now are studying up on CC, finalising and documenting stuff in kmd_pulp and finishing up flir2qr front end. Not having a car anymore means I should be more housebound than usual until insurance sorts things out, so should get a fair bit done over the next week or two.

I am pretty happy with `start.sh` now its just about fool proof.. Although there can always be a bigger idiot. 
We need to test adding a chain and an era change at some point with diffrent pubkeys.

@blackjok3r In case you are still looking into this
`iguana VIRT 3099M   RES 179m`
I've updated with origin/master on both.

[04-Oct-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, james just dismissed all my findings and said there was no problem so I am just not looking into it anymore... I guess I need to never restart my mainnet notary until the "iguana has stopped working" bug appears then try and find out why

[04-Oct-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok also seem to have my stats server and blocknotify working.

[04-Oct-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  is there a reason you are leaveing old chains in `assetchains.json` in `komodo/src`

[04-Oct-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have finally got my blocknotify to work by passing it block hash, so it no longer dupes blocks üòÑ and also takes $2 as the chain name so I can use the same script for every chain.

[04-Oct-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
103.6.12.112 is now an extra seednode that can be added to `assetchains.json`

Those scripts might be very helpful for anyone wanting to run a seed node for the chains.

[04-Oct-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
obviously you dont really need the blockcnotify stuff, but its simple enough to remove it.

[04-Oct-18 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r yes, I leave explorers up for the deded chains

[04-Oct-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, because of that 103.6.12.112 syncs them, and hosts a copy of the chain as I used the assetchains.json from komodo repo rather than StakedNotary

[04-Oct-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was just less to code, far less

[04-Oct-18 09:26 PM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator and channels cc testers, you've probablyseen this further info, but just in case...

Will probably start on some channels stuff today, it depends on how I got with iguana, I found some interesting thing by accident late last night i want to check out.

[05-Oct-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha nar, there is an error that occurs on main net and I figured out how to make it happen although its the same error its not exactly the same as its not breaking the notarsations completely just making the error happen on a single node

[05-Oct-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But its a good lead that needs some investigation either way, whole bunch of depreciated code thats in iguana, seems removing it can only help things as long as it doesn't totally break them, which is why it hasn't been removed already

[05-Oct-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is made a few...

[05-Oct-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am still seeing script verify errors, but I already know they are form other nodes.

[05-Oct-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... I didnt do this peroperly by any means... I just did a search project of `isratify` and `ratifying` and commented out or removed all of it'

[05-Oct-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue james told em last night that it was depreciated... and if ratify or isratify is somwhow accidently set, it makes the node bail out of a round..

[05-Oct-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And my node has always been shite because it keep bailing out of rounds

[05-Oct-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I figured that not letting it bail out has to be better

[05-Oct-18 03:25 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
commenting each line/section of code, now there's year-long endeavor

[05-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it might use a bit more system resource... but seriously it already uses nothing but ram, because of what seems like a poor design choice of storing each round in ram for too long.

[05-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think to do this properly... you need to start at `dpow_statemachinestart`

[05-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
find wher that is called... and follow each function

[05-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and copy that to a new code base

[05-Oct-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you dont ahve all the old crap... but the problem is that how iguana does its RPC calls and stuff is all hidden all over the place... its a miassive undertaking

[05-Oct-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just keep increaseing in ram use for no valid reaosn

[05-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should only need the current notarisation satemachine and the on before it.. not hundreds of them

[05-Oct-18 03:28 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`it just keep increaseing in ram use for no valid reaosn`
Same issue that mm used to have maybe?

[05-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well maybe its not hundreds buts a lot... some top nodes iguana is using 8Gb of ram

[05-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no its not a memleak

[05-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because it caps out after a while

[05-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked seems to use about 1.5Gb after a couple of days of running and stop increasing

[05-Oct-18 03:29 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
iirc the one ram issue wasn't a leak, but that mm kept allocating more in a loop/call somewhere (it's been so long I honestly forget)

[05-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
james said specifically it was because the iguana saves its statemachine allocation until some delay before freeing it back up

[05-Oct-18 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
ahh

[05-Oct-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless it bails out of a rounc, then it free s instantly.. .and *I think* this is the cause of instability and script verify errors

[05-Oct-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont let the statemachine end, and force it to continue until time out, it might make things work better.

[05-Oct-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
script verify errors are missning data

[05-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
most propbably caused by a netowrk issue

[05-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe not... they dont happen very often when all nodes have been runnign for a very long time without restart... as soon as people start updateing and restarting a lot. they happen frequently.

[05-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was the mission yes

[05-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

dpow was added onto a mess.

[05-Oct-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the dpow code itself isnt that bad... but what it was built on... is terrible

[05-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems very difficult without a lot of time spent
