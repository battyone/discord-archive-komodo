some flag

[30-Nov-19 12:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
just checking to see any addresses  have huge UTXO amounts in them

[30-Nov-19 12:30 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so I guess  I learn bash then json then  py

[30-Nov-19 12:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
actually - screw pythoin

[30-Nov-19 12:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`reindexing from 0`
why?
there's no need to recheck the entire block database because you're having wallet issues and not block issues

[30-Nov-19 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I cant see the top of the ouput`
what "top" of what output? in what terminal/screen/tmux?

[30-Nov-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so I am just googling how to keep the output for unlimited charaacters`
huh?

[30-Nov-19 12:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just checking to see any addresses have huge UTXO amounts in them`
...
```komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listunspent|jq '[map(select((.amount|tonumber) > 15)) | .[] | {address,txid,vout,amount}]'
[
  {
    "address": "RLabsCGxTRqJcJvz6foKuXAB61puJ2x8yt",
    "txid": "3006151eb72e72bcdacc1dd656df1a851c2e826a4a224b70f48fcf6878eb9d26",
    "vout": 103,
    "amount": 23.42540952
  }
]```

[30-Nov-19 12:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just change 15 to whatever number and the {} bits to whatever you want to see

[30-Nov-19 12:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this would all be so much better to and for you if you'd just:
```ComputerGenie Today at 3:42 PM
do one thing, then move on to the next thing```

[30-Nov-19 01:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i am  trying to remember the save to json command from  testing mm1 --  it  is all coming back -- too freaking slowly - but learning quicker than yesterday

[30-Nov-19 01:27 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
tada!!!        >  UTXOs.json   added

[30-Nov-19 01:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok  cool

[30-Nov-19 01:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
now I can  see all UTXOs ---  would like to consolidate all UTXOs < 1  and  > 20   and  would  like  to see segid in json output  -  and a freaking  UTXO id  if  there  is a way to extract 1  utxo from this pile with  a  consolidate code  for the hash or the TX id or however they are identified - then I can move this data to a spreadsheet and play really well  with it...

[30-Nov-19 01:53 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and why does every address have the same size UTXOs in them again?   isnt that a not so good idea? RNDsendmany.py should add 1/64 utxo size per address for each base UTXO size picked -   or is there a genious reason there are 64 identical UTXOs?

[30-Nov-19 01:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or 63 or whatever

[30-Nov-19 01:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im going to mess with the math and test it tonight

[30-Nov-19 02:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
age would  be awesome data to have extracted as well

[30-Nov-19 02:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`date -d @$(komodo-cli gettransaction txid|jq .blocktime)`

[30-Nov-19 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
e.g.:
`$ date -d @$(komodo-cli gettransaction 1900d0a8264ed1b5c6b68632281563ad34cf311aedfe596afab4ec3f32c136fa|jq .blocktime)
Thu 28 Nov 2019 06:59:00 AM CST`

[30-Nov-19 02:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
putting all this in my help files

[30-Nov-19 02:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
to build an active spread sheet - maybe tomorrow

[30-Nov-19 03:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
that  is an .sh?  I had to add  <./>   --  fek  yeah $ date -d @$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS gettransaction f22d2397a13acd84438a5e030968e95fb7881858b89e9e42ccc0e85a29fe0eff|jq .blocktime)
Fri Nov 29 02:16:06 EST 2019

[30-Nov-19 03:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
now  I learn  to create a bash to put it all into a csv file or someting -- ill ponder the best way  -

[30-Nov-19 03:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i understand  a shit pile  more today

[30-Nov-19 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I had to add <./>`
after you run the build.sh file, you can run `sudo make install` and it will put it in `usr/local/bin` an  terminal/bash will be able to run it from anywhere (no more need for ./)
but if you do that you will have to remember to do it each time you update or else it will not be updated in the bin directory

[30-Nov-19 05:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I am going to make an .sh or .py --- I really do not need the dates - I can use confirmations to see how "old" they are.

[30-Nov-19 05:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listunspent|jq -cr '.|[map(select(.))]|.[]|sort_by(.confirmations)[]|{segid,amount,address,confirmations,txid}' > UTXOs.json

[30-Nov-19 05:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
json2xlsx UTXOs.ts -l -j UTXOs.json -o UTXOs.xlsx --open

[30-Nov-19 05:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
have  my data in spreadsheet now I can look at whats up

[30-Nov-19 05:05 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
reorganizing UTXOs to coincide with data output and will add more Emanually

[30-Nov-19 05:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think I can let this puppy rest for a few days now

[30-Nov-19 05:07 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
If anyone knows how to run scripts in cells LMK - would like to import timestamp

[30-Nov-19 05:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
you can gscript it to sheets

[30-Nov-19 05:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
or python to get the data into an array... then push the array into CSV format.

[30-Nov-19 05:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
and vice versa

[30-Nov-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`=(((timestamp/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)` where 'timestamp' is the block time and 'DATE' is a literal (so don't change the word 'DATE')
and then just format it in any combination of MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS you want

[30-Nov-19 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, end your jq with `| @csv' > UTXOs.csv` instead of a .json and Bob's your uncle

[30-Nov-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/> will be your friend

[30-Nov-19 05:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Bob  is my uncle

[30-Nov-19 05:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how did you know

[30-Nov-19 05:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
today I learn how to  gscript

[30-Nov-19 05:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I thought maybe CURL or json to get data to a GUI eventually --- I guess CSV then somehow get the timestamp and txid to match up so I can send raw transactions easier ---  does KO use any UTXO rawtracnsation shit?  I havent even opened it

[30-Nov-19 06:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks  like gscripts it is

[30-Nov-19 06:05 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I need to learn that for my real company anyway

[30-Nov-19 06:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
GSCRIPT IS NICE...

[30-Nov-19 06:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
caps lmao sorry

[30-Nov-19 06:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
I used gscript to pull API calls from several exchanges and made a sheet to agregate my own dashboard data

[30-Nov-19 06:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
i stopped updating it so most of the calls are deprecated now... and I can no longer get a live BTC USD feed from Coinbase like I was before... and I dont feel like redoing it anyways now that the prices stuff is in KMD.

[30-Nov-19 06:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
Eventually i do need to fix it though... new sources and pulling from my own KMD node from adex

[30-Nov-19 07:51 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
----going with Python to parse .json data and run simple .py, .js, .sh scripts from there -- you can import/parse http shit too....  will  use spreadsheet to verify scripts --- >>kmdkrazy  komputing<< gunna  have to fork  some chains in a few weeks ---  ⌨️

[30-Nov-19 07:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks  like i need a script editor to change variables easier ---

[30-Nov-19 11:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao looks like I mined the same block twice???

[30-Nov-19 11:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
0b414a64f31ef89b92ee4e296fe4af265f8a50ed4a0086d5972622c6b21a23c1 mined LABS block 260513!

0cb7e1d5d9dae8aef205e0196a3575ae29107b0e380f5c8dda7382532c338b2b mined LABS block 260513!
503445858 block.nBits vs. calc 503443776 for block #260514

[30-Nov-19 11:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope... somehow I orphaned the same block... twice...

[30-Nov-19 11:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
I dont own the address for the stake that moved nor the address of the gen'd coins... lame

[30-Nov-19 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I dont own the address for the stake that moved nor the address of the gen'd coins..`
I am certain that you cannot mine a block if the former is true
not sure about using a pubkey you don't own though

[30-Nov-19 11:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless

[30-Nov-19 11:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by `somehow I orphaned the same block... twice...` you actually mean `somehow I *had* the same block ophaned... twice...` and that you don't own the addys of the block that was succesful 🤔

[01-Dec-19 01:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
Yes I orphaned the same block with two different utxos, and someone else with a third is the one on the explorer... just weird I managed to orphan two different utxos for the same block

170 accounts grabbed 1 LABS already... was going quick but seems to have stopped for now

[01-Dec-19 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
200 now... i assume Graviex has some people with shill accounts... but not bad. as a measure of interest. 90 minutes since I put it up and 20% collected.

[01-Dec-19 10:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
`90 minutes since I put it up and 20% collected` bots maybe?!

[01-Dec-19 10:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
it has captcha and it deposits to your Graviex balance...

[01-Dec-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
So while i wont rule that out... I doubt too many of them are in fact bots

[01-Dec-19 10:37 PM] phm87#7395
on hide my ass, there are 200 IP to use for free (free proxy)

[01-Dec-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
gotta be logged in

2  hours  to figure out I deleted  a    )   ---  I  either need classes, glasses or both

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
thats mildly funny... at least you found it!

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
You using an editor to assist?

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
not funny at all -

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
I like vim

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i bought Sublime

[02-Dec-19 12:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
and on Win side Notepad++ is a godsend

[02-Dec-19 12:49 AM] phm87#7395
if you use git, make a git diff to see what you changed

[02-Dec-19 12:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it didnt catch it

[02-Dec-19 12:49 AM] phm87#7395
if you began by git clone a repo then you can do it if you edited files from the repo

[02-Dec-19 12:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I programmed back in the day ---

[02-Dec-19 12:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
... IDK... all i know is I have never had a hung or mising close tag of any sort I wasnt alerted to in Notepad++ and vim seems to be pretty good at it too

[02-Dec-19 12:50 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just  missed  the  ) end of the command and the  error  output came as the next command

[02-Dec-19 12:50 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so I  chased  that for awhile

[02-Dec-19 12:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
anyway --- i thought my editing skill  were  great ---  Ill  start another github account and link it to Sublime
