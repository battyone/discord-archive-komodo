what color-blind person thought up this subtle color scheme?

I neded it... For the large network... It was extemly difficult to see what was happenong when the screne was scrolling hundreds of pages a minute at times. 
The colours are all wrong btw... Dont make a lot of sense... 
If you do a search in SuperNET for `"RESET` with case sensitive on, you can see all the prints where I added colour and change the colour to whatever you want.

Green -> Teal```
My eye is like "why bother with the teal?" üòõ

[20-Aug-19 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Becuuse when there are a good number of nodes up that print will not show.. It only prints if the K is shfted to an online node

[20-Aug-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its working. The most important thing we need to be on the look out for is that the :
`Random seed: 18 12 3 18 3 13 8 5 16 8 20 17 10 15 12 18 18 18 17 15 7 19 8 10 19 6 1 3 19 12 15 16`
Is agreeing on all nodes.

[20-Aug-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still not 100% sure how best to log that... I was thinking to make the oiguana directly curl it to a webserver or DB or something ü§∑

[20-Aug-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if its notarizing... then its working

[20-Aug-19 03:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
After `./start.sh` CFEKMYLO is not running and I have no screen session neither (screen is installed)

[20-Aug-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
does 'screen' scroll back not work or does it only not work when inside tmux pane?

[20-Aug-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry but you will need to debug it youself.. I know noting about screen myself... took me hours of tial and error to get this working

[20-Aug-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
screen is not scrolling with tmux mouse no... Anoying... trying to find  as solution

[20-Aug-19 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
`CRTL + A` then `ESC` to scroll for screen

[20-Aug-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not if its inside tmux

[20-Aug-19 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, screen inside a tmux is not a good idea

[20-Aug-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems good to me... But need to change the hot keys

[20-Aug-19 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
