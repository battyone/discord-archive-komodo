in that case we might need to adjust the algo a bit

[18-Dec-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems safe enough here... doing some last code checks and stuff and will push for you ghuys to test

[18-Dec-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
liekly this may alklow stakign nodes to do more than just stake aswell.

[18-Dec-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the stakign nodes all start stkingt and just keep on staking... regardless of weather a block has been received in that time`
iirc, that was intentional...
You keep rechecking what you can do  (a new 90 check with every loop iirc) until a block comes in and then you start with the new hash

[18-Dec-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant see a block comming in in the current state

[18-Dec-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now it can

[18-Dec-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire daemon is locked... it only is a real issue when the stakign loop takes a long time (5000+ utxos)

[18-Dec-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but now there is 0 issue

[18-Dec-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
regardless of the number of uitxos

[18-Dec-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you couldn't see an incoming block, then you'd fork or reorg any time you had a valid block in x seconds 😕

[18-Dec-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats exactlk what happens

[18-Dec-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
these chains reorg liek crazy

[18-Dec-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is also why the wallet fucks up

[18-Dec-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
creating and then erasing txs all the time

[18-Dec-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm limited to CFEK, but I don't recall the last time I saw a reorg

[18-Dec-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😕

[18-Dec-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
either way I know 100% that the chaintip updated and break from staking loop was not happening before I fixed the lcok up

[18-Dec-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ive been watching th print for days

[18-Dec-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will be pushed to test soon

[18-Dec-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can check it

[18-Dec-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
vast improvemnmt I promise

[18-Dec-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, I see what you mean now, I thought you meant it wasn't *ever* stopping (i.e. not even checking *between* loops)

[18-Dec-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basicallyt what happened is this:
create block is called
deamon is locked until block is created
during this process near teh end of create block the staking loop is called
the staking loop takes up to 10-25 even 30s to complete
dureing this time the deamon is locked
no RPC calls no block received nothing, locked.

what happens now
Create blcok is called
half way though the process the deamon lock is relaesed and the staking loop is called

[18-Dec-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
up side to this seems to be that whenever a block is created its now valid

[18-Dec-18 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
before it created lots and lots of stale/invlid blocks

[18-Dec-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still hasn't seen this lockup you keep referring to since POSTEST64C, so he'll have to take your word for that bit_

[18-Dec-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It also apperars that the lock probably use to end where I moved it to ... but as thigns were added to the function they were included in the lock, becaseu tehre are variables inside that set of {}

[18-Dec-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I had to do was move some of these variables outside the lock to be declared

[18-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to affect anything... maybe if a block was received at the exact nano second the chain tip was fetched there might be an issue

[18-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`chain tip changed during staking loop t.1545136006 counter.0`

[18-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you didnt see that print then it was happening

[18-Dec-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm thinking that you caught genieitis and you're now in that land where shit only happens to you like it usually only happens to me 😛

I kind of deliberatly made it do these things

[18-Dec-18 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as tehere is no other way to fix it

[18-Dec-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I kind of deliberatly made it do these things`
ahhhhh, see, now that makes more sense 😂

[18-Dec-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you pushing to the absolute limtis you cant really find bugs

[18-Dec-18 01:53 PM] CrisF#3405
I had a few lockups on CFEK.  One required a reboot.  Wasn't able to stop komodod on that one.  pkills did nothing.  On others could ^C and then send commands.

[18-Dec-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every single staking node will "lock"

[18-Dec-18 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`unless you pushing to the absolute limtis you cant really find bugs`
I don't disagree, at all, but I've been reading what you've been writing for the last couple/few days as if you were just running "normally" and seeing this going on (which is why I keep saying thing's like "I don't see that", "get an Intel", etc)

[18-Dec-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but they should be exiting.... wait a little bit and this new version should fix the l;ast of it

[18-Dec-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just need to test a fresh sync

[18-Dec-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did see some werid shit before when syncong CFEK

[18-Dec-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can anyopne flood a few thousand txs on CFEK ?

[18-Dec-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
while true loop on sendtoaddress will do it

[18-Dec-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait dw about it

[18-Dec-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll do it meyself... this node is probably too isolated for it to even work

[18-Dec-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol who is doing that

[18-Dec-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: nonstandard transaction: sapling-version`

[18-Dec-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's not me, but I'm running
`while :; do ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK sendtoaddress RBdHcrEGdPpAYBjckQhXcaJG3AD213JyHU 0.000001 "" false; done`
for what the slow "flood" is worth lol

[18-Dec-18 02:24 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll set off a migration loop before heading off.

its my other node syncing

[18-Dec-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEK getmempoolinfo | jq '.size'
1401`
good enough or more?

[18-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as it syncs it adds all txs intothe mempool and htey muyst be trying to probagate to the other ndoe, its on connect =

[18-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok

[18-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll spam in this other node

[18-Dec-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if it was going to lock it would ahve done so by now in any case

[18-Dec-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are some huge blocks in CFEK near the end... taking an eternity to validate

[18-Dec-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wonder if this is anoter bug 😂

[18-Dec-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
slow performance isnt actually a bug, just slow performance

[18-Dec-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I will see what txs they are... my guess is oracle spam form smks dApp

[18-Dec-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have merged FSM to staked and pushed the ram staker fixes. You need 1000 utxo to activate the ram staker, it lasts 10 minutes or resets after you mine a block.

[18-Dec-18 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have fit over 1000 tx in a block and its not locking up. CFEK sync a a bit slow though, and it seems to lock up on some blocks and pion a CPU core. after 95% synced.

[18-Dec-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will investigate that tomorrow

[18-Dec-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hoptefully its nothing

[18-Dec-18 10:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, there's probably a few chocker blocks for the day the gps spoofing loop lost sleep on

[18-Dec-18 10:44 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
been keeping an eye on and it's been behaving since tho

[18-Dec-18 10:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will likely need  a dedicated chain, or maybe more than one, when it starts to scale up in users

[19-Dec-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'd still like to investigate what txs make it get stuck that long on a block, its pretty intense hang up, like its not like that block is 10mb or something

[19-Dec-18 03:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I can try spamming again tonite. The txs were from the write2oracle fuction

[19-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fixed another long outstanding bug

[19-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When I asked james to put segid into getblock

[19-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it always returns -2

[19-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
turns out the segid inside the block index is NEVER set

[19-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed that...

{Reactions}
👍🏽 (2) 

[19-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this also had the effect that the `getlastsegidstakes` RPC is now about 1000x faster

[19-Dec-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ity no longer has to fetch the entire block from disk but rather only iterate down the index. 😎

[19-Dec-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught this might be some hard forking change... but it does not appear to be the case... the code has a backup and actually every time it checks for segid, had to fully process the entire block

[19-Dec-18 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to calculate the segid for it.

[19-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this should speed things up no end

[19-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sync times are already faster ...

[19-Dec-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These changes are now getting so far off jl777/FSM that I dont even know how to merge this down

maybe we just keep this as :trollface:

[19-Dec-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```    for (int64_t i = chainActive.Height(); i >  chainActive.Height()-depth; i--)
    {
        CBlockIndex* pblockindex = chainActive[i];
        if ( pblockindex->segid >= 0 )
            segids[pblockindex->segid] += 1;
    }``` 
😄

[19-Dec-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was a weird bug

[19-Dec-18 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was trying to load the block from disk before it had even been processed and added to the chain

[19-Dec-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so simply returning PoW for every PoS block ... once this is resynced on CFEK i will try to stake with it and see if it forks off

[19-Dec-18 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wow that getsegidstakes RPC is  instant even for the entire chain 😮

[19-Dec-18 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my brain is shot and my grep skills blow; what's the komodo max tx byte size?

[19-Dec-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not actually sure

[19-Dec-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Raise 100kB transaction size limit from Sapling activation

[19-Dec-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe?

[19-Dec-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
200kb

[19-Dec-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
saapling tx are al;lowed to be 2x the old size
