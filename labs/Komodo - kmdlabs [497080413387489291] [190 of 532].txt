I'll check your pool code when I get home

yeah, I've been playing with the code but no luck yet. hoping @NutellaLicka  has seen the error and knows a fix

[04-Jan-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a feeling know what it is

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
was using zcash code on git as refrence, but they dont have the disablecb

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What happened was when I found a corrupt tx it just flagged a full rescan which never actually fixed the problem.. I guess they never anticipated wallets with millions of transactions in the. Lol

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so flow is a bit different

[04-Jan-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I "broke" the stratum protocol with that pool lol, its a few lines of java script to fix that error. Just waiting on a pizza then walk home will let u know

[04-Jan-19 11:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers dude. I'll focus on getting DH back up then. sounds like @TonyL  has migration covered so I"ll fall back on that.

Your pool should be using my stratum already

[04-Jan-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... this is why I said not to use notary for testoing ... you can disable it by making min sats a massive number or set youself whitelist address

I'll  spin off fecked nodes üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should accept all transactions from your -pubkey (and pretty much only this address, it ignores absolutly everything )

[04-Jan-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stops DWY attack against notary nodes... which is the single and only viable attack that someone can do to stop notarisations

[04-Jan-19 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless they comprimise a notary node... then a sig attack can be done, already have way to stop this attack aswell, just need to make it... was put down list

[04-Jan-19 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh,  have sense

[04-Jan-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its needs to have a flag to disable it, incase someone wants to use notary for toehr things ... its unlikey a testnet will be attacked, unless one of us attacks it :trollface:

I am going to make centrel server for these RPCs on KMD and target chain, so you only need the source chain to make the  tx ... the burn TX can be made by light client aswell, its not a complex one.

Currently you need 3 daemons runnign full nodes to complete a migrate.... but much for an end user

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD expecially thse days is using 3GB of ram alone

[04-Jan-19 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah it's true - bottleneck in my GUIs as well

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Need some SPV solution

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly easy

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for migrates... the tx is signed early on.... on the source! alone

[04-Jan-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so a server with no wallet and some kind of rate limiter on connections can provide the rest of the steps

[04-Jan-19 12:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Wallet auth via not VPN tunnel seems as a security rekt imo

[04-Jan-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577

[04-Jan-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a all I need for my GUIs to run it even on kettle - RPC connection to remote daemon

But problem to do it safu üòÉ

[04-Jan-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
So actually not hardcoding path to komodod principally to be motivated for better solution and be flexible in remote server choice

[04-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah for most CC txs you need the daemon wallet üò¶ 
We are lucky for migrates we don't apart from the creation of import tx on source chain, so I can make it at least that they only need the chain being sent from, everything else can work with explorers and my KMD server with RPC for public... I will disable all wallet functions from this node, it will be an explorer node with RPC access for signing migrate on KMD step (this requires no wallet)

@CMaurice Blackjok3r and Tony were discussing using a NN above. ```I bet the wallet filter skipped it
https://github.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary#wallet-filter``` ```yeah... this is why I said not to use notary for testoing ... you can disable it by making min sats a massive number or set youself whitelist address```  It sounds possible but would involve changing the wallet filter.
