Lol - reminds me of when I told a french guy we were `all in the same boat` and he replied that we were currently land-locked.

Hey all

[26-Dec-18 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
Finally wrapped up moving, got all the networking abck up and servers online

[26-Dec-18 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
no idea where you all are at in this stuff? Where should I pick up at?

Hi, looks like stress testing Momom is the next thing on the agenda.

[26-Dec-18 10:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Webworker01 & ComputerGenie have sorted out the utxosplitter.

[26-Dec-18 10:56 PM] CrisF#3405
4 chains in the cluster atm.

[26-Dec-18 11:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
k once I get all these wallets back in sync ill redeploy my NN

[26-Dec-18 11:12 PM] CrisF#3405
👍

[27-Dec-18 01:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah for now just keep notaries up, and stake or mine on cfek so you have balance, maybe we should deploy new 0br chains for stress test, I might do that today. It will be better to have smaller chains to test with so we can get lots of small vps to migrate in vast numbers.

[27-Dec-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I implemented the stubs for chains that implement selfimporting (for lack of better terminology). for now there is no validation when the -ac_import=PUBKEY option is used. Once the normal crosschain tx creations are verified to work, then I will add the validation for this mode. What it will rely on is that the -ac_pubkey=pubkey has signed the vin0 for the burnTx. This then allows any type of centralized coin creation, ie. via website, via oracles data of any interpretation, etc.

jl777 branch

[27-Dec-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the -ac_import=PUBKEY is literal, so that string exactly is needed to enable this mode

[27-Dec-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i also added stubs for GATEWAY, which will allow 1:1 sidechains to be created

[28-Dec-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know what this means... This is for having one key that can create as many coins as it likes using a Import (but without a burn) ?

[28-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We will need to do the MoMoM stress test before we can test this, just incase it causues any issues with that.

[28-Dec-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need a stable daemon we can use the launch the main chain. It seems I have one last "lock up" bug left to find, and I'm not looking forward to it at all as I have no idea what does it or where it could even be. 😦

[28-Dec-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Even though we no longer need it, I have merged the fix for ac_split into our supernet fork.

[28-Dec-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No need to update unless you want to.

[28-Dec-18 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems after restarting everything I have not encountered the daemon lock up bug again. Please be on the look out for this, and let me know. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I think it was only me and you that its happened to. It was on a daemon that was PoW mining, but has never happened to a staking node.

[28-Dec-18 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to have another look at that peers thing.... I have a feeling simply removing the fixed peers from our daemon will help... But genie's idea of simply removing a node from the peers list after it does not respond could also work.

[28-Dec-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Found a much cleaner way to disable DNS seeds, but I am really not convinced thats the problem tbh.

[28-Dec-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you clear peers.dat and then let it run. after a long enough time all these IP's end up back in your peers list, and the node just tries to connect to them. Seems to be a low level BTC network thing, not sure its worth me wastign time on. If i'm going to so anything with networking code., I should be trying to disable the mempool on InistalBlockDownload, maybe i will find the answer to this other problem of trying to connect to dead nodes constantly, by accident later on 😃

[28-Dec-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thiunk I have solved this problem.... Was looking in the wrong place... But man, learning a lot about BTC interals with all this lol.

In any case, its fixed now.. but god that was a tricky one... at least 1.5 days of going in circles.. But upside I know how another part of BTC works.

does that also fix the "socket sending timeout" lockup?

[28-Dec-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure at all... the print, is a symptom not a cause

[28-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those are ona  diffrent thread that seems not locked by `cs_main`

[28-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so continue to try doing something until they time out

[28-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont ahve any nodes in that condition any more

[28-Dec-18 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just find it odd that it's only on 2 chains and always those 2

[28-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same

[28-Dec-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its rare enough we cna procced with it there and hopefully the cause becomes apparent later on... or disppears entirly. These chains are pretty screwed up, the fact they even sync and work still is amazing tbh.

[28-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r have you tried using different burnamount than is funded, specifically claiming you burned more than actually burned? reading the code either I am understanding it backwards, or the check is making sure you dont burn less than the actual coins burned, but maybe it allows to claim that more coins were burned ?

[28-Dec-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All we have tested is that using it properly works

[28-Dec-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
migrate_converttoexport rawTx dest export_amount

[28-Dec-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the export_amount maybe can be set to more than was in the vins

[28-Dec-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because that didn't work we needed to test that first and fix it

[28-Dec-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
should be easy enough to test bigger and smaller export_amounts and see what happens

[28-Dec-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries can try this. Thanks for checking it...

[28-Dec-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looking at this soon, why does export amount even need to be there lol?

[28-Dec-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Because I had the script tbh ice never checked any of this myself only asked others to do so. Guess I should check all of it before we launch ha.

[28-Dec-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont want to be burning coins permanently

[28-Dec-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but we also dont want to import coins that werent burned.

[28-Dec-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it needs to be an == with adjustment for txfee

[28-Dec-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will have a play with it...  shoudl be trivial to make a transaction on a modified node with ridiculous deamnds and see if it is accepted by the network.

[28-Dec-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might also be a good time to retest dice with a dice tx blaster after the mempool fixes.

[28-Dec-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if many nodes can all bet using the same entropy in vast numbers without any coins being created then it should be proven safe.

[28-Dec-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I've run through how to trick it in my head a heap of times and I think creating an random environment where it has a chance to happen is the easiest... just how to track it in a controlled manner thats hard.

[28-Dec-18 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Would the `coinsupply` RPC wortk for that? It counts every utxo right? I ran it on KMD and it took a very very long time to finish.

[28-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the first time it will do a rescan

[28-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you call it with a height it just does it up to that height

[28-Dec-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
gettxoutset is much faster

[28-Dec-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes understood.. But say I was to create a chain with a supply, with no block reward then carry out a million dice transactions with conflicting ones made diliberatly in vast numbers. Then just call it again after it was finished... if the supply was equal then its confirmed workign. ?

[28-Dec-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it would just confirm no new coins were created

[28-Dec-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
not that each dicebet was properly resolved

[28-Dec-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes which is what I think we need to prove right?

[28-Dec-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont care about zaddr, just use gettxoutset

[28-Dec-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how dice applies to crosschain burn/imports

[28-Dec-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the condition that allows coins to be created from the mempool fix, if indeed it can happen is:
1) tx invalid (no or wrong vins) included in block that is not in any other nodes mempool
2) that block is mined and broadcast
3) then other nodes add the tx to their mempool and verify another valid tx against it.

[28-Dec-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very improbable but with enough dice txs and miners

[28-Dec-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should just happen

[28-Dec-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
wait, how can coins be created from the mempool fix??

[28-Dec-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
which "fix"

[28-Dec-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would require a very special and al;m,ost impossible chain of events...

[28-Dec-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I think if a tx can be created spending a tx included in a block by a maliciouls miner it might happen

[28-Dec-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless I am not understanding everything.... but ive been thinking about this for many days since I made it trying to figure out how it could happen

[28-Dec-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
a tx without vins wont have any valid outputs

[28-Dec-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so any funds spent would be an invalid tx

[28-Dec-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they can be put into the mempool though if they are included in a received block

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
a received block, or validated block?

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to make it fast, it had tro not check vins only under that exact condition.... when already in a block no inputs checks

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that adds them oput of order

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bu8t then after that the block processes as normal

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and any txs withj no vins are rejected

[28-Dec-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but for a silght moment they are int he mempool of a node

[28-Dec-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but in the mempool doesnt mean it will validate in a block

[28-Dec-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but cannot a cc tx be created from the mempool and for a shor time it would be valid

[28-Dec-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because vin checks only go back 1 tx

[28-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
well, it might appear valid and get into the mempool

[28-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but then when it is fully validated in a block it should be rejected as invalid tx

[28-Dec-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and then the block with invalid tx is an invalid block

[28-Dec-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean this is almost impossibly improbable what im saying

[28-Dec-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it requres multiple blocks to be mined in less than maybe 100ms

[28-Dec-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but even if it does, the full block validation would reject an illegal tx in the mempool

[28-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I am saying is... you are creating a tx from a tx that is invlid., but the tx you created to the checks that happen are valid... as it onyl chekcs back 1 tx not 2.

[28-Dec-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
why not add a check for this special case, to make 100% sure it cant happen

[28-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how to

[28-Dec-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but the initial invalid tx would need to get confirmed into a block, how does that happen?

[28-Dec-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
just have a check for tx without vins

[28-Dec-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
by a miner who changed his node.
