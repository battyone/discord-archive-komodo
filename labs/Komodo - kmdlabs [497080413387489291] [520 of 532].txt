I "think  I  installed  all  dependencies

[20-Nov-19 04:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  had  an  old  komodod  installed

[20-Nov-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the actual error will be above that and say `error` (in red/orange)

[20-Nov-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's not that; it'll always say that, the script hasn't been edited for curl's last 4 or 5 updates

[20-Nov-19 05:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  I  started it  with  sudo  before I  got  that  message

[20-Nov-19 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there's no need to sudo anything (other than installing the build dependencies)

[20-Nov-19 05:04 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
well -- I  could  stop  it  but  --- its  rolling  on  now

[20-Nov-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
never sudo unless it needs it

[20-Nov-19 05:05 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[20-Nov-19 05:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so  I guess this  install  will be  dirty

I might  be staking

[20-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Oszy#5734
if getmininginfo says staking:true then yes

[20-Nov-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[20-Nov-19 10:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
does  this  mean I am making money?

[20-Nov-19 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
that means a notarization happened

[20-Nov-19 10:07 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I guess  I need to know how to see all of  the commands so I cn research what  the fek i am doing

[20-Nov-19 10:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
does  blocknotify have to  be running?

[20-Nov-19 10:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think  my dirty  install  needs to be refreshed to new and  clean

[20-Nov-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
`help`

[20-Nov-19 10:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
this  aint  working

[20-Nov-19 10:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
with  labs

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`does blocknotify have to be running?`
blocknotify is a function in the daemon that allows you to tell your computer to do something when a block is added to the chain (be it by you or someone else)
you don't *have to* run it ever, but you can use it to do things

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
LABS

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok  then  i  am mining

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
stop putting ' in there

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  just  would like  to see

[20-Nov-19 10:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i did

[20-Nov-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and put your blocknotify command in your config file

[20-Nov-19 10:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I tried my best

[20-Nov-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes, like that

[20-Nov-19 10:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[20-Nov-19 10:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill restart it later

[20-Nov-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but put %s in there before LABS

[20-Nov-19 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
unless the script cares not about the hash?

[20-Nov-19 10:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[20-Nov-19 10:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[20-Nov-19 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`blocknotify=/home/kmdkrazy/pos64staker/staker.py %s LABS`
if the script uses the actual block hash to do things

[20-Nov-19 10:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[20-Nov-19 10:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
willl  figure out  stats in  a  couple  hours

my bookkeeper turned off  my  computer  earlier  to save electric  and said it was making loud weerrrring noises

[20-Nov-19 10:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[20-Nov-19 10:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah... if you have a recent Intel Core i chip...

[20-Nov-19 10:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
each time you hit an eligible segID utxo a sngle core is gonna max out

[20-Nov-19 10:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
and with Intel boost thats gonna kick your fan on quick

[20-Nov-19 10:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
then off when you stake or a new chainip comes in

[20-Nov-19 10:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
do it will rev and wind down and rinse repeat

[20-Nov-19 10:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
AMD Ryzen's seem to be a little less fan aggressive on the single core boosts

[20-Nov-19 10:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
how do I know  for sure  ALL  my addresses are being  staked?

[20-Nov-19 10:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
by the nature of POS64 they are

[20-Nov-19 10:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
it cycles through all segIDs and the utxos in them until a block is staked

[20-Nov-19 10:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
If segID has no one on the net with a solution... it moves to segID 1 addresses and evaluates

[20-Nov-19 10:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
GRATZ!

[20-Nov-19 10:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
now hope it dont orphan lmao

[20-Nov-19 10:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok - and I figure that  out  how?

[20-Nov-19 10:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and  block rewards are what now?

[20-Nov-19 10:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
LABS notarizations are what secures the chain so blocks are only 100% valid once a notary has passed

[20-Nov-19 10:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
if somone else solved that same block with an earlier time stamp... the notray will reshuffle the chain to the right blocks... means there are chances locks are orphaned after 5-10 mins
