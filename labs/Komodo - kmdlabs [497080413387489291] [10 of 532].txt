Full node v1 is cool.  The CC concept is interesting.   Many uses for full node v1 kv.  Board game positions etc.

[10-Oct-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah a super fast KV/CC only chain with ondemand blocks has many use cases

[10-Oct-18 04:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Using vrsc auto chains for games

[10-Oct-18 04:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why I kept working on it...

[10-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The block reward is 0, and all rewards go to the founders address, so noone will every bother to mine it

[10-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they did somehow manage to GPU mine it though it would ahve 0.1s blocks

[10-Oct-18 04:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and would just break instantly

[10-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Faucet is good too

[10-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
faucet is the only way to get coins

[10-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it has 1 trillion of them and gives out 100 at a time...

[10-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be any issue of it running out

[10-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Make it 90/10 pos

[10-Oct-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant do that

[10-Oct-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has a static difficulty of 1

[10-Oct-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cna onyl work with ondemand blocks

[10-Oct-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CPU mine

[10-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Mylo#8306
Hmmmmm....ok v1 limitations, CC mempool tx chat v2

[10-Oct-18 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all notary nodes mine it ondemand, so as soon as a TX it sent a block is found like instantly

[10-Oct-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This was required for chat.

[10-Oct-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise the messages take too long to show up

[10-Oct-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becaause its secured by dPoW it needs no thash rate or difficulty at all

[10-Oct-18 04:12 AM] Mylo#8306
Exotic hehe

[10-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Mylo#8306
What a cool development anyways

[10-Oct-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its closer to what I imagine james wanted the assets to be... but there are still ways peole can attack it... its just only to attack it, and dosnt gain them any finaciall reward

[10-Oct-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only lose them money

[10-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Mylo#8306
I wonder if btch would be interested @dukeleto for a cc version of this?

[10-Oct-18 04:14 AM] Mylo#8306
KV chat v1 on demand blocks but then dev into a CC

[10-Oct-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has CC enabled because it used faucet... limiting the type of TX by conensus rules is a bit over my head, so all I did was make it so that blocks with just a coinbase TX are invalid.

[10-Oct-18 04:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it has a super weird coinbase thats not compatible with any existing stratum, so currently unless someone figures out how to do that, can only be mined with the deamon

[10-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In matter of fact I wonder if its possible to make the coinbase a negative value ü§î

[10-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might make making a stratum even harder

[10-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
founders address is allowed to have negative balance  ü§î

[10-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Mylo#8306
Oh this is a bastardized kmd?  Not a regular AC?

[10-Oct-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its a seperate branch of STAKED ... although with some effort the changes can be made into a compatible flag

[10-Oct-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured for this use case, a compiled binarry would be used... so having a seperate branch with diffrent rules seemed irrelavent

[10-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Mylo#8306
So when u said notary mining, that was staked notaries or NN notaries?

[10-Oct-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked notaries have -gen -genproclimit =1 in theer assetchains.json

[10-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but all the rewards are 0, and go to the founders address, which upon launching the chain and funding notaries 100 coins, sends all its coins to the faucet

[10-Oct-18 04:21 AM] Mylo#8306
Cool.  What an interesting channel !

[10-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherswise notaries mine 2 vouts of 0 coins to thier wallet, and bloat them needlessly

[10-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I jst made it send them to an unused address

[10-Oct-18 04:22 AM] Mylo#8306
Lol

[10-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wanted to make the BR mine to the faucet ... but it seemed you cannot do that without a LOT of fucking around

[10-Oct-18 04:25 AM] Mylo#8306
I was up at 4 laying in bed thinking about key deployment for 64 dockers, and rather than pass in Argos and use swarm, it‚Äôll be easy enough to have 255 configured keys from 1-255 in bash file to source from and based off the containers last octet in its network addy just read it in at start up.  Much simpler to script, especially if we test geo timing stuff

Nice idea.

Good development happening!

[10-Oct-18 07:35 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Hi,  have you or anyone else been having any trouble or errors with notarizations over the last 2 or 3 updates?

[10-Oct-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not really... but I diecovered something that I need to fix in my version of iguana today

[10-Oct-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ad there is a very importnat change in mainnet we need to merge down.

[10-Oct-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to think about how to do it as its wont be a git merge, I need to manually do it.

[10-Oct-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[10-Oct-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator and @CMaurice  I think are the only people running nodes apart from me and you, as I have Alrights...

[10-Oct-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I think all 4 of mine are on blackjok3r branch, which may be imompatible with jl777 in a few ways

[10-Oct-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really need to fix it, spent all morning rebuilding a-team iguana.

[10-Oct-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
main net is more important at this point in time. But I know what to do for us now. was going to start Troll dApp but might do this first, if your ahving problems unless your node has just run out of KMD ?

[10-Oct-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alrights had

[10-Oct-18 07:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been having troubles since the weekend but can't say for sure exactly when it started.  I had to rescue my pc and got locked out of a few  vps so have been wrestling with that.
I've had a few strange errors notarizing though.

[10-Oct-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181

ok no wories.. will check out my nodes and make the iguana change for you now, if you can please pose errors you are seeing.

[10-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMd isnt running

[10-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its not gonna work

[10-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[10-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and tell me what it says

[10-Oct-18 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the VPS ran out of RAM and it crashed?

[10-Oct-18 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
I restarted and it is running now.

[10-Oct-18 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, that's possible.  reboot killed the swap.

4.2GB ram used on my main STAKED notary...

[10-Oct-18 07:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll add the swap again.  Forgot it wasn't permanent on this server.

[10-Oct-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... yeah iguana can use a lot of ram and it will just force everything else out and crash it üòÇ

[10-Oct-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD is also using a lot of ram these days.

[10-Oct-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even this very small STAKED notary testnet is not cheap. me and alright burning though a fair bit of money here, but PIRATE paid for it all üòâ

yeah... figured holding the rest might pay for my house one day so I may as well hold it. Need to back up the prive key lol

[10-Oct-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
has to go on my paperwallet

[10-Oct-18 07:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah.

[10-Oct-18 07:53 AM] CrisF#3405
I still have quite a bit to do to recover from the weekend's nightmare, but please let me know if you set up that trollbox test.  Happy to help out.

[10-Oct-18 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will be getting onto that soon.... I was able to merge my a-team iguana directly into staked, with minimal effort .

[10-Oct-18 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made us a new branch called staked... I need to update my nodes first though as it might break everything
