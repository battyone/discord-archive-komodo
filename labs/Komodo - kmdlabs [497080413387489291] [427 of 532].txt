use `./stats` inside `StakedNotary` folder or `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getinfo | grep longestchain`

[13-Jun-19 11:50 AM] CrisF#3405
How this look?```"longestchain": 27623,
```

Hi @zatJUM 👋
Did you get KMD up?

[13-Jun-19 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm thinking to bootstrap if it worked for you.

[13-Jun-19 11:59 AM] zatJUM#9924
```[KMD] : Waiting for KMD daemon to start...``` after deploying bootstrap... 😉

[13-Jun-19 12:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
Sync'ing last 6% from bootstrap now

[13-Jun-19 12:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
Meanwhile... I just started staking (for the first time) LABS yesterday with 2 LABS x 64.
I would like to stake with more now.
How should I proceed? Which address should I send my LABS to? (no, not yours, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ;-))

[13-Jun-19 12:07 PM] zatJUM#9924
Initial one, or the one matching the pubkey I used for pos64staker, or anyone in list.json?

[13-Jun-19 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you own thew address, it will stake

[13-Jun-19 12:08 PM] zatJUM#9924
And do I have to sendmany.sh after again?

[13-Jun-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
different people have had different results staking new bits to all 64, 1 random one, 1 specific one, as well as doing nothing

[13-Jun-19 12:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
ok, no rule 😉

[13-Jun-19 12:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
or to be discovered!

[13-Jun-19 12:09 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks CG

[13-Jun-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no "if you always do this, then you will always get that", because it always depends on many different things

@LabsAssistant  I pushed jls fix to labs, you can update now.

done and started

[13-Jun-19 02:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
I still have to sudo ./zcutil/build.sh manually and then rerun ./start.sh... otherwise my build fails.

[13-Jun-19 02:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
But it works now.

[13-Jun-19 02:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
Just bootstrapped , and now ./stop.sh and ./start.sh 😉

[13-Jun-19 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136

[13-Jun-19 02:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
@Deleted User  yup looks like you cant link directly to a trade pair.

[13-Jun-19 02:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
But if you check the site, he has KMD/BTC and KMD/ETH actively trading.

[13-Jun-19 03:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Exile13#4458
what did you do to get it to work?

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Exile13#4458
or do i have to delete everything?

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
cd then cd komodo

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
run sudo ./zcutil/build.sh

[13-Jun-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
but thats a me issue not likely yours

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Also

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
I manually commented out the other chains last time

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
so if no one changed that file again since in the git repo...

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Mine still has CFEK and others commented out

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Only LABS starts after KMD right now

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Exile13#4458
so you arent Nota them

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Exile13#4458
oh

[13-Jun-19 03:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Nota LABS only

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Exile13#4458
was that advised?

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
idk

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
but when the build was broken and failing to start with CFEK issues

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
I commented them out and just ran LABS for now

[13-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Exile13#4458
hmm

[13-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Exile13#4458
when i build i get the makefile error

[13-Jun-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
if your build failed... your daemons launched with the old compiled binary... maybe thats your CFEK issue

[13-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Exile13#4458
ok

[13-Jun-19 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
and no

[13-Jun-19 03:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
cd to komodo... the ./start.sh script already did a git pull

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] CMaurice#1685
hm, no chains seeme to have moved for me for 4.5 hrs

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
There were no commits to assetchains.json since my edit so I only have LABS defined

i did

[13-Jun-19 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
That gave your the cclib.cpp error correct?

[13-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Exile13#4458

ya

[13-Jun-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
you ran the sudo apt update and upgrade commands?

[13-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Exile13#4458
ya

[13-Jun-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then tried the manual build again?

[13-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Exile13#4458
manual build meaning...start from scratch?

[13-Jun-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
make clean
git clean -f
zcutil/build.sh```

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Exile13#4458
ahh

[13-Jun-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
hopefully that works for you, ty Genie.

[13-Jun-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's always my 1st step when manual build fails

[13-Jun-19 03:22 PM] Exile13#4458
make clean, is the command to wipe certain data, correct?

[13-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Exile13#4458
like it reverts to default

[13-Jun-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it "cleans out" many files made during last make (or make attempt)

[13-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Exile13#4458
ok
