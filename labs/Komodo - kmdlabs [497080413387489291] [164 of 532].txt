Im not exactly staking efficantly I have 12,000 utxo in the same address

[17-Dec-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I think there are other stakers

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I've nailed down this "invalid block mined"

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need a way of remoing a chosen utxo from the RAM Stater array ... its spending a utxo, then selecting the same one again for the next block some how

[17-Dec-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm not quite sure how to word the issue....
Mostly the problem is that weight can "force" block creation too fast driving up the diff (and that large weights "seem to be" immune to that diff)
Honestly I need to look at a couple other chains, because CFEK weights are an anomaly in and of themselves

[17-Dec-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... whic is why I havent worried about it at all ... the amount of coins on this chain is astronomical

[17-Dec-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have 90 million or 9 billion myself

[17-Dec-18 01:20 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm getting `mined` then `invalid block mined` on cpu.

lol

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm Cris please look at the debug.log at the same time

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will tell you why the block is invalid

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's not counting the 200M I sent to NN 游땥

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that of itself is not an issue ...

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what I am getting is like 5-10 of those in a row

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats fine

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoW isnt always right.

[17-Dec-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
aha!

[17-Dec-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the ramstaker needs to reset if you mine a block

[17-Dec-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
man the `2018-12-17 13:22:22 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found` flood is getting stronger

[17-Dec-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it would keep finding the same utxo as the most likely to win, but it already won

[17-Dec-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... and it also has a check inside of it

[17-Dec-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that should stop it, when a block arrives but that doesnt seem to work

[17-Dec-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
you make it reset the ramstaker if it finds a winner?

[17-Dec-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its liek once the loop starts the whoe daemon is just locked hard

[17-Dec-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RPC cant work, amoung other things it seems.

[17-Dec-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to make it reset the array when it finds a block.

[17-Dec-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how easy that will be ..

[17-Dec-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is there any way for the arrays loop to be in `mining.cpp`

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like the array can be declared

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and have a pointer apssed to `rpcwallet.cpp`

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to fill it

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this might stop the deamon locking up RPC calls while staking

[17-Dec-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[17-Dec-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe just set a flag if a winning utxo is found?

[17-Dec-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
not perfect, but at least it will verify if this method fixes it

[17-Dec-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
winning utxo does not always find a block though

[17-Dec-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok guess its a decent test to see

[17-Dec-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
"not perfect, but at least it will verify if this method fixes it"

[17-Dec-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes imperfect tests give perfect information

{Reactions}
游녨 

[17-Dec-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
like if this test doesnt fix it, then no need to spend time on some fancy comms between mining loop and ramstaker

[17-Dec-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
one way is to just see who staked the last block and if it was this node, then toreset the ramstaker

Does anyone else have crazy floods in their debug.log

[17-Dec-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ERROR: myGetTransaction: Deserialize or I/O error - ReadCompactSize():

[17-Dec-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems I have got it to reset... just have to wait and see now if this fixes it

[17-Dec-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Those accept to mempory pool errors are insane .... someone must be on a fork ?

[17-Dec-18 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
I had strange situation today: KMD was on sync, showed 60 connections, showed my wallet inside but balance was 0 (actual balance on blockchain wasn't zero). Only thing which helped is `./stop` `./start`

[17-Dec-18 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Notarisations on my node stopped ~13 hours ago (probably when by some reason my wallet decided that there is no balance)

[17-Dec-18 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
But now everything ok

[17-Dec-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@blackjok3r I don't have that, but given the `my` bit, I'm still thinking the `tx inputs not found` flood is you 游땥

[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesnt appear so.... checking the blocks now to see if there is that many txs in them for a start...

[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  did you send any KMD to it ?

[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant send it amount under 1 KMD.

[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you over ride it ... instriuctions are in the readme.

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
strange that it just came back though

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
I've resolved it already, just strange

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or you eman it was syncing when you checked the balance

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
It was totally synced

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ah

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And on other node/wallet/explorer my actual balance wasnt 0

[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
But this notary node wallet thought I have 0

[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then it simply returned

[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
After I ran stop and start scripts

[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Balance is just returned yeah

[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did it rescan on start ?

[17-Dec-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is an issue with iguana too, that might cause utxo's to get stuck on 0.

[17-Dec-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
man I wish I had an explorer right now lol

[17-Dec-18 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
No, it didnt rescan

[17-Dec-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm strange as.. I guess unless someone else reports it theres not much I can do atm.

[17-Dec-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as it "fixed itself " lol

[17-Dec-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will have a look though once I am finished on this.

[17-Dec-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The mGetTransactions floods were me ... I was asking it to get a transaction if a get block failed, rather than succeded 游뱑

[17-Dec-18 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Since there is no logs and no way to replicate it's just a kinda "funny story" 游땎

[17-Dec-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah lol ..

[17-Dec-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this ram staker reset fix appears to work perfectly.... Altough staking this many blocks, there is no reason to use the ram staker 游땍

[17-Dec-18 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
On my side everything seems quite clear (in spot of logs)

[17-Dec-18 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
On notary node at least - maybe you're testing different things

[17-Dec-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes .. notary nodes have ben rock stable for a fair while really .. The issues are iwht keeping chains moving ... long standing problem with POS64

[17-Dec-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm this sucks ... managed to move all of the staking functions to komodo_bitcoind.h and the RPC still hangs up ... my guess was wrong I guess

[17-Dec-18 04:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
uh, about cfek...

[17-Dec-18 04:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
turns out I was spamming it a bit more than  ithought

[17-Dec-18 04:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
gps spoofing script which writes to oracle was getting an exception which led to it bypassing the 5 minute sleep command

[17-Dec-18 04:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
fixed now. hope that makes the errors disappear.

[17-Dec-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... my guess is that you were sending so many txs that depend on each other, that they couldnt enter the mempool on other nodes.

[17-Dec-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive seen that happen plenty of times

[17-Dec-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they cant all arrive in the exact right order... hence mempool deny spam.

[17-Dec-18 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There were some pretty big blocks there for a while 游땏

[17-Dec-18 04:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, no sleep, 6 or so "users" all writing in loops

all good ... Had me checing my fixes from yesterday there for a few minuts ... had some git problems today ...

[17-Dec-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like I've got the ram staker working quite well now aswell 游땎

[17-Dec-18 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still hangs RPC calls ... but I cant really figure out how to fix that, the mining thread is supposed to be async ... but I guess the wallet calls change that ... messing around with the LOCK2 placement atm.. doesnt seem to help 游땭
