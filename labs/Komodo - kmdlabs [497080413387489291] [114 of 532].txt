[24-Nov-18 08:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
nice

[24-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just a reminder everyone now MUSt update their komodod (start.sh if your on staked notary or staked repos)

[24-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not updateing could be very bad

[24-Nov-18 08:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill look at the scrtipts and how to use them

[24-Nov-18 08:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
updat in 2 hours?

[24-Nov-18 08:28 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i guess I need to fund my KMD address or will you send a few there?

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll send some funds.  Haven't got any LF atm.

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i mean KMD

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have 0 UTXOs

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] CrisF#3405
do you have any in your tipbot?

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
zero balance

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i do

[24-Nov-18 08:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
good idea

[24-Nov-18 08:30 AM] CrisF#3405
It requires < 1

[24-Nov-18 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
.5  even should last.

[24-Nov-18 08:31 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright @blackjok3r  Any point in doing a migration over the change?

[24-Nov-18 08:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Worth trying?

[24-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Alright#0419
what do you mean?

[24-Nov-18 08:35 AM] CrisF#3405
The current, or some of the current, chains will be kept fo a later testnet right?

[24-Nov-18 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really cris ..likley because of pubkey changes ... migrate mightnot even work atm

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
this is likely the only chain that will stay in testnet

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
no reason to keep the old ones

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
that I know of

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
this chain is also in a different cluster

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would wait until we confirm at least 20 nodes notarised the new chain, then we cna test migrates on CFEK chains again

[24-Nov-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that makes sure eveyrone is on the right version

[24-Nov-18 08:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, yeah.

[24-Nov-18 08:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
where is oracle chat located these days?

[24-Nov-18 08:39 AM] CrisF#3405
You'd probably have to set your own room atm.

[24-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
anywhere you want @kmdkrazy 游땥

[24-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
took a back seat to this stuff

[24-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
still works really well though

[24-Nov-18 08:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I like the idea creating a room for every cryptocurrency---  I was asking what repo the source is in?

[24-Nov-18 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405
When KMDLabs is up there'll be more time and can set up some permanent rooms eh.

there was also  GUI @TonyL  was working on

[24-Nov-18 08:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
oh yeah - not StakedNotary

[24-Nov-18 08:45 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
goit it

[24-Nov-18 08:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
is there a way to verify my cron is actually running every 15 minutes?

[24-Nov-18 08:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
besides reading the log when I run out of UTXOIs?

[24-Nov-18 08:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i can use google

[24-Nov-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you used the cron in the readme

[24-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will log to ~/utxospliter.log

[24-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if its pringint somethign ther

[24-Nov-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then its working

[24-Nov-18 08:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
nice

[24-Nov-18 08:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i think the onlything missing in the Chat is relying on chains that need to be synced - and maybe they are larger than needed - the solution would be small chains that can be created on the fly - anyway - ill read more of the code tomorrow - and try to comp[rehend a good solid solution to sdpeed

[24-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy solution would be a webserver that allows multiple people to use it

[24-Nov-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
plenty of blocks being mined and paid out wby my pool.. making PR to smks repo and then getting food. back for launch in 1H.

[24-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
user would have a username/password on webserver, webserver would act as a single chat dapp client with single pubkey

[24-Nov-18 09:01 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r Just updated. Seems ./stats is broken

[24-Nov-18 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shit I cant make the PR ... for some reason it has like every single file changed 游땟

[24-Nov-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
游뱑游낗

[24-Nov-18 09:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and the pubkey could be changed by the user whenever needed

[24-Nov-18 09:02 AM] zatJUM#9924
no wait, I had to wait some minutes now it works, sorry

[24-Nov-18 09:03 AM] CrisF#3405
@zatJUM Yeah, it takes a minute or so after Iguana starts.

[24-Nov-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can confirm the update ies working each time as its meant to... a start.sh cron, with start.sh output sent to a screen will work for auto updates and era changes. 游땎

[24-Nov-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what happned to pool ... I think merging in webworkers upstream stuff has changred 5,100 files which makes o sense at all...

[24-Nov-18 09:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[24-Nov-18 09:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[24-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 09:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Nov-18 09:16 AM] CMaurice#1685
g'day, removed CFEKING, re start.sh'd and it's sticking again at block 29160

[24-Nov-18 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @CMaurice , @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator also had the same trouble.

[24-Nov-18 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
I made abootstrap of ING for you, but you won't need it I think.

[24-Nov-18 09:19 AM] CMaurice#1685
aha

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright CMaurice has been having the same trouble as SMK with ING not syncing.  What should he do?

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
send him the bootstrap

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
past block 29160

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
SMK didn't need that.

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] Alright#0419
that bug has been driving me crazy for about a week now

[24-Nov-18 09:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i was stuck and resynced

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
not sure tbh

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
can't reproduce it

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] Alright#0419
not sure why it happens

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
there is a bad ip address

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
at the start

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i believe

[24-Nov-18 09:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i got lucky

[24-Nov-18 09:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
hes syncing a fork

[24-Nov-18 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
He  was trying for hours last night to sort it out.  Also no notarizations like SMK.

[24-Nov-18 09:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
just send him the boot strap for the correct chain ATM

[24-Nov-18 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Should he just start on the new chains?
@Alright

[24-Nov-18 09:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
he will feel better in 20 minutesx

[24-Nov-18 09:24 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@CMaurice are you removing peers.dat each time?

[24-Nov-18 09:25 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats probably the answer - I deleteted the entire folder
