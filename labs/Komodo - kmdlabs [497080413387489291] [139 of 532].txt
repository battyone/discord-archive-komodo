Hi @Mylo, thanks. The reason I asked about the NN was I saw you in my mask. Blackjok3r explain it was something wrong with the script.

[01-Dec-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something is most definatly wrong with komodod sync .... I have CFEKING just synced on a node with closed port and my upload bandwidth is like 15mbit after syncing for a good 10 mins

[01-Dec-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand why upload is so high .

[01-Dec-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is on master and noStreamer branch, so its a probem before sapling merge

[01-Dec-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mining /staking is working on noStreamer branch, and the slow sync seems to be fixed, altough upload bandwidth seems too high during sync... it works.

Hi @LabsAssistant  (and others with an interest),
Please give a Yea / Nay on the following suggested coin icon for KMDLabs.
The coin icon would be used on exchanges and in other places to represent us and what we are creating here.
If `Nay` please suggest alternatives.

[01-Dec-18 08:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Also please vote on the following KMDLabs logos.  Presenting an alternative is also fine.
The background images and placement of the logos on them are for reference only.  
The logo should be able to stand by itself on a variety of backgrounds.
The black and white flask/text will be used depending on the background.

Logo variations boil down to this:  

1.  Gold flask, black/white text

2.  Black/white flask, black/white text

Comments welcome too.  Thanks  😀

Thanks, @zatJUM.  I just gave input, @Exile13 did all the hard work making it come alive.

[01-Dec-18 08:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Which logo do you prefer, gold flask or black/white flask?

[01-Dec-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we should make a vote chain?

@CrisF It depends of the background, but I think black flask + black "KMDLabs" looks great

Isn't Verus' original(?) main(?) purpose as a voting mechanism?
Or am I thinking of something else?

_votes for 24_

[01-Dec-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Look like 3 votes for 2 and 4 (black flask).
@gcharang Which logo do you prefer, gold flask, or black/white flask?

[01-Dec-18 09:47 AM] gcharang#6833
Black flask. Yeah what @zatJUM said

[01-Dec-18 09:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!

[01-Dec-18 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Look like 3 votes for 2 and 4 (black flask)`
now I'm corn fuzzed; which ones are "2" and "4"?

[01-Dec-18 10:10 AM] CrisF#3405
2nd and 4th logo pic.  Black flask and black text.
Sorry, I should have called the coin one an `icon`.

[01-Dec-18 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[01-Dec-18 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so "24" is "2"?

[01-Dec-18 10:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, just different bg.

No nay on that so far.

[01-Dec-18 10:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As for "gold vs black", imo that's more dependent on the individual background than anything else (my preference being the molecules over blank or a cityscape)

[01-Dec-18 10:19 AM] CrisF#3405
I have some good backgrounds with lab, molecules etc.  Won't use the cityscape on this site.
Mainly need  the black/white vs gold for plain bgs.  Will have some other stylized  ones for different situations (when have the time!)

Hi All,  I started talking about this in the #cc-general channel, but then the conversation there went on to other topics.  So I repeat here what was covered there as this channel is exactly on topic.  I have a "shovel ready" real world project which I need help to materialize.  I am looking for help in putting together GUI templates something like the www.swagger.io demo where a non-technical person can write an API on that webpage for their organization.  I want  a tool that will interface the RPC where the user can "fill in the blanks" to create his own Oracle CC to put IoT and other data on the blockchain.  As I am sure you are aware, only the Komodo ecosystem tech is able to meet the tx/sec required by IoT data bursts coming in from millions of devices.   I want to begin testing the Oracle CC ASAP under "real world" conditions.  Since I am not too technical as yet, I  need help from the community.  I do have  detailed knowledge of what the workings of the apps should cover -- so we can avoid "theoretical silos",  coding the exact requirements of the end users.  The KMD documentation says, "A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid".  We need to design a smart phone app that will register and pay the fee and upload its edge signals to the Oracle CC.    Googlemaps API is one data source we can register or use leaflet like  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator did with his interesting CC to track his dog.    It seems like we have all or almost all of the components now to put together what this real world application needs.

[03-Dec-18 02:43 AM] axo777#1232
Once we get it running it has the promise of being a big boost for Komodo and its ecosystem as well as the team members, directly or indirectly.  This must be ultra "user" friendly with GUI's that will make the blockchain simple for non-technical people. User group members will be restricted to invitation only with just a few entities on the low end to hundreds or thousands of members on the higher end.  With the advent of Sapling and the possibility of developing ZKP signals for IoT devices in the future no other commercial "blockchain" such as Hyperledger Fabric or Sawtooth will be able to compete with us if we are the first mover.  We need to strike while the iron is hot in this important sector.  I look forward to comments from the community about this "shovel ready" project.

Im working on something similar. To start with, it's storing and retrieving gps data via a particle.io device. Backend is working, but gui is work in progress. Intended to expand to other sensor data etc once POC complete.

[03-Dec-18 02:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
End goal is adaptable middleware to integrate iot with oracles and display as map, graph, table, etc etc depending on data type

[03-Dec-18 02:58 AM] axo777#1232
I have a call scheduled with Particle on Wednesday about this, but they are only one device supplier.  I am looking at the global market where any number of devices will be able to operate in the system.  Seems like making universal registration code that will accept signals from any device is needed.

[03-Dec-18 03:01 AM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I have an idea about a possible follow-on when the DrogonHound PoC is in the books. ;)
