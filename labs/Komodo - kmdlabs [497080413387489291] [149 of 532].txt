But to do that effectivly hes alrady 80-90% attacking the chain....

[06-Dec-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not a practical attack ... although on things like on demand AC's and such with very low values ... its toally possible, but the incentive to do its isnt really there.

[06-Dec-18 07:46 AM] jorian#4555
either way, it's an improbable situation

[06-Dec-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very

[06-Dec-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are updates, they dont seem importnat unless your staking/mining btw.

[06-Dec-18 07:48 AM] jorian#4555
i think i was staking

[06-Dec-18 07:48 AM] jorian#4555
i'll update

[06-Dec-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you were using -pubkey

[06-Dec-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would have still worked

[06-Dec-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be good to make sure they havent borken other things, but it all seems ok ... We are getting close to it all working now I think.

[06-Dec-18 08:06 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@blackjok3r migrates to Ed and LF running OK and quick. ING is struggling to import on KMD I think - so not completing.

[06-Dec-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The chains have been stalling a fair bit so if they are mostly working thats very good

[06-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am mostly looking for fails on import tx, the ones the script is looking for and saving the hexes at

[06-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if those are not happening any more

[06-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then we are set

[06-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[06-Dec-18 08:15 AM] CrisF#3405
I've finally gotten in `ING` notarization.  After 9 hours.

[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah things have been really bad today guys

[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] CrisF#3405
All notarized in the last 10 minutes.

[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah miners are all fixed

[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] CrisF#3405
So looking up.

[06-Dec-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that helps a LOT 😅

[06-Dec-18 08:19 AM] CrisF#3405

[06-Dec-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so how many fixes needed to miner.cpp?

[06-Dec-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the non-notarized blocks are always subject to attack

[06-Dec-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is an attacker making 100% of blocks, and there wont be a notarization

[06-Dec-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
then dpowconfs logic would keep confs at 1, you would know something is wrong and not accept a trade for $100,000

[06-Dec-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  You need to toally wipe the `komodo` folder fromt he hom directory

[06-Dec-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and run buildkomodo.sh from scratch

[06-Dec-18 08:22 AM] CrisF#3405
`rm -rf` `komodo` and also `staked`.

[06-Dec-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a faster way but its just too confusing to explain

[06-Dec-18 08:23 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try again.

[06-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats really strange ... masterbranch now has sapling ...

[06-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should build from clean clone

[06-Dec-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see what is wrong with isStake, it seems to be set properly

[06-Dec-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not isStake

[06-Dec-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the second post I pinged you in

[06-Dec-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to add || ASSETCHAINS_STAKED != 0

[06-Dec-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to !isStake in CreateBlockWithKey or what ever it is

[06-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
other wise when isStake is set

[06-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses a null pubkey

[06-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and burns all the coinbases

[06-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure the logic behind it

[06-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its there none the less... took me all day to find it

[06-Dec-18 08:39 AM] jorian#4555
`2018-12-06 08:39:08 Block 16539 : PoS 95% vs target 51%`

[06-Dec-18 08:39 AM] jorian#4555
no-one pow mining lame ducks?

[06-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is too much PoS weight for CPU to compete

[06-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its normal

[06-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Add a single GPU or everyone CPU mining and it would be ok

[06-Dec-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Expected with chains that have 0 value

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
yes exactly haha, i guess with LABS it would be a different story

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats it ... all the 0BR chains are set at 1% PoS and average around 10-15%

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is fine ... as they progress for free

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically

[06-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if I cna fix the wallet corruption issue we should use 100% PoS for the 0BR chains really.

[06-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stops miners attacking them

[06-Dec-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can mine coins on the main chain... and then migrate them there and stake if you want to mine blocks

[06-Dec-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just adds extra effort

[06-Dec-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it should never skip adding a scriptPubKey

[06-Dec-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i wonder why there is even the case for a null pubkey

[06-Dec-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, that case is for when there is no -pubkey

[06-Dec-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
I am going to remove the if (!isStake), i cant see when it is any good to have a null scriptPubKey

[06-Dec-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You should check with mike first I think ... maybe that needs to be ther efor verus PoS

[06-Dec-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a LOT of extra code that relates to that scriptPubKey

[06-Dec-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea what it does ...

[06-Dec-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it just creates it, i wrote it before I got more familiar with the c++ ways

[06-Dec-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No I mean later in CreatBlock

[06-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that wasnt there before

[06-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right at the top

[06-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even before your vairable declarations

[06-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther is _ScriptPubKey

[06-Dec-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it runs that thorugh "things"

[06-Dec-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to get the ScriptPubKeyIn

[06-Dec-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I can tell on my testing... those things do nothing at all

[06-Dec-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but they must be ther efor some reason

[06-Dec-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
mining is working?

[06-Dec-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When I added the exception for `ASSETCHAINS_STAKED != 0` everything works perfectly

[06-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, my approach of always going inside the if would behave the same, even in cases where isStake is true

[06-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems just a bug

[06-Dec-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I guess we remove it ... its very strange that its ther eI agree ...

[06-Dec-18 09:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just realised the dragonhound server may as well be staking, so I've kicked it off on all chains

[06-Dec-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This staking seems to use a LOT of CPU compared to normal

[06-Dec-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staking .. still not sure why

[06-Dec-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Connection Refused mindless and annoying prints form debug.log are fixed.. After messing around for quite some time, trying to make staked chains have their own seeds in the chain params and getting no where I disabled them all together as we use addnode on chain start anyway.. we will need to add a bunch of nodes as addnode for reliabilty though.

[06-Dec-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe the top preforming notaries can all be seeds... They will already be in the repo for iguana so just adding them to all chains in assetchains.json will be the go. 😃

[06-Dec-18 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they're actually not pointless and debug has options that one could select to not show them
#JustSayin

[06-Dec-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All the default seeds dont have these chains anyway ... so all tey did was spam error logs

[06-Dec-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you found the fatal flaw with dPoW. it doesnt work against a 100% mining attack

[06-Dec-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
where people ignore "confirmations"

[06-Dec-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I was going to make them not show but ti was requested that they needed to stay there... however with 200+ KMD seeds beoing pulled in and constantly trying to to be connected to it was filling the logs with spam.

[06-Dec-18 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c So I've been wrong this whole time and Komod NNs don't ever mine assetchains?

[06-Dec-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of us dont no

[06-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
some NN mine some AC

[06-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is totally optional

[06-Dec-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It fills the wallet with spam dust and slows the node down

[06-Dec-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For a while I mined to another pubkey

[06-Dec-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that was creating too many blocks and needlessly making chains really long.

[06-Dec-18 11:20 AM] jorian#4555
for my official node i have disabled it, but there exists a randomized function that sets some chains to -gen at startup

[06-Dec-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure how +1 every 5 is "too many" but OK
_goes back to his troll-hole_

[06-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when by default they have 1 block a day if they are lucky
