doesnt take that long to sync does it?

[19-Oct-19 10:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
Whats that decentralising stuff everybody talk about :troll_cool: :troll_compadre:

[19-Oct-19 10:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeash like if it takes a day, I understand the need for a bootstrap...

[19-Oct-19 10:28 PM] CMaurice#1685
any better, or am I still spamming?

[19-Oct-19 10:33 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm not seeing any spam here, after a fresh update.

[19-Oct-19 11:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will check it now. I know what caused the issues... I saw it on AWS network, and just turned off the nodes that were doing it at the time. Was too hard to fix. 
What happens, is a split tx is created but is not mined for some reason, this then prevents the local wallet from making another split, because it thinks the utxo used to split is spent in mempool. 
But no other nodes see this tx, and it never gets mined. 
I caused the spam of spent utxo, by forgetting to stop it from checking mempool for unspents. 
The "fix" we have, doesnt actually fix the real issue, but it works around it, by making sure that all utxo selected have 5 confirms and are not spent.

[19-Oct-19 11:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also, with utxo cache or not, this issue would have been much the same.

[19-Oct-19 11:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems there is maybe one minor bug with -26 errors, but it is rare, and most liekly a race condtion of some kind. Doesnt seem worth fixing at this stage. 100% perfection cannot be attained with a large distributed network, but I think I got darn close to 98% of notarizations to work.  At one time I rember it was less tahn 50% sucess rate on KMD main net... So its come a long way.

@CMaurice  looks like everything is fine on my end here... My logs are not getting longer any more. 😄

[19-Oct-19 11:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok now we need to make it work with CHIPS, then BLUR 🙂

[20-Oct-19 12:56 AM] CrisF#3405
BLUR!  Yes, please 🙏

LOL .... thats like the very last thing to touch

[20-Oct-19 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry merge problems... almost ready, not sure anything here is related, but we need to merge this anyway it seems

[20-Oct-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  I spoke to @Biz  yesterday, will be getting to BLUR soon, doesnt seem too dfficult, but its quite diffrent so may take a while to get it stable.

[20-Oct-19 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can do `start.sh` to update CFEK chains to latest FSM.

Great!  I have been running a BLUR node for a while now.  Haven't had time to set up more than that so far.

[20-Oct-19 01:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't sure what was happening there.  Not much in the channel.

[20-Oct-19 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice. Maybe you can help me with it then 😉 I have had a look at the code, but I didnt get too far yesterday. Its the weekend after all lol.. About to go outside to get my RB30 GQ patrol actually running for the first time in 2 years 😄

Let me know if there's anything I can do.

[20-Oct-19 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will do. Will be days before I get fully into it.

[20-Oct-19 01:43 AM] CrisF#3405
It was quite easy to set up.  Very different, which was good to see.

[20-Oct-19 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One thing at  a time... Im taking it easy tbh, bit of work here, bit there... Seems more productive this way too lol

[20-Oct-19 01:44 AM] CrisF#3405
No rush, haha.  I've got a lot on the go atm.

[20-Oct-19 01:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that sounds like a good way to go about it.

[20-Oct-19 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmmm bug in start.sh I think... its not stopping all daemons. do `stop.sh` then `start.sh` to make sure it updates properly. Build is working. I'll check back here in a few hours.

[20-Oct-19 01:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Seemed to work for me.  Will do it again and check./

What happened?

[20-Oct-19 01:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @kevinkatovic,
Please ask in  #talk-mining to learn more about why that may be.

[20-Oct-19 01:55 AM] CrisF#3405
The miners there should be able to explain the intricacies of mining and staking.

[20-Oct-19 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why can't I get the 1200 labs a day again?`
@kevinkatovic you're about to get less again because you're complaining again

[20-Oct-19 02:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I'll just be mining LABS again until @kevinkatovic goes away forever

[20-Oct-19 02:08 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Your emblem looks agressive your words are cruel you profitability should match your nastiness

[20-Oct-19 02:09 AM] kevinkatovic#1278

India?

[20-Oct-19 02:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I doubt I'll ever take a loss on LABS; however, if I do, it will be worth it to make your dumping ass go away

[20-Oct-19 02:11 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Are you a complete ass why mine a coin that has no value and thats worthless.

[20-Oct-19 02:11 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
maybe buy 100 a3's

[20-Oct-19 02:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because unlike you and other dumpers, I see future value

[20-Oct-19 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I saw the value in LABS long before you were here and I'll invest in in long after you're gone

[20-Oct-19 02:12 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
someone ban this idiot india child

[20-Oct-19 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Maybe we will trace your ip where you stand and just remind you how pathetic you are in reality

[20-Oct-19 02:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PS - if I do get "banned" then where would you mine?

[20-Oct-19 02:13 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Fuck off

your a idiot i can't see anyone keeping you around unless someone just as pathetic agrees to manipulating your stupid resource of 500 ksol

[20-Oct-19 02:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 500 is just my play hash, you silly dumper

@kevinkatovic you can hate me all you like and I'll still make a profit in the long run 😎

[20-Oct-19 03:15 AM] Biz#0842
`Wasn't sure what was happening there.  Not much in the channel.` @CrisF 

@blackjok3r  and I had a good chat about BLUR and dPoW . Something I’ll be doing here very soon (probably tomorrow) Is typing up a flow diagram for code comprehension, and of the higher up stuff for the less code-savvy too. It’s been a crap ton of code, but it’s very close to being fully operational. About 90% of the work done, I’d venture. Everything is integrated deeply into the Blur binaries, so adding my work to other XMR-derived chains should be relatively smooth for future

[20-Oct-19 03:15 AM] Biz#0842
You know how busy is, usually very quiet haha 🙂

[20-Oct-19 03:18 AM] Biz#0842
Because it’s integrated so deeply into wallet, daemon, protocol messaging, just about everywhere, it’s a lot of jumping around and requires a lot of knowledge of how the CN networks operate. So that is the purpose in the write up. Eliminating that barrier hopefully

[20-Oct-19 03:19 AM] Biz#0842
I think it directly touches every layer except p2p, and even that layer it uses indirectly  through the protocol relays

[20-Oct-19 03:20 AM] Biz#0842
Cool thing is everything will be automated, and I re-used the existing notary BTC keys as seeds for viewkey generation

[20-Oct-19 03:20 AM] Biz#0842
So it’s really hands-off and transparent for all NN operators

[20-Oct-19 03:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for the update, @Biz 🔥 
Very happy to hear of the great progress.  The busy/quiet comes at a good time for me.  Been quiet in #blur for the same reason, although different work :abusedsmily: 
I'm keen to help out wherever I can.  Will keep a closer eye on it.

[20-Oct-19 03:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @kevinkatovic,
Please refrain from excessive and personally directed swearing in our channel. 
@Alright, I'd like to remove the multiple unproductive`fuck off` posts directed at @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢.  It makes us all look like children.
BTW ComputerGenie, there are 2 of you in here now.  An imposter?

[20-Oct-19 03:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes 2, not an imposter
I added the 2nd account when mods went all power hungry

Ok, cool 👍

I'm not going to not help here because someone has an issue with something in a priv channel

Not following.

[20-Oct-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My car started btw.... but I think the timing is off... Had to turn the dizzy back past the full adjustment retarded.. But its smooth, no sledgehammer noise in teh head anymore, and seems to run much better than it did last time it worked... Really wasnt that much work lol, he just had to hammer the crap out of the front bar where the bonnet latches to slide it all the way out... 
The joys of working on a car that will probably explode 😂

[20-Oct-19 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but I think the timing is off...`
weren't you a feken mechanic? 😕

[20-Oct-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its hilarious though the car that the engine came out of had a broken bonnet latch and the bonnet flew off at 120km/h hit the root and flew 20m into the air and almost landed on the car behind me... and now the car I put the engine in, has no bonnet latch 🤣

[20-Oct-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.. but you cant time the timing belt with all the pullys still there...

[20-Oct-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we guessed... Its an RB30... It will run fine with it a tooth off.

[20-Oct-19 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It will run fine with it a tooth off.`
I was right, rednecks do live all over the world 🤣

[20-Oct-19 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that sounds like some shit I'd do

[20-Oct-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Litterally has half a motor from a seized engine, including all the pistons, head from a drag car, block from an R31 skyline and a heap of random nissan and holden parts. I think in the end it took parts from 14 diffrent cars to make it work, and my guess is 200hp out all 4 wheels for about a week before it explodes. I think the turbo is good for 15psi, currently running 5psi and was already quite fast.

[20-Oct-19 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My mate did it, I wouldnt do ti that way, too scared id break it... but hes had those engines before, basically lined it all up by eye 😂

[20-Oct-19 03:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`holden parts.`
that explains why it runs like shit :troll_lol:

Withbout being able to see any marks, or having a timing light

[20-Oct-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL... the plan was to use Holden polished rocker cover, Ford Maveric front grille and leave the rest of teh badges NISSAN PATROL... but I couldnt fit a grille in front of the front mount, and the holden rocker cover had massiv breathers on it that I have no hoses big enough for 😦

hopefully get a video of it driving later today. Not sure I should take it ont he road, but i think the worst that can happen is the cops impound it if someone complains, trick will be to not drive for long. It took the cops at least 15mins to drive 300m last night to investigate where I did a skid in the falcon, and by then I was long gone.
