so much happens in LABS, it's hard to keep up. It would be cool to see something like a "LABS tech tuesday" or something that gives a VERY high level summary of what is going on in LABS world. Or a LABS twitter account that summarizes big things with appropriate memepics. Just a thought, and congrats on all the new stuff! 👍

There's a new iguana port? Connection refused...

[29-May-19 02:37 PM] CrisF#3405
Think it's 9333? @zatJUM

[29-May-19 02:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
That's what I have 🤔

[29-May-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKBET1 finally notarized adn notary pay worked without breaking. Seems I got the opreturn to work with it. 😃  @Alright  @TonyL

I'm waiting for LABS @ 7.77$ atm

[29-May-19 02:57 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
So is BET1 paying Labs to notaries?

[29-May-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no, native coin. But a later chain needs notary pay. And it didnt work with it, so we fixed it today.

[29-May-19 03:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't have any iguana cnx (`curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\"
dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq '[.[] | select(.bestk > 0)] | . |length'` displays nothing)

[29-May-19 03:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
Have already pkill'd it and restarted but still no cnx

[29-May-19 03:13 PM] PHBA2061#2530
does it return anything with ?

[29-May-19 03:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
no

[29-May-19 03:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
weird, which means iguana is not started yet in the background

[29-May-19 03:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
when you `./start.sh` does it output anything ?

[29-May-19 03:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm on the phone now... I'll try in an hour or two

[29-May-19 04:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
iguana segfaulted...

[29-May-19 04:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
Restarted, but cnx now = 0

[29-May-19 04:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
Is there a banned ip stuff, like for coins?

[29-May-19 04:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
do you see `iguana/iguana` in htop ?

[29-May-19 04:24 PM] zatJUM#9924

purpose of this CFEKBET0 chain was just to test that ac_notarypay can work with a coinbase OP_RETURN properly, it takes about 2 days for it the "mature" then we can do some basic tests and launch the LABS fungible chain

[29-May-19 11:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there will be an easy solo pool like I did for KMD, but that's likely 2 weeks out

[30-May-19 12:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also might be a public solo like for pirate if I can fix the coinbase bleed where the stratum thinks that NN payments belong to the pool 😛

[30-May-19 12:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Whomever is PoW mining with: RNnLgqHH8L5xsumugMWaHGEPSQjYveGu8g, you need to take the space out of your name

Testing some migrates  `CFEKFEK -> CFEKBET01`

[30-May-19 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2 migrates finsihed, and sent 10k funds to burn address, I think notarypay on CFEKBET1 maybe a bit high, it burnt though 90 coiuns in less thana  day even with long block times.

[30-May-19 04:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Blocks quite faster than 300 seconds now it seems

[30-May-19 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could be hash rate, or there could be bug... I think we need a couple of days blocks, to take average block time? I think the verushash blocktime is close, but its not exactly right, as the math required is float basd,a nd I used an approximate interger. Basically worked out what the constant was, and just hardcoded it. Its out by ~10% or so.

[30-May-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Spending today reqwriting CHIPS pubkey activation code, ready to port to all external coins. 
Idea is to make it so that monkey can change seasons and other coins can handle their won hard fork 😃 no more "pay me now etc lol" Just fix it yourself, not my respinsibility if it fails from something you screwed up.

i also had a boost/optional: no such file

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] jorian#4555
and installing libboost-dev fixed that

[30-May-19 10:03 AM] jorian#4555
but this is berkeley shit and that is always a PITA

[30-May-19 10:09 AM] jorian#4555
i got it to build by commenting out the ifdef BUILDROGUE part, so that it always uses Berkeley from depends folder

afaik no ports were opened for resultion of connection problems for others yesterday

@CMaurice Please relaunch chain, post here runtime logs

[30-May-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian 
Aha... The makecclib script isn't exiting after it builds rogue. That is the bug. Will fix

[30-May-19 12:56 PM] CMaurice#1685
@Nabob I can post any logs you ask for from the current running processes

[30-May-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My guess is that something didn't build for ya, and your on some incorrect komodod and it has a diff magic. In about 30mins I'll fix that maybe then it will work

[30-May-19 12:58 PM] Nabob#5004

[30-May-19 12:58 PM] CMaurice#1685
manual komodo buils did seem to finish quickly, perhaps per your comment above, @blackjok3r

[30-May-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe, or maybe all.seeds are down, I can also fix that by making my notary a seed again... Alright removed it 😂

[30-May-19 01:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@jorian I had this errors as well, then I tried 
```
cd src
make
```
and it worked

[30-May-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its an error with makecclib, I tried to make a fix that we could pish to kmd but I failed badly, can easily see the problem now, shouldn't be hard to fix.

[30-May-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
