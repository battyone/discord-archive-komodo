@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ```is CFEKMYLO6 totally borked or is it just my server?```Here it's OK, I had a nota 3 mn ago

Looks like the problem I had a few days ago. Remember?

[20-Oct-19 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't remember "a few days ago" much less what someone else had then :troll:

cant believe I just rented some hash an hour ago and I havent mined 1000 LABS yet. Its all your fault @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

not too shabby... all in all im back to half my original STAKED > LABS haul just staking and sending NN earnings to the staker.

[20-Oct-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Oszy  
You can lock the utxos manually. 
The splittter will split the entire balance only, you can manually lock, or use a script, to lock all the utxos you want to keep, then do a split, and it will spend the utxos you did not lock.

[20-Oct-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made this at some point, cant rember if it works 100 correctly. But it does close to what you want to do. Should be trivial to modify it for your needs.

[20-Oct-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Its all your fault @ComputerGenie`
prolly 😛

[20-Oct-19 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I do not see CFEKMYLO6 problem, because my daemon did not stop. Will fix start.sh bug first, then try and reproduce the daemon locking and not responding to RPC calls.

[20-Oct-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol this never actually worked... Could explain a lot 🤣

[20-Oct-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If >2 chains use same branch, then only the first chain in assetchains.json on that branch was stopped automatically

`If >2 chains use same branch, then only the first chain in assetchains.json on that branch was stopped automatically`
why would branch even matter when issuing a cli stop?

[20-Oct-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because its bash spagetti and it makes no sense 🤣

[20-Oct-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once it updates a branch on the first chain that uses it, it no longer could see that any chains using that branch needed an update.

[20-Oct-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So it only stopped the avery first one. Hence why I said to stop first in last update... cant beleive I didnt see this before, guess I havent looked at the output of `start.sh` closely enough lol

_is so over the whole "is now on AtomicDEX" thing when everything in the coins repo should be an automatic option (including LABS, which was added 4 months ago)_

[20-Oct-19 04:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
guis have to be selective I guess, too much to scroll thru. not all in coins repo are compatible, but ecosys projects are.

[20-Oct-19 04:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

`guis have to be selective I guess, too much to scroll thru. `
For a team member, that's a very naive comment. It's all about revenue 😦

[20-Oct-19 04:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dunno, I just test the app, and then get back to CLI

[20-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Alright#0419

install dependencies of https://github.com/kmdlabs/stakednotary

clone it 

sync LABS fully, start the daemon with -pubkey

fund the node with a tiny amount of LABS(1 LABS is more than enough)

run `./NNvote.py`

select `1 | NN lottery`

select `1 | How to participate` 

read that
