you can try it if you like, really don't think it'll work though

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
you'll have to comment out the "absurdly high fees" error in the code

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
why does that even exist I wonder

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that happened becuaes of a BUG in the Export TX creation

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you were able to set in the migratecoin script 2 diffrent amounts for export

[30-Dec-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one for the amount that was imported, and another for the amount that was burnt

[30-Dec-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this created a condition where shit loads of burnt coins were "left over"

[30-Dec-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and went to the miner on the target

[30-Dec-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed that, be removing that extra burn amount, and made it simply add all the vouts.

[30-Dec-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it cna only burn what is imported ... this is checked on export createion and import validation. All is safe

seems like something you want to turn off if you're a miner

😂 

[30-Dec-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
would that really matter, unless a user also turned it off ?

[30-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Alright#0419
not likely to matter at all because the tx wouldn't really propagate across the network

[30-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Alright#0419
BUT

[30-Dec-18 09:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`would that really matter, unless a user also turned it off ?`
It should just be a local stop, not a checked one iirc

[30-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Alright#0419
you might get really lucky and be one hop away from someone trying to give coins to miners

[30-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
for example, when I was burning PIRATE, that allowed me to not worry about someone else mining the inputs > outputs tx

ok well managed to fix migrates ... I think that was all. Everyone please update to the latest on all your nodes and be on the look out for new or old bugs. I think that wraps up the last of them tbh.

[30-Dec-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The mining freeze *should* be gone. As should the wallet corruption issues,  if it does happen, we now have some prints on daemon launch and it wont trigger a pointless rescan. With the changes to the staker, using a staking node to make transacions and other things is working well, so people wil be able to stake and test on the same VPS 🚀

[30-Dec-18 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  migrate issues fixed on latest master. You can resume working on your scripts. 😃

[30-Dec-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it requires everyone to be updated... as it was a hard forking change. Because there are no existing sapling imports in any chain, they will still sync. If they dont please report it so we cna start new chains before the stress test.

[30-Dec-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181

nou

[30-Dec-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whenever ... if ppl dont do migrates until we are all iupdated it will be ok.

[30-Dec-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise it will fork

[30-Dec-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am updating all my ming nodes and notary now... if it forks to a mess... we just start new chains before stress test.

[30-Dec-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its possible you might need to manually do `./zcutil/build.sh -j4` before it will build, there were changes to the Makefile.

[30-Dec-18 10:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Did stop.sh, start.sh and seems to have statted np.

[30-Dec-18 10:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Also,```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKED getrawtransaction 9c628e5646bf503586b8f894729aa3d632f3c4c515b521efb5d9cc95dccc4d51 1
error code: -5
error message:

```

[30-Dec-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah my notary worked... I stopped both CFEKED nodes that were updated and had that tx

[30-Dec-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as it was a hardfork... so we need all notaries updated before anyone does any migrates.

[30-Dec-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
give it a few days. Everyone enjoy the new year.

[30-Dec-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181

how so?

I ahvent done it here, because its a testnet.. but a-team does it every 6H and is contantly in top 7 since I made that

[30-Dec-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the wallet has that much tx history its going to be slow as hell

[30-Dec-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ping times + listunspent call time == counts of notarisations

[30-Dec-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can lower one easily the other requires moving your node lol

if that isnt effective... use the wallet rest script

the actual wallet wont decrease in size

[30-Dec-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best measure is:
`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`

[30-Dec-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r So you use VMs for your NN and LABS NN?

[30-Dec-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`listunspent` time is moot with utxo counts being 5-50
`listtransactions` time, might matter though

My server runs VMWare EXSi on a pair od SDcards ... then has 2x 1TB SSDs RAID1 for mainnet notary VM (with BTC full node) and 2x 512GB SSDs (RAID1) for a seed node VM. Seed runs all nodes, (not BTC) and labs notary... also has a stratum server there if I need to use that. 64GB each VM, 24 cores. 
Then I overprovision testing VMs aswell.
