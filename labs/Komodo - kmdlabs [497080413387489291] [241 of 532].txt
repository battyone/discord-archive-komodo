this will save us from hardforking to fix bugs in contracts

[25-Jan-19 05:03 AM] Alright#0419
we can always hardfork to add them if we have the need

[25-Jan-19 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
debug them on a test chain and then add?

[25-Jan-19 05:04 AM] Alright#0419
main chain should hardfork as little as possible

[25-Jan-19 05:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many branches are you figuring for repo hierarchy?

[25-Jan-19 05:06 AM] Alright#0419
blackjok3r -> dev -> master for main chain things
<your_name> for your own branch/chain

[25-Jan-19 05:07 AM] Alright#0419
<your_name> branch would be the "master" branch for your chain

Any need for a faucet on mainchain?

[25-Jan-19 05:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`<your_name> branch would be the "master" branch for your chain`
That could end up being one huge messy repo, no?

[25-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think we will need branches for each chain eventually because of ac_cclib

[25-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Alright#0419
just a separate file for each chain in a single branch

[25-Jan-19 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
but for now, I think it's best to have separate branches

[25-Jan-19 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF not sure, do we?

[25-Jan-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
main chain import export only is a great idea

[25-Jan-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
can have faucet on separate chain then import to main if you need them there

👍 

[25-Jan-19 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
forces ppl to use migrates 😛

[25-Jan-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
also prevents hardforks

shexy 

[25-Jan-19 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
we can always add contracts to main chain

[25-Jan-19 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
but they must be truly battle tested

[25-Jan-19 05:11 AM] Alright#0419
simple bug in any contract can be a hardfork

[25-Jan-19 05:12 AM] Alright#0419
so dealing with CEXs, getting all notaries to update, all pools, *everything*

[25-Jan-19 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
idea of main chain, was to basically never have to fork it

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
except every 2 months :trollface:

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] Alright#0419
or do we have a better solution for that yet

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not really up there on my list yet

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to enable ratification.

[25-Jan-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then make it work

[25-Jan-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with it jaems said was that notaries never did it... So to make them do it... we make the ratification tx the tx that pays them.

[25-Jan-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This places the notaries on chain

[25-Jan-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when they see the ratification... they know at X block to use this new set of keys

[25-Jan-19 05:14 AM] Alright#0419
must be signed by all current notaries or what

[25-Jan-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a notarisation

[25-Jan-19 05:15 AM] Alright#0419
should probably be more min sigs than a typical notarization

[25-Jan-19 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look... I didnt make it and OI dont even know how it works... I proposed that the notaries could be in a tx on chain,, rather than int he source code... james said ratification already does this but its not used

[25-Jan-19 05:16 AM] Alright#0419
no worries, long term goals

[25-Jan-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
havent had time to figure out whatit actaully does

[25-Jan-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for now a hard fork every 2 months isnt that bad

[25-Jan-19 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
what are we defining "2 months" as

[25-Jan-19 05:17 AM] Alright#0419
literally by the calendar or by estimated block times

[25-Jan-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code works with timestamps

[25-Jan-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
decided by us at this point

[25-Jan-19 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anyone with git access could change it :S

[25-Jan-19 05:19 AM] Alright#0419
so call it noon UTC on first day of the month every 2 months?

[25-Jan-19 05:20 AM] Alright#0419

are both of these EVAL codes required for import/export

[25-Jan-19 05:21 AM] Alright#0419
```
EVAL(EVAL_IMPORTPAYOUT, 0xe1)  \
EVAL(EVAL_IMPORTCOIN, 0xe2) \
```

[25-Jan-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
import coin I think only... payout was some testing mode

[25-Jan-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably best to disable it

[25-Jan-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just incase there is some bug with it

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should launch the entire cluster in test mode today. So ppl can play with it over weekend, see if any issues

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
sure, let me figure out notary payout chain

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I was thinking to just leave it on main chain... but having a seperat chain is much better idea

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
or well let's launch main test chain then I'll do that

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
mastertest?

[25-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
or master

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah.. I'll check out that spreadsheet right now and run some numbers

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mastertest

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need to test it

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
Ok, I'll start it

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no way to get FSM to master ... its fucking impossible to merge..

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
airdropping STAKED4 to it to

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
good idea

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
will go through what launch will look like

[25-Jan-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
practice run is good. 😃

[25-Jan-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
just changed stakedchain org name to KMDLabs

[25-Jan-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
likely to cause a bit of trouble at first, so just bear with us as we fix everything

no, get it done now :trollface:

[25-Jan-19 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED4 still has a peer 😮

"addr": "45.125.247.234:25798"

Just loaded it up from bootastrap from my webserver... it laoded and had a peer

[25-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
I'm making dirty black hat changes to this airdrop onto test chain

[25-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
first person to find all of them gets 200 KMD

[25-Jan-19 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
doing this to demonstrate how important it is to verify the airdrop was done properly

[25-Jan-19 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw (because I like to try shit)...
if you run 0pay:
`./komodod -ac_name=OUR -ac_reward=1478310502 -ac_halving=525600 -ac_cc=42 -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_perc=77700 -ac_staked=93 -ac_pubkey=02652a3f3e00b3a1875a918314f0bac838d6dd189a346fa623f5efe9541ac0b98c -ac_public=1 -pubkey=02116493d41c84bdb6ec4806870312307fee732943bf496294b34e7df551fc60b4`
with the branch you asked for testing
if you`setgenerate true 0` and try to run a pool as well
it will lock up
`423 seconds until elegible, waiting.
383 seconds until elegible, waiting.
362 seconds until elegible, waiting.
319 seconds until elegible, waiting.
255 seconds until elegible, waiting.
3 seconds until elegible, waiting.`
until timer is up

@blackjok3r

[25-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
I was helping them test the params, but wasn't told it would be launched so soon

[25-Jan-19 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh so its trying to stake with a pool?

[25-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
now it's "Alright said it was fine" :abusedsmily:

[25-Jan-19 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wasn't told it would be launched so soon`
MGNX Jr.? :trollface:

[25-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
fuck no, dudes are legit

[25-Jan-19 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so its trying to stake with a pool?`
*It's* not, I was

[25-Jan-19 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I tried to use 1 node for staking and pool

[25-Jan-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I dont think you can...

[25-Jan-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But i will have a look at that soon... maybe I can make ti let you

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
you definitely cannot

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can make it let you

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I dont think you can...`
no shit, I just told you I can't 😝

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
do not do `setgenerate true 0` on a node that is using blocktemplate to make pow blocks

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm pretty sure I can fix that 😛

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only HOW it chooses weatehr its staking or not

[25-Jan-19 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easily changed

[25-Jan-19 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I know it's all your fault because it's your pool too :trollface:

[25-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
genie, will you try to claim this 200 KMD?

[25-Jan-19 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"this"?

[25-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
well you buried it as soon as I posted it

[25-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
not surprised you didn't see it 😂

[25-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
look up there^

[25-Jan-19 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I could learn how airdrops work and see what I can see 😛
