The error log:
 ""event"": {
          ""data"": {
            ""error"": ""maker_swap:387] utxo:1132] JsonRpcError { request: JsonRpcRequest { jsonrpc: \""2.0\"", id: \""32\"", method: \""blockchain.transaction.get\"", params: [String(\""e0ecc7338b7662ad721c06d00d0e99589f35670ab11473e1dfa9dec9748c9854\""), Bool(false)] }, error: Response(Object({\""code\"": Number(2), \""message\"": String(\""daemon error: DaemonError({\\'code\\': -5, \\'message\\': \\'No information available about transaction\\'})\"")})) }""
          },
          ""type"": ""TakerFeeValidateFailed""

Can someone explain this? I try to set an order with the atomic dex api and buy it from my mobile.","",""
