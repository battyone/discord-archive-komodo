Andy Brice pinpoints that there's no stupid behavior like going to an investor and saying, ""eating 1 percent of the market is enough to do business.""

If there are 1000 companies in power function, what should the ranking be to become a 1% market share company?
It says only 13th place can it make up 1 percent of the market.

If the number of companies is 100, they can only take 1 percent at the most when they can they rank 19th.

If individual events, such as corporate competition, are networked and the influence of a particular event is higher than that of others, the normal distribution does not represent reality correctly. 

Let's not jump to conclusions that everything in the world will follow the regular distribution.","",""
