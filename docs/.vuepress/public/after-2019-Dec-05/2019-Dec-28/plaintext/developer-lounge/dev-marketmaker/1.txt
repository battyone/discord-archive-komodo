Hey guys, my swap with atomic dex api always fails (step 2 / 3 ) and mm2 tells me the sender is banned.
The error log:
 "event": {
          "data": {
            "error": "maker_swap:387] utxo:1132] JsonRpcError { request: JsonRpcRequest { jsonrpc: \"2.0\", id: \"32\", method: \"blockchain.transaction.get\", params: [String(\"e0ecc7338b7662ad721c06d00d0e99589f35670ab11473e1dfa9dec9748c9854\"), Bool(false)] }, error: Response(Object({\"code\": Number(2), \"message\": String(\"daemon error: DaemonError({\\'code\\': -5, \\'message\\': \\'No information available about transaction\\'})\")})) }"
          },
          "type": "TakerFeeValidateFailed"

Can someone explain this? I try to set an order with the atomic dex api and buy it from my mobile.

It tells me :

27 14:40:20, common:937] RPC error response: lp_ordermatch:852] sender pubkey 028b2e2d4a963657a1ba52b0c22410edb96fb0bad188e561766a8732843cb5d531 is banned

[27-Dec-19 02:40 PM] Mische#6695
but I restared the API and didn't cancel any orders beforehand so I'm wondering right now

Duplicate pubkey from 2 different devices maybe??

[27-Dec-19 03:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Why attempt this trade?? For the fun of it??

I am trying to trade with @PengPuffPow

[27-Dec-19 03:42 PM] Mische#6695
we want to setup a automated trading bot for the atomic dex

[27-Dec-19 03:42 PM] Mische#6695
but we can't finish the swaps

[27-Dec-19 03:44 PM] cipi#4502
`No information available about transaction` ... looks like your daemon is not in sync... it can't find the `TakerFee`tx on the blockchain

[27-Dec-19 03:45 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
@cipi hi and how do we sync it?

[27-Dec-19 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Could be outdated daemon

[27-Dec-19 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Could be tons of things

[27-Dec-19 03:45 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Connections

[27-Dec-19 03:46 PM] cipi#4502
yes, indeed... could also be Taker not configured properly, tx is rejected and maker only sees `No information available about transaction`

[27-Dec-19 03:46 PM] cipi#4502
both logs (taker and maker) should be looked into

[27-Dec-19 03:47 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
we use rick and morty for this and just followed the atomic dex setup

this is the result if we check the swap status

[27-Dec-19 03:48 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Its most likely a networking problem-- my best guess -- ports -- all guesses are wild ATM

[27-Dec-19 03:49 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
maybe a problem with linux subsystem for windows? ðŸ˜‚

[27-Dec-19 03:51 PM] cipi#4502
that was the log from the maker, which only says he can't find the tx (takerfee) on the blockchain... it doesn't tell why... this info could be in the logs from the taker

[27-Dec-19 03:52 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
@cipi is there a log folder on android?

[27-Dec-19 03:53 PM] gcharang#6833
settings -> share log

[27-Dec-19 03:53 PM] cipi#4502
i don't know where the folder is

[27-Dec-19 03:54 PM] PengPuffPow#8948
@gcharang & @cipi thanks! ðŸ™‚
