[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio you forgot to tell them, that connection info will only work on the `dev` branch I think, right?

[27-Dec-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are very close to merging dev to master, but not yet.

[27-Dec-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Oh yes, it will only work with our dev branch atm

Not quite ready yet, but let's get the ball rolling.
We are in a code freeze for touching anything that could possibly be consensus code. From here on out, only changes to RPC, tests or docs.

[27-Dec-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 54,000 lines of code will change when I merge dev to master

[27-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some of that is weird data that was in the repo, but I also deleted immense amounts of code

[27-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Amazing work! You made this all possible! So much fun to play with Hush Smartchains

[27-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why our build system compiles Hush much faster

[27-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think @denio said something like half the build time on his system

[27-Dec-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> as a developer, this is really nice. It doesn't really matter to end users, I get that too

We don't like vaporware promises from other projects, so $HUSH already has a fully working #z2z testcoin we call $ZUSH. This will test a future network upgrade with these consensus rules.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't just talk about stuff, @denio makes things happen!!!

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All those screenshots are courtesy of @denio, i didn't have room to mention but tagged him in the photos ðŸ™‚ Forgive me @denio

[27-Dec-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Hush can now spin up z2z smart chains with one commad like this: `./hush-smart-chain -ac_name=ZUSH -ac_private=1 -ac_blocktime=120 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=150000 -addnode=81.169.218.223`

[27-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we inherited this from KMD, jl777 did most of the work long ago. We are just focusing on z2z PoW chains. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, Satoshi and jl777

[27-Dec-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I deleted all PoS stuff from Hush, so if you want that, KMD is the place. Hush is focused *solely* on PoW Sapling chains with an emphasis on z2z. We do not encourage people to make non-z2z chains with Hush, but it's still possible. Mostly for testing purposes and to experiment with hybrid taddr/zaddr chains

Germans are queuing at Degussa store to buy #gold in KÃ¶ln. From Jan. 1, 2020, the limit to buy gold anonymously drops from â‚¬10,000 down to â‚¬2,000. Only two years ago the limit was â‚¬15,000.

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> this viewkey thing is pretty new to zcash forks/kmd/arrr/hush etc right?

[27-Dec-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh yes, radix42 merged it into KMD.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC still hasn't merged it, or maybe did recently
