[dscrd-prt] <LoPhatMelk> Soooo, anyone else see the interview with mcafee on @Crypto Rich  channel on YT? Dude is something else, but quite interesting and hopefully he becomes truly interested in our project.

[27-Dec-19 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> yeah i watched it and he was quite interested in pirate name and tech and repeatedly said to get in touch with devs

:alert: :alert: :alert: @everyone :alert: :alert: :alert: 
Due to some scheduling issues with hardfork podcast, the interview with hardfork, masari and mcafee will be pushed (date will be given soon) and the format will be more of a round table discussion to include other projects. I will update everyone as soon as I have more info"

As far as I remember this interview was planned, but for some reason it was postponed

[27-Dec-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> but i must say every coin mcafee has been with in the past few years has had a controversy eg sky, apl, doc, and countless others so arrr should be very careful dealing with him

[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> you may accidentally use his name, but you dont have to eat your own dick level mcafee

[27-Dec-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> bill gates got alot of things right, but screwed over so many ppl to be right and win, mcafee may spread teh word, but he by no means represents the community imho....he is trouble, but at thsi point even a guy like mcafee is needed to push the envelope sometimes *sigh*

[27-Dec-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> just gotta watch yourself around that guy, i think ppl eventually stop taking you seriosuly after awhile with him in the room
