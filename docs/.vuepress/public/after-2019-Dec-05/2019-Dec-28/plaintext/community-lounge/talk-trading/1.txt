Could get gold ETFs

[27-Dec-19 01:42 AM] richardt#2807
Anything gold or silver is looking to be a good bet given potential future events

[27-Dec-19 02:07 AM] AkiraX#8269
Where does btc go from here

[27-Dec-19 02:07 AM] AkiraX#8269
Up or down

[27-Dec-19 02:19 AM] richardt#2807
My best guess is another pump around time of the halving, then down after that

[27-Dec-19 02:50 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think we drop to $6600-$6800

[27-Dec-19 03:20 AM] Privatoshi#9487

[27-Dec-19 03:21 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I got into BCH earlier.

Some farm or OG BTC miner is exiting Bitcoin right now. 158,832 BTC sold in the last 12 weeks, all first spend.

$1.175 billion in value. https://t.co/euGOteAQKG

[27-Dec-19 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Why does this have to be an OG miner?

[27-Dec-19 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
We saw an increase in hashrate last month, cant it be new super efficient miner just selling off for instant profit?

[27-Dec-19 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm a month of catching all blocks should be 50k btc

[27-Dec-19 07:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So not probable

[27-Dec-19 07:43 AM] jspook16#3059
Exiting to what?

@jspook16 fiat?

[27-Dec-19 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Although he cant seem to give the specific to exchange tx

[27-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just says they were all unspent minted utxos

[27-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So not sure how to interpret that post

[27-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might as well be someone consolidating utxo if he cant provide exchange tx

@Cryptoon Also saw a post a few days ago of 92k eth transfer to coinbase from a single wallet, i quess ppl expect a huge dump

[27-Dec-19 10:10 AM] Markus#5464
considering all those longs on bitfinex it would make sense

Looks like TrustNodes found the person behind the large ETH - Exchange move on Christmas.

Ethereum co-founder Jeff Wilcke interacted with Ethereum Name Service back in 2017 which led to the link.
