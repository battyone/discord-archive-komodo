would be good as komodo gets some light on real innovation and organic marketing in such events.","",""

so that would extend their mileage, buuut it seems the whole core organization is not operating very harmoniously so that won't really help","",""
"347922216429813760","grewalsatinder#9653","15-Dec-19 08:57 AM","true, having more value in hand to sell and run for a little longer will help some, and also very possible that some will actually make it somewhere in market with something usable. But I doubt many of those will still handle their financial budget responsibly. If they don't, they are out of the business sooner than later.","",""

Just keep your funds off of exchanges and let the dead bodies resting in peace.   https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/14/business/lawyers-exhumation-gerald-cotten-intl-scli/index.html    I guess these lawyers are even worse than vultures.","",""

Not after reading about 200 millions in unsubstantiated deposits that he wrote into existence under his pseudonymous Chris Markay accounts. Unbelievable.   See  p35
