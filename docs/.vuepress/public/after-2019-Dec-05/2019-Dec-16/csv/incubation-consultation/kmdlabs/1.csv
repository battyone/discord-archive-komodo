Cannot contact joker at all. This isn't normal. Even when he fucks off for a few days on discord, I have other means of communication that he would normally respond with. 

If I don't hear from him within about a day, we will start transitioning all of our infra to komodoplatform repos prior to the fork. There's a good chance ac_notarypay will need to be disabled for a little while. I'm deathly afraid to touch it other than deactivating it entirely. I'm not confident I won't introduce an inflation bug.

The CFEK cluster is likely to die off for a little while as well.","",""
