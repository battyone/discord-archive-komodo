You deposit KMD into a special address, you receive 80% of the value in a NEW stable coin which you can spend or do whatever. If your deposit value falls below the 80% amount you had withdrawn, ANYONE can liquidate your account by sending stable coins and receiving your KMD. 
You still have your stable coins, but the stable coins used to liquidate your account are destroyed. This way liquidators keep the price stable and it doesn't need a single issuing entity. All coins are +100% backed, no trust needed","",""
