The original inspiration for this project was to make a coinmarket capitlization page that only lists coins that are traded on an atomic swap powered DEX. The page would also show DEX trading volumes and list all the DEXes. Very similar to coinmarketcap.com but only for atomic swaps.

I guess we are almost there, right?

We still have a domain http://atomicmarketcap.com/ – would we use this domain for this project? By listing the DEX markets the site would advertise all the DEXes that use atomic swaps (currently only AtomicDEX & HyperDEX), similarly how you can check all the CEX markets for Komodo from coinmarketcap.com

Once we are off the beta and get liquidity we could use the site as an advertising campaign to make people aware about atomic swap trading and about how it is the future.

find alice->b_addr (alice chain)
from there find b_addr->bob (alice chain)
look at b_addr->bob tx, from here we know the script that b_addr->alice must be on bob chain
