Any results in the Zec issue after the blossom update?
Can’t swap and send Zec from AtomicDEX!

Trying to do a KMD/HUSH swap and get a message saying my KMD is locked by ongoing swaps. I don’t have any swaps happening. Any ideas?

did you have a failed swap in the past 4 hours?

[15-Dec-19 03:21 PM] J.J.#3939
Yes

Let the app stay open for a while, funds should be unlocked after that.
