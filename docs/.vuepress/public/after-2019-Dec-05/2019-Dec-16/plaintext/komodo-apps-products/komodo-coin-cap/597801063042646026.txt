What's the status of this project? 

The original inspiration for this project was to make a coinmarket capitlization page that only lists coins that are traded on an atomic swap powered DEX. The page would also show DEX trading volumes and list all the DEXes. Very similar to coinmarketcap.com but only for atomic swaps.

I guess we are almost there, right?

We still have a domain http://atomicmarketcap.com/ – would we use this domain for this project? By listing the DEX markets the site would advertise all the DEXes that use atomic swaps (currently only AtomicDEX & HyperDEX), similarly how you can check all the CEX markets for Komodo from coinmarketcap.com

Once we are off the beta and get liquidity we could use the site as an advertising campaign to make people aware about atomic swap trading and about how it is the future.

@Audo do you know if the code of this project is opensource ?

[15-Dec-19 08:13 AM] gcharang#6833
I think this was it: <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard>

[15-Dec-19 08:15 AM] phm87#7395
Crypto51.app does not retrieve NH prices and does not display 51% cost since weeks/months. Maybe there is demand for such a website

[15-Dec-19 08:15 AM] phm87#7395
Thank you @gcharang

my front-end codes are on github <https://github.com/NOCTLJRNE/Antara-coin-cap>
also hosted on heroku <http://antara-coin-cap.herokuapp.com/coinCap>
haven't made any update since months though

What I can say at the moment is that we are actually only listing the coin of the Komodo environment and -> that are traded on an atomic swap powered DEX.

On the other hand we have no information concerning the historical data of atomicDEX, which is necessary to display the volume of swap for example (it was not present at the time of the development of this application) Maybe those data are available via API's today?

[15-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Currently the project is using: Dexstats for coins info related to Komodo

Coingecko + Coinpaprika for coins that are active (fetching prices, ignoring for test-coins and innactive coins)

[15-Dec-19 11:09 AM] Slyris#2880
I see that on https://dexstats.info we can see the 24h volume for Swaps etc, but i don't know if the API is open-source to get those information.

[15-Dec-19 11:12 AM] Slyris#2880
So we currently have a program that fetch information about currencies in the komodo universe. But we have no information concerning the decentralized exchange.

Once those historical data will be available from some endpoint, we can integrate it into the current application

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
I have scripts that can pull historical trade mm2 data from on chain @Slyris

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Slyris#2880
We have the possibility to host it into an open endpoint ?

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
working on incorporating a db into them, they take a long while to run

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Slyris#2880
What we need will be something like an official api for mm2 historical data

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
I'll run an oracle on LABS chain with LABS/KMD data at first

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Slyris#2880
So everyone can use it

[15-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
then slowly add more as I optimize

[15-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
any pair requests?

[15-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Slyris#2880
RICK/MORTY CHIPS/KMD seem's popular, but ideally we want any pair that can be traded on atomicDEX

[15-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
👌

[15-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
will open source code once I have something stable

[15-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
(I'm using Dexstats API, would be great to integrate those stuff into dexstats)

[15-Dec-19 11:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright scripts in py ?

[15-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
yes, want what I have so far?

[15-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
I know @smk762 and @TonyL Have some scripts too.

[15-Dec-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
is terribly slow, needs a db behind it so it can do it in real time

[15-Dec-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
grabbing all historical data for a KMD pair takes 40 minutes

[15-Dec-19 11:26 AM] Slyris#2880
But i think let me know if i'm wrong, but the goal is to be able to query through an rpc call those data directly from mm2 no ?

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Slyris#2880
i think @jl777c tell me that was possible on mm1/barterDex

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
you can get real time data from mm2 seed nodes, but I don't think you can get historical

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] gcharang#6833
> yes, want what I have so far?
yes, please

> is terribly slow, needs a db behind it so it can do it in real time
sqlite should be enough correct?

are you using nSPV ?

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
and that limits who can run it, we can't add a tonne of seed nodes

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Slyris#2880
How it's was working on mm1 just by curiosity ?

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Slyris#2880

[15-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
no SPV, using bitcore commands on local node

[15-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419

[15-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
mm2 only seed nodes can see this

[15-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok ok !

"netid"

[15-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
yes^

[15-Dec-19 11:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Anyway, this is not the kind of data that I need to request all the time, but only a few times a day.

[15-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
my plan is to have two oracles on LABS at first. One that will show any part of the swap as it happens(shortly after really) and one that will show only completed trades

[15-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Slyris#2880
After that it is sure that if we want real time with the history of swaps on the last minutes, it will be more complicated

[15-Dec-19 11:30 AM] gcharang#6833
> explorer can work if I'm whitelisted in rate limiter
maybe switch to use electrum servers?

[15-Dec-19 11:32 AM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
basic logic is... 

on alice chain, get DEX fee txids
iterate through these(or just do them shortly after they happen once db is incorporated)
find alice->b_addr (alice chain)
from there find b_addr->bob (alice chain)
look at b_addr->bob tx, from here we know the script that b_addr->alice must be on bob chain
search for corresponding tx on bob chain in Alice address

Pinned a message.

[15-Dec-19 11:50 AM] cipi#4502
i would like to see mm2 providing this data, directly, in real time
data should include: last_price, 24h volume and live orderbook (this is what most sites like cmc and coinpaprika will request)
the seed nodes are already storing the data, but it would be best to have a special type of nodes, statnodes, where this data is sent (anonymized, without involved addresses) instead of the seed nodes (the seed nodes should only be used for orderbook propagation)

[15-Dec-19 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
no point in anonymizing, the data is on chain anyway

[15-Dec-19 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
would be better to tell people "hey, look at all this data. It's open for everyone to see. Keep that in mind"

[15-Dec-19 11:53 AM] cipi#4502
you are right, Alright 🙂 ... data is on chain, so no need for anonymizing

[15-Dec-19 11:53 AM] Slyris#2880
i would love a simple rpc call to access this data i agree with @cipi

[15-Dec-19 11:54 AM] Slyris#2880
I think it's a lot of work, so for the moment, we can use custom solution

[15-Dec-19 11:54 AM] Slyris#2880
also data to construct charts would be interesting too

[15-Dec-19 11:55 AM] cipi#4502
problem with analyzing the data from the seed nodes atm is that it only contains historical data, no orderbook
would be nice, if this data could be retrieved from a single node

[15-Dec-19 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
if we wanted better privacy, HD wallets would throw a wrench in all of this

[15-Dec-19 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
more obfuscation than privacy though

[15-Dec-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
the idea that a private netid gives you privacy is flawed. If it uses same DEX fee address, it's easily tracked

[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
Aha dex fee could be paid to a 1of2 address with DEX address and random garbage address

[15-Dec-19 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
would still need a way for jl(or whoever is managing DEX address) to track them though

[15-Dec-19 12:02 PM] cipi#4502
i don't think it is worth thinking too much about additionally anonymizing the swaps... will be enough work to get the stats working 😉

[15-Dec-19 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
more of a shower thought than a suggestion 😛

[15-Dec-19 02:29 PM] Audo#5667
@Alright , are we able to show how much trading happens on any specific wallet/GUI? Maybe there's no need for that though since the liquidity pool is shared. It would help to rank the DEXes at the very least, in terms of usage.

[15-Dec-19 02:34 PM] gcharang#6833
there is a gui fee address correct?
may be it can be tracked for that data?

[15-Dec-19 02:38 PM] Audo#5667
right, I think so

[15-Dec-19 02:48 PM] Alright#0419
must be tracked from seed node if it's done at all

[15-Dec-19 02:48 PM] Alright#0419
not possible to determine based on the way I'm doing it

[15-Dec-19 02:49 PM] Alright#0419
Oh same concept of 1of2 could be used for DEX address to indicate which GUI it was made from could be used

[15-Dec-19 02:50 PM] Alright#0419
would need to be 2of3 in that case, 1 key provided by GUI dev, 2 owned by whoever is managing DEX address

[15-Dec-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
@ca333 have a nice idea for you there^

[15-Dec-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how GUI is tracked now, but if we want historical data to be available could do the above

if anyone happens to have a list of known completed RICK/MORTY swaps, please give it to me. Can sanity check this script

[15-Dec-19 06:59 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright I'll have a look at your <https://github.com/Alrighttt/atomicdex_volume/> but do you check volume using dexfee address or checking if swaps occured ? How to know if it is an atomic swap of atomicdex or a swap of another tool (outside KMD stuff) ?

[15-Dec-19 07:00 PM] phm87#7395
Second question: Can I use and port your code to another language for one of my secret project (opensource) ?

[15-Dec-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
It will only find mm2 protocol swaps that use standard DEX address. It will not find any others.

[15-Dec-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
And yes, use it freely, was just meant to demonstrate the logic that can be used

[15-Dec-19 07:44 PM] cipi#4502
there is a field "gui" in the swap data of every swap: eg `"gui" : "nogui"` ... so that info can be used to determine which GUI was used for the swap... what i don't know is to which side the info applies: taker or maker...

[15-Dec-19 07:46 PM] cipi#4502
could be that it is different on taker and maker... i was maker... and the swap data contains
```"type" : "Maker"
"gui" : "nogui"```
i guess the taker has
```"type" : "Taker"
"gui" : "whatever"```
in the swap with the same uuid

[15-Dec-19 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
is the swap data something we can find after the fact?

[15-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
the issue I see is that not everyone can run a seed node(everyone *can*, but they need users to specify them as a seed node) meaning only a handful of people can get this data

[15-Dec-19 08:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Is what I get from seed DB parsing
```
RICK/MORTY 4582
MORTY/RICK 5645
```

[15-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
I guess for GUI tracking that is not as important, but I made those scripts to enable everyone to be able to get volume data

[15-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
is that completed swaps only @TonyL ?

[15-Dec-19 08:00 PM] TonyL#3577
