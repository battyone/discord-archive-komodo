I think many otc desks would prefer a komodo-backed stablecoin as a reserve for customers rather than just komodo itself.

[15-Dec-19 12:10 AM] allbits#5898
@artik123 your recent long post upthread is quite hard to decipher. Maybe you can rephrase so I, and maybe others, can understand what you're proposing

[15-Dec-19 12:11 AM] artik123#2884
Which one?

[15-Dec-19 12:12 AM] artik123#2884
I'm not an English native speaker but i do my best

[15-Dec-19 12:13 AM] allbits#5898
The crypto.com one - all I see there is the ability to deposit my crypto, lord knows where, and to pay big interest rates for 50% ltv

[15-Dec-19 12:13 AM] artik123#2884
@polycryptoblog What kind of infrastructure cost a smart chain has? It is secured by the notaries and they are well compensated for that by their lower difficulty mining algo.

NSPV servers, explorers, mining pools,  notarization costs , operator cost.   Notaries mine about 2k kmd a month - server cost is only a couple hundred dollars take home

[15-Dec-19 12:18 AM] artik123#2884
@allbits it's true... lord know where... but people do follow them. I'm not saying that kmd should do what they do. But in order to compete it has to do *something*

Was looking at the one below it.

[15-Dec-19 12:19 AM] allbits#5898
That's quite a different scheme than the algorithmic stable coin that is being created here. Not relevant in my opinion.

[15-Dec-19 12:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m not against the loan idea,  like I said there are parties working on that but this is like a precursor to that .

[15-Dec-19 12:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Interest bearing loans aren’t accessible to 1/7 the world as well which is another reason to stay interest free.

[15-Dec-19 12:23 AM] artik123#2884
@polycryptoblog If they want they can pay intergration cost and thats all. Notaries get what they get just because current market value and it's not going to stay this way for long. At times it was over $12k for a notary

[15-Dec-19 12:26 AM] artik123#2884
It doesn't matter if 1/7 accessible or not. When they will be, they won't necessarily come to you. They will have better options

[15-Dec-19 12:30 AM] artik123#2884
@allbits Of course it is. By the contrary, the internal technology has no relevance to the user. The simple thing is that they are getting interest on a loan. Here nothing. So imo we can *at least* give them something by utilizing the rewards

[15-Dec-19 12:31 AM] allbits#5898
I think you're mixed up, honestly.

[15-Dec-19 12:31 AM] artik123#2884
I think the same about you

[15-Dec-19 12:32 AM] allbits#5898
But I haven't claimed anything

[15-Dec-19 12:32 AM] allbits#5898
In the crypto.com example one gives up all their crypto in return for earning interest

[15-Dec-19 12:33 AM] allbits#5898
That act of giving up all ones crypto is not suggested in the system proposed here

[15-Dec-19 12:33 AM] allbits#5898
That's why I think you've introduced an irrelevant example and comparison

[15-Dec-19 12:34 AM] artik123#2884
They can get it back at any time

[15-Dec-19 12:34 AM] artik123#2884
What's the difference?

[15-Dec-19 12:34 AM] artik123#2884
Here get can get it at the end

[15-Dec-19 12:34 AM] allbits#5898
If you don't see that, you need to start at the beginning

[15-Dec-19 12:34 AM] artik123#2884
Amazing

[15-Dec-19 12:35 AM] artik123#2884
It's like two parallel line that don't converge

[15-Dec-19 12:35 AM] allbits#5898
Two quite different things, obviously

[15-Dec-19 12:35 AM] artik123#2884
It is just because you're not taking the user perspective in mind

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] allbits#5898
I am actually. You're not seeing the obvious

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] artik123#2884
Again amazing

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] allbits#5898
1. I give up all my crypto in return for interest

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] artik123#2884
No

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] artik123#2884
You get them back at the end

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] artik123#2884
When ever you want

[15-Dec-19 12:36 AM] allbits#5898
2. I give up all my crypto in return for another coin (up to 89%)

[15-Dec-19 12:37 AM] allbits#5898
They are two different things. Anyone can see that

[15-Dec-19 12:38 AM] artik123#2884
Of course. But can you agree with me that at crypto.com you give something and get back more than you give on the first place?

[15-Dec-19 12:39 AM] artik123#2884
Do you agree or not?

[15-Dec-19 12:39 AM] allbits#5898
I agree that if you do one thing that's different from another you can expect different results

[15-Dec-19 12:39 AM] artik123#2884
Actually you're right

[15-Dec-19 12:40 AM] artik123#2884
Actually you're not :)

[15-Dec-19 12:41 AM] artik123#2884
See at the image capture that polycryptoblog shared

[15-Dec-19 12:41 AM] artik123#2884
Recieve pax or tusd for your collateral and get interest

[15-Dec-19 12:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You pay interest on the loan

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] artik123#2884
You pay or get?

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pay

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] allbits#5898
I saw that. It is a different and hardly relevant system. You are comparing two different things

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] artik123#2884
8% apr what does it means?

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Get would be APY

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Annual percentage rate va annual percentage yield

[15-Dec-19 12:43 AM] artik123#2884
@allbits yes. Poly shared image is.more relevant

[15-Dec-19 12:44 AM] artik123#2884
If so. Then I was wrong

[15-Dec-19 12:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate
Annual percentage rate
The term annual percentage rate of charge (APR), corresponding sometimes to a nominal APR and sometimes to an effective APR (EAPR), is the interest rate for a whole year (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, credit card, etc. ...

[15-Dec-19 12:45 AM] allbits#5898
How strange you can't understand how it's different. In KUSD I lock my crypto and receive KUSD which I am free to use at my will. 

In the other system I "lock" my crypto and get no crypto in return. Just s promise to receive interest.

[15-Dec-19 12:45 AM] allbits#5898
Two different things

[15-Dec-19 12:46 AM] artik123#2884
The other example of poly was the more relevant one

[15-Dec-19 12:47 AM] artik123#2884
Are you going to eat my head?

[15-Dec-19 12:47 AM] allbits#5898
In the poly example I pay interest, I don't earn it

[15-Dec-19 12:48 AM] artik123#2884
Then it's fine with me

[15-Dec-19 12:48 AM] allbits#5898
At higher rates than the what is proposed in KUSD

[15-Dec-19 12:48 AM] artik123#2884
I just want to make sure that kmd offers the best deal

[15-Dec-19 12:49 AM] artik123#2884
Don't take it personal. Usually i'm right. This time i was wrong

[15-Dec-19 12:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No head eating, just want to point out differences in system ,  pegs is a foundational cc, loans and such will be further along the pipeline mainly done by 3rd parties I believe, but will be used in more advanced defi systems

[15-Dec-19 12:51 AM] artik123#2884
Ok

[15-Dec-19 12:55 AM] allbits#5898
You were aggressively wrong

[15-Dec-19 12:56 AM] allbits#5898
About a very simple matter. I would have little confidence in your ability to analyze other things, honestly

Comparison chart of lending platforms I picked up from Celsius at WCC

[15-Dec-19 12:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Trying to work something with them to get kmd on there

[15-Dec-19 12:59 AM] artik123#2884
@allbits so you did take it personal... hehe it's 3 AM here. What time is it at your place now?

[15-Dec-19 01:01 AM] artik123#2884
I know to admit when I'm wrong. Trust me, it's more important than anything else

[15-Dec-19 05:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@artik123 i have not read all of it, but what is the risk of default? If you have to trust someone to give you the principle back, would even 10% be enough for you to do that?

[15-Dec-19 06:08 AM] artik123#2884
I'm not saying that it's good to trust someone with the loan. All I'm saying, if technically feasible, he should get at least some of the rewards.
All else being equal, he may lose on both ends since usdk is depreciating at 2% yearly rate and kmd 5% rewards are already integrated in current market price

[15-Dec-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you feel that KMD will decrease 7% in the next year, it even makes sense to lock it and withdraw stablecoin

[15-Dec-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody is getting paid interest and nobody has to pay interest

[15-Dec-19 06:41 AM] artik123#2884
"All else being equal"

[15-Dec-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you are able to sell partial equity (without technically selling it) and get freely tradeable stablecoins

[15-Dec-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and are able to close the account, all with just txfees to pay

[15-Dec-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if you imagine using BTC as collateral, there is no 5% rewards to be debating about

[15-Dec-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and anybody that is paying you interest for you to deposit BTC, is lending it to someone else at a higher rate

[15-Dec-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD system is NOT a deposit and get interest so someone can loan it out to get paid a higher rate of interest

[15-Dec-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not that at all

[15-Dec-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a system that allows people to have KMD and at anytime, borrow against it using the blockchain without paying any interest. in KMD case the monthly rewards are lost, but that wont really matter to someone who is outside the KMD now as they are not used to it. very few coins pay rewards

[15-Dec-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
by the time someone is complaining that they dont get the 5% rewards by using this system, they at least understand a lot more about KMD than they did before

[15-Dec-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD is kept in a federated multisig that requires long term commitment and availability, it is not exactly the notary nodes, but rather composed of 13 msig operators, most of which used to be notaries. but all are long term community members

[15-Dec-19 06:46 AM] artik123#2884
So it was a political decision?

[15-Dec-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically if this became a deposit and get paid interest system which then charges someone else to borrow. then it would be charging the same person as the same person is depositing and issuing

[15-Dec-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
there was no campaigning involved to be one of the 13

[15-Dec-19 08:17 AM] mobipoi#5774
I still say a full video explaining this can help or a simple Q&A it a bit confusing to understand

[15-Dec-19 08:18 AM] mobipoi#5774
For general people

[15-Dec-19 08:18 AM] mobipoi#5774
In regards to the stable coin

[15-Dec-19 08:19 AM] Privatoshi#9487
What don't you understand about the stable coin?

[15-Dec-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is someone that can make a video from the existing info?

[15-Dec-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the main idea is that it decentralizes the money supply creation, so each person can choose to create new stablecoins. based on overall demand, which is expected to go up as the price goes up, more stablecoins are issued. once issued they exist independently. of course the issuing accounts are owing the amount of stablecoins issued, so in addition to stablecoin usage, the stablecoin also enables one to gain the arbitrage from liquidation.

[15-Dec-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if to add that to the percentage gained by having stablecoins, it could become much more than double digit percentage as the target is 5% arbitrage gain. and there is not need to wait a year for it, just need to find an over leveraged account that can be liquidated

[15-Dec-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this income production method i dont believe is availble for the other stablecoins. so the issuers do get something more than just the stablecoins in exchange for locking their KMD

[15-Dec-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
deposit KMD, then issue stablecoins up to max of 80%.
these coins can then be used for anything and are not restricted in any way, and anybody can issue them
the special function of the stablecoins in addition to being pegged to EUR is that they are needed to liquidate delinquent accounts. this is a 5% per instance revenue source.
