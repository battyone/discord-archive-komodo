Odoo is an Open Source ERP system with more than 4 million users globally and very suitable for all SMEs while it is easily scalable to large organisations.  Odoo needs to be customized in Turkey especially in accordance with financial regulations. 

We can develop trust based features in Marmara Version 2 by merging Odoo ERP with Marmara Credit Loops. When considering the users of post-dated Cheques as being mostly SME businessmen, Marmara has a good chance of penetrating into ERP market in Turkey by having a good addon/module integrating trust based features of Marmara with ERP systems. Therefore, we established ‚ÄúOdoo Turkey‚Äù Discord group. We invite you there, I think it will have huge effect if Komodo is involved/integrated in ERP business. Btw, before entering into Odoo, we had a thorough research for selection of best Open Source ERP system at a large institution to start with and Odoo was the best among many alternatives. 

We invite Odoo and/or Komodo Developers who can help in integration of Marmara Chain with Odoo.
