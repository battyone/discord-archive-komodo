any way to completely disable sounds for the android app? I see the options to not play at full volume but still get annoying change sounds coming through. Also, it looks like each time I load atomicdex on phone i have to go in to settings and un-choose 'play at full volume'.

[26-Dec-19 02:24 AM] PTYX#6840
@CiPhEr i was just literally thinking there should be an option to remove the sounds

question- as a maker, do i need to have app open and screen on in order for others to participate in my orders that i've already setup in atomicdex?

[26-Dec-19 02:35 AM] gcharang#6833
> as a maker, do i need to have app open and screen on in order for others to participate in my orders that i've already setup in atomicdex?
there is no need for the screen to be on (this is what the sounds fix was for)
but the app must be open in the background

[26-Dec-19 02:47 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i see. I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off, i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time. Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook?

And on that subject, if i have the same atomic dex seed running simultaneously on two phones will that cause issues?

[26-Dec-19 03:07 AM] gcharang#6833
> if i have the same atomic dex seed running simultaneously on two phones will that cause issues?
yes, there may be issues
the case of same seed running on two devices is undefined. that is , it wasn't considered when atomicDEX was  developed
it is not recommended to do so

> I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off
this will cause the maker to go offline, that is no swaps

>  i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time
good idea

> Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook
nothing else is needed. have sufficient balances and place orders. thats it

[26-Dec-19 04:01 AM] CiPhEr#2091
thanks for your help gcharang! I'm also assuming I could import the seed from the atomic dex into agama wallet and monitor activity, transfer funds, etc through agama right?

[26-Dec-19 04:04 AM] gcharang#6833
np!
>  I could import the seed from the atomic dex into agama wallet and monitor activity, transfer funds, etc through agama right?
yes. but transferring funds out while there is an active order may cause swaps to fail

[26-Dec-19 05:47 AM] CiPhEr#2091
on the oracle orderbook site for atomicdex, are the volumes listed for 24 hours or all time or ??

[26-Dec-19 05:49 AM] bamby#5307
i have already update new vesion
but it doesnt have COMMOD coin

[26-Dec-19 05:49 AM] CiPhEr#2091
what is commod coin?

[26-Dec-19 05:50 AM] bamby#5307
yes, COMMOD

[26-Dec-19 05:53 AM] bamby#5307
it was displayed on mobile atomicdex

[26-Dec-19 06:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@CiPhEr those aren't past volumes
those are quantities and prices of coins that were available for swap 15 minutes ago
you can see current orderbook in the app if you have some balance for a coin

[26-Dec-19 06:07 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ooooh i see now that makes sense, thanks!

[26-Dec-19 06:50 AM] tolken#2655
@artemciy_dice I am using this one as it appears to be a more thorough walkthrough, suggesting a pathway to get Rustup installed, but seems to error in ways the walkthrough doesn't address. https://docs.komodoplatform.com/mmV2/LP/walkthrough.html This is the walkthrough pinned in the dev-marketmaker channel. (This message is in reference to your question Last Sunday at 1:42 AM)

[26-Dec-19 06:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@tolken what is the error you are seeing?

[26-Dec-19 07:14 AM] tolken#2655
@gcharang It's something @phm87 reported back on 11/20/2019. When doing the 'dustup install nightly-2019-10-06 (they posted a fairly thorough report /errors) it outputs "... error: some components unavailable for download for channel nightly-2019-10-06 'chippy', 'rustfmt'"

[26-Dec-19 07:15 AM] tolken#2655
it then suggests installing latest successful build by doing a dustup toolchain install (build) but I'm new to this, so probably doing something wrong. I tried doing the dustup toolchain install (build) specifying several versions but couldn't find a way to get around that error above.

[26-Dec-19 07:17 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Try nightly-2019-10-24

[26-Dec-19 08:32 AM] iota dude#4261

[26-Dec-19 08:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@iota dude go to settings -> scroll down 
what is the version number you see?

[26-Dec-19 08:37 AM] iota dude#4261
0.2.11

[26-Dec-19 08:37 AM] iota dude#4261
33e end of hash

[26-Dec-19 08:37 AM] gcharang#6833
can you send me the log through dm?

[26-Dec-19 08:41 AM] tolken#2655
@artemciy_dice got past that error this time! Awesome.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #132 The password requirements are bad
The android app asks for a password that is at least 12 characters long, contains an upper case and lower case letter, and a special character. These are the ultra-common password requirements (plus a longer length requirement) and they are pretty [bad advice](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/password-advice-wrong,news-25617.html) for a strong password. Easy to forget, easy to guess, all around bad. 

Please remove all the requirements except for the length requirement. See also: https://xkcd.c...

If my phone loses the Wlan connection and reconnects after a few minutes, is my order in AtomicDex online again ?

[26-Dec-19 11:36 AM] ca333#0118

yes

@ronyi @_PureHate_ @Markus @JaNuS 
VRSC works in AtomicDEX now, if you are still looking for it
might need to restart/reinstall the app

KMD

[26-Dec-19 12:37 PM] JaNuS#7325
@gcharang thx, i noticed it working again already. well done devs!!

[26-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Acura#2748
Many users report swap problems between the KMD pair and Dex. I myself can confirm this - errors occur with many different order prices. I can also provide the ID's.

[26-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Acura#2748
I also had 2 trades that went through DEX, but they are shown as faulty in the app including the UNLOCK FUNDS button.

[26-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Acura#2748
