[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But HUSH isn't.

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I hope everyone had a good day of work!!!

[26-Dec-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe you got to spend time with the family, or a significant other.

[26-Dec-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> With 5 days left in 2019, it would be beneficial to look back on 2019, for HUSH.

[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Is it possible to build and run Hush on a raspberri Pi 4 with 2 GB of ram ?

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @phm87 This is what Duke uses for DragonHead.

[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Thx

[26-Dec-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I hope that 2 gb is enough to run it

[26-Dec-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I would think that Raspberry Pi 4 would work

[26-Dec-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm unsure

[26-Dec-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I just know what we are using for DragonHead

[26-Dec-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I have a Raspberry pi 2 on a shelf, I would like to install Hush on it.  With all the code that has been removed, it may be lighter and may now be compatible...

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Good morning

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 compiling any zec coin with only 2GB of ram is a bit rough, but if you make a 4GB swap file, it will probably work. 4GB of RAM is always recommended to *compile* zec coins, but you can easily install a package and run with 2GB of ram, /cc @gilardh

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the pine64 and rasppi 4 are similar, but not quite the same. DragonHead uses pine64
