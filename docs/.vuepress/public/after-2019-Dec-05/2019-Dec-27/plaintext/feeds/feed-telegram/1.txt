[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> How will komodo's dex gain adoption

[26-Dec-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> All dexs seem to account for less than .01% or crypto sales ðŸ˜‚

[26-Dec-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Probably otc is way bigger.

[26-Dec-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <joshuamayu44> All dex's pretty much suck. I'm hoping Kmd's is something easy to use

[26-Dec-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andi> Tbh i dont care on the dex..for me antara is the important product...

[telegram] <Regnar> Yea imo they definitely target two separate groups. The DEX targets the trader and the regular crypto wallet user who wants to simply swap some coins. 
Antara targets those looking to build things with blockchains, generally the lower level/infrastructure base on which other things will be built. However there are also other Antara modules that are targeted directly to 2nd layer providers and services too (re @Andi: Tbh i dont care on the dex..for me antara is the important product...)

[26-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So I can see the merit for both

[26-Dec-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andi> True, is there a demand for antara so far ? (re @Regnar: So I can see the merit for both)

[26-Dec-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There is demand for different parts of it, some much more than others. Oracles are a big one. I personally like tokens and think pegs will be a big one too. I'm not sure about new, dedicated chains. But I know there are some chains that are adding newer CCs often, pretty sure HUSH has been adding a bunch (re @Andi: True, is there a demand for antara so far ?)

[26-Dec-19 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I've also seen in discord some people posting about creating their own smart chains with the composer
