"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","26-Dec-19 05:48 PM","[telegram] <Regnar> Yea imo they definitely target two separate groups. The DEX targets the trader and the regular crypto wallet user who wants to simply swap some coins. 
Antara targets those looking to build things with blockchains, generally the lower level/infrastructure base on which other things will be built. However there are also other Antara modules that are targeted directly to 2nd layer providers and services too (re @Andi: Tbh i dont care on the dex..for me antara is the important product...)","",""
