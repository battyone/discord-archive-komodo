We will be hearing from Coin Center, Chainalysis, and Ciphertrace on the functionality of, and challenges presented by, privacy coins.
<https://vimeo.com/379765960/a813511f6a>

If anyone is interested in listening in ^
Basically skip the first 19 minutes. An interesting part about WannaCry and the coin shuffling afterwards at `19:15`
`21:50` shows shapeshift public API showing a random BTC > XMR transaction including IDs, IP addresses, but then loses it with the XMR explorer. No mention of ringCT pool size issues.
`24:27` brings up discussion on Dash and Zcash ""Optional Privacy""
`""...who is using TAILS from USB, he will not try to install lightweight operating system, and then DASH core(to send private transactions), after which he will have to download 12GBs of blockchain""` Honestly seems like a good argument for GhostShipOS","",""

This is a regulation that will enforce virtual assets service providers, so exchanges, hosted wallets, custody providers etc. to not only have KYC info, but to also exchange that when transactions are made between those organizations""`
