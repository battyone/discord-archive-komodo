If a cosmos ecosystem product could atomically swap btc for eth, or even cosmos natively, it would be heralded as the second coming. Kmd's only real problem is that it's not holding hundreds of millions of ico funds and/or bagholders to throw at crypto carnival barkers. I hope maybe once the dex is out of beta some dev bandwidth can be more effectively pointed at cc origination, things will probably get a little easier to put together. defi is a giant buzzword now but if the price of eth is any indicator, concentional investor interest and corporate devs are likely mostly being thrown at permissioned and ip secured blockchains right now.","",""

UTXO based contracts - yes harder than a VM at this stage.  Accounts, yes, has not been focus by devs.  100s millions in marketing budget, no.

So, to use your ship analogy because I am a passionate sailor ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚õµÔ∏è, the wind is blowing a bear market, and the goal is around the corner of the point in the distance, the current is against us, but it will change with the tide.  Current course is out to sea where few people can see us, but we have radio contact and good relationships with key people.  When we are headed on final tack with solutions to some key integration points (atomic swaps, btc security in dPoW, nspv light clients with existing CC support, FSM & better community mgmt) headed to the goal - we will have a welcoming party behind the point at our goal.

Timing.  Ppl are hard at work, stuff is still in alpha/beta.","",""

The other side of your argument is that if komodo succeeds your ROI will be much better.
