[14-Dec-19 11:07 AM] PHBA2061#2530
1st hint :
||9 segments, if we randomly chose 3 segments among these 9, then there will C(9,3) = 84 possible combinations||

[14-Dec-19 11:08 AM] PHBA2061#2530
2nd hint :
||the 1 cm segment cannot form triangle with any other 2 segments, so it's C(8,2) = 28 combinations less||
