[14-Dec-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio epic work, nicely done!

[14-Dec-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio fyi, dev=>master, duke=>dev merges have been done, it's stable now. i need to do more testing before danger=>duke but that will hopefully happen soon

[14-Dec-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i will do extensive testing on the duke branch before merging to dev and asking for wider testing

[14-Dec-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am hoping that the hardfork code is 99% done and we may find a few little things to tweak. I don't want to change it anymore, because i want to start a long testing phase. and if we change it, we have to start testing all over again. i need a way to simulate the hardfork happening and seeing what the code does....

[14-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio i just realized, unix man pages probably didn't get updated for v3.2.3

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you have to run `./contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.sh` after hush is recompiled with new version number

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> oh...yes your right

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> will do it again

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not critical, lol

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but this is the full process

[14-Dec-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this only affects the .deb

[14-Dec-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so none of the other binaries need to be touched, but to do things "right", we want the correct version number in our unix man page, or that could be pretty confusing to people

[14-Dec-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "my binary says version X, the man page says version Y, y do you hate users????" ðŸ˜‰

[14-Dec-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ðŸ™‚

[14-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need a document about doing a release

[14-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i will try to do that

[14-Dec-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio oh, as well

[14-Dec-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there was a bug in that script, which made it fail when trying to autodetect the version

[14-Dec-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and i got so annoyed with it that i just hard-coded the version

[14-Dec-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> super annoying

[14-Dec-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but if you are going crazy trying to figure out why the numbers are weird, that is why ðŸ™‚

[14-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we should probably go back to autodetect

[14-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because we are likely to cause merge conflicts in that file, changing that version number in diff branches

[14-Dec-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio additionally, if you see `-dirty` in the manpage, that is because there are uncommitted changes in git

[14-Dec-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> best to not have that in the man page, if we can avoid it, but again, not critical

[14-Dec-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think i added -dirty last time, because i just had too much going on and didn't care

[14-Dec-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hilariously, this is #general

[14-Dec-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anyway, back to your normal #general programming, you can find this lovely stuff in #developers if you like it

[14-Dec-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip 11 random users 55 hush

[14-Dec-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Dec-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nice work Denio

[14-Dec-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'd like to let the community know, about 
some excellent work, that a newer CM @FtrSaroth has been doing in his first few weeks in our community... I say a few weeks but it's more like 10 days lol...

He translated the HUSHv3 & HushList WhitePapers, both to Spanish. Amazing!!

[14-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is amazing!

[14-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we probably need a dedicated page on our website for whitepapers and which languages they are available in

[14-Dec-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are also very interested to translate myhush.org into Chinese (ZH), Russian (RU) and various other languages

[14-Dec-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi we should put whitepaper translations somewhere on our github

[14-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and somebody really should tell Duke to update those whitepapers

[14-Dec-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hahaha

[14-Dec-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Duke will get around to them, when time permits.

[14-Dec-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He is doing more time sensitive things, atm.

[14-Dec-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i kind of need to update the wp's before lots of translations are done

[14-Dec-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's more important for the hushlist paper, that needs a large update

[14-Dec-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for the hush v3 paper, that is still 95% up-to-date

[14-Dec-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so translations of hush v3 are OK, but I really need to update Hushlist paper to be Sapling-ified

[14-Dec-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He wanted to learn about Hush

[14-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think he really understands Hush now.
