Hi, I submitted a claim because of the Agama wallet "hack" and I am just looking for a way to find out if it is being processed or if not who I can talk to about that.  The Komodo website had nothing to go on, so I am here looking for support.  Thanks

What rev should I use?
Will I need to re-sync?
