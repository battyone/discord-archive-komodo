@artik, it is actually ok if a state machine never terminates. each transaction will only update one state transition

[14-Dec-19 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so the fact that you need a separate transaction and that it is linearly dependent, automatically limits the resources needed for each FSM transaction

1. Why the choice of 20% safety net? 
2. Why not variable as in makr? 
3. Does the pegged stable coin borrowed get destroyed when the debt is repaid? 
4. Why should people choose to borrow against  kmd and get no interest when with DAI they can get 4% yearly
5. Is it going to borrow only against KMD?

[14-Dec-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
1. it uses a 24 hr price average
2. what is the point to make it variable. when the market moves it will move before you can adjust it. and isnt the makr changing the interest rate and not the safety margin?
3. yes
4. if somebody has KMD and not DAI, what does it matter what DAI does? also i think you have it backwards. people are not loaning their KMD to others. you are using KMD as collateral to create stablecoins. nobody is charging anybody any interest
5. the reference chain we will make will use KMD

[14-Dec-19 08:13 PM] criptobear#6402
1. You mean it varies automatically based on the price?
2. I talk about makr because I am using it although im not a great expert but I like the fact that when you collateralize ETH you can choose how strong is you safety net is so you can have a deeper margin or if you like risk a shallower one.
Thx

have you read the docs on how it works?

[14-Dec-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you control exactly how strong the safety net is, by the amount you borrow

[14-Dec-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
how is this any different?

[14-Dec-19 09:09 PM] artik123#2884
I wasn't aware of the full discussion about it, but what is the reason that the user doesn't get the yearly 5% reward on his collateral? Is it a technical reason?

Operators and servers aren’t free

Hi, I made a few exchanges on the AtomicDEX and have quite a bit of BTC leftover. I keep trying to withdraw BTC from the app and it keeps saying "Error, please try again later". Is there a fix for this? I keep trying and nothing is working. Thanks.

@zensherps  you have to send to a legacy address ( begins with 1 ), segwit addresses aren’t supported yet

@polycryptoblog Thank you so much for the detail there. I wouldve been searching online forever to figure that out. Blessings.

@polycryptoblog the remark on operators and servers was a response to my question?

[14-Dec-19 11:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes.

[14-Dec-19 11:19 PM] artik123#2884
What operators and servers? It suppose to be trustless and peer to peer...

In the real world I can take a loan maybe at a half percent interest. So it's also practically zero.

Have a look at crypto.com. 
They are giving interest bearing loans on collaterals and their app has 500k+ downloads. Others too, will draw loops in the sky and offer all kind of crazy stuff for having the collaterals.

They will play with other people's money just like banks do and people will surely follow them as long as they stay alive or go bust.

I'm not saying that kmd loans have to become bitconnect, but If it wishes to compete or have *any relevance* in this game outside this community, then is has to give *something*. Any reward between 2%-5% is ok. Otherwise it will mostly be just a hedging tool for people that are already within this community.

That being said, I don't think that giving a reward, if technically feasible, is a big stretch. Especially if it does not harm the integrity of the system.

[14-Dec-19 11:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
First, every chain has infrastructure costs. Second, it’s not a loan,  it’s an interest-free line of credit. Third, crypto.com gives a third-party stablecoin for its loans.

Whoever closes a liquidated account gets a discount, i.e. reward, for doing so.

[14-Dec-19 11:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pegs can be the foundation for a loan cc ( and there are parties investigating this ) but it’s not a loaning system .

[14-Dec-19 11:53 PM] artik123#2884
@polycryptoblog Call it whatever you wish... but no one outside this community will use it.

[14-Dec-19 11:54 PM] artik123#2884
@smk762 How is it related to what I wrote? 
I'm talking about the user not the liquidator. The liquidator gets a margin to the market price of kmd... it's a totally different thing. And not related at all to rewards.

[14-Dec-19 11:56 PM] smk762#7640
rewarding those that keep the system running > than rewarding those that could potentially be liquidated.

[14-Dec-19 11:57 PM] artik123#2884
When I speak about reward I'm talking about the yearly 5% interest. We are talking about different things
