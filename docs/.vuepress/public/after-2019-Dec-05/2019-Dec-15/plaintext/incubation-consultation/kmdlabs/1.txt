[14-Dec-19 04:24 AM] daemonfox#6136

[14-Dec-19 01:58 PM] CrisF#3405
How long did the sync take, @daemonfox ?

[14-Dec-19 03:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
it died at 1635295

[14-Dec-19 03:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
couldnt get it past that...

[14-Dec-19 03:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
in process of copying my other node that is in sync over to bootstrap it

[14-Dec-19 03:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
```  "blocks": 1635295,
  "longestchain": 1660848,
```

[14-Dec-19 03:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
after that it would never start the daemon sadly...

[14-Dec-19 03:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
```Error: Failed to connect best block```

[14-Dec-19 03:02 PM] daemonfox#6136

Let me know if it DOES NOT work

[14-Dec-19 07:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
my LABS NN and staking node seem fine, it's jl777/komodo dev (from some weeks ago) that's giving me that error

[14-Dec-19 07:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
if  you  change to good  komodod and it still doesnt sync or throws errors then it might  be corrupt  wallet.dat  file

[14-Dec-19 07:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
those instructions fixed me  after trying  multiple different  ways of syncing

[14-Dec-19 07:09 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
/staking

[14-Dec-19 08:31 PM] CMaurice#1685
doesn't seem to be a corrupt wallet

[14-Dec-19 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

`even when directed at me they are still funny as fuck damn it!!`
