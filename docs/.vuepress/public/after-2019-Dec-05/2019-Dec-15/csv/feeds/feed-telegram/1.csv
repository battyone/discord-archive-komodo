"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","14-Dec-19 11:03 AM","[telegram] <Mixic> This latest Verus CLI daemon and wallet now supports a new optional format for your identity. 
As part of the VerusID protocol, identity names on all blockchains besides Verus (and VRSCTEST) will include a ""."" followed by the blockchain symbol before the ""@"". 
For example, on the chain VRSCTEST, an ID would normally be referred to as ""bob@"".  With this update, you will have the option to refer to your identity and include the blockchain name or not. 
That means that on testnet with v0.6.0-2 or later, you may optionally refer to bob@ as bob.vrsctest@ as well.
New, non-madatory CLI wallet version for Linux, Mac, and Windows x64 platforms, with support for pools and optional VRSC suffix for IDs (same underlying name and protocol) is available here:
https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
Nheqminer (the only currently autoswitching CPU pool miner) for Linux, Mac, and Windows x64 platforms are available here:
 https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases
Pool operators should update to the latest CLI wallet and also upgrade their pool with the latest
 https://github.com/veruscoin/node-stratum-pool 
and
https://github.com/veruscoin/verushash-node
Congratulations to the entire Verus community for this major milestone and contribution to blockchain technology. There is no safer model for storing funds on decentralized blockchains today than VerusID. 
Soon we will all be able to use it!

So, I'm looking for such a solution, like wallet that have both fiat and crypto assets. I've found KABN, and actually they have already partnered with Visa card and are creating a multi-currency wallet, but their product is being tested now. That‚Äôs why I came to ask you if you know any other projects that have already created such a solution","",""
