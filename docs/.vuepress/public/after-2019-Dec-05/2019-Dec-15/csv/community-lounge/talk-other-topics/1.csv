"403585751171989507","LocoMB#8593","14-Dec-19 03:17 PM","Lisk Central America was one of the delegates to leave this week.
The following post was deleted from there subreddit.
Our faith in HQ to deliver a product has been diminishing for sometime but as of late we have lost all confidence in HQ.
With management making mistake after mistake with no sign of learning, it is time for us to step down as a delegate and organization.
We hope all community members the best of luck. It has been a wild ride but it is time to get off .
Maybe one day we will see a full product from Lisk but that is still years away.
The space is moving too fast and our opinion is Lisk will be left before it even has a chance to release a full SDK.
We are still bullish on crypto and blockchain in general but this project lacks the right leadership and experience to succeed in our opinion. Too many early missteps have taken place , that has now left the project in a bad place with the current layoffs.
Management never seemed to address serious concerns and opinions over the years from both employees and community members. This resulting in many talented employees and community members leaving Lisk behind.
It‚Äôs a Sad day as we had high hopes for Lisk and it‚Äôs sidechain technology but it‚Äôs apparent that this team can not deliverer. We hope that other talented projects continue and bring this technology to life.
I hope all those talented employees that were recently fired right before Christmas all are successful in their job searches.
Good luck to Lisk and the community!
