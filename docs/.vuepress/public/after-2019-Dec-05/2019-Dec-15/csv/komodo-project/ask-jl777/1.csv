2. Why not variable as in makr?

2. what is the point to make it variable. when the market moves it will move before you can adjust it. and isnt the makr changing the interest rate and not the safety margin?
3. yes
4. if somebody has KMD and not DAI, what does it matter what DAI does? also i think you have it backwards. people are not loaning their KMD to others. you are using KMD as collateral to create stablecoins. nobody is charging anybody any interest
5. the reference chain we will make will use KMD","",""

2. I talk about makr because I am using it although im not a great expert but I like the fact that when you collateralize ETH you can choose how strong is you safety net is so you can have a deeper margin or if you like risk a shallower one.

In the real world I can take a loan maybe at a half percent interest. So it's also practically zero.

Have a look at crypto.com. 
They are giving interest bearing loans on collaterals and their app has 500k+ downloads. Others too, will draw loops in the sky and offer all kind of crazy stuff for having the collaterals.

They will play with other people's money just like banks do and people will surely follow them as long as they stay alive or go bust.

I'm not saying that kmd loans have to become bitconnect, but If it wishes to compete or have *any relevance* in this game outside this community, then is has to give *something*. Any reward between 2%-5% is ok. Otherwise it will mostly be just a hedging tool for people that are already within this community.

That being said, I don't think that giving a reward, if technically feasible, is a big stretch. Especially if it does not harm the integrity of the system.","",""
