[22-Dec-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The cryptocoin devs with absolutely no passion, that wear suits and get along with everybody? Those people scare the fuck out of me

[22-Dec-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The people who plant backdoors, I am sure they are nice to everybody.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In other news, i have been working like a crazy person on our new Hush release, which will be a "mandatory update" just like KMD went thru

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have 172 commits and over 42,000 lines of changes coming, and growing

[22-Dec-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whenever this gets merged to master, we will probably shoot up in any type of github rankings

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is planning for the long-term every day, unlike many other projects. That is something many of my mentors have taught me over the years, and most recently, jl777 has shown me the wisdom of this in practice, applied to cryptocoins.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Finality welcome back

[22-Dec-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Finality QT Linguist is the GUI for doing translation stuff most people use. you can manually edit files directly like a crazy Duke, but I think Linguist is probably what you want

[22-Dec-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Dec-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Solistica> Seems like a spammer

[22-Dec-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
