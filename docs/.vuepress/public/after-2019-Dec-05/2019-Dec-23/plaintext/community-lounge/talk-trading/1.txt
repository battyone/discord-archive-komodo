Asians do tend to close positions before lunar new year

Any good USable exchange for kmd that's not bittrex?

[22-Dec-19 06:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Metalpay

[22-Dec-19 06:15 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Ok.

[22-Dec-19 06:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Altsbit also is good, formerly digital price

[22-Dec-19 06:40 PM] tolken#2655
Metal pay exchange is live? @polycryptoblog   thought you could only buy/sell, but not actually send cryoto

[22-Dec-19 06:43 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Altsbit will be my go-to I guess. Probably has super low volume at the moment.

[22-Dec-19 07:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@tolken  yea just checked they haven‚Äôt enabled normal crypto send and receive yet with Komodo ,  I know it‚Äôs in the pipeline I will message and find out.

[22-Dec-19 07:56 PM] tolken#2655
I bought a little KMD on there a while back, then found out couldn‚Äôt send. Glad it‚Äôs in the pipeline though.

[22-Dec-19 07:58 PM] tolken#2655
The fees are rather high at 5%, but if they have any future it could be very beneficial to use considering you can reduce fees to 0. Would certainly be my go to on/off ramp.

[22-Dec-19 07:59 PM] tolken#2655
@polycryptoblog thanks, would appreciate hearing anything you find out.
