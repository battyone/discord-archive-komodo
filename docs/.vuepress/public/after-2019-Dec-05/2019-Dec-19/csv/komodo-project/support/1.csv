I have downloaded Agama wallet on mine PC. I was able to create Veruscoin, DGB, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
When I try to add Tether Agama wallet says that there is already Ether wallet and nothing happens.

How can I get tether address if it won't create?

Also Agama wallet for Android is not installing and could also not be found on Google Play store.","",""
