I haven't had any notas either with no change to firewall settings.

[18-Dec-19 01:46 AM] bishop#9773
but, I am synced, so that's a positive

[18-Dec-19 02:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
aSame... nothing i am doing is getting me notas at all

[18-Dec-19 05:42 AM] smk762#7640
the lack of notas is likely due to not enough notaries on the same version or in sync.

also be aware that as there are currently no CFEK chains running, there are obviously no CFEK chains to notarise.

[18-Dec-19 06:07 AM] CrisF#3405

[18-Dec-19 11:20 AM] smk762#7640
I had to clear out ~/komodo before mine would start a few days ago. those error codes are new to me tho

[18-Dec-19 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, that didn't work either

[18-Dec-19 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the build script molested the komodo.conf

[18-Dec-19 11:34 AM] smk762#7640
I'm testing the steps from Joker's post now. 
clean slate + compartmentalisation to avoid conflicts with existing folders (e.g. KMD core) looks good.
molested how?

[18-Dec-19 11:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
remade it without rpcallow 🤦🏽‍♂️

[18-Dec-19 11:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
funny that, rpc calls fail when you don't allow them

err code 28 I assume is the "rewinding blocks" stage

[18-Dec-19 12:07 PM] smk762#7640
not sure about this bit tho `./starting.sh: line 317: labs.json: No such file or directory`

[18-Dec-19 12:07 PM] smk762#7640
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what do you need added to the conf file? I can PR the change

[18-Dec-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1` should be enough

[18-Dec-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`err code 28 I assume is the "rewinding blocks" stage`
as far as I can tell, yes

[18-Dec-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`labs.json: No such file or directory`
looks like it didn't pull the file from git

[18-Dec-19 12:57 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
LABS SPVs will be down until after the hard fork

[18-Dec-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
would recommend not using atomicdex (buying or selling) until day or so after hard fork

I think the labs.json bit is ignorable. seems like a check and compare against new/old, so prob something for the future.

[18-Dec-19 01:18 PM] smk762#7640
strangely, `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1` is already in my conf... cant see where it came from, or if it was already there. 🤷🏽

you're right, mine is emptier too. I was looking at LABS.conf earlier. komodo.conf is basically just whats from that script

when is it advised to shut down staking nodes so I won't end up on a nasty fork like last time?

[18-Dec-19 02:58 PM] Oszy#5734
or maybe i just started it too early after the HF

shouldnt happen, but keep an eye on sync and latest block hash after updating just in case

a few of us have updated NN from in the last few hours after seeing no ntx for a while.

you may need to remove ~/komodo due to disk space requirements
