I didn't bother with windows as it is a separate computer and I did a new computer with just ubantu/linux and am running the komodo and THC there. So I am only working with linux

[18-Dec-19 12:30 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
I downloaded the 0.5.0 git hub obsedian files and extracted them, but apparently don't know where to go from there

[18-Dec-19 12:31 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
am on the linux/ubantu computer where I have been running the THC cli wallet and daemon, pos64staker, etc

[18-Dec-19 12:37 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
I don't know what binary files are. It seems to me they were: sprout-proving.key sprout-verifying.key sapling-spend.params sapling-output.params sprout-groth16.params but I can't find them in the new github download?

[18-Dec-19 12:47 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
I remember when I first did this, that I had to manually put the komodod file into komodo/src. I also later put it into the pos64staker folder so I could use it for staking

[18-Dec-19 12:47 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
Has worked great for months

[18-Dec-19 12:48 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
komodod is not in the downloaded files 0.5.0 obsidian so I guess I could manually copy it over?

[18-Dec-19 12:50 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
It seems i also had to locate the sprout etc files and download them and put them into a folder, just don't remember

[18-Dec-19 12:51 AM] TonyL#3577
You no need to update sprout files, what you need to to is to change your current `~/komodo/src/komodod` file with `komodod` file from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/0.5.0/komodo_0.5.0_linux.tar.gz archieve and restart the `komodod` with THC params

[18-Dec-19 12:52 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
ok, what is thc params? is that the ac= line?

[18-Dec-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
yep:
 ```./komodod -ac_name=THC -ac_supply=251253103 -ac_reward=360000000,300000000,240000000,180000000,150000000,90000000,0 -ac_staked=100 -ac_eras=7 -ac_end=500001,1000001,1500001,2000001,2500001,4500001,0 -ac_perc=233333333 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenable=229,236,240 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -ac_founders=150 -ac_cbmaturity=1 -ac_sapling=1 -addnode=157.230.45.184 -addnode=165.22.52.123 -earlytxid=7e4a76259e99c9379551389e9f757fc5f46c33ae922a8644dc2b187af2a6adc1 &```

[18-Dec-19 12:53 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
ah, ok, and then after it syncs can I then do the pos64staker?

[18-Dec-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, just ensure that you see 0.5.0 version in getinfo

[18-Dec-19 12:54 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
Thx, appreciate your patience, will give it a go

[18-Dec-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
No worries üëç

[18-Dec-19 12:56 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
should I replace all 3 of the files in komodo/src? fetch params, komodo-cli and the komodod

[18-Dec-19 12:56 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, you can replace all 3

[18-Dec-19 12:57 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
Those are the three that downloaded

[18-Dec-19 12:57 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
k, thx

[18-Dec-19 01:11 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
Awesome, get info is now 0.5.0, Thx so much. Now can I stop it and enter my daemon starting string for the pos64staker, or does that need to be modified

[18-Dec-19 01:13 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
it has my pubkey and blocknotify info

[18-Dec-19 01:43 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, for staking you can start it same way as you did before

[18-Dec-19 01:44 AM] gregmcgolf#5997
awesome

[18-Dec-19 02:37 AM] Jobi#8901

Thanks @TonyL

Hi,

I have downloaded Agama wallet on mine PC. I was able to create Veruscoin, DGB, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
When I try to add Tether Agama wallet says that there is already Ether wallet and nothing happens.

How can I get tether address if it won't create?

Also Agama wallet for Android is not installing and could also not be found on Google Play store.

[18-Dec-19 05:52 AM] smk762#7640
for mobile, Give atomicDEX a shot. Beyond being a DEX for trading, it also functions as a wallet. Verus is now maintaining Agama, so any issues they might be able to help in thier discord https://discord.gg/U5rWvpQ

@Audo @SHossain If language channels can be opened on the Discord server. would be great.

[18-Dec-19 08:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@Paro did you check the #start-here channel?
is the language you want not available?

[18-Dec-19 08:38 AM] Paro#7842
Yes I saw.

[18-Dec-19 08:38 AM] Oszy#5734
some of those flags don't create a channel for me

[18-Dec-19 08:39 AM] Paro#7842
