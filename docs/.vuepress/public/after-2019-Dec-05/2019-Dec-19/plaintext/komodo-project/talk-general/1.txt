@VoskCoin your node has mined roughly 8000 KMD, did any of this go to "fund[ing] Komodo news and tutorials"?

[18-Dec-19 12:15 PM] Alright#0419
@Greer if the node is auto-reelected, I hope it's greer_EU going forward

I have updated Ledger Live and the Komodo app on Ledger to latest version.

[18-Dec-19 03:07 PM] farl#9964
Ledger device also stalls in the Komodo app after this...

yes

[18-Dec-19 06:00 PM] gcharang#6833
he said he blocked you
it seems you asked him for his wallet.dat
I am not banning you now because I am not sure if you were really trying to scam (as his actual wallet.dat is deleted)
please don't try to contact him again

if you have ways to recover his address please describe them in a public channel and we will all be grateful if your method works and helps a community member

[18-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Alright#0419
checking every box in the "is this person a scammer" checklist

[18-Dec-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
You show up with a fresh account immediately after a user asking for help recovering a large amount of money

[18-Dec-19 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
and apparently ask that user for his wallet.dat, so....

[18-Dec-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
I have no doubt you're a scammer

[18-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
if not a scammer why the sock puppet account?

[18-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Slyris#2880
@Alright Don't waste time, ban him.

[18-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Slyris#2880
And if you can ban ip feel free.

[18-Dec-19 06:54 PM] Slyris#2880
He is obviously a scammer, we don't need that.

the last two videos featured verus for reference

[18-Dec-19 10:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`@ComputerGenie always great to see you here shit talking`
Remind me the last time you actually ran the node that bears your name....

[18-Dec-19 10:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
.... or the last actual Komodo vid you made...

[18-Dec-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#JustSayin'

[18-Dec-19 10:24 PM] VoskCoin#1869
i never claimed to have ran the node

[18-Dec-19 10:25 PM] VoskCoin#1869
and im busy right now so I'm not going to sit here and argue with you in this server for the next hour because you're unhappy with your life lol

[18-Dec-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i never claimed to have ran the node`
then it's not "talking shit", it's a perfect parallel to call it a "RINO" 🤷🏽‍♂️

[18-Dec-19 10:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because you're unhappy with your life`
the only thing I'm unhappy about is that I had to get up from supper for this 😣

[18-Dec-19 10:26 PM] VoskCoin#1869
idk idc, everytime I peep my head in here and catch up on some info you're in some sort of argument or making rude remarks

[18-Dec-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe you should come around more often then 🤷🏽‍♂️

[18-Dec-19 10:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do find it mildly interesting that you sought to attack me and not actually respond to the comment @Alright made and I agreed with, though

[18-Dec-19 10:31 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@sφldat @PTYX @hyperDEX @Alright @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 

Once node costs are reimbursed and I convince @Greer he deserves the lion share of the remains, then the rest will fund KMD news & to be blunt that's hardly any funding for the work involved.

{Reactions}
😐

[18-Dec-19 10:31 PM] VoskCoin#1869
there's over $2000 in server bills alone

[18-Dec-19 10:32 PM] sφldat#8733
so if I understand correctly, a place is available for the next election?

[18-Dec-19 10:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`for the work involved`

_goes back to his lasagna_

[18-Dec-19 10:33 PM] VoskCoin#1869
If anyone wants to help w/ content creation via research/articles/key points and features to cover, I'm all ears. But if you just want to waste time arguing, I don't have the time or interest for it

[18-Dec-19 10:40 PM] PTYX#6840
The above doesn't make any sense at all. So you want more funds to complete your promise as a notary?

[18-Dec-19 10:41 PM] PTYX#6840
I like that you made content for Verus but why isn't there any content for komodo?

[18-Dec-19 10:45 PM] PTYX#6840
There's also no way you spend $2000 in Komodo server bills

[18-Dec-19 10:49 PM] Llama#1330
i love vosk calling out genie and genie *trying his hardest* to refute it

[18-Dec-19 11:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I pay about $200/month for both of my NN servers

[18-Dec-19 11:21 PM] sφldat#8733
what kind of server do you have @VoskCoin to pay more than 10x expensive?

[18-Dec-19 11:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`There's also no way you spend $2000 in Komodo server bills`
_spent more than that in the last 6 months_ 🤷🏽‍♂️

[18-Dec-19 11:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are less expensive alternatives, but that's not an "absurd" figure, my server is $2100 for 6 months

[18-Dec-19 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`genie trying his hardest to refute it`
what was I "refuting"? 😕

[18-Dec-19 11:37 PM] VoskCoin#1869
On mobile atm but I can furnish bills if you’d like, nothing to hide, it’s likely ~$2500 since the nodes inception. & there’s no diy route being in EU vs USA my location

& our two servers aren’t even overkill, they’re spec’d to meet requirements, as promised.

A NN first job is being a NN, second is everything else as the network should naturally be the most imperative

[18-Dec-19 11:37 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 looks like we are allies now 😄

[18-Dec-19 11:48 PM] sφldat#8733
thank you for your answer @VoskCoin ,it's positive to have nothing to hide. it's true that the kmd price is not at its best. but I think everyone would be happy when you have time to make a short video about Komodo, especially about the new features.

[18-Dec-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
I forgot that we were talking about your verus NN

[18-Dec-19 11:49 PM] Alright#0419
Don’t really care, just wanted to point out that you made a bunch of promises and didn’t follow through

[18-Dec-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
