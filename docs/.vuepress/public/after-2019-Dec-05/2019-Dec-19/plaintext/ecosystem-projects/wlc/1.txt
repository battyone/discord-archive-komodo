Those who missed the migration process are unable to claim anything as WLC is delisted from Agama wallet and the new WLC21 will be listed...I have advertised in our WLC channels a few times for 2 months even in private to some of you, I could not do more

You can still use old verus agama but on native mode
Or with cli or qt wallet, WLC chain is still alive and still notarized for a few months
