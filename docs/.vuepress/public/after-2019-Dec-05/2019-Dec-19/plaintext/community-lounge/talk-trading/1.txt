@Crabby Paddy yeah you know , better worry about the 4 defunct projects you was promoting and holding millions of coins before getting another loan

[18-Dec-19 12:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
There is still people waiting for the scam exchange to open up again so they can withdraw funds

[18-Dec-19 01:21 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@mrtzmp3 as am I but I don‚Äôt have any control over that situation nor is there any solid evidence on which sides fault it is yet

[18-Dec-19 01:27 AM] richardt#2807
@Markus I meant the deep bear market, when BTC went down to $3k

[18-Dec-19 01:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
No control over the situation , just facilitating 100% of OTC trades of this project , airdrop coins of personal stash ,, so I don't become some kind of megawhale'' , you are literally the head of project now that CEO has gone missing

[18-Dec-19 01:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so you‚Äôre mad at me because I did airdrops helped try build a community when  belief in project was strong

[18-Dec-19 01:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But when it falls now everything is somehow my fault

[18-Dec-19 01:49 AM] tolken#2655
His not gone? What does that mean?

[18-Dec-19 01:50 AM] tolken#2655
If you meant, ‚Äúhe is not gone‚Äù am I safe to say you mean Fabien? If not gone, then why does everyone think he is?

[18-Dec-19 02:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You did OTC everything zexo , our , dune 1% commission .... Open the fucking exchange asap pls ppl have their funds stuck , and CEO is disappeared after saying he will clear all fud easily 3 weeks ago

[18-Dec-19 02:04 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[18-Dec-19 02:07 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I find it hard to believe guy with your balance , that I saw when you gave the airdrops , would consider even one second putting money in this obvious scam from the start

[18-Dec-19 04:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I believed in it and I built the community yes

[18-Dec-19 04:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If it was successful or how you‚Äôd want it, you would not be roasting me now for trying to build the community up

[18-Dec-19 04:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I have not made a cent off this. Everyone has their views I still see potential and know of a few things in works. I‚Äôm not telling anyone to buy but I have done nothing wrong so please stop telling me to put the exchange up

[18-Dec-19 04:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Because I can‚Äôt do that

[18-Dec-19 05:18 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes I want to see it . Like last time you offered me to see the proof you ever bought a single of this sh...coins , you lost your 2 fa :)

[18-Dec-19 05:20 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Beside this if you lost so much you should be the nr1 critical here . And demand answers for Christ sakes , you cannot just shut down the exchange without notice , promise to clear the ,,fud '' and nothing for 3 weeks I mean comeon

[18-Dec-19 05:20 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
As it looks now it's an exitscam unless proven otherwise

[18-Dec-19 05:22 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not trying to roast you neither but you are the community manager or similar

[18-Dec-19 05:23 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
There is no other to talk to because it's a scammy business without any real contacts

[18-Dec-19 06:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Tradingview being played? Just before btc started to drop punch of bullish buying opportunities posted for kmd.  Hopefully nobody fell for those.

[18-Dec-19 06:23 AM] Mark81#4505
When you're on downtrending --> dont buy!

Now I know you are full of shit  @coingirl87. You say no TA here works. Just scroll up to Dec 5th and Dec 7th and you'll see that my TA was on point.

Loads of manipulation on TV  @Mark81, it turned into a shitshow years ago which is why I don't use the 'social' part of it anymore.

[18-Dec-19 06:30 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Beware of your attitude towards TA, it will only prevent you from learning. I thought TA was bs and used to call TV Tardingview and proceeded to watch BTC fall from $800 to $250. That's when I decided I needed to understand markets and TA and after years of work I know for myself that it works.

[18-Dec-19 06:34 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Just remember there are always unknown unknowns... the things you don't know, you dont know

[18-Dec-19 06:42 AM] Mark81#4505
I know that TA works. I think that right now only bitcoin matters and it is affecting all. Prices are getting now very low. It still doesn't mean that they cant go lower from here. I am saying stuff of TV just that i know there are people that are throwing money for some giving "hope" for winning trade. I have had seen my kmd account go over 1 million dollar and didnt do anything to it.  I cashed out my litecoin position back then to get my dream of paid mortage fullfill anf it did. Since then I've been trying to grow my kmd position. So its been rollercoaster but i still have my patiency to wait.

@Mark81 sorry if you felt that was directed at you, it wasn't. It was directed at  @hyperDEX and the many others who always have some unfounded reason to discount TA and talk of 'meme lines', manipulation, whales etc. just because it's easier than actually trying to understand.

the public are reluctant to accept the results of the market based on their own moral standards. 
this attitude is very dangerous. 
who in the world can judge moral standards? 
market does not compensate by moral standards. 
therefore, please get rid of the folly of using ethical standards in the market economy.

[18-Dec-19 08:55 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Conservative estimate of the bear flag ends at 45c which coincides with support going back to Nov '18. I'll be looking for a bounce there, although it is already starting to show some bullish divergence on the 4hr.

when talking to banks being honest usually works best and yields the best results in getting what you want

[18-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
unless you want to take out loans for crypto, in that case don't be honest.

Thanks  @CoinKing88, I've been wondering what's been going on there... it's about -30mil now üëÄ

but is that realized yet?

[18-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or unrealized 30mil loss

[18-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362

There has been a marked increase in calls for free integration and collaboration .   It definitely does seem that people are warming up to komodo from the bizdev side at least.

KMD (4)

[18-Dec-19 07:02 PM] richardt#2807
It's just like anyone who experienced the 2013 and 2017 bull market. Lots of regret of not accumulating more beforehand

[18-Dec-19 07:27 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Lets say KMD is a unicorn, at some point they would want to structure the project into a company structure. KMD is a utility token so we won't have any equity in that company, we have a right to use the product KMD. I would be interested to know what the plans in that area are for lets say the next 10 years. Any @Team  Admin can elaborate on that? 1. How will the value for the KMD be preserved? For example: if the team decides to start a company and launch KMD2 and build their company on that we could end up with a lot of useless tokens (like Ripple did with XRAPID). 2. If a company structure is chosen will KMD hodlers get a piece of equity or will they be able to buy a piece based on being a KMD hodler? Me personally i would be more interested in buying equity shares instead of buying KMD utility coins.

[18-Dec-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
you make some very incorrect assumptions.

i would NEVER support any such attempt to takeover KMD. period. if you doubt this, not sure how i can convince you. maybe the fact that i cannot own any such company shares gives it a financial incentive that you can understand. but it is far more than just the financial aspects. it would break the trust of everybody that has KMD. over the years from NXT assets, SuperNET, BTCD, i have always done my best to make sure the people who supported projects of mine are protected against dilution and certainly against theft.

the place for companies is to build useful services and products using KMD. and already there are such companies that exist, with more to come. each of these are independent and many will have opportunities to invest in them. so there already are companies in the ecosystem.

[18-Dec-19 08:14 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I was not saying that you would, i was just thinking about some scenario's for the future. If KMD turns into a Amazon big company (think big :)) lots of things COULD happen. The fact that i only hodl KMD, DEX and BTC shows i got big faith in you and the other team members.
