[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
using DEX for consensus is probably a great idea

but a decentralized orderbook is useless without the extra liveliness data (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373#issuecomment-565961090)

and our order book experience needs a lot of improvement, in terms of both the order types and of making them work reliably by using the liveliness data

therefore I'd like the caretakers to synchronize the entire orderbook for starters (no need for shortquotes there)

then I ha...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
not sure what you mean about liveliness data, i specified that each quote will have a timestamp, so couldnt the elapsed time from the timestamp indicate how likely it is to still be valid? also we can build in some PoW that is needed to prevent the orders from being spammed.

i think the shortquotes will allow to create a very good model of the top of the orderbook and each node can fetch whatever specific quotes it wants. the "shortquotes" can encode whatever resolution of the orderbook th...

the most recent timestamp from a peer will indicate when it was last alive. given that we can set how often a node will send out a fresh quote (to at least update the timestamp), we can tell if a node went away if the most recent timestamp is older than that. at least assuming we are having decent propagation of quotes.

the shortquotes providing the inventory and each node able to query specific quotes, suffices for a node to sync the entire orderbook if it desires. the shorthash should no...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #373: p2p for ordermatching, plans
d3 seems best

i think the basic idea of having a set of peers (like for DEX chain) that is able to provide a complete list of known quotes, summary data and whatever else is needed (even liveness validation of a pubkey) is a good way to make a practical solution.

using the gossip network with inventory and specific queries for the full quote, allow us to have relatively large data for each quote (for signature, maybe even utxo details) and by making the DEX peers able to serve lite clie...

a lightweight chain will have a small number of failures whereas a bitcoin swap will more likely fail due to a user being impatient or loosing loosing connectivity. consequently, for a bitcoin swap we are more likely to split the swap, performing a number of swaps in background.
