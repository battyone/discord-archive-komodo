A friendly reminder that Komodo's mandatory Obsidian Dragon upgrade to the code base version 0.5.0 will happen at block height 1670000. That's about 57 hours from now. This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update will not run on the correct network.
As a precaution, we have also advised all services and Exchanges to pause the deposits and withdrawals from Dec. 19th - 21st, 2019.

[telegram] <DanishCryptoGuy> Hi, I just found out that there was a KMD hardfork, june 15. I had my coins stored in my Ledger Nano wallet. Do I have to worry?

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> No you are fine

[18-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> I deleted that ETH video because I think it is an elaborate scam.

[18-Dec-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yup.

[18-Dec-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I was right haha

[18-Dec-19 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Might be the most elaborate scam I've seen in some time. It's a "live" video of Vitalik Buterin talking about ETH and is cropped onto a screen of an ETH explorer with an ETH giveaway QR code you "send" to... there's thousands watching the video and it's on a YouTube Channel called Ethereum with like 15k subscribers, but no other content.
Scam
