"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:02 PM","Also, refactoring the libraries to not compile as plugins seems to fix some things. Still some problems due to historical `blocks` library always linking as dynamic/static in certain libs, but we’ve stopped using that as a historical record. All nodes sync the whole blockchain in our network, without masking PoW hashes","",""

"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:03 PM","Specifically protocol and p2p libraries are the ones that compile as modules","",""

"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:07 PM","And they matter even more when values cross the network...","",""
"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:11 PM","Probably the source of this too: https://hackerone.com/reports/630903","",""
"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:14 PM","Won’t work on Linux or Mac, as `euid != uuid`... but that’s only true for things that modify root file system I think?","",""
"402649850241482752","Biz#0842","08-Jan-20 12:28 PM","I would probably continue reporting via HackerOne, if i wasn’t being discussed in the context of “banning biz from making contributions” while the same person was also falsifying things I said in a written form","",""
