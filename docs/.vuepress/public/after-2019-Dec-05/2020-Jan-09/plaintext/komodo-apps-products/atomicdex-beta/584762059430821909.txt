Haven‚Äôt been able to match a single swap since updating atomicDEX today

[08-Jan-20 03:52 AM] Vanncoins#3044
Latest update didn‚Äôt seem to fix it

[08-Jan-20 04:04 AM] Bastol#5205
Since update i can't see estimated usd values anymore.

[08-Jan-20 04:05 AM] Bastol#5205
Aaand it just came back on its own for some reason

[08-Jan-20 04:26 AM] CiPhEr#2091
strange thing i'm noticing with the android app is that I'll place a bunch of orders in the morning on my phone, phone runs all day with screen on at work so it can properly host orders with internet (mostly) always connected to it and now at night the orders are still on my phone, yet 90% of them are not showing up on the oracle orderbook. This is not with the latest app, but I installed about a week ago.

[08-Jan-20 04:27 AM] CiPhEr#2091
do orders sometimes disappear if connectivity fails for a while?

[08-Jan-20 05:02 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so with new version of app I was FINALLY able to get rid of the change sounds. For anyone else wanting to do the same just: 
download audacity, create a new (empty) project and then go to Generate > Silence... default length of 30s is fine. Then go to File > Export audio, and choose MP3. Put this file on your phone and link every sound to it and voila sound free experience.

[08-Jan-20 06:37 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
When will CHIPS and ARRR be added to the DEX?

[08-Jan-20 06:39 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
And once ARRR is added is it still technically a ‚Äújumbler‚Äù for other blockchains via atomic swap? Basically use it as a cloak bridge between blockchains, is this the idea?

[08-Jan-20 06:43 AM] figgy132#7531
New version crashing when running in the background (android)

[08-Jan-20 07:08 AM] CiPhEr#2091
@MorganJekyll i doubt arrr will be added since it is private transactions only. I believe visibility of transactions is necessary for atomicdex to work with the coin, but i'm not positive

[08-Jan-20 07:34 AM] CiPhEr#2091
any suggestions on how to get orderbook queries looking better? I am using jq but at any of these brackets [ ] it makes it a line by itself so one order book entry takes up my whole vertical screen practically

[08-Jan-20 07:36 AM] TonyL#3577
For human readable format it more practical to use or make GUI

[08-Jan-20 07:39 AM] CiPhEr#2091
true. yeah i built an excel sheet that queries market data and compares it to the csv oracle download but i'm finding out that oracle orderbook page only has some of the markets, finally found that out after just now compiling and using mm2 for the first time. I was able to see my orders that my phone says exist but don't show up on the orderbook oracle.

[08-Jan-20 07:51 AM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm i wonder how difficult it would be to use the orderbook api on mm2 to build & keep up to date a database of trading pairs, just like the oracle orderbook but just for myself with the pairs I want to track.

[08-Jan-20 08:14 AM] CiPhEr#2091
hi @smk762 sorry to bug you but do you have any info on documentation / recommendations for me to do the above? I believe you are the one currently maintaining the atomicdex orderbook oracle, no? I'd like to see about making one for myself that has the pairs i'd like to watch üôÇ or, maybe you could check if it is functioning properly, it used to list all sorts of rel's for kmd but now only shows vrsc and axe.

Some of the other coins might be missing some rel's too like VRSC I think was showing FTC but not anymore

[08-Jan-20 08:21 AM] smk762#7640
which language?

[08-Jan-20 08:22 AM] CiPhEr#2091
like programming language? I'm just starting out in all this, so not a programmer but willing to learn!

[08-Jan-20 08:22 AM] smk762#7640

prob easiest to clone the repo, set your MM2.json creds and cron the orderbook script

[08-Jan-20 08:23 AM] smk762#7640
I'm assuming you are on linux?

[08-Jan-20 08:24 AM] CiPhEr#2091

sweet. havent tested the above on win.

[08-Jan-20 08:24 AM] smk762#7640
should work, but sometimes some quirks

[08-Jan-20 08:25 AM] CiPhEr#2091
cool yeah or i'll probably use linux

[08-Jan-20 08:25 AM] CiPhEr#2091
do you know if the current orderbook oracle is working correctly?

[08-Jan-20 08:25 AM] CiPhEr#2091
seems to be missing some pairs err some sides of pairs

[08-Jan-20 08:25 AM] smk762#7640
should be, but only updates every 15 min or so

[08-Jan-20 08:26 AM] smk762#7640
last update 13 min ago

[08-Jan-20 08:26 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ok yeah for kmd only other side showing is axe and vrsc, used to be tons others this morning. Cant manage to find my orders i placed but can see them through mm2 orderbook querry

[08-Jan-20 08:26 AM] CiPhEr#2091
been checking a few hours

[08-Jan-20 08:26 AM] smk762#7640
using vpn?

[08-Jan-20 08:27 AM] CiPhEr#2091
actually yes would that affect it

[08-Jan-20 08:27 AM] smk762#7640
yeah it can sometimes

[08-Jan-20 08:27 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i'll try turning it off

[08-Jan-20 08:28 AM] CiPhEr#2091
showing 153 entries, same for you?

[08-Jan-20 08:29 AM] smk762#7640
site agrees

[08-Jan-20 08:29 AM] smk762#7640
I dont have a terminal to that server at the moment

New version crashing when running in the background (android)`
For me too. After switching back to the app.

[08-Jan-20 08:30 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah no worries, thanks for all your work on it though!

[08-Jan-20 08:30 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i built an excel sheet that uses the csv quite nicely

[08-Jan-20 08:30 AM] smk762#7640
no worries, mm2 has motivated me to learn many new things üòÑ

[08-Jan-20 08:31 AM] CiPhEr#2091
couldn't figure out a way to have excel download the csv by itself to update so i download it manually

[08-Jan-20 08:31 AM] smk762#7640
havent used excell for a while, and the csv is gen by js so prob no url for it.

[08-Jan-20 08:32 AM] CiPhEr#2091
but having those pairs missing made me compile mm2 in my vm to query the orderbook manually to make sure my android app wasn't saying something not real with my orders not showing up anymore

[08-Jan-20 08:32 AM] CiPhEr#2091
which i'm glad i did, great to be getting into this stuff again

[08-Jan-20 08:35 AM] smk762#7640
you can get the json that populates the site from http://cryptocartography.io/json/mm2_orderbook.json

hmmm just checked again i think i was being a moron and not sorting something right in excel i see most everything, just not FTC

oh nice cool man i'll check it out thanks!

when AtomicDex goes Officially to AppStore

[08-Jan-20 09:14 AM] gcharang#6833
@DRE not anytime soon
the app and mm2 are still in beta and in development

[08-Jan-20 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
@Oszy can you DM me the logs? anything in them give a reson for crash?

[08-Jan-20 09:33 AM] gcharang#6833
@CiPhEr @MorganJekyll arrr will be added to the DEX. but no ETA right now
and yes, it can theoretically be used as a jumblr

wow thats super awesome

[08-Jan-20 09:35 AM] CiPhEr#2091
hey any ideas for this- my app goes into order matching but doesn't proceed to next step, i've tried different amounts, does this mean that maker is already engaged with another taker?

[08-Jan-20 09:36 AM] gcharang#6833
what is the pair?

[08-Jan-20 09:36 AM] CiPhEr#2091
zec / kmd

[08-Jan-20 09:36 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i'm trying to be the taker with kmd

[08-Jan-20 09:37 AM] gcharang#6833
is there only 1 order?

[08-Jan-20 09:37 AM] CiPhEr#2091
it is the one for .018 price

[08-Jan-20 09:37 AM] CiPhEr#2091
max vol 9.78692999 zec

[08-Jan-20 09:39 AM] gcharang#6833
if one order doesn't work for you, it is recommended to try matching another order
the non working order could have unupdated node or bad connectivity

ZEC recently had a network upgrade and if the maker didn't update, swap won't go through

[08-Jan-20 09:39 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh ok i see

[08-Jan-20 09:40 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so there would be no advantage to just let order matching sit and work right? if order doesn't get matched right away that is probably bad sign

[08-Jan-20 09:41 AM] gcharang#6833
that's correct most times

[08-Jan-20 09:41 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ok cool thanks

Hi, what is the ECA feature in the update?

[08-Jan-20 10:24 AM] gcharang#6833
ECA is a coin

[08-Jan-20 12:08 PM] cipi#4502
btw, there is maker on the network with ZEC that uses `atomicDEX 0.2.7 Android` (also as maker) and fails all swaps (last 2020-01-08 10:05:05 and 2020-01-08 11:52:18), simply because this version can't handle ZEC... so if ZEC-swaps are failing, try another maker

Is there a step by step manual how to send DEX asset to ledger nano AND get them off again (i understand that getting them off is the tricky part?)

[08-Jan-20 03:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I got them mostly stored on the atomicdex wallet, don't want that for longterm HODL

[08-Jan-20 04:00 PM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
@CoinKing88 when you move DEX out of ledger, the privatekey of Komodo (as they are the same) will also be exposed to a computer.
If that is ok, here are the steps:
To store:
1) Just send to a KMD address from your Ledger

To move them:
1) Open this webpage in an offline computer: <https://iancoleman.io/bip39/>
2) Input your ledger seed words in the field "BIP39 Mnemonic"
3) Select KMD in the field named "Coin"
4) In "Derivation path", select the tab "BIP44"
5) you should see the addresses and privatekeys of your ledger addresses
6) copy the privatekey of the address with your DEX coin and use it to login to Verus Agama and you can move them

[08-Jan-20 04:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Allright, thanks a lot! Last question: what if that website (iancoleman.io) goes offline? :troll_hmm:

[08-Jan-20 04:04 PM] gcharang#6833
here is the source code: <https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39>
countless other people (including me) have forked it and have offline copies

[08-Jan-20 04:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Thanks, downloaded a copy of the code to be sure. Have a good night!

Fyi in case anyone else is having issues installing the latest version, play store only worked for me after "uninstalling updates" in app settings. It was not possible to install anything before that. Probably an android issue, but figured I'd mention it

@MrBizzy - atomicDEX-PRO (codename "DEXtop") is the DEX desktop GUI - it is not fully usable yet but very soon.

https://developers.atomicdex.io has a lot of infos ref. the atomicDEX API-core/backend that all GUIs (mobile + Dextop) are based on.
