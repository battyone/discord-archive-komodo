[telegram] <changemymindk> Vitalik sounds like a robot anyway so it‚Äôs hard to tell what videos r fake üòÇ (re @Regnar: I did see a crazy creative one a little while back, involving a fake YouTube channel with Vitalik Buterin talking over a video with scam ETH address for giveaway)

[08-Jan-20 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Haha yea but admittedly this was pretty clever, even had a YouTube channel with like 20k followers (re @changemymindk: Vitalik sounds like a robot anyway so it‚Äôs hard to tell what videos r fake üòÇ)

[telegram] <johnConnor8> guys anyone know about Zaddex project?

[08-Jan-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <johnConnor8> they were partners with rfox i guess

[08-Jan-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <johnConnor8> did they exit scam

[08-Jan-20 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <johnConnor8> zaddex was a project on kmd btw

[08-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No idea tbh. I don't know much about them and honestly don't keep track of every project in the ecosystem. I think you are right about Redfox working with them though so they might have more info in the RFOX channel.
I did just search a little in discord and saw there is some relation between Zaddex and Dune (Tezos fork?) But I know even less about Dune and Tezos lol. 
I suggest trying the Redfox channel for that question (re @johnConnor8: guys anyone know about Zaddex project?)

[telegram] <Crypto_Ferret> I was just wondering; the user bonus? do you gain 'interest' on the coins sent or the coins in the wallet? It's not very clear onine

[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Is KMD used for anything in the atomic DEX? Does it have a utility?

[08-Jan-20 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Less trading fees on AtomicDex if you hold more then 10KMD on your Wallet as an example (re @CallMeDaddy: Is KMD used for anything in the atomic DEX? Does it have a utility?)

[08-Jan-20 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> No utility else?

[08-Jan-20 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Used in DPoW

[08-Jan-20 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
you pay less fees if you use KMD in AtomicDEX

[08-Jan-20 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
https://dexstats.info/index.php
and almost all trades on AtomicDEX are with KMD, either maker or taker

[08-Jan-20 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo has been very strategic in its planning when deciding how to use KMD in the ecosystem, most every project or product provides benefits by using or holding KMD but does not force the reliance on it, especially Atomicdex. 
For example DEX the coin, receives fees from Atomicdex trades, then converts those coins into KMD at market price and distributes KMD to DEX holders. This separation is what protects KMD and it's holders from being lumped into regulatory nightmares that will eventually arise (re @CallMeDaddy: No utility else?)

[08-Jan-20 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Does the DEX have a separate coin not KMD..?

[08-Jan-20 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Deadpool1001> DEX and KMD are different coins (re @CallMeDaddy: Does the DEX have a separate coin not KMD..?)

[08-Jan-20 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Thats means KMD has no real utility (re @Deadpool1001: DEX and KMD are different coins)

[08-Jan-20 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Or not?

[08-Jan-20 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> What? lol (re @CallMeDaddy: Thats means KMD has no real utility)

[08-Jan-20 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CallMeDaddy> Did I misunderstand something?

[08-Jan-20 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Didn¬¥t you read the answers from the others here ?

[08-Jan-20 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> DEX Asset = DEX
Total Coin Supply: 1,000,000
DEX receives 50% of all dex fees on AtomicDex API .
This shows all the dex fees collected for every coin. Before payout, these will be traded for KMD and then distributed according to the revenue sharing model. This is the distribution of the dex fees:
50% ‚Äì DEX
15% ‚Äì JUMBLR
15% ‚Äì BOTS
5% ‚Äì REVS
5% ‚Äì MGW
10% ‚Äì Claimed by the GUI developer

[08-Jan-20 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Deadpool1001> It has utility. Smaller trading fees, rewards, dpow is paid in kmd, all atomic dex fees are distributed in kmd to DEX holders etc. (re @CallMeDaddy: Thats means KMD has no real utility)

[08-Jan-20 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Another important thing by doing this is KMD does not fall into the murky waters of security coins by deriving revenue from potential businesses. It still benefits because it is still bought and used to pay out for things like DEX. 
Additionally by keeping the Atomicapi free of requiring KMD, it means other wallets and coin projects can build on it and share liquidity without having to "become a Komodo coin" but still benefits KMD by way of trading fees being used to buy KMD.

[08-Jan-20 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So think of the alternative, requiring KMD to use the Atomicdex or API, it would keep projects that want to maintain independence and their own coin, from adopting Atomicdex at all.
Development would almost exclusively have to be done by Komodo devs themselves, not just initially, but forever. Keeping it open will help foster a better development ecosystem.
Another example, Binance doesn't require BNB to trade, if they did, they'd probably be replaced by a competitor who didn't
