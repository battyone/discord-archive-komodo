I like how the BTC pump has the old crows coming out talking about accumulating... keep in mind, these voices that are again talking about accumulating have been wrong every time they have spoken up for the past 2 years.  BTC has always been the better buy every time the KMD Krew starts talking about, "What a great time to buy!"  Time may prove them right, buuuuut... it also may not.  Time has not been kind to the KMD maximalists.

[08-Jan-20 01:57 AM] Lanii#8302
@meatspoon I was just explaining how accumulation tends to work. Never said kmd being in one. I haven't been here for 2 years, nor have I once called a kmd bottom (I never speak in absolutes, just probabilities). Im also not a kmd maximalist, was at one point but learned my lesson long ago. However you seem to be one and thats why you are frustrated and salty like this. But sure, go ahead and tell us more about how btc is a great buy after a 20+% pump with no pullbacks worth mentioning.

[08-Jan-20 02:42 AM] richardt#2807
Yeah  @meatspoon, get it straight!  BTC and ETH were dead 2 years ago!  Only KMD lives on

[08-Jan-20 03:22 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Lanii I apologize if it came across as if I were targeting you with my comment.  I was responding more to the subtext and actual text of others in here recently  (several days) who are saying now is the time to accumulate (not that the charts show that we are in an accumulation phase).  I was pointing out how the active users who often claim that KMD is a steal at the the current price have been claiming that for 2 frigging years and how BTC has owned them at every single turn for 2 years.  I was also responding to the general haranguing of coingirl.  I agree with little of what she says, but she is critical of KMD which I appreciate and people bag on her, especially the KMD maximalists.  I am not and have never been a KMD maximalist.  I am, however, a salty MF in general.   I am also not saying BTC is a great buy after a 20% pump, but I miiiight still wager that $100 spent on BTC right now will be worth more in 6 months than $100 spent on KMD.  But shiiiiit, i am not buying BTC right now.  Come on man, don't straw man me into the position of a chromosome-challenged individual.

Most people first buy btc and then buy alts

[08-Jan-20 07:27 AM] Flint#6435
it should be recognized that large investors KMD is now not at all interesting and these small pumps that we see are just minor manipulations and nothing more! Real money does not go into Komodo, and this shows how it bleeds when bitcoin grows. No matter how the defenders and developers of Komodo deny, but probably the time has come to recognize that the Agama hack - the official wallet of the project has scared off potential large investors no longer wants to take such a risk and check whether the same thing happens with Verus Agama or AtomisDEX and of course the team did it well funds and returned them, but this will not completely erase the reputation and any major investor, thinking about investing, will look at this page of history with a hack and bypass at least until he is sure that all the risks are now Do! After all, investors are not techno experts and masters of the program crypto code and they are alien to talk about the complexities and innovations of the blockchain - they look at the investment attractiveness and use of the asset and, most importantly, its liquidity, which is now very bad for the coin as well as for volumes!

[08-Jan-20 07:51 AM] ronyi#5719
üôÇ just wait, I have time and KMD is good. Halving, WWWIII, hashrate.... I think BTC going down (volume). If not that's good for me. https://imgur.com/a/BpTH7vD

The only thing that saves the Komodo from an even lower decline is rewards of 5%, but this is done exclusively by exchanges, the Komodo team and the desperate FOMO who bought the coin at the last peak of the price six months ago and who wants to at least leave this game without losing at least 5 % per annum so you can take a screenshot of this forecast but I‚Äôm guaranteed for sure that when the price touches the previous peak again at $ 1.5-1.8 we will see a massive coin drain so that FOMO investors will return their and possibly new bottom below $ 0.4 per coin, especially with the growing dominance of bitcoin and especially if at that time the use of KMD is a matter of a maximum of thousands of people around the world as it is today!

[08-Jan-20 08:03 AM] ronyi#5719
Early NXT, BTS, AMP charts.... üôÇ Yes, many people is only BTC and BTC and BTC... I'm tried of BTC, almost all alts is under water. What is the reason for 50 thousand? 3k-14k = Facebook libra; now 6,5k- 8,4k (9K) WWWIII and halving. Bitmain is rationalize..... I have position all sides, we will see.

[08-Jan-20 08:17 AM] Flint#6435
as long as the cryptocurrency joke meme with a dog has a trading volume comparable and often greater with the capitalization of the super technological and innovative Komodo system that only the Binance director knows about, several hundred Chinese traders who do not care what to trade and readers of contention, there will be no price increase, but rather We will see more than one bottom and the migration of the last investment in profitable assets! And when web 3.0 really becomes the standard and we see exchange applications without nasty sounds with killed user experience and enough liquidity, then maybe we'll do the applause! But this is 5-10 years minimum

if there was an indicator of fear and greed for Komodo then he would have broken many times the lower bar of extreme fear and would never have gotten out of there until the price returned at least above $ 1.8üòÇ

So guys what you are saying is that kmd is pretty much fcked and no bright future ahead of it .

[08-Jan-20 09:57 AM] Buddz1993#5380

because of the events between the usa and Iran, the demand for bitcoin and gold has already begun to increase and the dominance of bitcoin will continue to strengthen, and given that komodo has virtually no liquidity and the only pair with bitcoin, this can mean many years of hibernation if someone does not like the word "death" After all, there is no pair with the dollar, and a pair on bittrex with usd is even contemplated due to lack of volume liquidity! The rocket to the moon is canceled. In these circumstances, even the ARRR pirate project is more likely to make a leap to cover the losses of gullible investors.

[08-Jan-20 01:26 PM] Lanii#8302
I got my fills on kmd also, the saltyness is a nice addition to my TA

[08-Jan-20 01:26 PM] Lanii#8302
Looking good

[08-Jan-20 01:28 PM] Lanii#8302
On a serious note, if someone was adding down here and wants a good SL, below 620 ish looks good.

[08-Jan-20 01:30 PM] Flint#6435
@Lanii Do you naively believe that technical analysis works when liquidity is so low that it even becomes suspicious? This is unforgivably low liquidity and the trading volume only says that there is no interest in the coin completely and the maximum you can count on is a small rebound from the so-called double bottom that we recently saw a flat or new bottom and there will be no end to it until the coin will find REAL application and will not find liquidity!

[08-Jan-20 01:31 PM] Lanii#8302
You are right, TA on illuquid stuff is kinda meh, however better use my set of rules even if they are kind of iffy, rather then buying blindly

[08-Jan-20 01:32 PM] bishop#9773
The point I was trying to make back then was how silly it is to guarantee a price target. And broadly speaking, I can't stand it when people say "guaranteed" when things can and do change.

Does the experience of the past tense tell you anything when we broke all conceivable and not conceivable support levels and moved contrary to the laws of the market, breaking a new bottom? For your technical analysis to work, buyers need investors, and not just sellers who received a coin due to mining or holding in a wallet! So far, this model only works well for developers who received cheap coins at the ICO and created an imaginary coin value of $ 0.5 minimum, and simply pays hundreds of thousands of coins for their bills! But for other investors, this is a pain! And for smart investors, the development of the coin should also be supported by the expansion of liquidity and trading pairs, but this is not alas

ask yourself what will happen to the price tomorrow if Binance delists kmd? This is a word about liquidity and its effect on value.

[08-Jan-20 01:47 PM] Lanii#8302
I can ask myself many different questions. What will happen if Bill Gates becomes a kmd maximalist etc, but I truly don't give a shit about that. I use TA to define my entries/stops and risk. I don't bother with the FA part of it, I used to once but then I realized its not fundementals but funnymentals. Any worst case scenario I would already be out as per my defined risk.

[08-Jan-20 01:47 PM] designer#4893
Regardless of the development of technology, Komodo was shunned by the market.

[08-Jan-20 01:47 PM] designer#4893
No excuses are allowed in the market.

[08-Jan-20 01:48 PM] Lanii#8302
We had a 145% pop from the lows where I bet many fomoed in, now that we are back into what (I) assume to be a support people are scared shitless and talking about all kinds of worst case scenarios.

[08-Jan-20 01:50 PM] Lanii#8302
They could happen for sure, Iran vs US could fully blow out later tonight and ww3 begin then I doubt crypto would matter. But that possible scenario is not gonna stop me from trading the way I have for quite some time now.

[08-Jan-20 01:52 PM] Flint#6435
KMD value at the moment is held ONLY because of a 5% reward and because of FOMO investors who are waiting for a price return of $ 10-12. But a 5% reward will no longer seem so attractive if we lose another 50%, for example, due to a hack at the Bilaxy exchange that bypassed Binance in Kmd trading but still continues to amuse us with trading volumes of $ 800,000 per day - this is the amount with which Several Singaporean investors are trading a DOGE cryptocurrency meme with a dog, and we do not even have anyone close in the matter of coin value! Yes, the technology is cool but the market does not want to evaluate it and prefers to bypass KMD preferring the dog meme and bitcoin

[08-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
5% reward is actually inflation so it should decreasse value not increasse

[08-Jan-20 01:59 PM] Flint#6435
just the war of the usa and Iran plays into the hands of only the dominance of bitcoin and maybe a few more liquid private currencies like MONERO, but if the market didn‚Äôt give a damn about KMD, then in the light of new events do not console yourself with the fact that the story from the take-off from the lows will repeat! Of course, we can make 500% in six months, but this is even worse than the casino and there are no factors other than our dreams and hopes of FOMO that the price will cover losses, not to mention profit. Profit is received by those who created a relatively liquid instrument with a certain emission simply due to staking but not providing yet any more useful functions and involved so far only in the rates of traders

[08-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus 5% is also the reason why many did not sell the remnants of KMD after the collapse and after breaking Agama

[08-Jan-20 02:10 PM] Flint#6435
the biggest problem is that KMD has no investors who can move the price; there is no big money because of almost zero liquidity! I don‚Äôt know what should happen so that a large venture fund says ‚Äúwe should invest in KMD‚Äù tomorrow, but KMD is not used anywhere except for speculation. Neither in online casinos, nor in cross-border transfers, neither on the darknet nor in payment for a NETFLIX subscription, nor in pairs on liquid exchanges anywhere except for fantasies and plans of developers! This does not say that this will always be the case, and we may still see a peak, but so far, alas, nothing will change this unless a new bullish race of bitcoin above 20K

people using HODL for KMD are the only defenders of the price, and if they had not been delisting from exchanges for a long time now, although if everything continues with liquidity as of late, there are no guarantees that these two or three exchanges not delisting KMD as is the case with illiquid pairs. And then they will calm us down and persuade us to do HODL for a couple of years in anticipation of AtomicDEX

I just want to warn the newbees not to start daytrading and expect to get rich quick.

True, your first post sounded like an advice to everyone to stop HODL and start daytrading to earn more money. That's too risky imo.
