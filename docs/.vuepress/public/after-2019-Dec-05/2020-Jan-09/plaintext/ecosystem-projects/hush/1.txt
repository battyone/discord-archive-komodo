[dscrd-hush] <MorganJekyll> So is there an actual working HUSH messaging app?

[dscrd-hush] <MorganJekyll> And does it have a built in feature to send btc and others with atomic swaps? Because thatâ€™s the killer app right there ðŸ¤«

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @MorganJekyll Regarding HUSH messaging app, we have put a few bricks on SilenceDragonAndroid (SDA) and SilentDragonLite (SDL). We are working hard to strengthen network security and eradicate metadata leaks. A secure and private base is important for building private messaging applications, which is our goal.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @MorganJekyll all of our GUI wallets support sending the encrypted memo field back and forth already (SD, SDL, SDA). We have a mock GUI for our android app SDA that is furthest along, that needs to be tied to the backend. All the pieces are there, but all the glue and shiny stuff between them is not ðŸ™‚ If you want to help, we got plenty to do and we pay bounties

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> For those who saw the announcement in #ðŸ“£-announcements-ðŸ“£ I cannot stress enough how valuable this listing would be for HUSH.
This is not a mere market listing, but an opportunity for HUSH to be accepted by merchants worldwide as a form of payment in both transparent AND private shielded transactions. This would be monumental for HUSH.
