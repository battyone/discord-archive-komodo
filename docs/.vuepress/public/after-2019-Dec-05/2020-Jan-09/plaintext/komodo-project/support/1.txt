Hi there, I'm trying to claim rewards through ledger, but I get a Win security message saying chrome wants me to log into github, which I can't, and then the claim reward app says that the ledger device is unavailable...anyone can help me with this?

thank you, however i run into the same problem with all three apps: I get a Win security message saying chrome wants me to log into github for some reason, which I can't, and then the claim reward app says that the ledger device is unavailable...anyone can help me with this? it's the first time i got this error message, maybe to do with updating to the latest firmware and komodo-app version on ledger a few days ago? Somebody have any idea?

[08-Jan-20 08:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that is weird that it want to login to github

[08-Jan-20 08:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe try incontigo mode in chrome

[08-Jan-20 08:28 PM] okthen#8167
i am doing that already

[08-Jan-20 08:28 PM] okthen#8167
i have no github acc

[08-Jan-20 08:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
Unfortunatly I cant test it right now but hopefully somebody else can test it with the newst firmware and komodo-app

[08-Jan-20 08:31 PM] okthen#8167
i suppose that's where the error comes from, i'll check back in a few days, maybe someone can check it out, I wouldn't know how tbh
