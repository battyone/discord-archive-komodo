crex24 deposit and withdrawals for KMD has been in maintenance for quite a while. any ideas why?

[09-Dec-19 12:03 PM] Regnar#6164
@badscrypto my bet is it is probably the same reason all the other exchanges were in maintenance, updating their wallets for the hard update. Though many have finished already

But you should ask Crex24 to be sure
