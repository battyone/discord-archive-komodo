hello there
im one of the poor folks who bought a Ledger Blue
i have my KMD stuck there and Ledger no longer supports KMD on the Blue ( i have since bought a nano)

[09-Dec-19 01:51 AM] MackParts#2582
any advice? would be much appreciated

[09-Dec-19 06:18 AM] Deltazulu#2710
hey guys, ihave a question, i accidentally sent my OOT to my KMD ledger adress, is there a possibility to retrieve them?

[09-Dec-19 06:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Extract wif and import to agama

[09-Dec-19 06:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But that would expose seed I assume

[09-Dec-19 07:01 AM] Oszy#5734
yes it would. if you do that, set up ledger with a new seed after dont use the exposed seed again

I had two failed swaps today again as a taker with the latest iOS version. Both times, it went up to step 2/3, then cancelled, the app was even in the foreground all the time. It's annoying that you loose your taker fee when it's a larger amount. What's going on with all those failed swaps?

[09-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Oszy#5734
dex?

[09-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Arno#3334
yes

[09-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Oszy#5734
there is a maker who has wrong coin params setup

[09-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Oszy#5734
makes them fail

[09-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
the 20 kmd guy

[09-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Arno#3334
What does this mean specifically? Can you use the software "wrongly" as a maker?

[09-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Oszy#5734
on pc if the coins file set up wrongly or outdated the swap will not go trough

[09-Dec-19 11:09 AM] Arno#3334
It should always work on the "base layer", no matter which app versions or app variants people use.

[09-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Arno#3334
(I know, easy to say, but maybe hard to accomplish)

[09-Dec-19 11:11 AM] Oszy#5734
it always works with the latest coin config, unless someone doesn't update it or changes things in it.

[09-Dec-19 11:14 AM] Oszy#5734
on mobile it can't happen cus you can't edit it

[09-Dec-19 11:14 AM] Arno#3334
At least there's hope to get back a tiny, tiny fraction of the lost taker fees when you own some dex...

[09-Dec-19 11:16 AM] Oszy#5734
@artem.pikulin would it be possible to add config file verification for mm2 on pc? don't let orders posted or activate the coin with outdated config params?

[09-Dec-19 11:17 AM] Oszy#5734
or always pull the latest on start automatically

[09-Dec-19 11:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
There's an idea to detect the transaction version and other params automatically: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/239. Pulling latest config can be easily automated without MM2 changes by adding `git pull & cp coins mm2_location` or something similar to MM2 run script.
Also it's possible to validate that coins config of nodes match to each other before even matching the order.
I would like to not force MM2 to always use the `coins` file from JL777 repo, what if someone would like to test the BTC testnet keeping the ticker same? Or maybe test that specific config fails, etc.

[09-Dec-19 11:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
In summary: we already have several ideas how to prevent the swaps fails due to misconfiguration and it will be implemented in near future.

[09-Dec-19 11:31 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also with the most recent changes your node will ban the failing maker until restart, so next swap attempt will be made with another node.

[09-Dec-19 11:35 AM] Arno#3334
Another suggestion is to be able to turn off the sounds, or not keep it running constantly during a swap, or even during an order is active.

[09-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Oszy#5734
@Arno read about that in #atomicdex-beta from Saturday why it's like that

[09-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Oszy#5734
Thanks for the answer Artem

[09-Dec-19 05:29 PM] sbucks#9553
will VRSC going to mainnet in the agama v0.6.0.1 win wallet keep me from safely storing KMD in the same wallet?  I only use lite mode for my KMD in the agama wallet or do i need to stick with V0.5.9.1?

yes, the version 0.6.0-1 is good for KMD also

@Moderator y'all have a spammer, GiveAWAY News#5320

[09-Dec-19 07:07 PM] Max Power#0420
probably a scam

[09-Dec-19 07:08 PM] Max Power#0420
I've got a screencap if you require it

[09-Dec-19 07:12 PM] gcharang#6833
thanks, I think it is banned already

[09-Dec-19 07:20 PM] sbucks#9553
@gcharang thanks for your response.  i feel better.
