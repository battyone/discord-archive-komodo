Looks like Richard Heart is set to make over $100m USD from Bitcoin HEX when all is said and done. That's the problem with crypto, scamming clueless noobs is more lucrative and so much easier than building a successful business that advances the state of the industry.

Under A HEX
Fair warning: This is going to be a lengthy analysis, but I promise the pay off is worth it. I have seen several articles that call HEX a…

Gonna post this here so I can read it later

This doc provides a good explanation of how the HEX smart contract works. I am still sceptical but find it unlikely RH is intentionally trying to scam people, I think HEX is more likely a genuine attempt to create an interest paying crypto without any third party custody or lending, it might not succeed, but RH gains far more from success that a cynical scam where he probably ends up in prison or worse. If this is a serious attempt RH will have a mountain of liquidity to support HEX from the origin address (HEX), and the adoption amplifier ETH. After the first year the inflation will be 3.69%, and probably over 85% of HEX will be locked up in long term stakes which means the circulating supply will be relatively small, and after the first year HEX could be priced quite high.

One of the tricks is when a user stakes the HEX are burnt, reducing circulating supply numbers on CMC,  if all goes to plan 90% of supply is locked up in stakes, so HEX will appear on CMC much lower down the rankings, making it look cheap. Smoke and mirrors, but if the staked amounts stay consistent the circulating supply will too.

[09-Dec-19 01:21 PM] Don King#8901
When a stake matures the HEX principal plus interest gets created again, but if the stake & unstake inflows and outflows find an equilibrium, the circulating supply could be a fraction of the HEX locked up in stakes. It does resemble a Ponzi (but strictly speaking isn't), but it could last indefinitely because all the moving parts are visible, and coded in the smart contract.

One possibility would be rebooting a komodo version of HEX using similar parameters, but instead of using ETH or KMD for the AA , a new token like VOTE could be airdropped onto KMD holders, and if this token was made to only be expendable to the AA contract address, it wouldn't be tradable, and so might avoid attention from the SEC as it wouldn't be a security. A lot of the problem with HEX comes from RH having to play nudge nudge wink wink games on who controls the AA ETH and origin HEX, to avoid howey test and the SEC. An airdropped komodo token just for komodo:HEX would avoid this all together.

It would showcase the smart contract capabilities of komodo

[09-Dec-19 02:56 PM] Don King#8901
Even if just as an experiment and a bit of fun marketing

KMD need to gain more value for this be interesting

[09-Dec-19 03:09 PM] Markus#5464
kmd looking pretty weak on the chart

[09-Dec-19 03:09 PM] Markus#5464
not sure if 50 ma daily will hold

[09-Dec-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully it holds and can pump to 10k to ensure the golden cross that is getting closer and closer
