On-chain momentum is crossing into bullish. Prep for halvening front running here on in. Can't say what this indicator is, as it's proprietary to @AdaptiveFund, but it tracks investor momentum. The bottom is mostly likely in, anything lower will be just a wick in the macro...

Time for plan B in Greece too. The war on cash and the desire for surveillance and control just escalated. WTF!

Problematic

[09-Dec-19 07:15 PM] LocoMB#8593
haven't read yet- from the non-hysterical tone of the first few lines, I gather: this has not happened .. 🕰️  _yet_ - looks like a scary thing 👻

It's an interesting read, actually. my mind goes immediately in overdrive to reason if this attack vector is present on other chains.

Yeah for sure, how many people simply copy pasted MKR contract? Or such a type exploit in general, which devs didnt bother to patch/fix because they believe in the kindness of people or whatever

Tbh, if I had the money, knowing this I would consider it. Only problem is you know Ethereum is capable of fucking you over and forking over your fairly ‘hacked’ ETH...

Jl has more the lose than a mere 40 million should it go wrong should it trace to him

As kmd and the ecosystem would probably be hurt as well
