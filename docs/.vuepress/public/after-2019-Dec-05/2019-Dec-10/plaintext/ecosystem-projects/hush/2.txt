[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> enjoy that little bit of privacy, most people are trying to steal it from you üôÇ

[09-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Dec-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Merged upstream changes from KMD, you can add that

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we also have our own fork of libsnark now

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and libgmp

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> how much detail do you want? :troll:

[09-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> All of it

[09-Dec-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can write "Hush now has our own forks of libsnark and libgmp to fix build system issues"

[09-Dec-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi you might as well say that I recently deleted every single Verus-specific line of code from the Hush fork of KMD

[09-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the reason it's for DragonHead

[09-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to natively support ARMv8 compile, which VerusHash prevents

[09-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since we don't use Verus code, I deleted it all.

[09-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I got 99 problems but a Verus ain't one

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> My Twitter has been suspended, due to some hater. So you might see a Privatoshi3 account.. Shake dem haters off

China has ordered that all foreign computer equipment and software be removed from government offices and public institutions within three years. Does this mean backdoors will be going open source?  https://t.co/U6Jndq3mBN

[09-Dec-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is a funny joke

[09-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Imagine what it would take for the US to remove all Chinese HW+SW from our country, lol

[09-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think I can see where this is going, and it's not looking good

[09-Dec-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are going back to paper

[09-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Open source hardware is the only future that makes sense, for privacy

[09-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We must have it, or have no privacy

[09-Dec-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Some opensource hardware already exist but it is old and perfs are outdated compared to modern stuff. Do you know a modern manufactorer of modern opensource hardware ?
(yeah we can program a FPGA, it can do the trick)
