is there anyone who can get the DEX trade (taking with KMD) to work?  The offer with 1 DEX for 20 KMD doesn't move despite trying a few levels of KMD.

[09-Dec-19 04:22 AM] NNoperator#3835
Alice is not at all interested following through with my swap despite order match and fee taken.

[09-Dec-19 04:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Looks like it’s same bad maker returned. Tried few times with this order too without luck

[09-Dec-19 05:05 AM] cipi#4502
the config for DEX is likely wrong on that maker

[09-Dec-19 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I believe it not updated also because last mm should temorary ban him from trades

[09-Dec-19 05:20 AM] NNoperator#3835
A different Alice went right after my Bob.

[09-Dec-19 05:21 AM] NNoperator#3835
I think I could even hear her talking with my Bob.

[09-Dec-19 05:35 AM] cipi#4502
@NNoperator you should check your config too
https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2988
DEX needs `txversion:4` and `overwindtered:1` set, just like KMD, else it will not work

Sound setting does not work, not saving when you disable play at full time

[09-Dec-19 08:40 AM] Acura#2748
Short feedback on the new version on the iPhone:
I made the sound quieter in the settings, then turned it completely quiet in the soundless mode - so I could go to sleep overnight and still keep my order online without any disturbing sound. Great

Don't forget to left the phone on charge if keep it with maker orders at night 😀

[09-Dec-19 08:43 AM] Acura#2748
yes - i do that 🙂

[09-Dec-19 09:59 AM] Tom.T#6920
Who guys know when the Atomicdex will be on App Store?

[09-Dec-19 09:59 AM] Oszy#5734
after beta test is finished

[09-Dec-19 09:59 AM] Tom.T#6920
@Oszy Sound great, thankyou Oszy.

[09-Dec-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
@ca333 why did anyone think a non stop repeating sound byte that can only be slightly turned down was a good idea? Toggle should be on/off/onEventOnly

[09-Dec-19 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
How to Android soundless mode??? Ive put my Media volume at zero for now.

[09-Dec-19 04:49 PM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
>>> 10:32 PM]TonyL: sound notification  was implemented mostly for iOS (will allow mm2 to work in background). In AtomicDEX settings you can minimize the sound volume of these notifications

10:45 PM]ca333:for android we can certainly implement a "silent sound" - for iOS we simply can't. However, we can work out a sound/format that isn't annoying. Maybe being able to chose the sound will be an improvement: "Female with irish accents" vs. "Male with scotch accent", "Beeps", etc.

10:46 PM]jl777c:you cant have a very low volume (close to inaudible) sound on iOs?
[10:48 PM]ca333:you can - but the goal is to get the app approval from apple - so we had to declare the application as an app which needs sound-notifications (key-feature) since that is one of the few options we had to be able to keep the app running in the background. If there is no sound it will be interpreted as a bypass of the "no app can run in the background" rule - and that would bring us back to the old situation.

 8:29 AM]artemciy_dice:Playing silent sounds on iOS is unlikely an option, it is an old and infamous trick, iOS reviewers are well-aware of it and it gets applications banned most of the time.
[8:31 AM]artemciy_dice:But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.
10:50 PM]artemciy_dice:AtomicDEX is in beta and we're only just started testing this functionality. The major question now is whether the Apple would approve the background mode. If they will, then we'll be further improving this functionality with things like choosing different sounds, allowing you to use the sounds from your own sound library and such. Anyhow, thanks for testing the app!

blame lynch, he posted something that put it in my head to start with

[09-Dec-19 05:07 PM] 0x03#8822
has there been an atomicdex update on android?

[09-Dec-19 05:07 PM] 0x03#8822
android 9 here and it's playing funny coin noises in circles

[09-Dec-19 05:08 PM] 0x03#8822
driving me into sheer madness 😛

[09-Dec-19 05:08 PM] 0x03#8822
oh... nvm

[09-Dec-19 05:10 PM] 0x03#8822
am i allowed the admittedly slightly mean question how this happened? 🙂

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
scroll up

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] 0x03#8822
no... let me rephrase

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
been there, done that, got pinned

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] 0x03#8822
was there no android user having this before it got pushed 😛

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] 0x03#8822
ohgod nvm again

[09-Dec-19 05:11 PM] 0x03#8822

[09-Dec-19 05:12 PM] 0x03#8822
y u no 😛

[09-Dec-19 05:12 PM] 0x03#8822
i just dont know what, actually

[09-Dec-19 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
... since Android 9 you can lower media volume so its silent... only loops sounds if you have open orders

[09-Dec-19 05:12 PM] 0x03#8822
i dont btw

[09-Dec-19 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
dont what?

[09-Dec-19 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
have open orders

[09-Dec-19 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
but it shut up after switching to dex and back to portfolio oO

[09-Dec-19 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
is there a cache involved

[09-Dec-19 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh yeah on launch it makes that sound when coins load... but that didnt loop for me... so might be buggy in 9?

[09-Dec-19 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have a Pixel so on 10

[09-Dec-19 05:14 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm on g7play

[09-Dec-19 05:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
should be sorted out soon... sounds like it can be turned off in Android with a future update to that code... apparently it has to stay for iOS to keep the app open for posted orders.
