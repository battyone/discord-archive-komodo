don't know where I should ask this question, I'm playing around with electrum servers requests.
When I send `https://www.atomicexplorer.com:9998/api/getcurrentblock?ip=electrum2.cipig.net&port=10001&proto=tcp`
it returns
```
{
  "msg": "success",
  "result": 1653916
}
```
but when I send 
```
https://www.atomicexplorer.com:9998/api/getbalance?ip=electrum2.cipig.net&port=10001&proto=tcp&address=RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA
```
it returns
```
{
  "msg": "error",
  "result": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "unknown method \"blockchain.address.get_balance\""
  }
}
```
I can't figured out how to make it correct though, anyone has any idea ?

@PHBA2061 you have to look around, but I think `address.get_balance` was deprecated

@PHBA2061 you need to use scripthash instead of a public address

[09-Dec-19 11:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@pbca26 thank you for the answer, can you elaborate a bit how the scripthash is related to the R-address ? I only know that R-address = encodebas58(3C + RIPEMD160(sha256(pubkey) + checksum)

maybe this helps: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-basics.html#script-hashes

[09-Dec-19 11:23 PM] cipi#4502
and you need to use this call: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html#blockchain-scripthash-get-balance

[09-Dec-19 11:24 PM] cipi#4502
https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-removed.html#blockchain-address-get-balance was removed
