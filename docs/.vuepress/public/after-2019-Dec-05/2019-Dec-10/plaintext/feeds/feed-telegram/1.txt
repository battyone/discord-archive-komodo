[telegram] <Regnar> I've got tons of erc20 tokens from random airdrops, all of which would cost me more in gas to send to an exchange and sell than they are worth. Lol and it isn't 0 value (re @BearTheTrader: Just today I was playing with bancor token, every freaking move is a fee, I used metamask like more than 10 times today and it is always crazy set because you never know how much it is going to cost you a txt and that is horrible)

[telegram] <t_dan> I had two failed swaps today again as a taker with the latest iOS version. It's annoying that you loose your taker fee when it's a larger amount. What's going on with all those failed swaps?

[09-Dec-19 11:05 AM] gcharang#6833
is it a swap for DEX?

[09-Dec-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> Yes, I already got an answer, that there is a maker who has wrong coin params setup which makes it fail. So people better use the latest version of AD.
