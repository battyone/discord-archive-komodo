Closing an account this way may also have tax advanteges. In many jurisdictions, selling other asset to buy usdk in order to cover the loan may trigger capital gain tax, and by this approach it can be avoided.","",""

As currently you can only redeem if you have at least full amount of debt in coins. So if you took 100USDK, if you have 90USDK you are trapped. If you have nothing you are still trapped and the only way to take the deposit is to buy USDK coins. Maybe we should allow to redeem any amount of coins to get deposit at current price until you are let say below yellow zone and you do not put global account in red zone.","",""

"424224648889106444","Mihailo#5902","09-Dec-19 09:31 AM","So basically we should have only one command which will be called let say pegscloseaccount and there you can put any amount of coins or none and with that get right amount of deposit. If you put the whole debt then it is like redeem now. If you put some of the coins you will get deposit minus value of uncoverd debt. If you put no coins you will get just the deposit that is left after covering the debt. And these two cases can be done only if you don't enter in some of danger zones.","",""

"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","09-Dec-19 09:35 AM","clearly, we need to avoid pushing global balance into danger and some sort of rising fee as it gets closer and just not allowing it if it would make it go into the danger zone. that should avoid the attacks by people who deposit a lot and then close it, just to push the system to the brink","",""

The large depositor scenario sets off a bit of an alarm bell, but that fee to dissuade tom foolery behaviour sounds like it would do the trick 🤷‍♂️","",""
"424224648889106444","Mihailo#5902","09-Dec-19 12:26 PM","The global balance is basically total balance of all users deposits and debts. The liquidation is enabled only when global ratio reaches 60% debt. So if one user is in red zone (90% or more) but the global ratio is let say 40% nothing is in danger. When total debt vs. total deposit reaches 60% then liquidation is active and the worst accounts >90% are subject to liquidation.","",""

I can set 0 but on importgateway and also pegs chain you will have coins and regular transactions which if used with for example `sendtoaddress` it will set 5k sat txfee. So those transactions will be mined first as they have higher fee. So the deposit and withdraw tx will not be a priority. And I think it need to be different way.
