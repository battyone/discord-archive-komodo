Pulling latest config can be easily automated without MM2 changes by adding `git pull & cp coins mm2_location` or something similar to MM2 run script.
Also it's possible to validate that coins config of nodes match to each other before even matching the order.
I would like to not force MM2 to always use the `coins` file from JL777 repo, what if someone would like to test the BTC testnet keeping the ticker same? Or maybe test that specific config fails, etc.","",""
