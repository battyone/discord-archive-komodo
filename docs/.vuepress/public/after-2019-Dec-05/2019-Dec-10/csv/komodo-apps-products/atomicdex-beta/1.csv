"423176312354635779","gcharang#6833","09-Dec-19 04:49 PM",">>> 10:32 PM]TonyL: sound notification  was implemented mostly for iOS (will allow mm2 to work in background). In AtomicDEX settings you can minimize the sound volume of these notifications

10:45 PM]ca333:for android we can certainly implement a ""silent sound"" - for iOS we simply can't. However, we can work out a sound/format that isn't annoying. Maybe being able to chose the sound will be an improvement: ""Female with irish accents"" vs. ""Male with scotch accent"", ""Beeps"", etc.

10:46 PM]jl777c:you cant have a very low volume (close to inaudible) sound on iOs?
[10:48 PM]ca333:you can - but the goal is to get the app approval from apple - so we had to declare the application as an app which needs sound-notifications (key-feature) since that is one of the few options we had to be able to keep the app running in the background. If there is no sound it will be interpreted as a bypass of the ""no app can run in the background"" rule - and that would bring us back to the old situation.

 8:29 AM]artemciy_dice:Playing silent sounds on iOS is unlikely an option, it is an old and infamous trick, iOS reviewers are well-aware of it and it gets applications banned most of the time.
[8:31 AM]artemciy_dice:But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.
10:50 PM]artemciy_dice:AtomicDEX is in beta and we're only just started testing this functionality. The major question now is whether the Apple would approve the background mode. If they will, then we'll be further improving this functionality with things like choosing different sounds, allowing you to use the sounds from your own sound library and such. Anyhow, thanks for testing the app!","","👌 (1)"
