I am still sceptical but find it unlikely RH is intentionally trying to scam people, I think HEX is more likely a genuine attempt to create an interest paying crypto without any third party custody or lending, it might not succeed, but RH gains far more from success that a cynical scam where he probably ends up in prison or worse. If this is a serious attempt RH will have a mountain of liquidity to support HEX from the origin address (HEX), and the adoption amplifier ETH. After the first year the inflation will be 3.69%, and probably over 85% of HEX will be locked up in long term stakes which means the circulating supply will be relatively small, and after the first year HEX could be priced quite high.

Smoke and mirrors, but if the staked amounts stay consistent the circulating supply will too.","",""

It does resemble a Ponzi (but strictly speaking isn't), but it could last indefinitely because all the moving parts are visible, and coded in the smart contract.","","üíÑ (2),üê∑ (1)"
"288941564263268353","Don King#8901","09-Dec-19 02:55 PM","One possibility would be rebooting a komodo version of HEX using similar parameters, but instead of using ETH or KMD for the AA , a new token like VOTE could be airdropped onto KMD holders, and if this token was made to only be expendable to the AA contract address, it wouldn't be tradable, and so might avoid attention from the SEC as it wouldn't be a security. A lot of the problem with HEX comes from RH having to play nudge nudge wink wink games on who controls the AA ETH and origin HEX, to avoid howey test and the SEC. An airdropped komodo token just for komodo:HEX would avoid this all together.","",""
