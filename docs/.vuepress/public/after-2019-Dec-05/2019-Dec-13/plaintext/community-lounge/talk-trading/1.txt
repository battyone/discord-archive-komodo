Pretty large cluster that will act as resistance

[12-Dec-19 04:48 AM] jspook16#3059

that looks like a ...

[12-Dec-19 10:46 AM] Oszy#5734
(dog) toy?

[12-Dec-19 10:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you put candy in it, takes a while for the dog to get it out

[12-Dec-19 10:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
they play with it for half an hour or so chasing the candy

[12-Dec-19 10:48 AM] Oszy#5734
well I mean.. by the looks of it, you could put something else in it. let's say if you're not a dog.

[12-Dec-19 10:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you have a dirty mind

[12-Dec-19 10:49 AM] Oszy#5734
it's for natural teething :troll:

[12-Dec-19 11:07 AM] smk762#7640
now I have to wonder what my dog does when I'm out. picture is to scale tho, and the rubber is pretty firm so I'd advise caution for non-standard usage.

Piratechain (ARRR) got listed on bilaxy :pirate:

[12-Dec-19 11:31 AM] Oszy#5734
nice volumes

[12-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Markus#5464
keep in mind that bilaxy volume is not legit

[12-Dec-19 11:43 AM] Markus#5464
just watch kmd/btc orderbook....spread between 8,07k and 8,17k and suddenly trade history is filled with trades between those 2 values and total trading volume is like 10k kmd in 1 sec out of nowhere

[12-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Markus#5464
and orderbook contain very weird orders, most of orders are 800 kmd on the buy side

[12-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Markus#5464
not even 1 order above 1k

[12-Dec-19 11:45 AM] Markus#5464
maybe thats also why their chart on the website got so many gaps

[12-Dec-19 11:48 AM] kaks#6612
in order book seems normal

[12-Dec-19 11:48 AM] Oszy#5734
volume might not be real but orderbook it is

[12-Dec-19 11:48 AM] Oszy#5734
500k up for sale

[12-Dec-19 11:50 AM] Markus#5464
wouldnt trust it, fake volume and fake trading = no go for me

[12-Dec-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
not worth the risk to one day not be able to withdraw for some weird reason, u never know with fishy exchanges

[12-Dec-19 11:52 AM] Oszy#5734
it looks legit so far.. we'll see after some time has passed.

[12-Dec-19 11:52 AM] kaks#6612
this exchange recommended by jl

[12-Dec-19 11:54 AM] Markus#5464
Its up to each person what he want  to do but im not a risk taker, crypto is a very evil place where u have to be very cautious. Thats why i rarely invest into any coin and only use exchanges that are proven legit

[12-Dec-19 11:55 AM] Markus#5464
u see exit scams pretty much everyday

[12-Dec-19 11:55 AM] kaks#6612
altsbit/tradeogre exchanges there isnt fake trade/volume

[12-Dec-19 11:56 AM] Markus#5464
sure not every exchange do fake volume

[12-Dec-19 11:56 AM] kaks#6612
ofc

[12-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no arrr/btc?

[12-Dec-19 01:11 PM] kaks#6612
only usdt

[12-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Here's a pretty good report on exchange volumes, it's a year old but worth a read to see the games being played: https://ftx.com/volume-report-paper.pdf

[12-Dec-19 02:37 PM] Bitfinger#6245

[12-Dec-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
they have several accounts on bitmex leaderboards who made the most profits

[12-Dec-19 02:44 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah they look legit and professional. Very big operation.

[12-Dec-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
they have a youtube channel also

[12-Dec-19 02:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245
They have tons of data so that's why they are worth listening to.

[12-Dec-19 02:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245

```BTC/USD on daily chart. Looks like ~$7000 for the second bottoming before the massive liftoff in the price could be on Dec. 15/16.```

[12-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464
Dont know if i agree, bitcoin is extremely bearish over all timeframes
