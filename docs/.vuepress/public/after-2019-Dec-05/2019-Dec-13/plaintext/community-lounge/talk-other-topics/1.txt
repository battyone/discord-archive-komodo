creating favorable conditions for the U.S. is the premise of a future trade order. In other words, the U.S. does not deny free trade or pursue economic isolationism, but rather bilateral free trade in favor of the U.S.

what the current international economic order means is that strengthening individual free trade through strong links with the United States is a prerequisite for survival.

recognize that we are approaching the point of seeking survival in a limited international space where free trade is open only to selected countries in the United States.
