When thinking about it, kmd moat is that because of it's frugality and trustless nature it will have the cheapest prices (the only thing that bothers me atm is the fees), just like Amazon or Walmart. Further tapping into that moat will further widen it and will further increase the money flows into the system.
More funds flowing into the system would probably mean further decreasing of DEX fees (and by that further increasing the moat) which in turn up to a certain point will further increase the revenues.

Laffer curve
In economics, the Laffer curve illustrates a theoretical relationship between rates of taxation and the resulting levels of government revenue. The Laffer curve assumes that no tax revenue is raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100%, and that there is a tax rate between...

Ah ok

[12-Dec-19 03:14 AM] artik123#2884
I'm adding a couple of words on things that I have mentioned above.

Notarization: 
Notaries tx's fees to BTC could be calculated maybe as last 24 hours avg tx fee or weighted toward current time or just 10% more than lowest fee of the last BTC block.

Zero fees: 
Eos has zero fees and they use a rate limit algorithm to prevent spam. I know that it is different than kmd because they have a trusted setup (in kmd a miner can just drop/ignore a tx without fees). But regardless I'm also not sure that this approach would be in any case good enough for kmd. I think that a big enough ddos attack can still disrupt them. Maybe it's good just for the start but be sure that as they grow they *will* be attacked. Just like ddos attacks still exist (and growing...) on the net.

DEX: 
Maybe we could also have lower dex fees for public keys that have a lot of accumulated value usage (Like Costco. cex's also having it) which will be lowered more as they use them more (this would be a kmd type of lock-in).

[12-Dec-19 03:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Agree with the fee optimization , disagree on the DEX part,  makers already don’t pay fee and taker fee is lower than pretty much every normal exchange.

[12-Dec-19 03:46 AM] artik123#2884
Read about the Laffer Curve

[12-Dec-19 03:47 AM] artik123#2884
Lower fees doesn't always mean lower revenues

[12-Dec-19 03:47 AM] artik123#2884
It could well possibly mean higher revenues

[12-Dec-19 03:52 AM] artik123#2884
They can also be optimized

[12-Dec-19 04:08 AM] artik123#2884
If a book costs $15 and Amazon sells it for $20 and barnes and noble sells if for $30. Amazon for example, could have five times as much sales as Barnes and Noble and would make a total profit of $25 compared to $15 profit of each sale of Barnes and Noble. This is the general principle

[12-Dec-19 04:28 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but Amazon sells below costs (sometimes at $0) until barn and noble goes bankrupt, then only increase the price after no other bookstore exists

[12-Dec-19 04:57 AM] artik123#2884
Not exactly. This approach is called predatory pricing. They do have profits but they use them to expand their company.
This is why for many years their overall net balance was negative or very low.
They actually have/had measures to make sure that they have the lowest price in the market for every item. And they have/had a price comparison showed to the user in real time.
When they raise prices they still wont raise them above a certain level which is still very low. 
There are all kinds of monopolies. Amazon/Google are considered a "good monopoly" because user can choose a different product/service of a different company (unlike a "bad monopoly" where you don't have other choices - usually government monopolies) at any time (And they are actually the ones that keep the "good monopoly" in check).
But we still using them because they good at what they do.

[12-Dec-19 05:01 AM] artik123#2884
But what you said is just proving my point. If kmd dex would have enough traffic and the best margin prices for users and by that could raise the fees and make more profit, it would kinda be days of redemption...

[12-Dec-19 06:08 AM] artik123#2884
The Costco example could incentivize someone that wishes to develop services/cex on top of kmd dex. 
So for example if the normal dex fee is (y), he (because of the traffic that he brings) could have a lower fee (x) and could offer to his customers a tx fee of x+z (z<y-x) and have the difference (z) for himself. It's a viable model.

His public addresses could be implemented as multi-signature addresses signed by trusted parties to increase security.

This general setup could be done by the kmd team, so all he needs to do is develop a nice website (kmd team can even develop a simple white label website) and go out to find his customers.

So that if komodo is the Wix of blockchains is could also be the Wix of Dex's. A service provider would just need to be someone with good marketing skills and it could be preferably implemented in a way that he also wouldn't need to know almost nothing about blockchains.

thanks for these good ideas!

[12-Dec-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
we are always improving the tech, so when we are upgrading the notarizer we will look at dynamic fees
