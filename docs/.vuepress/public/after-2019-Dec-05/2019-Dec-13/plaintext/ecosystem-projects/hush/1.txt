[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Super Mario, because he constantly is after coins

This is why you don't use JS to secure your money. That is a really dumb idea. This is why $HUSH threw away our entire nodeJS GUI wallet.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you use Verus Agama, you should ask them if they are vulnerable, lulz

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> RewardBot#6246 is a DM spammer, FYI

[12-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We need to up the server moderation to, users must wait 10 minutes to write a message or, they must have a verified email address.

[12-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Not a valid phone number, that's too far, lol

[12-Dec-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Correct

[12-Dec-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> phone numbers are bad

[12-Dec-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> verified email is ok i guess

[12-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why not? Not all Spam bots verify email

[12-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD bot just asks you to click a link, that would be fine

[12-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> requiring a valid email doesn't really provide much, either

[12-Dec-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We need something like the telegram bot we use

[12-Dec-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That thing has no spam. It'll ban you if your first message is a link.
