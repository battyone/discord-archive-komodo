@SHossain @jl777c I have stopped USDKTEST chain to bring up new chain on pegs with new gateway. We said the new chain should have aPoW, is there anything else we mentioned that we need to add to these chains?

[12-Dec-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
lets make it a EUR peg

[12-Dec-19 03:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I'm doing that - EURK

[12-Dec-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
other than -adaptivepow, i dont think any other changes from last time around

[12-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, just checking if I forgot something

[12-Dec-19 03:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
EURK, in french, makes think of "BEURK"...

@jl777c The plan for txfees is to set to all cc transactions that we use in pegs and side chains (oracles, gateways, tokens, pegs ...) txfee to 0. And then I will add to miner code priority with flat multiplier. The question is should I give that high priority only to CC txs or to all txs on that chain? (I think only to those CC txs)

[12-Dec-19 04:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, weird thing. I started the chain with same ac parameters on 2 nodes and got different magic number and port...

[12-Dec-19 04:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahhh, never mind. Error in copy paste

[12-Dec-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
high priority only for the special tx, other tx should just default to normal mechanism

[12-Dec-19 04:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I thought so. And another thing is we should branch the txfee somehow. If I put in code 0 txfee then on all chains for Oracles fro example it will be 0 txfee. Maybe we can add it as parameter on launch, and for certain CCs check if parameter is set and set txfee to that value, if not then default 10k txfee.

[12-Dec-19 04:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL As I changed format for oracles with gateways to `IhhL` can you change it in TUI so oracles can be created with TUI for gateways?

[12-Dec-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Sure, will do üëç

@jl777c I got AC node to exit, but not sure exact cause:

[12-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think it could be bacuse there are small chain forks as both nodes are mining with cpu with one thread and some times there are chain splits but when longer chain happens it one node switches to main chain, and maybe then this happens...

[12-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Not sure.

[12-Dec-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea. seems some malformed tx

[12-Dec-19 06:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm thinking about oracles tx from oraclefeed for block data

[12-Dec-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool transaction missing input" == 0

[12-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
What would happen if one node goes in other direction and when it switches to main chain, the transaction in mempool could be refering input that does not exist anymore.

[12-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
But those txs should be removed from mempool

[12-Dec-19 06:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
Also not sure why this: `ERROR: ContextualCheckBlock: block height mismatch in coinbase`

[12-Dec-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there does seem to be a bug where invalid tx are not purged from mempool

[12-Dec-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if it can be reproduced, you need to work backwards from the error

[12-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, the problem is that it happens sometimes. Not sure how to reproduce it...

[12-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
But looking now, it seems my chain splitted on block 26

[12-Dec-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
not a good idea to be mining on more than one node during the early blocks

[12-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Mihailo#5902
Aha, didn't know that. What is the reason? Whate changes after more blocks?

[12-Dec-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
before 100 blocks things are just very prone to forking

[12-Dec-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
probably due to the total chain work being so small, it can easily flip flop between two very different forks

[12-Dec-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i just always mine on a single node until it is in the 1000+ height to avoid such problems

[12-Dec-19 06:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
Aha, good. As I noticed that it forks often. Now I know üòâ
