[telegram] <Booboo222> Pretty new here.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I need to get my KMD off of Binance and am going to use the Magnum/Trezor method to store.  Anyone had experience with this?  Pros/cons?

[12-Dec-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Haven’t heard anything bad about magnum it is closed source though as I recall

[12-Dec-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> That combination is working great for me. (re @Booboo222: Pretty new here.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I need to get my KMD off of Binance and am going to use the Magnum/Trezor method to store.  Anyone had experience with this?  Pros/cons?)

[12-Dec-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> That's strange, I didn't leave and re-join the group. (re @You: )

[telegram] <bitgrinmw> Bought my first kmd earlier today. I got out of Arrr after the weekly meeting b/c I'm not cool with the OS on USB. As if crypto isn't hard enuf 🙄

[12-Dec-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> you mean Ghostship ? (re @bitgrinmw: Bought my first kmd earlier today. I got out of Arrr after the weekly meeting b/c I'm not cool with the OS on USB. As if crypto isn't hard enuf 🙄)

[12-Dec-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> You sold your ARRR because of Ghostship?
Don't get the sense of it.

[12-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ZaferGraph> Stop working and don't develop the project guys, it's not cool (re @Acura360: You sold your ARRR because of Ghostship?
Don't get the sense of it.)

[12-Dec-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Are you saying $4MM is too high? (re @bitgrinmw: It's not feasible except for hobby and not $4MM cap😝)

[12-Dec-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> Fair enough. I think it's low but okay

[12-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bitgrinmw> Perfect

[12-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But the OS is only one part of what they are doing, and isn't the entirety of it. But nvm I'm sure you did your research, I'm still a fan

[12-Dec-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bitgrinmw> Had better opp anyhow 🤗

[12-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea I mean, that is the nature of open source development/projects. People come along who like the project and they bring their skills and capabilities with them to try and help the project in the way they know best. 
I know Python so that's what I usually build stuff with. Some people are experts at Android dev, or iOS, or custom desktop OS. I don't hold it against an open source project if people come along and want to build something for it.
Not like Pirate is this massive business, or had a huge ICO and is spending frivolously

[12-Dec-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But you like what you like, it's your investment 🤗 (re @bitgrinmw: Had better opp anyhow 🤗)

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> i hope that the stable coin project from komodo comes fast, i yesterday put my DAIs on Oasis to see what is it about and i have to say that it should be taken as inspiration by komodo development staff, it is clean, it works but it would be so much better with KMD low fees and less risk of congestion, i want so hard that komodo wins this race.

[telegram] <t_dan> Pegs will be decentralized, meaning you put your own kmd as collateral.
