I'm assuming this trading fee, upon listing an offer for sale on the dex, is for full amount being sold. So, if a taker chooses to trade for say, only half the amount I have listed, this trading fee for this transaction would be half as well, right?
Also- It appears the transaction fee is based solely on the coin being sold by the maker and has nothing to do with what coin it is being paid for by the taker, correct?","",""

"419964976397156352","cipi#4502","05-Jan-20 03:09 AM","that also depends on the involved coins, not sure though
i think with BTC and BCH you have more time to get back online and ccontinue the swap
if the swap fails (timeouts or other error) and if funds were already been sent, they are refunded
the time also depends on the chains... here i am sure that it is that way, but not how long the times are exactly... 4h or something like that","",""
