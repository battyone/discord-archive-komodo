"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","05-Jan-20 11:05 AM","now any chain with -dexp2p=2 (or 1) will activate the decentralized DEX p2p messages
txpow is active at a minimal level, tx/sec of blasters will likely be reduced by 10x to 50x
packet priority is supported. each priority level doubles the txpow needed, dont go much above 16 and for now priority is not affecting routing, so can just set it to 0
3 indices in parallel are maintained in realtime for all packets with tags (or destpubkey)
DEX_broadcast now will actually broadcast the hex specified and takes a lot more parameters
DEX_list is able to get a list of all the packets with matching tags
plz dont abuse the messaging side yet, it is not hardened and limited to just 64 different tags for now. also, it will likely crash after an hour if you are making DEX_list requests that needs to get a packet being purged","",""
