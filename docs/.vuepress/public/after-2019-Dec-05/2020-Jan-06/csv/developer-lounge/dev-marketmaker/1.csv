looks like with AXE it takes longer then 50s for a tx to make it to the mempool of other nodes","",""

If all 3 attempts fail it will abort the swap with `...PaymentValidateFailed`  error. 50 seconds is too long for tx mempool propagation, seems like it's specific coin issue. We can wait a bit longer too, but I'm unsure if it's worth to make such fix for single coin when it works nice for 99.9% of the others.","",""
