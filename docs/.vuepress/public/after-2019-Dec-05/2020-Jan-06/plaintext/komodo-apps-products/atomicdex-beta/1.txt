question- when placing a trade on atomicdex, it looks like the transaction fee for a coin is not dependent on the amount traded, however the trading fee goes up in relation to amount listed. 
I'm assuming this trading fee, upon listing an offer for sale on the dex, is for full amount being sold. So, if a taker chooses to trade for say, only half the amount I have listed, this trading fee for this transaction would be half as well, right?
Also- It appears the transaction fee is based solely on the coin being sold by the maker and has nothing to do with what coin it is being paid for by the taker, correct?

@J.J. problem with AXE identified: for some reason AXE-transactions can take a very long time to propagate to the mempool of other nodes (AtomicDEX waited 50s then gave up)... problem "solved" by directly connecting the wallet of the maker node with the ones from the electrums... but this is more a AXE problem, then a AtomicDEX problem, txs should not take that long to make it into the mempool of other nodes

[05-Jan-20 02:59 AM] cipi#4502
@CiPhEr the transaction fee is the normal network fee for the involved chains and not dependent on the amount
trading fee (dexfee) is 1/777 of the takercoin amount (maker pays no dexfee)

[05-Jan-20 03:02 AM] cipi#4502
this also means: coins with high txfees (BTC, often ERC20) should be swapped in bigger amounts, else txfee can be a significant part of traded amount

[05-Jan-20 03:02 AM] dan.#2473
Will the min amount be raised for certain coins?

[05-Jan-20 03:04 AM] cipi#4502
the min. amount is now fixed at 0.00777 for all coins
but i would like to have the possibility to set it for each coin in part, so i made this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473

ok thanks cipi üôÇ

[05-Jan-20 03:07 AM] CiPhEr#2091
one other question- say my phone loses connection, how long do i have to get it back online and go back into adex if i am in the middle of a swap to have it complete?
and if i don't make it in time, the locked transaction goes back into my wallet at a certain time?

[05-Jan-20 03:09 AM] dan.#2473
Can I suggest at the very least having the option to disable in settings.

[05-Jan-20 03:09 AM] dan.#2473
The reason being is that in its current state atomicdex cannot be used for dust

[05-Jan-20 03:09 AM] cipi#4502
that also depends on the involved coins, not sure though
i think with BTC and BCH you have more time to get back online and ccontinue the swap
if the swap fails (timeouts or other error) and if funds were already been sent, they are refunded
the time also depends on the chains... here i am sure that it is that way, but not how long the times are exactly... 4h or something like that

[05-Jan-20 03:10 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ok thanks

[05-Jan-20 03:12 AM] cipi#4502
@dan. don't know how much sense it makes to send small amounts and pay a higher fee then the transferred amount... better "collect" the dust üôÇ

[05-Jan-20 03:13 AM] dan.#2473
Sure in the instances where it makes sense to. But in its current form of 0.00777 that isn't always the case depending on the crypto

[05-Jan-20 03:14 AM] dan.#2473
I know this is an edge case but it would likely increase usage a little bit if people could dust out their wallets with atomicdex

[05-Jan-20 03:14 AM] cipi#4502
sure, the fixed 0.00777 was/is just a quickfix and will be changed

[05-Jan-20 03:15 AM] dan.#2473
Alright. I get the safegaurd, but it would be good to see it changed

[05-Jan-20 03:15 AM] dan.#2473
Thanks for answering

[05-Jan-20 09:41 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
When we will see support of defi erc 20s like rlc,Zrx,knc,mkr and so on...in the AtomicDEX?

[05-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Think some of them already added to backend

[05-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Once they apply for lising on atomicdex they can be listed üôÇ

When I open AtomicDex the sound of metal coins never stops playing, I'm on Android

[05-Jan-20 10:28 AM] Acura#2748
click on settings and disable full sounds, then you can also mute the sound via Soundbutton on your phone @criptobear

[05-Jan-20 11:11 AM] looye29#2126
Any change you add CKB to DeX?

[05-Jan-20 12:50 PM] Oszy#5734
@looye29 
Adding it to marketmaker is free if it's compatible:
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/additional-information-about-atomicdex.html#add-your-coin-to-marketmaker-2-0

Adding it to mobile DeX has a listing fee, and you need to contact the team.

It would be great if the wallet actually told the user that this was the problem instead of telling to try later if a user wants to withdraw BTC to an Segwit Adress.

[05-Jan-20 03:44 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Imo it would be better if segwit was supported as it would be more compatible and potentially reduce fees for trading and deposit/withdrawal

[05-Jan-20 03:47 PM] PTYX#6840
I think the team will add segwit in the future

If you also add custom TX fees I think it could be a very competitive multi-coin mobile wallet as well as a Dex. Looking at Dexstats it seems btc/kmd has the most volume so it should be seriously considered

segwit already added to API and i tested it with a dozen of coins or so
every coin that has `"segwit": true` in the coin file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins
the next AtomicDEX-GUI release will have it too... just wait couple of days üòâ

you can also use custom fees with the API on withdraw... there are also some fee handling things WIP  so this will improve in the future... just have a look at the issues with the word "fee" in the name: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues

Excellent to hear that, thanks @cipi

[05-Jan-20 04:25 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So in the next update i can withdraw to segwit btc address from atomicDEX?

[05-Jan-20 04:36 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I mean: send it to another address (technically its now in a address i already have control of)

[05-Jan-20 04:44 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you will be able to withdraw BTC, LTC and so on from AtomicDEX to another segwit-address, e.g. on a CEX
like this one: https://blockchair.com/litecoin/transaction/da317a2165c6fb45cb3a7289b6c5f9e8fbcf66f6a508c7d39468e21206cd7962

Trying to withdraw TUSD and it shows "not a valid address", I have tried to several addresses with the same result.

[05-Jan-20 08:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Are you using mixed case?

[05-Jan-20 09:08 PM] marktyler#0324
@PTYX have an atomic dex issue, tried to make a swap with kmd. It timed out after an hour. Komodo never refunded back to me. Suggestions?

[05-Jan-20 10:28 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not entirely sure how to fix failed swaps if the kmd wasn't returned. Do you have a transaction ID? @marktyler

[05-Jan-20 10:46 PM] cipi#4502
there are no infos about this swap uuid on the seed nodes
you need to look in the logfiles on your device
are you sure that anything was sent?
dexfee is not refunded, only MakerPayment and TakerPayment
you can now lookup the errors that happened with a swap with this link: http://dexapi.cipig.net:8080/public/error.php?uuid=c65d9539-11ec-4d35-8d02-eb3f3ed2aa52 (if there is anything on the seed nodes)

[05-Jan-20 11:18 PM] smk762#7640
@Ignacio Figueroa (TheWalk_er)  to get the checksummed version of your erc20 address, search for it at https://etherscan.io/
then copy what is returned.
e.g. if you search for `0x331953f1fd954af6c162a3243809337fd938272d` it will display as  `0x331953F1fD954AF6c162A3243809337fd938272D`
