[telegram] <John> can I buy crypto on atomicdex from a specific user directly? without going through order book ? In other words, if my friend wants to sell me crypto can we both trade with each other directly ?

[05-Jan-20 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> If it's your friend you could just send to each other directly.

[05-Jan-20 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t_dan> If your friend creates an order on AD for you, anyone could immediately take it ahead of you.

Great Info from our DevÂ´s from Discord: segwit already added to API and i tested it with a dozen of coins or so - every coin that has "segwit": true in the coin file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins
the next AtomicDEX-GUI release will have it too... just wait couple of days

[05-Jan-20 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nobody knows, anyone who says different is selling something (re @Giotti96: Price in the next days ? Ahaha)
