backtrace for crashes, otherwise cant do much

[05-Jan-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
my testnet did 120 millionm sustained 3k+/sec and all nodes are in sync

"reject packet from future" outputs?

[05-Jan-20 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
very strict system clock sync required. ntp node

@jl777c could this new tech be used to make  CHIPS networking/communication more reliable?

[05-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt a lossless protocol, but if a reliability layer is added on top of it, maybe it can. also there isnt a large amount of privacy with the dexp2p, so it would need to be carefully analyzed to see if point to point encryption will be sufficient

[05-Jan-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i made a new release, it is hardforking

[05-Jan-20 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
now any chain with -dexp2p=2 (or 1) will activate the decentralized DEX p2p messages
txpow is active at a minimal level, tx/sec of blasters will likely be reduced by 10x to 50x
packet priority is supported. each priority level doubles the txpow needed, dont go much above 16 and for now priority is not affecting routing, so can just set it to 0
3 indices in parallel are maintained in realtime for all packets with tags (or destpubkey)
DEX_broadcast now will actually broadcast the hex specified and takes a lot more parameters
DEX_list is able to get a list of all the packets with matching tags
plz dont abuse the messaging side yet, it is not hardened and limited to just 64 different tags for now. also, it will likely crash after an hour if you are making DEX_list requests that needs to get a packet being purged

[05-Jan-20 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
destpubkey encryption and min/max amount filtering in DEX_list is not implemented yet, nor is minpriority filtering. DEX_stats and DEX_get is not implemented yet

[05-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
however, enough should be work to be able to broadcast a specific message with a specific tag and then see it in a list

[05-Jan-20 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
for example if tagA is KMD and tagB is BTC, then the packet will be in the indices for "KMD", "BTC" and "KMD/BTC". that will allow future DEX_list for BTC to find this along with any other that had BTC as tagA or tagB. if you DEX_list with both KMD and BTC, only the ones that match the order will be returned. so to get an orderbook, you can do a DEX_list KMD BTC and a DEX_list BTC KMD and construct it. however, i plan to add convenient orderbook functions as each packet also has volumeA and volumeB fields that can be used to calculate a price

[05-Jan-20 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i was just able to get this to work in a few cases and havent had a chance to find and fix all bugs, but too tired now and will wait for bug reports based on the above functionality

[05-Jan-20 11:14 AM] looye29#2126
Can orrderbook be filled by multiple targets? E.g. Alice has 1000 KMD and Bob can only fill 500 KMD can Stanley  take the other 500 KMD?

[05-Jan-20 11:16 AM] looye29#2126
Now in explaining of Atomic DEX it talks only about Alice and Bob swap.

[05-Jan-20 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure that is already implemented

[05-Jan-20 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p is for a decentralized and fast way to get orders to all nodes, it does not deal with using that data, that is up to the app

[05-Jan-20 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
with the messaging layer it should make it quite easy to write dapps that want to deal with any sort of messaging that fits into the tagA/tagB, destpubkey, volumeA volumeB framework

[05-Jan-20 01:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Had to leave town....it seems easily reproducable..

[05-Jan-20 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be anymore. there are known problems after one hour, for now only crashes in the first hour are of interest

[05-Jan-20 03:06 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok... the crash seems daemon related...I will run daemon only and backtrace when it jumps down from 2000 kb to 150....I dont have my glasses with me to read your posts....I'll tey at my next stop

[05-Jan-20 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what else could crash, the deamon is the only thing running

[05-Jan-20 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
when i say "there are known problems after one hour" that means i know of things that can cause crashes after an hour, only crashes before one hour purges start are of interest until i fix the known bug

[05-Jan-20 03:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Well yeah but...didn't know if blaster caused daemon to overload or if it did it by itself....I understand

[05-Jan-20 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
daemon is designed to not overload

[05-Jan-20 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
well, if you start blasting 4MB packets, it would make nodes run out of memory

[05-Jan-20 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but based on tx count, it will drop packets, to avoid overload

[05-Jan-20 03:51 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Yes it did do that without blaster running....which confused me....like its exchanging data without blaster...It did not "crash" but was running poorly at the suspected 1 hour mark "ish" was going to scientifically get correct data on my next tests.....computer only froze with blastee....70 MPH statements are not my forte

[05-Jan-20 03:56 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
4.5 GB of mem was consumed before the 1hr mark and without blaster

[05-Jan-20 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
with no transactions being sent at all?

[05-Jan-20 03:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Blaster tached my up to 4.9

[05-Jan-20 03:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Yes..  I got confused

[05-Jan-20 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if nothing is being blasted, the nodes mem use should be minimal other than the half gig overhead

[05-Jan-20 03:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Wondering why

[05-Jan-20 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if any node is blasting, all nodes will see 99.999% the same packets

[05-Jan-20 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and have mem use about the same

[05-Jan-20 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
what are you wondering about

[05-Jan-20 03:58 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I know....I rest and retested

[05-Jan-20 03:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
how can we tell if nodes are staying in sync?

[05-Jan-20 03:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Why mem was being chewed up

[05-Jan-20 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have created 4 nodes and blasted them all for a bit and they all seem to drift

[05-Jan-20 03:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I had to leave this morning with no answer

[05-Jan-20 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you blast at a higher rate than the network can handle, PACKETS WILL BE DROPPED

[05-Jan-20 04:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Next test was/will be no blaster for 1 hour then backtrace

[05-Jan-20 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and sync will be lost

[05-Jan-20 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are below the critical rate, then i am seeing very very few packets out of sync

[05-Jan-20 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
on the order of 1 in a millon

[05-Jan-20 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you can check the summary hashes for the totals to see if it is in sync or not (when there are no new packets coming in)

[05-Jan-20 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
with the messaging level, it should be possible to packetize files, blast it and then reconstruct it and see if they are the same

[05-Jan-20 04:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
If no update in 8 hours I will see what I can do

[05-Jan-20 04:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
1GB memory munching loop every 15minutes shouldn't be that hard to replicate....I'm 8 hours out

[05-Jan-20 04:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It wasn't there on Friday ....pretty sure
