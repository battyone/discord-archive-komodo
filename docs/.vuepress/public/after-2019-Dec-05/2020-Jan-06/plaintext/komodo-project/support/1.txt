@SHossain  I'm trying to send ZEC from the VerusAgama wallet (0.6.0-8) which generates an error message: "can't broadcast transaction" Debug Info reads: {"code". 1 "the transaction was rejected by network rules. \n\n16: mandatory-script-verity-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty topo stack element)\n[ then a zillion characters-long script which is in a code of sorts (those were my words)].   I'm running in Lite Mode.  This persists whether I'm sinding .5 ZEC or 2 dozen. Switching SPV Electrum servers yields the same error message.  Would the recent Komodo network upgrade have affected this?  Thanks!

@Acura thanks for the reply, but it unfortunately generates the same error message with v0.6.1

cipi in Verus discord:
> ZEC had the Blossom network upgrade, which changed some stuff
> AtomicDEX needed to make this change: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/commit/546426b2aad359eadd8924f3669f885d5808b5c1
> i guess the same is needed for Agama
> the error before the fix in AtomicDEX was the same `the transaction was rejected by network rules. \n\n16: mandatory-script-verity-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty topo stack element)`

Wallet devs are aware of this

[05-Jan-20 07:15 PM] Micah68#5652
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 Thanks for checking into this; as you can see I also went to the Agama wallet folks. I see you are in both spots - you're everywhere!! (that's a good thing).  I went to that github link and it doesn't look like it's anything I am able to do. I'll hold tight and test the Agama wallet periodically.

[05-Jan-20 07:43 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
There's nothing you can do, that's why I made our devs aware of this info cipi supplied, although I'm convinced they would have seen it just as fast anyway.

[05-Jan-20 07:51 PM] Micah68#5652
Thanks!

have an atomic dex issue, tried to make a swap with kmd. It timed out after an hour. Komodo never refunded back to me. Suggestions?
