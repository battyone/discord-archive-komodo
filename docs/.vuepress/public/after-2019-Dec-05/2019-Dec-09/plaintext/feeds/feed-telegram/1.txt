[08-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> If it is smartchain of kmd then there is no such information in hush official web site, or I did not see it

[08-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> there is only written secured by dpow in their site.

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> So, it says hush has its own blockchain. (re @Acura360: )

[08-Dec-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> it does not mean that hush is a smart chain

[08-Dec-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> but in komodo web site written as hush is a smartchain of komodo

[08-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Every chain in Komodo ecosystem is it's own chain. Smart chains are their own chains and not dependent on Komodo or KMD. They share a codebase, generally referred to as a "runtime fork". This means they have different blockchains but maintain a level of interoperability where advances on Hush can be pushed to Komodo, and vice versa. They also use dPoW which secures their chain with hashed "notarizations" to Komodo and Bitcoin (re @Ggokhangark: So, it says hush has its own blockchain.)

[08-Dec-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> thank you, now all is understandable. (re @Regnar: Every chain in Komodo ecosystem is it's own chain. Smart chains are their own chains and not dependent on Komodo or KMD.

[08-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's important to understand that because it is a main difference we have with other platform like chains.
Ethereum: all tokens are on Ethereum chain, need to use ETH for gas, token nodes need to validate all other tokens and ETH (GB/s just to stay synced), restricted to the capability of ETH (TX/s, updates, etc) the whims of ETH developers/forks. 
But they benefit by having an ecosystem of wallets, block explorers, and miners, can use a "DEX" between ERC20 tokens. They are generally safe from 51% attacks because they rely on ETH, but aren't safe because Ethereum has a history of reversing transactions they find unfavorable (ETC). And worse of all (though many see it as a price benefit for ETH) is all tokens need to use ETH as Gas, which means a single project like crypto kitties can stall the whole network and destroy your project, or just outright make it too expensive to send money. (re @Ggokhangark: thank you, now all is understandable.)

[08-Dec-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo: all coins have their own blockchains, use their own coins for TX fees, nodes only have to validate their own chain (helps decentralization, most of ETH nodes are on cloud services!!!) And you are NOT at the whims of Komodo developers. You can runtime fork the Komodo daemon and adopt or reject any technology or capability Komodo (or other smart chains) develops (oracles, tokens, channels, etc). So you benefit from the ecosystem of developers. We have multicoin wallets, true atomic swap DEXs, plug and play modules that do things Ethereum cant do, extra privacy features, quantum resistance, we can provide your own block explorer, you can customize your mining rewards/decay/premine if you want it, and your chain can use dPoW to protect against 51% attacks.

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> Anyways today I understood finally what the heck are these liquidity pools and what is a relay, in few words they have shared liquidity and in anyway solved part of the liquidity problem for tokens but they don't have the cross-chain power of Komodo that will make it the winner in the long run, the simplicity is something they lack too
