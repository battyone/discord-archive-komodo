If at any point you find a bug during this test, and you feel it's bounty worthy, let me know, and I will walk you through the claim process. No bounties will be paid out until the end of the test. Likely 2-3 days after conclusion to give me time to verify results

[08-Dec-19 02:21 PM] Alright#0419
search broken, code snippets broken

[08-Dec-19 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
i NEVER had the ability in these channels

[08-Dec-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
does look like a fork, should fix itself

[08-Dec-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419

all mnine!

[08-Dec-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
utxo eligibility time is much lower the sooner you split

[08-Dec-19 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
either i forked or they all gonna be mine

[08-Dec-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Dec-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
I made ac_reward 1 coin so they aren't eligible to stake btw 😉

[08-Dec-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah that sucks

[08-Dec-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i should pukey mine?

[08-Dec-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
coinbase utxo won't stake unless you use splitperc 😛

[08-Dec-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
Plaese see pinned messages :troll:

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i should add -splitperc=100 to put the whole 1 coin into the staked utxo?

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
ok

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`coinbase utxo won't stake unless you use splitperc`
what dumbass thought that up? and why?

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
let's say you staked with a 10 coin UTXO, with splitperc 100, the coinbase will make a single 11 coin utxo

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
make sense?

[08-Dec-19 02:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes

[08-Dec-19 02:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats whay I thought ty

[08-Dec-19 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 to force you to test splitperc

[08-Dec-19 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
the entire point of this comp

[08-Dec-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽‍♂️

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm going to be late to get started, not running new things until power co can assure me no more outages

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
please don't intentionally reorg this chain, act as if it has dpow 😅

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
hour or two

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
someone just stole 21 blocks, please don't do any more

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"stole"?

[08-Dec-19 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
can't stop you I guess, but you shouldn't be able to do that if this had gone smoothly

[08-Dec-19 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
someone (seemingly) just intentionally reorged 21 blocks

[08-Dec-19 02:31 PM] Oszy#5734
i have no idea how to do that so it's not me 😄

[08-Dec-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes for food and doesn't ask what you feked up so bad that PoS gets reorged by 21 blocks_

[08-Dec-19 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
ummm

[08-Dec-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
looks fine to me... block 162

[08-Dec-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
163

[08-Dec-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
did you add this coin to the StakedNotary assetchains file in the repo?

[08-Dec-19 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
or do I need to add it manually?

[08-Dec-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
working on easiest solution

[08-Dec-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
will need to be manual

[08-Dec-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`easiest solution`:
slap it in the json and go on

[08-Dec-19 02:35 PM] daemonfox#6136

[08-Dec-19 02:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
i didnt see a reorg...

[08-Dec-19 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
means you did it 😛

[08-Dec-19 02:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I added splitperc=100 and restarted

[08-Dec-19 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
there were 3 total

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
well... I did nothing but ./start.sh with the params I added

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
won't work, just hang out for a minute please

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Oszy#5734
my daemon says I mine every block but I don't hash on explorer is different

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
adding manually to my NN now, will give instructions in a moment

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
what does p2pport in getinfo show @Oszy

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my daemon says I mine every block but I don't hash on explorer is different`
that means you're on a fork

[08-Dec-19 02:36 PM] Oszy#5734
"p2pport": 53609,

[08-Dec-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419

resynced still not matching

[08-Dec-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
didn't we agree, like forever ago, that many peers before 210 blocks was a bad idea?

[08-Dec-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or is my memory completely shot?

[08-Dec-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe because its 90% staked the daemon is confused and canot find the best work chain

[08-Dec-19 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
100

[08-Dec-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181

I've done 99 pos on older code with OE, but I was generally the only one running those chains

[08-Dec-19 02:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no more than half a dozen nodes at most

[08-Dec-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
remind me again, why we agreed that 100% and 10% or less were awful ideas.....
