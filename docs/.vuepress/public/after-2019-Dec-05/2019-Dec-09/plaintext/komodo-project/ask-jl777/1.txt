is it possible to join komodo as a dev with 1.5kusd monthly salary and a postgraduate degree in mechatronics with focus on embedded systems? your main website has only senior c++, what about young talents?

if you have no blockchain experience, then maybe you can start as a tester. contact tonyL for a testing position
