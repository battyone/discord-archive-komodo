Yeah with debt ratio at only 10%, needing it to be >50% to self liquidate seems to be a little against the intention of the depositor/hodler.

Eg 1000KMD, withdraw 180USDK.
KMD moons to $1.80, the 180USDK represents 10% of the mooning initial deposit.
To close account / self liquidate, the >50% debt ratio to enable this would mean withdrawing  further USDK (720), to take debt to 900USDK.  Self liquidate giving back 500KMD.

Maybe if self liquidate is <50% debt ratio, a 0.5% fee is reasonable for this type of line of credit?

Maybe too high, depending on length of time the funds were locked up.  If longer than a month, 0% fee, because reward could be claimed by network/pegfund.

you have it backwards

[08-Dec-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
equity > 50% -> debt < 50%

as soon as the mooning price reduces the debt ratio below 50%, you would be able to close the account and extract the net balance

@Mylo this is in case you have no more coins (you spent them on something). If you have coins you can always cover your debt and take the deposit. This case is when you have lost the coins but you account is not in big debt so you close your account and get the rest of KMD that is rest fro covering your debt. The question is should it there be a penalty as with this action you can influence the global ratio of pegs and maybe put it in liquidation zone

maybe just require that globally it wont be in the liquidation zone, if it is, then close account needs to wait
