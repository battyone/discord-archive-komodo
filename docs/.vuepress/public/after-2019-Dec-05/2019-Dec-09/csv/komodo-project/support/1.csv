1. After setting up a wallet and restarting the app, on the welcome screen there is no option to log into the created and saved wallet. Instead, the app assumes you want to start from scratch and asks you to select/activate a coin to create a new wallet or to import a seed, both of which I don't want.
2. Why is the DEX coin not in the initial list even though it is available only later when you add other coins to an existing wallet?
3. When setting up a wallet that only consists of the DEX coin and you only hold DEX on that address, after logging in you don't see the DEX coin listed, instead you see KMD with 0 balance listed. Then you have to add the DEX coin again to enable it. This is something you definitely do not want to repeat after every login.
4. On the welcome screen, when I select ""Pirate Chain"", a red error box appears immediately at the right bottom saying something like ""Komodod Zcash params are missing or incomplete: ..."", even thought I haven't even started. Furthermore, I'm asked to choose between three non self-explanatory ""Zcash params keys"" before you can go on.
Even though the wallet seems quite hyped and recommended, I see some serious UX flaws and shortcomings.";"";"";
