All website hosted with @Github Pages are a vector for clickjacking and subdomain take-over. $MSFT/Github must add features to prevent this, users have no options and tens of thousands of websites are vulnerable.

1) Make a new Github Pages repo with CNAME of a subdomain you want to own.
2) Use Github to impersonate and break the entire DNS system
3) Be evil

For the love of baby buddha's bunghole, @githubsecurity please fix...

Metadata is the gift that keeps on giving.
