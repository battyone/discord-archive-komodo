two sentences on that PR to explain context could have saved us days of pain

[10-Dec-19 07:38 PM] phm87#7395
I agree. I hope better commit titles. Now, I need to read the change to understand what it is sbout

[10-Dec-19 07:39 PM] phm87#7395
Good documentation of PR helps to create docs but it is also a kind of marketing. I will add more comments on hithub
