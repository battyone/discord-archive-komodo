I dont know tbh. I got pretty far with LabsNotary, but I wouldnt use it yet.

[10-Dec-19 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There were outstanding bugs with the bash/py spagetti that were so hard to fix I had to almost rewrite it. Alright kept saying he was porting the entire thing to python, so I left it as it mostly worked. 
Kind of annoying when you have 1 week to get something working and slap it together and then start building on top  of that...

That is a GREAT idea.

[10-Dec-19 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt orginise anything here because there were NO clear instructions.

[10-Dec-19 12:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope to recify that in the future, clearly I cannot do everything myself though...

[10-Dec-19 12:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Too many things at once leads to mistakes

[10-Dec-19 01:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
Then it shall be done. I will draft somethin gup and we ALL can pick it to death until satisfied, then for good measure, ratify it with a vote maybe?

For something like implementing a suggested template shouldn't need a vote.

[10-Dec-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes agreed. Its pretty simple and definatly required.

[10-Dec-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

CFEKPOS1 I have a fix for, but later on. 
I know that my repo LabsNotary is working for me.. But as I see most nodes connected to me, the StakedNotary repo should also be ok... or nobody updated it :abusedsmily:

just dont... if it doesnt work wait until I finish it.. wont be taht many days.

[10-Dec-19 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LabsNotary does require a fresh clone.. but is just mv config.ini and 3 scripts and you are away. Very easy.

[10-Dec-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will needd to test a VM with no deps though to verify this is actually right

If I  staked a buch of fake LABS coins on a fork ...does this mean my wallet is screwed?

[10-Dec-19 04:26 PM] gcharang#6833
rescanning the wallet once you are on the correct chain should fix any issues

[10-Dec-19 04:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
having extreme difficulties getting on the right chain...I though I had it --but nope

[10-Dec-19 04:27 PM] gcharang#6833
as a last resort, stop staking and reindex the chain

[10-Dec-19 04:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I reindexed 3 times now

[10-Dec-19 04:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
think  I will try without the  wallet.dat file

[10-Dec-19 04:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
seems like the only thing I havent tried

[10-Dec-19 04:29 PM] Oszy#5734
are u 100% sure you are on a fork?

use dumpwallet
<https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/wallet.html#dumpwallet>
and save the file
then delete ~/.komodo/LABS

then make sure you are on the correct branch and repo
then start the chain

let it sync

[10-Dec-19 04:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok

[10-Dec-19 04:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Wait

[10-Dec-19 04:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
LABS isn't 100% pos

[10-Dec-19 04:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
So how the fuck???

[10-Dec-19 05:11 PM] phm87#7395
Labs is 51% pos 49% pow if my memory is correct

[10-Dec-19 05:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and  to import that dumped wallet file  I use  what command?

didnt scroll down that far  --- thanks  ---  looks like  I am good  to go  now  - but  I  wonder how  my wallet file got  jacked up

[10-Dec-19 05:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
CFEKPOS64 maybe??

[10-Dec-19 05:41 PM] gcharang#6833
CFEKPOS64  can't affect the  wallet.dat of a different chain

[10-Dec-19 05:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah  --  then  maybe  switching to differnt  komodod and/or possibly  running 2 staking chains at same time

[10-Dec-19 05:43 PM] gcharang#6833
> switching to differnt  komodod
yes, this can theoretically cause wallet.dat corruption

[10-Dec-19 05:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok -  where  is the  code that  can stop  this  corruption from  happening? seems like something could be done to prevent this pretty easily --  not  too many people would make this  mistake though

[10-Dec-19 06:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems straight forward...

[10-Dec-19 06:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
you updated komodod at some point... it didnt like LABS and forked... left your wallet all fucked... no amount of starting it with the correct daemon seemed to fix the extra fork blocks in your wallet... hence it reporting 100% PoS

[10-Dec-19 06:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
and wouldnt allow you back on the correct chain

[10-Dec-19 06:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
even after a resync... yout wallet was still full of bullshit... and dumping the keys was the only thing you could do to salvage it

[10-Dec-19 06:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
and import on proper chain

[10-Dec-19 06:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
that right there is what I believe Alright feared the code would do... fuck all existing POS chains

[10-Dec-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
no

[10-Dec-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
sorry what do you mean by "the code"?

[10-Dec-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
maybe misunderstood you

[10-Dec-19 06:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
Why we stopped the competition

[10-Dec-19 06:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
at w/eheight the algo change would kick in would do what we saw CFEKPOS64 doing

[10-Dec-19 06:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
but on the other POS chains

[10-Dec-19 06:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
It sounds like kmdkrazy ran his LABS staking on the same code as the CFEKPOS64 test daemon

[10-Dec-19 06:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yes

[10-Dec-19 06:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i  did

[10-Dec-19 06:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
thought it was anenhancement

[10-Dec-19 06:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
once he forked... all it saw was POS blocks he mined

[10-Dec-19 06:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
hence the 100% vs 51% message

[10-Dec-19 06:49 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

it  "appeared" to sync  fine until i staked

[10-Dec-19 06:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
tried to resync and stake 1000 ways until wallet.dat file  was the  only thing I didnt change...I  now have correct peers thanks to  CG and  a clean wallet  thanks to GC - I can officially look away from my  computer again ---laterz

not sure why wallet file would hold such corrupt data--- but that is above my pay grade --- seriously going back to  real job

[10-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
I was able to figure out the context of joker's suspect commits. It's not what it seemed.
