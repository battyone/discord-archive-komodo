The real dominance after adjusting for all the fake alt volumes (and marketcaps) is probably already close to 90

A few more thoughts on HEX
I have been around crypto since 2013, I was fortunate to see BCNext's NXT thread early and was a small part of the 73 person ICO. I am seeing a lot of similarities with how people are responding to HEX, with NXT a lot of people focused on the massive ICO gains , and just yelled 'scam' at NXT for years and years, they couldn't separate the ICO gains from the NXT tech. In retrospect this was an error, the next ICO gains were huge, but the NXT tech was unique and something well worth exploring.

With HEX I am observing something similar, people who focus solely on the AA ETH and origin  address HEX can only see a scam, but those who are focusing on the smart contract mechanics see something new and potentially game changing for the evolution of crypto. In early 2014 the famous NXT mega thread took off on bitcointalk with 20-40 New pages every day for months, people who focused on the ideas behind NXT were incredibly excited, and people who focused on the ICO gains of the 73 yelled scam. That's where NEM came from, it's founder UtopianFuture, could appreciate the NXT ideas and tech were amazing, but he finally succumbed to  the ICO gains scam mentality,  and started NEM. I think something similar will happen with HEX. 

I am observing the HEX telegram groups, and crypto Twitter and YouTube debates, and they remind me of early NXT very much. Ultimately NXT NEM and everything that came after had little to do with NXT creator CfB, and I think the same will happen with RH and HEX after the 350 days of AA is finished. RH might end up in prison, or he might refund the ETH,  or donate it to charity, or use the funds to support HEX,  but HEX will keep going no matter what RH does, and there will be clones and copycats.

I predict HEX will be a crypto phenomenon in 2020, and well worth watching, I hope komodo at least claims the free airdrop, and if there is potential for a komodo version I hope it happens.

Crypto. The stuff of dreams and nightmares. $MATIC was up 180% in two weeks before crashing 70% in an hour.

looks like somebody big cashed out of a dozen+ alts at the same time.

[10-Dec-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
including 20 BTC worth of KMD

[10-Dec-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
seems something is imminent with BTC. not sure if the idea is that BTC is going up a lot, or down a lot as BTC also went up and dropped during the same time.

```....January 18, 2020 is likely when Bitcoin will lurch forward towards surmounting¬†new ATHs¬†to be achieved¬†before¬†the May 2020 halving event....
......it will also¬†suddenly¬†raise the¬†Bitcoin Market Cap Dominance¬†to¬†~99+%......
.....Proof-of-work altcoins

Thusly Bitcoin‚Äôs mining hashrate will be at least two orders-of-magnitude greater than any altcoin‚Äôs. Thus¬†rented 50+% hashrate attacks¬†will become trivially easy against¬†all¬†altcoins not just the¬†numerous weaker ones which have already been 50+% attacked.

The¬†cost of¬†Komodo‚Äôs¬†Delayed Proof-of-work¬†(dPoW) might become prohibitive.

I feel bad about that, because the idea for dPoW¬†originated from me¬†in private discussions with¬†@jl777, although I always thought it to be only a stopgap measure while researching for a better solution.....```

On-chain momentum is crossing into bullish. Prep for halvening front running here on in. Can't say what this indicator is, as it's proprietary to @AdaptiveFund, but it tracks investor momentum. The bottom is mostly likely in, anything lower will be just a wick in the macro...

The big sell off from Matic resulted in a cascade which can be seen across the pairs.

Right now the narrative behind the sell-off is that seed investors / advisers dumped a bunch triggering SL's resulting in this enormous dump.
Matic responds to the situation in this blog :
https://blog.matic.network/foundation-token-movement-accounting/

Note how they state that the 'amount' was wrong, not that they did not sell.
1 ) In the article they admit they were transferring the tokens towards Binance during the unlock schedule.
2 ) The amount that they transferred is roughly equal to the amount that was used during the first sells.

Fishy if you ask me.

The 300m coins were apparently announced to be sold earlier, so its not like they were hiding it

There was a snapshot for airdrop yesterday, so to me it was a clear pump and dump kind of thing

[10-Dec-19 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Countdown to snapshot block for flint airdrop

[10-Dec-19 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Dump right before or after the snapshot happened

what i dont understand is how something can triple in price for an airdrop of something. was what they got from the airdrop worth double MATIC?

[10-Dec-19 10:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
only the ones silly enough to buy in to get it are left holding the bag

[10-Dec-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what i dont understand is why so many other coins sold off significantly at the same time

[10-Dec-19 10:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
bots is probably the answer

[10-Dec-19 10:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I wonder if binance has a trading desk for alts

[10-Dec-19 10:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586

@jl777c if there was a way to plot a time scale with all the alts on binance on it

[10-Dec-19 10:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would be a interesting graph

[10-Dec-19 10:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can compare charts in tradingview

[10-Dec-19 10:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You can plot all alts on the same graph?

[10-Dec-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[10-Dec-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It might get messy if you dont scale correctly, but yes, you can compare charts

[10-Dec-19 10:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh nice, need someone that has some time to overlay the graphs and see how it looks
