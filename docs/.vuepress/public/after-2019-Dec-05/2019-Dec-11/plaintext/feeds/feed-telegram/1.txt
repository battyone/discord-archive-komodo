[10-Dec-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Alright let me try to ask a legit question. 
Which "big" projects (in terms of market cap or hype) would work better if they were in the Komodo ecosystem? 
For example, why or why not was it a good idea to for Binance to build on tendermint / cosmos rather than a kmododo chain? 
Or, how would the synthetix project work on Komodo vs Ethereum? 
Or, HEX is probably a pretty terrible project. But if you were Richard Heart, why or why not would you have built it inside Komodo?
My question isn't about those three projects in particular. If you have ever looked into a project and thought "they should do that on komodo" then please explain why. And maybe why you think they didn't use Komodo although they should have

Von den echten DEX werden nur jene √ºberleben, bei denen die Erschaffer v√∂llig anonym und nicht greifbar sind. Alle anderen werden sie so derma√üen unter Druck setzen bis die entweder Full-KYC gehen oder gleich dichtmachen, siehe #CryptoBridge.

[10-Dec-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> I'm not asking about those projects specifically. 
They might not be good examples.  
But certainly there must be other examples of projects that are not using Komodo tech, but which should be. (re @iqly_almond: Because komod never talk to those project ü§î)

[10-Dec-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <iqly_almond> Bc no partnership (re @Craig: I'm not asking about those projects specifically. 
They might not be good examples.  
But certainly there must be other examples of projects that are not using Komodo tech, but which should be.)

[10-Dec-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> A) why no partnership? What does cosmos have that Komodo doesn't have? If Komodo tech is better why don't partners come to us? Is this naive?
B) HEX isn't a partner with Ethereum. SNX isn't partner with Ethereum as far as I know.
 Maybe bad examples, but is my question clear?

[10-Dec-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Objectively, if you're a project on ethereum and your token purpose relies on usage/transactions, you shouldn't be on Ethereum (re @Craig: I'm not asking about those projects specifically. 
They might not be good examples.  
But certainly there must be other examples of projects that are not using Komodo tech, but which should be.)

[10-Dec-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That's just a huge risk to a project if another crypto kitties comes along and skyrockets gas prices

[10-Dec-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> So why do these projects not understand this objective fact?
Everyone saw crypto kitties, it was not an obscure risk

[10-Dec-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> I mean anyone can see that Ethereum network could be clogged again. But they still build new stuff  there. 
Because partnerships?
When do you think Komodo will be recognized as a top competitor to ethereum? 
Maybe when the DEX seed adoption, or after another crypto kitties incident?

[telegram] <Craig> "Komodo doesn't have the fanciest marketing, and our team doesn't schmooze with Justin sun or cut backroom deals. 
"So, realistically speaking, we can't partner with every flash in the pan project. 
"But here is what a project like __ is missing by building on ___ rather than Komodo. As you see, this project is limited by ____ but if they were with komodo they would have _ and __. 
"To be fair they might sacrifice a little ___ but that doesn't matter as much as you think because _____.
"In the future we expect similar projects to use Komodo because _____."

[10-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> I'm trying to fill the blanks

[10-Dec-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> You can also add
 "to be fair we already have cool projects and partners" 
But I'm still curious to fill in the blanks.
Forget binance.
"Raven coin has its own blockchain. But if you think about it, they would have been better off as a Komodo project because X Y Z.
"In fact I expect Raven is likely to be outcompeted by a Komodo module that will look like _ with advantages __."

[telegram] <Bilal> what's going on here

[10-Dec-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Namely the reason is because features and reference implementations are not complete yet.   Most people choose a platform like Eth to build on because of 1) they want to raise money and Eth is more liquid 2) They aren‚Äôt capable of running their own network.  ,  why this is a bad idea is lack of scalability,  a taxation model that will screw your business.  Re: Tendermint,   Why someone wants to use that namely is because of control ( dpos is pretty centralized ),  why it‚Äôs a bad choice is because zones offer little in the way of interoperability .
