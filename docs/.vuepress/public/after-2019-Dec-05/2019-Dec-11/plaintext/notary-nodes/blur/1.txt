@Biz

Lets ask him 🙂

[10-Dec-19 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
That’s a fake biz

[10-Dec-19 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
Not the real me

[10-Dec-19 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
We’ve got a team of great individuals managing the community now, so that I can focus on development

[10-Dec-19 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
Oh whoops, that was me

[10-Dec-19 08:34 PM] Biz#0842
I’m discussing with jl777 later today.

[10-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Biz#0842
Can say with certainty that nothing that comes from @Morningstar is of any value though

[10-Dec-19 08:38 PM] Biz#0842
Sorry, I should read things more closely. The bottom line is that notarizing directly to BTC is safer. So once I discuss with jl777, I’ll have better update. But we have people helping out on BLUR side now. Which means things will proceed. Without help, blur couldn’t proceed. That much has not changed. What has changed is that we now have help.

[10-Dec-19 08:40 PM] Biz#0842
Hope that’s somewhat helpful. Since DPoW technically shortcuts nakamoto consensus, it needs done properly

[10-Dec-19 08:41 PM] Biz#0842
To be clear, the @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 post was me. The @phm87 post was not me

[10-Dec-19 08:42 PM] phm87#7395
Yeah sorry I copied wrong msg

[10-Dec-19 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
That’s okay. It’s been a confusing few days

[10-Dec-19 08:43 PM] Biz#0842
Can’t blame you there. I would have liked for the trajectory for decentralization to be smoother. But that timeline is a luxury we don’t have Im afraid

[10-Dec-19 08:43 PM] Biz#0842
Fortunately we have a great community that really stepped up

[10-Dec-19 09:04 PM] Morningstar#3399
You said in Blur discord that dpow won't happen with Komodo.
Sadly i can't post an image here.

[10-Dec-19 09:07 PM] Biz#0842
And as I said, I’m discussing that with jl777. I was told that BTC notarizations cost $10k/yr if  I recall correctly. That much is simply not true by my math

[10-Dec-19 09:07 PM] Biz#0842
So these things need discussed again

[10-Dec-19 09:08 PM] Biz#0842
If we can’t speak honestly we are just wasting each others’ time

[10-Dec-19 09:08 PM] Biz#0842
I mean that in the most constructive way possible

[10-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Biz#0842
@Morningstar I don’t see where questioning anyone’s role is constructive however

[10-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Biz#0842
So it would seem your role is merely inflammatory

[10-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Biz#0842
Not surprising coming from Lucifer, I guess

[10-Dec-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
It is possible to tweak some aspects of it to make it cheaper, but it still won't be cheap at all

[10-Dec-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
"some aspects" being the utxo amount, where it's sent, how often they are made

[10-Dec-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
lower the amount of min sigs also can save money
