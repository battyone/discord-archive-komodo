@brucefenton @dieguito @pwuille Could build your own chain & secure it with Bitcoin. I won't do a whole marketing pitch, but just let you check out the documentation for @KomodoPlatform. Oh it's open source so just launch some tests from CLI. If you want the marketing side...

Let me get some likes and retweets, considering he is talking about issuing securities on RSK and Liquid because their "relation to Bitcoin" without the limitations of Ethereum, it only seems logical to just issue on your own chain, secure it to Bitcoin and not be limited

[10-Dec-19 04:21 AM] Enkh D#1827
When will we have uniswap or kyber like liquidity provider in the komodo ecosystem. I for instance find it hard to buy verus coin even though it seems to be really good project.

[10-Dec-19 04:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Enkh D  after public release,  we are still in the beta testing phase.

[10-Dec-19 04:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
As testing goes forward more people will put in coins for liquidity as well.  Or you could coordinate with a seller and just use Atomicdex as the trustless mechanism for swapping

[10-Dec-19 04:26 AM] Enkh D#1827
When is the decentralized poker dapp launching? Will it still have its own token or use kmd instead?

[10-Dec-19 04:27 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I haven’t been following it but it will use Chips coin.

[10-Dec-19 04:28 AM] Enkh D#1827
Is komodo team launching stable coin? or is it one of the feature that is added to antara framework?

[10-Dec-19 04:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Cc pegs has been in development for some time.  A stablecoin is in development though  I’m not sure it’s accurate to say the team launched it

[10-Dec-19 04:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It will utilize Komodo tech and notaries .

[10-Dec-19 05:09 AM] Enkh D#1827
Will it launch along with the oracle solution? I read something about staking in the report - is it referring to 5 interest paid to kmd holders or some lock up functionality?

[10-Dec-19 05:33 AM] ѕℓιм#1031
64 I believe

[10-Dec-19 05:33 AM] Enkh D#1827
@ѕℓιм Thanks.

[10-Dec-19 05:33 AM] ѕℓιм#1031
yep

[10-Dec-19 05:48 AM] Enkh D#1827
Will stable coins be backed by kmd tokens or real fiat? Also, will oracle solution be blovkchain agnostic or only applicable to komodo like coins?

[10-Dec-19 05:49 AM] ѕℓιм#1031
I do not know those answers sorry, hopefully someone else can help!

[10-Dec-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
pegged coins are backed by crypto, the tech is agnostic to which coin, but the ones we setup will be backed by KMD. the oracles use the DTO, which is specific to komodod chains

Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

[10-Dec-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we also have aggregated oracles, which are not as secure but can still be useful if designed properly for cases where chain value exceeds whatever value the oracle affects

[10-Dec-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and also cases where just having the data available from a specific pubkey is enough

[10-Dec-19 05:56 AM] Enkh D#1827
@jl777c Thanks. What do you think will be the differentiating usecase for komodo in the years to come? Do you  think atomic dex will still be the main focus for the near future?

[10-Dec-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is just one of many aspects

[10-Dec-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the focus now as it is needed by other parts of the system

[10-Dec-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is in place and working stable at scale, then we wont need to spend so much manhours on it, yet it will be a very important part of the overall picture, especially with all the regulation that will hit the CEX and fake DEX projects

[10-Dec-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you are talking about usecase for KMD or for komodo tech

[10-Dec-19 06:02 AM] Enkh D#1827
I feel like kmd tokens have not found its true utility after all these amazing developments. Barterdex never caught on - And I am just worried that what if atomic dex does not also attract many users as well.

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!
I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform “why should anybody hodl KMD”. Implicit in the…

[10-Dec-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
since we dont like taxation schemes it must be the usage of KMD that comes indirectly from all the projects that use it creates. by having the ONLY no-tax platform, projects that care about costs have a strong incentive to use komodo

[10-Dec-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
creating an end user product is a lot of work and is very expensive, we do not have the resources to make all the different end user projects that could be built with komodo tech.

[10-Dec-19 06:08 AM] Enkh D#1827
Also why is the komodo team so perfectionist in terms of being decentralized? Do you not think you could have launched decentralized poker sooner  maybe if you could trade off some decentralization?

[10-Dec-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS is not being done by the komodo team

[10-Dec-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
as slow as the development has been, are there any other actually decentralized poker projects yet? even with millions of funds raised, they all seem to basically be centralized

[10-Dec-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and what is the point of doing it, if it is centralized

[10-Dec-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS is basically a community project and has done quite well considering that

[10-Dec-19 06:12 AM] Enkh D#1827
You are right I dont think there is any project that actually came up with the poker game that is ready to play.

[10-Dec-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
they are very close to having a working GUI using the decentralized logic

[10-Dec-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, if the entire komodo team focused on CHIPS, then it certainly would have been done sooner, but then it would be the CHIPS team at that point, which it isnt.

[10-Dec-19 06:13 AM] Mark81#4505
Komodo is focusing to create technology to projects that need it freely to build on it and are able to focus their own business front. It firstly very big thing that komodo team doesnt need to seek funding to keep developing. Business that want to utilize blockchain technology first should put that also on their radar.

[10-Dec-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
we make reference implementations for most things. with atomicDEX, it is a critical part of the overall system, so we made it ourselves

[10-Dec-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
for most other projects, they are certainly nice to have, but really we are not in the business of being in business. lets businesses make end user products and make their money

[10-Dec-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
as a mostly horizontal tech provider, we need to provide tech without competing with projects that use our tech

[10-Dec-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this isnt the optimal approach you will say. but to build out all areas would take many millions of dollars, which we never raised, so not an option

[10-Dec-19 06:17 AM] Enkh D#1827
Yup! I really respect your focus and dedication to the project.

[10-Dec-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
there are projects that raised hundeds of millions and then make some centralized "solution", which are not so hard to make and not so expensive to make. so they have a lot of funds available for marketing

[10-Dec-19 06:19 AM] Enkh D#1827
You are definitely right. I also feel like ethereum has so much momentum that Komodo did not get the attention it deserved

[10-Dec-19 06:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Komodo needs only its name recognized and its framework to be known.

[10-Dec-19 06:23 AM] Enkh D#1827
Komodo is absolutely better project than all the shitty projects that raised millions of dollars in 2017, but Komodo has always been better than them. Its just pity that komodo never received much attention like eos and cardano did even though komodo tech is better and has been ready to use for years.

[10-Dec-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it has held up quite well considering the onslaught of new projects onto CMC, other projects from around the same time, many are far from the top 50

[10-Dec-19 06:25 AM] Enkh D#1827
I think I will read the oracle piece and head to bed - Its good to know that you still are active and answer community questions like you did in slack a year ago. Merry Christmas!

[10-Dec-19 06:40 AM] Mark81#4505
Satoshi writed in his white paper that bitcoin as in protocol first implemention is money. After that how many new  api calls has implemented to bitcoin to support various business needs or are those there to support only its use case as money?
