I have been around crypto since 2013, I was fortunate to see BCNext's NXT thread early and was a small part of the 73 person ICO. I am seeing a lot of similarities with how people are responding to HEX, with NXT a lot of people focused on the massive ICO gains , and just yelled 'scam' at NXT for years and years, they couldn't separate the ICO gains from the NXT tech. In retrospect this was an error, the next ICO gains were huge, but the NXT tech was unique and something well worth exploring.

With HEX I am observing something similar, people who focus solely on the AA ETH and origin  address HEX can only see a scam, but those who are focusing on the smart contract mechanics see something new and potentially game changing for the evolution of crypto. In early 2014 the famous NXT mega thread took off on bitcointalk with 20-40 New pages every day for months, people who focused on the ideas behind NXT were incredibly excited, and people who focused on the ICO gains of the 73 yelled scam. That's where NEM came from, it's founder UtopianFuture, could appreciate the NXT ideas and tech were amazing, but he finally succumbed to  the ICO gains scam mentality,  and started NEM. I think something similar will happen with HEX. 

I am observing the HEX telegram groups, and crypto Twitter and YouTube debates, and they remind me of early NXT very much. Ultimately NXT NEM and everything that came after had little to do with NXT creator CfB, and I think the same will happen with RH and HEX after the 350 days of AA is finished. RH might end up in prison, or he might refund the ETH,  or donate it to charity, or use the funds to support HEX,  but HEX will keep going no matter what RH does, and there will be clones and copycats.

I predict HEX will be a crypto phenomenon in 2020, and well worth watching, I hope komodo at least claims the free airdrop, and if there is potential for a komodo version I hope it happens.","",""

Right now the narrative behind the sell-off is that seed investors / advisers dumped a bunch triggering SL's resulting in this enormous dump.
Matic responds to the situation in this blog :
https://blog.matic.network/foundation-token-movement-accounting/

Note how they state that the 'amount' was wrong, not that they did not sell.
1 ) In the article they admit they were transferring the tokens towards Binance during the unlock schedule.
2 ) The amount that they transferred is roughly equal to the amount that was used during the first sells.

Fishy if you ask me.","",""
