#Bitcoin Mining Profitability vs Price already touched the previous High (x) in 2014. 

Is this chart invalidating all of the 1k charts out there? Maybe...Only satoshi knows.

Set a bunch of buy orders around $45,000 because if it gets there, then this guy is right and it‚Äôs a sure thing riding it up another $5000. Pro tip.

I finally know why we pumped :troll_hardcore:

[03-Jan-20 06:32 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Don't worry  @Lanii some of us are paying attention in here. I saw that call üòâ üëç

[03-Jan-20 07:16 PM] Lanii#8302
@Bitfinger Ah, now I feel bad about it. I don't usually "retweet" myself here since I obviously get stopped alot too. Thought it was kinda funny doe, people hating on TA but make up all kind of narratives for price movements.

[03-Jan-20 07:54 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii whats next step for bitcoin in your mind?

[03-Jan-20 08:15 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus No clue, Imma take Pt's on resistences all the way up

[03-Jan-20 08:16 PM] Lanii#8302
Imma bring stops to entry (where retail will now long)

[03-Jan-20 08:16 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont want to be long if it goes back down there

[03-Jan-20 08:16 PM] Lanii#8302
first chort around 8.5 ish with stop above 8.65

[03-Jan-20 08:17 PM] Lanii#8302
second and better chort around 9.3 ish

[03-Jan-20 08:17 PM] Lanii#8302
(If we get there)

[03-Jan-20 08:18 PM] Lanii#8302
there are other shorts before 8.6 but those should only be played as scalps, in and out imo

you also have this if you missed entry

[03-Jan-20 08:23 PM] Lanii#8302
I think by now I don't have to repeat myself, just because I have a plan and levels it doesn't mean that we will go there but if we do then I trade the plan.

[03-Jan-20 09:07 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii what about this?

[03-Jan-20 09:27 PM] Lanii#8302
Yes its a possibility if we dont start pushing above 7.5-7.6 or smth like that

[03-Jan-20 09:28 PM] Lanii#8302
Cant check atm, not by pc

[03-Jan-20 09:28 PM] Lanii#8302
But yeh bias should be to the downside untill we get above that 9-9.3k

[03-Jan-20 09:29 PM] Lanii#8302
However bias doesnt mean shorting bottoms, let it pop a bit first
