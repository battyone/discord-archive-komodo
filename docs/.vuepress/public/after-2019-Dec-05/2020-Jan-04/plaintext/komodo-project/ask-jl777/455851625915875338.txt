@SHossain check out portainer for a GUI to docker containers.  Very easy to manage.
I set up my dev web stuff moving away from easy engine in dev env for GUI mgmt (but keeping ee for prod)

Portainer doesnâ€™t allow orchestration of so many nodes, so there is another foss product called rancher.  With rancher orchestration across node clusters holding containers will get the desired testing.

Renting a 384GB ram with 10Gb pipe by the hour will make a huge test

[03-Jan-20 12:32 AM] Mylo#8306
4 hours, 10 servers, $80 or so.

Just read ANN in #notarynode channel, thx

[03-Jan-20 01:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, sorry I missed that :/
I have a server synced and will set up a node on my local on the possibility that it could be useful (geolocation? lower spec?)
Will be around from now.

Best to wait for instructions.

reject packet with too big lag t.1578017742 vs now.1578017821 lag.79   - happened for 30 seconds

How to read `DEXRDO` prints:
```jl777cLast Wednesday at 8:02 PM
this print has 3 parts
DEXpurge.145 for t.xxx -> n.0
that means for timeslot 145 at the unixtimestamp, it purged 0 packets
this makes sense as you need to run 59 minutes before anything will be purged.the rightmost part of L.8 A.1 coll.0 is the performance stats of the internal hashtable for recent requests. L is the number of lookups, A.1 is the number of additions to the hashtable and coll is the number of collisions
each collision will likely create a bit of redundant data transmission, that is why this is being tracked. my results show about a 0.1% collision rate, which is small enough to not matter as the goal is less than 20% redundant packets
now the middle part is what has the most important data

total.1 is the total number of packets that are in the RAM (sum of all timeslots)
the e59... is a combination of all the shorthashes (least 32 bits of actual hash XOR), given N packets, if it generates the same combination of shorthashes, odds are very good that the data is 100% in sync
R.1 S.0 A.1 duplicates.0
R.1 is the number of packets received
S.0 is the number of packets sent
A.1 is the number of packets added to the RAM. until purging starts, this should match the earlier total```

@SHossain made a hardforking change. now can join mid-stream. also made it a lot more efficient. my nodes that struggled to get 1400 tx/sec is now sustaining 5000/sec. also doubled max capacity to 16k/sec, we should be able to get to 10k/sec with this version

[03-Jan-20 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810

[03-Jan-20 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
for joining/re-joining, sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to start getting traffic

[03-Jan-20 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is due to TCP timeout for the packets that were sent the last instance.
