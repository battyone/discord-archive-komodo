thanks @smk762 . That article answered my questions. Bit of a hassle to backup wallet.dat everytime a new pair is generated but that is sometimes the cost of early adoption, I guess...ðŸ™‚

lite mode is simpler, but like anything, you the cost of  convenience is security/privacy/taking responsibility

Hi guys

[03-Jan-20 11:00 AM] zeehenk#4990
Just claimed rewards via nano ledger s. But now my account is showing 0kmd?! Im freaking out a bit... any help??

[03-Jan-20 11:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@zeehenk did you claim to a new address or your old address?

[03-Jan-20 11:01 AM] zeehenk#4990
I used the atomiclabs site

[03-Jan-20 11:02 AM] gcharang#6833
you can search the address in an explorer to see the transactions/balance https://kmdexplorer.io/

Which I always use

[03-Jan-20 11:03 AM] zeehenk#4990
That's the new address it gave me this time

[03-Jan-20 11:03 AM] zeehenk#4990
But after logging in again it show 0kmd

[03-Jan-20 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
I've deleted the address in this chat
but it does have the coins. you can search in the explorer
maybe restarting the app will update it?

[03-Jan-20 11:07 AM] zeehenk#4990
I tried that already.... any other way I can see how many kmd are on my ledger?

[03-Jan-20 11:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@zeehenk you can see the last address used in the "Last Operations" tab correct?
if the address there has the coins when searched on a blockexplorer, it means you have access to the coins
the ledger live software not displaying the correct balance is just an issue related to ledger and their servers

[03-Jan-20 11:13 AM] gcharang#6833
just waiting for some time might fix the display

[03-Jan-20 11:13 AM] gcharang#6833
if you need to move those coins in the meanwhile, you can use Verus Agama wallet

[03-Jan-20 11:17 AM] zeehenk#4990
Im clicking CLAIM REWARDS again to check the balance of kmd after the claim.... it shows 0kmd there....

[03-Jan-20 11:18 AM] zeehenk#4990
I'm not using ledger live for thia

[03-Jan-20 11:18 AM] zeehenk#4990
This*

[03-Jan-20 11:18 AM] gcharang#6833
@zeehenk do you have ledger live installed?

[03-Jan-20 11:19 AM] zeehenk#4990
Yes

[03-Jan-20 11:19 AM] gcharang#6833
please connect your ledger and check the balance shown there

[03-Jan-20 11:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@zeehenk alternatively, you could check here: <https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb>

[03-Jan-20 11:24 AM] zeehenk#4990
OK, that's. Will do that!!
