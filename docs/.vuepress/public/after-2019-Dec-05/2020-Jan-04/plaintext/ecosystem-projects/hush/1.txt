Happy 10th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Genesis Block!
Fun fact: Every $KMD and $HUSH smart chain embeds the $BTC genesis block in it's history as Block 0, so our genesis blocks are Block 1.

[03-Jan-20 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> anyone feel free to place some orders on the Atomicdex, i cant get anything through since days on atmoic dex, 1:10 kmd:hush is offer

[03-Jan-20 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Hi all! Its curious that citex is contacting every coin of kmd ecosystem 🤔 just hoping dont happen what i read happen to pirate, everything looks legit but at the end wasnt

[03-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah, luckily we aren't in the business of paying for huge listing fees. 😄

[03-Jan-20 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FtrSaroth care to elaborate?

[03-Jan-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And yeah, for all the exchanges that contact me asking us to pay fees, I immediately say "No, not 1 satoshi" and often they come right back offering a free listing. Paying CEX's is really dumb.

[03-Jan-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you are a CEX, do not contact me if you want us to pay. Just save us both the time.

[03-Jan-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> CEX's make money from *our* free software

[03-Jan-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> why should we pay them anything???

[03-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That whole model was backwards and unsustainable

[03-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that is why so few exchanges stay in biz anymore, there are no projects willing to pay silly listing fees, because they are all out of business

[03-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> exchanges must make their txfees, and so listing good projects for free just makes sense

[03-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They also offer us "marketmaking" services

[03-Jan-20 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anyway, i stick to the code mostly 🙂

[03-Jan-20 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Just saying because i read on Hush telegram and RFox telegram someone looking to be of citex offering talk about listing and in verus discord an announcement about listing on citex, on a announcement of pirate they said they was contacted for someone that looks legit of hotbit, but at the end results to be an imposter and they loss an amount of arrr they accumulate to pay the listing

[03-Jan-20 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FtrSaroth was that how Draeth got scammed out of funds? I saw something about that

[03-Jan-20 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I never believe anybody when they say they are from an exchange, I suggest others do the same. What proof do you have?

[03-Jan-20 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> About what you comment of Draeth, yes, is what he said on pirate discord

[03-Jan-20 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> yup that's how he lost 50k arr community fund

[03-Jan-20 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Proof about if the citex is legit or not, not really, just hoping not happen the same to other of the kmd ecosystem

[03-Jan-20 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i wouldn't be surprised if the same scammers would be using the names of other exchanges too, so just need to be on the lookout for that and make it 100% sure that you're actually talking to the exchange

[03-Jan-20 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We don't pay exchanges to list HUSH, so we don't need to worry much

[03-Jan-20 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The new Hush 3.3.0 release is imminent! It's got so much going on, it's hard to talk about it all

[03-Jan-20 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We could use some help telling the world all the amazing stuff coming out with our new release and Network Upgrade, which we call "Snarky Sasquatch" 😉

[03-Jan-20 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> how to get a floursihing community if cant buy in to get exposure/skin in the game? bootstrapping is tricky

[03-Jan-20 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @snowh are you saying there are not large amounts of sell orders on Graviex?

[03-Jan-20 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> i hate cex!, i pull out, i wont register nor liq on dex, i dont mine but code/trade

[03-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you could mine with your own hardware or NiceHash and "buy" Hush much cheaper. I do not understand

[03-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sure, I hate CEX's too

[03-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I guess you should learn about mining, then 🙂

[03-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the best way to acquire Hush currently is via mining

[03-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or getting paid in Hush

[03-Jan-20 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have many things to do in Hush community, if you want to earn Hush

[03-Jan-20 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> almost infinite stuff 🙂

[03-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Im finna buy lots of hush at graviex while its low

[03-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Worst case I lose 20 bucks. Who cares

[03-Jan-20 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @dirtymikelikesfeet HUSH ATH was just under $20, lot's of upside potential, not much downside 🙂

[03-Jan-20 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Eh

[03-Jan-20 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Ig

[03-Jan-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Low mcap coins get beat up much more when BTC is down, and they moon more when BTC is up. This pattern seems pretty constant. We have yet to see BTC find a new ATH, so other coins will be in cryptocoin winter until then

[03-Jan-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My hope is that people use the *technology* of Hush

[03-Jan-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if that happens, price and liquidity will follow naturally

[03-Jan-20 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> forcing liquidity by paying scammy exchanges to do "marketmaking" is not sustainable or healthy or even "good" for most definitions of "good"

[03-Jan-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Where can I buy hush?

[03-Jan-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> I havent found anything on gravi

[03-Jan-20 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> Like, is there a way I can use my AUD to buy hush?

[03-Jan-20 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> only probably AUD -> BTC -> HUSH

[03-Jan-20 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> oof that's a nightmare

[03-Jan-20 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> oof after al these fees make it pretty annoying for the average person

[03-Jan-20 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> I end up losing 5-10% of everything I exchange in the end. No wonder people don't do this.

[03-Jan-20 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I end up losing about that 5%, but it's not really that bad. You'd lose roughly the same if not much more if you moved and exchanged fiat money too

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> what do we have to do to update to HUSH 3.0?

[03-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good question

[03-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain what wallets/etc do you use? It depends

[03-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> SDL

[03-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For instance, SDL users don't need to do anything, because @denio does all the work on the backend 🙂

[03-Jan-20 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This only affects users of full node CLI or GUI wallets

[03-Jan-20 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> ah nice, that is good to hear! 🙂

[03-Jan-20 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This mostly affects notary nodes, mining pool, exchanges and people who run SilentDragon GUI wallet and/or hushd CLI full node

[03-Jan-20 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have about 26 days, almost 4 weeks! Hopefully that is enough time for our community

[03-Jan-20 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-20 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, this does not affect SDA users directly, unless they are using SDA=>SD. Then they need to update to the new :SD: when it comes out
