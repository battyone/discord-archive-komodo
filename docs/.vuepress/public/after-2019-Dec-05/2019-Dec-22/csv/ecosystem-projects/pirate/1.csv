It depends on the wallet and the user. There’s an inherent privacy risk with a BWS server but not an inherent security risk. There’s an inherent weakness in a mobile wallet that uses a single BIP39 12 word seed, because if you sweep *any* one of your coin wallets to a compromised system, your seed is compromised. iPhones have notably good security and if you add a level of security to your mobile wallet (password, pin, etc) you’re pretty immune from any physical security threat. Use a 2 out of 3 multi-sig wallet and you’re likely safe from most any exploit that could occur, like upstream injection to code...  basically, depending on your needs and knowledge, you can pick and use a mobile wallet very securely.","",""
