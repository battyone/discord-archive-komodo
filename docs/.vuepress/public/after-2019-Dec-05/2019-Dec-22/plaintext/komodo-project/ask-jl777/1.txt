Any interesting tech out there besides within the komodo ecosystem? Seems like the tech has peaked and will gravitate more toward usability and utility.

There is certainly a lot going on.  I'm also interested to see what jl777 thinks.

Yes, that is very cool!  Create a more easily programmable blockchain üëç

Do you see any other projects/tech that would be suited to a dual-daemon chain?
