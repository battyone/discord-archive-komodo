is agama safe again?

[21-Dec-19 02:04 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@BadAss yes, people are using verus agama as it does not have the same exploit as the original

I was looking for predictions for the new year just for my own entertainment, and accidently came across this guy, Bobby Ong, who is co-founder at coingecko.com making a couple of them. 

Later I skipped around and came across one of his older tweets.

It reminded me the idea of whitelabel dex.

I think that Komodo is positioned better than any other cryptocurrency for dex democratization.

And by listening to an interview I happen to see that it is a real pain point since smaller cex's doesn't have the resources to secure themselves as well as the bigger guys.

can anyone help as how to stake kmd coins? will ocean qt wallet be able to stake kmd? And any idea as how much kmd required to hit a stake once a day

[21-Dec-19 07:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
There is no staking in KMD. KMD does have a "usage reward" where you get a bonus reward for using it. Merely sending a transaction that meets certain rules allows you to earn this reward. Staking requires you to actively produce a block. These are completely different things. The user rewards don't "come from" x or y, they are created with the transaction at the time of the transaction. The amount that users get as a reward does not exist before the user gets the reward. The rewards are created by the protocol as a form of emission.
