If it wasn't NXT Asset Exchange, I wouldn't have learnt trading fundamentals.

@Acura i always find it weird looking at TA in sats, if BTC rises 300% a pair will drop in sat-value. If BTC drops it will eventually rise. Doesn't that make TA in sat value very vulnerable because it only tells half the story? For example in the chart there is a big "supply zone" in august and september where the sat price stays stable in that area, yet BTC dropped 20%, so KMD price dropped 20% in USD yet on your graph it shows a stable picture.

usd wise if kmd go below 0.46$ it will most likely go down to 0.25$

if btc bounces off 200wma like it has done every time in its history then will start to see alt prices begin to stabilise
