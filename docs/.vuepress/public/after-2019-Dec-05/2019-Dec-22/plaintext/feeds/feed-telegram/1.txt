[telegram] <CR202020> Hi Everyone    
I  recorded an interview with John McAfee yesterday. (See 35 sec clip in tweet below).
 I told him about a coin which is more private than Monero. Can you guess which one?
I also mentioned a true atomic swap cross-chain dex that works on a mobile phone. He was surprised to hear that it was already cross-chain.  :-)
