[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> @AhmedDhaif93 stand alone mobile wallet for sapling is difficult because of memory and processor requirements. It for sure will be done, but you’ll notice that there are no stand alone zaddr wallets for any zcash fork (at least that I know of). What’s amazing is that Piarate has the Android sevenseas wallet that links to your own full node wallet and can send zaddr transactions. Very impressive, actually.

[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] now i dont have a wallet i tried them all 64 bit and i have a pc 32 bit i cant withdraw my coins

[21-Dec-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> @theekgb I don’t agree that mobile wallets are the second lowest level of security. It depends on the wallet and the user. There’s an inherent privacy risk with a BWS server but not an inherent security risk. There’s an inherent weakness in a mobile wallet that uses a single BIP39 12 word seed, because if you sweep *any* one of your coin wallets to a compromised system, your seed is compromised. iPhones have notably good security and if you add a level of security to your mobile wallet (password, pin, etc) you’re pretty immune from any physical security threat. Use a 2 out of 3 multi-sig wallet and you’re likely safe from most any exploit that could occur, like upstream injection to code...  basically, depending on your needs and knowledge, you can pick and use a mobile wallet very securely.

[21-Dec-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> @AhmedDhaif93 you can generate a paperwallet

[21-Dec-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] and how can i send to it there is a video ? I want to know how to do it

[21-Dec-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> No video that I know of, but go to https://pirate.black/wallets and select the paper wallet option.  Then generate an address or two. Make sure to print the keys. Then use tip bot commands to send to your new paper wallet address. Later, you can import the private key into a wallet to send your ARRR
