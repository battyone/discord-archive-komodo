I had 3 failed OOT Swaps, and i can see the coins on the explorer being returned, but none of those tx'es want to confirm for days now (fee looks normal), which is weird because there are lots of blocks after they were sent back from the b address
https://explorer.utrum.io/address/RYKwUXd9mrJYM8QamczVcqASLW51iAFhMe

Looking at one of the b addresses, it's empty https://explorer.utrum.io/address/bTx87z6LKku9JAaLJPvvUZJAPkJvQ9YaSC

not sure what happened there but it happened 3 times in a row, let me know if this is worthy of a git issue and i'll open","",""
