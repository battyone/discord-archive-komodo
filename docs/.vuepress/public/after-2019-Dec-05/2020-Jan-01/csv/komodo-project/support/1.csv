But using the binaries, everything works fine! (I synced WLC21 on a microSD and I'll try to stake it). I prefer to build myself rather than using binaries.
I encountered problems when compiling things in depends folder (boost, librustzcash and so on), most of them seem to be solved by replacing ``aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc`` to ``gcc`` (same fix for ranlib, ar and g++). But after all, the compilation fails because it doesn't find sth related to boost (header file ?):","",""
