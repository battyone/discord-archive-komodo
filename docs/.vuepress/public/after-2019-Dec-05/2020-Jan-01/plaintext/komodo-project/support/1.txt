@gcharang I failed to compile @radix42 ARM source of KMD 0.5.0 on Raspberry Pi 4 (ubuntu 19.04 preimage). But using the binaries, everything works fine! (I synced WLC21 on a microSD and I'll try to stake it). I prefer to build myself rather than using binaries.
I encountered problems when compiling things in depends folder (boost, librustzcash and so on), most of them seem to be solved by replacing ``aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc`` to ``gcc`` (same fix for ranlib, ar and g++). But after all, the compilation fails because it doesn't find sth related to boost (header file ?):

```/home/ubuntu/testph/radixkmd/depends/work/build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/boost/1_66_0-f05f0228e8a/user-config.jam
Replace
using gcc : : aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-g++
To:
using gcc : : g++```

```/home/ubuntu/testph/radixkmd/depends/work/build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/boost/1_66_0-f05f0228e8a/Makefile
Replace
<archiver>"aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ar"
by
<archiver>"ar"

Replace
<ranlib>"aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ranlib"
by
<ranlib>"ranlib"```

```/home/ubuntu/testph/radixkmd/depends/work/build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/openssl/1.1.1a-62dfaa104aa

Makefile

CC=$(CROSS_COMPILE)aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc
CC=$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc

AR=$(CROSS_COMPILE)aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ar
RANLIB=$(CROSS_COMPILE)aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-ranlib

configdata.pm

Same fix for ar, gcc, ranlib (present twices)```

Similar trick for libevent ``/home/ubuntu/testph/radixkmd/depends/work/build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/libevent/2.1.8-31022cbebfd``

@phm87 I haven't used them, radix will know what the problem is

[31-Dec-19 09:44 AM] phm87#7395
I think that something differ between raspberry pi with ubuntu and the ARM that radix used. I had a look at her changes and I think that I'm reverting sth. If it is possible to create a kind of ln, maybe I can use radic code without change stuff in depends folder

@phm87 run `uname -a` to confirm architecture.. iirc not all rpi4 os's are 64bit
