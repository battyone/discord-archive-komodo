what exactly is the DEX nSPV stuff in jl777/komodo DEX tree?
it looks like it's fetching quotes - is it peg related or  atomicdex related or both?

[31-Dec-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime decentralized orderbook

[31-Dec-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
actually the quotes are datablobs, so it is low level. another layer can interpret the datablobs however it wants, eg. for orderbooks, for anything else that needs a realtime RAM synced set of datablobs across nodes

[31-Dec-19 05:42 AM] Mylo#8306
size limits on data blobs?

[31-Dec-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for now 1kb, but i will be making it arbitrary length soon.

[31-Dec-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be RAM limited and expire data after about an hour, though this can be changed with a #define change

[31-Dec-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not 100% guaranteed consensus, but most of the time most of the nodes will get most of the datablobs within a couple seconds

[31-Dec-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and i aim for no more than 20% excess bandwidth over perfect 1:1 packet transmissions

[31-Dec-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure that can be achieved, though initial tests are promising

[31-Dec-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this seems to solve a lot of possible use cases. i had assumed it was an already solved problem, but i couldnt find any preexisting working code

[31-Dec-19 05:47 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm trying to push a telephone directory paradigm into this data blob idea, to path find users for p2p phone call _setup_, the media can then be direct p2p.

ok - i'm starting up a dev update blog, like tech tuesdays of old since i enjoy doing it.

[31-Dec-19 05:47 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for responding to query üôè

[31-Dec-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
this came out of the atomicDEX-api/issues/373 discussion

[31-Dec-19 05:50 AM] Mylo#8306
hehe 7 month thread - will take it with me into the new year, cheers!

@jl777c when will the IOS AtomicDex be out of beta testing and fully operational?

[31-Dec-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
after the realtime decentralized orderbook is integrated. it is fully functional now, just wont be able to scale until the ordermatching is updated.

[31-Dec-19 07:21 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Gotcha üëå. Is there an estimated timetable?

[31-Dec-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i am making very good progress on the realtime orderbook

[31-Dec-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
as to how long it will take to integrate, that is not for me to say. it also depends on how the next scaling test performs. we need to do some internal scaling tests first, so it is more a step by step thing than a calendar precise process

[31-Dec-19 07:26 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
I understand now . Thank u for your time.

[31-Dec-19 01:32 PM] Mylo#8306
The ‚Äúseveral hundred node scaling test‚Äù in recent commit log, is this automated already from previous tests?

I was reading up on scaling containers, patchkez NN did a lot of the container stuff in the 2018 transaction scaletest.  I reckon 10s of thousands could be orchestrated seeing as mm2 & nspv are much more resource friendly than komodod & a miner.

[31-Dec-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, thousands of nodes could be spun up, virtually no resources are used by the DEX p2p code

[31-Dec-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, i just create random bytes as the "quotes"

[31-Dec-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and do it in an infinite while true bash script

[31-Dec-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
while true
do
./komodo_cli -ac_name=DEXtest DEX_broadcast ffff
done

[31-Dec-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
run that on all nodes and see if anything blows up, or if they get out of sync or use too much bandwidth

[31-Dec-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version seems to be pretty stable, but i dont have any fancy algos internally, so it will bog down a bit when there are 50,000 new orders in an hour

[31-Dec-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
though it seems 50+ cores will be needed to generate that much traffic

[31-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Mylo#8306
Yep, containers horizontally scaled across node clusters can simulate a country‚Äôs worth of traders if need be I think.  I like this data blob layer you‚Äôve come up with btw & txpow.

I was also thinking, would a dictionary of numerical values or ticker symbols save on bandwidth in the long run?

If low rez orderbook resolution used a dictionary and encoding scheme (byte arrays or even bitwise) then for higher rez detail or liveliness used the short sign messages.

Or should I stick to scaling container reading rather than protocol ideas ?

[31-Dec-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the datablobs will be able to be of any size, so it would be up to a higher level layer to decide what info to propagate

[31-Dec-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
cant get much better than 1% extra bandwidth

[31-Dec-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it is data that all the fullnodes need to know, then it seems any higher level layers would create condensed views, summaries, etc. as a service on top of the raw datablobs

[31-Dec-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so the maker mm2 nodes would run a DEX p2p node and then all these nodes are 99% in sync 99% of the time, which is sufficient for orderbook purpose. actual ordermatch and swap would use the normal libtorrent and other tunneling type of mechanisms

[31-Dec-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
phones would become a client to the next layer up from the raw datablobs

[31-Dec-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in a highly connected network, the extra bandwidth is a lot higher

[31-Dec-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
for example if all nodes in an 11 node network have 8 or 9 connections, the efficiency is pretty bad... about 2x excess banwidth. but this is really only an issue for such small networks. for any normal sized network, having 8 peers is just fine and the extra bandwidth will come way down.

[31-Dec-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the starting point is N times the bandwidth used, where N is the average number of peers, so 3x is actually not bad. i think i can tweak it a bit and get it below 2x, but really it seems ok as there is no overall bandwidth issue with so few nodes and speed of propagation is also desired

[31-Dec-19 02:05 PM] Mylo#8306
Riiiight gotcha, the maker nodes in artem comments referencing your design are the caretaker nodes?

[31-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Mylo#8306

caretaker nodes would run one of these p2p nodes
