I don't believe it's maximalism that causes everyone to scream scam at everything. It's most likely the actual number of scams that causes that.  @Andersen

Why cant people see that even using the word maximalist is disingenuous and causes a rift in the crypto community?

I think it's also influenced by people having bags heavier than their lifestyle can carry

Remember when #Dentacoin had a $2B market cap?  

It's now $23M, down 99%.  But still ranked in top 120 coins out of 5,000+ coins. 

Barring a handful, the Alt-coin markets are in a 2+ year bear market for good reason.  #worthless
