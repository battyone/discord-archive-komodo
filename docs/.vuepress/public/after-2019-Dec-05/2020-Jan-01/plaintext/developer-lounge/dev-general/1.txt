Is it possible to combine ac_private=1 with ac_stake and cc_peg ? (edit : private chains not compatibles with cc I think but maybe fine with staking)

No not possible because everybody needs to be able to audit the staking

Regarding the mobile development we have our hands full at the moment, but thanks for asking.

@CHMEX I understand but I was thinking of staking only on t addys and do nothing on z addys. It can be fun. Was it tested ?
