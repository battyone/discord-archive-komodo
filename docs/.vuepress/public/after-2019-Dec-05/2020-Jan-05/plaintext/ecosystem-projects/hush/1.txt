[04-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <admon> is the last version

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> You have to connect the app with Silentdragon wallet

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> @admon

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> You can't use the app only to transfer funds

[04-Jan-20 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> The app is only a controller of your wallet on your pc

[04-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @admon yes, I suggest SDL

[04-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> download that, install it, and then do the "Pair mobile app" feature, that will pair it to your Android app

[04-Jan-20 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ‚è∞  ATTENTION: The user `Privatoshi` who had a Twitter account `@Privatoshi1` is a scammer and thief! They have stolen hardware from Hush Core Team. If you see this person in any community, please call them out and warn others! `Privatoshi IS A SCAMMER!` ‚è∞

[04-Jan-20 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @here Privatoshi Is A Scammer, Beware!!

[04-Jan-20 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> ü§®

[04-Jan-20 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[04-Jan-20 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He deleted all his twitter/discord accounts

[04-Jan-20 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> wtf?

[04-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's sad, really, he was a good student, but impatient. And now we see, didn't give a shit about Hush community at all

[04-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> what did he do?

[04-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he stole Android phones that were purchased to work on HushDroid project

[04-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> wow... that's really pathetic

[04-Jan-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the sad act of a sad person, biting the hand that feeds

[04-Jan-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> he didn't send them back?

[04-Jan-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Privatoshi is not associated with the Hush community at all any longer. Deleting him from the website now

[04-Jan-20 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He is a known scammer, at this point. Beware. He is very good at disguise

[04-Jan-20 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He told me of purchasing twitter accounts in bulk for 50 cents each

[04-Jan-20 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> His Discord account is still active

[04-Jan-20 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> meh, i would rather go code

[04-Jan-20 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> feel free to find him, people

[04-Jan-20 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I know that Karma and his own mind knows what he did was morally wrong

[04-Jan-20 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> exactly, We're a strong community. We'll survive! üôÇ

[04-Jan-20 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> We have seen a lot of darker days!

[04-Jan-20 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Privatoshi even deleted his github account, which to me sounds like he was getting rid of evidence

[04-Jan-20 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> A normal anon dev would just leave their anon github account, it's not tied to themselves

[04-Jan-20 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I accidentally found one of Privatoshi's old Github accounts, the one he deleted was `jw9898` and this one autocompleted for me (which is how I found it): https://github.com/jw989898

[04-Jan-20 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he confirmed that it was his account while we were still talking. This guy uses accounts like tissues

[04-Jan-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> wow, and he was a good member of the team up until now üò†

[04-Jan-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> but i'm glad he's gone

[04-Jan-20 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> we don't need no scammers

[04-Jan-20 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> So much stuff got done this year by our amazing team, too many people to count. Thanks to Duke, Denio, Berg, Gilardh, ~~Privatoshi~~, and many more who i can't even name, i'm so proud of everyone who has contributed to development including translators and other community members. :hush_white: ü§ó Great Holidays and  a New Decade to all üôÇ

[04-Jan-20 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> He also never fully paid me for the work I did for him

[04-Jan-20 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> I mean, he did

[04-Jan-20 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> He did end hp paying me

[04-Jan-20 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> But it was a hassle. I got no beef w him he low balled me but the nigga came through and in this world thats sum

[04-Jan-20 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That's rough

[04-Jan-20 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Imagine if we all used his "hardware". With hacked android os

[04-Jan-20 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Would've gotten all our funds stolen

[04-Jan-20 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I never trusted him

[04-Jan-20 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Wow. Really sad to hear

[04-Jan-20 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Oh well, we have too much cool shit to focus on. It's just a small inconvenience

[04-Jan-20 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto I am just curious. Were phones paid from your own pocket or from 10% HUSh mining reward? If that was your own money, I would like to pay something back...
