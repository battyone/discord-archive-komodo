[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Here is the ARRRchive, guys! https://lbry.tv/@ARRRchive:d
If you want to help ARRRchive to get to trending on this platform, you can support the channel or any of the posts by using the support feature (you will still own your coins).
You'll need to get LBC (for example from CoinEx) and send it to your wallet on the platform. Go to settings and "Enable claim support". Then go to any post or to the channel and click support and input the amount you want to use.
At this early stage it doesn't need much to get to trending. Support given now will help tremendously in the future as the platform is getting bigger as we speak (as you can see from the LBC price curve during the last month).

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Any questions about the ARRRchive or the platform can be launched at my direction. Also, there may be competitions in the future to grow the ARRRchive. Anything posted there is free for anyone to use. If you want to use any of the pictures with the original resolution and size, you should download the desktop app. Any and all files from the platform are then yours.

[04-Jan-20 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Oh and about the name: It is ARRRchive, and the platform attaches a random symbol in the end. I got lucky and it was a d. :D
The channel name for now will be Pirate Chain as it is better for the big public. After gaining more followers the channel will change it's name to ARRRchive as requested.

[04-Jan-20 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ph03nix> very cool @Hember

[04-Jan-20 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Thank you. 🙂 Also, I suggest all to use the dark mode on that page. It is much more beautiful.

[04-Jan-20 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Thank you.
And as you can see, I try to collect pictures and gifs (and why not videos) so that they are easy to browse. But I also include text and links in the description of all posts to get more exposure to the project.
I ask for as beautiful content as possible so that the thumbnails can be the same picture as the content itself. This will help anyone that is browsing through the content to find a pic for their article of tweet, but it also helps with the following on the platform, as beauty attracts.

[04-Jan-20 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Still an ugly meme with a great joke will land straight into the ARRRchive. 😉

[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i am having a small issue with their kyc @Hember, they are a little too enthusiastic about it

[04-Jan-20 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> and I need a better set up

[04-Jan-20 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I think one does not need to do a kyc to give support.

[04-Jan-20 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> love the channel by the way

[04-Jan-20 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> thanks 🙂

[04-Jan-20 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> kyc is for small occasional LBC rewards (at this state of the project). they need to prove your humanness so that no bots can come to the platform to collect free lbc through thousands of fake accounts

[04-Jan-20 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> For example I gained 3 LBC today for watching content. That is like under 10 cents. But it is something to use as a support or a tip.

[04-Jan-20 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> got it, I am using it without, but yes to get rewards they are asking for some proof of identity. it might be looser than it appears but they need to improve that bit imo

[04-Jan-20 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> yes, because there are no likes, its tips instead, which is cool

[04-Jan-20 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> yeah. they say that they use the kyc data just to prove humanness, as they don't use ads and the way they "make money" is by offering a product so good that LBC price goes up. Dem hodlers.

[04-Jan-20 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I think you can still give a follow without kyc?.. so, you can do something in one of the patterns they will use for trending lists.

[04-Jan-20 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I love how this platform allows you to post any kind of documents, too. I mostly follow channels that make art photos. But surely the biggest channels there will probably be video channels.

[04-Jan-20 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> i like the platform, the whole idea and the channel, everything else is really cool about it

[04-Jan-20 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Yeah, I like how it has evolved. I first found the project and downloaded the desktop app in the late 2017. I like where the platform has been headed and it really is starting to offer a good product.. also many quite big youtubers are migrating there. I wanted to make the arrrchive on this platform to use the rapid growth of it to gain exposure for arrr.

[04-Jan-20 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> After Youtube banned many crypto channels on christmas the platform has exploded, and it seems LBC is starting it's next bullrun. Wish I had more money, I could buy now and use as a support.

[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> is the tip-bot still down?  I just keep getting messages with "status: failed"

[04-Jan-20 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] Sclear hasn't gotten back to me

[04-Jan-20 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Ok, cool. thanks for the response. I won't sweat it.  If you remember, try to tag me when it's working. Ultimately, I'm a long term arrr hodler

[04-Jan-20 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> but I'm also a strong "not your key, not your crypto" guy, as I know you know.,....

[04-Jan-20 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> Guys, tbh, I had my doubts if pirate or any other coin will be able to implement native mobile z-tx before ZEC

[04-Jan-20 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> Yesterday I learned that ZER released them last month

[04-Jan-20 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> Closed source though

[04-Jan-20 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> But I thought for devs it might still be interesting to have a look

[04-Jan-20 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> If others can do it I am more than confident that ARRR can do it as well!

[04-Jan-20 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Ahmed of $ETHO> Good morning everybody and happy day active friends

[04-Jan-20 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
