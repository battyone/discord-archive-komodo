@dukeleto I have an issue with this version:```ÔªøÔªø[HUSH3] matched.1 VALID (HUSH3) MoM.cbd5112a68561249c9458228a3650201ce45cfb3e0d04f6c6410c0f45e55ab1e [18] CCid.2

don't update it just yet, should probably wait for an announcement

[04-Jan-20 10:45 AM] zatJUM#9924
hush3 isn't running anymore for ~15 days now on my NN üò©

[04-Jan-20 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM that looks no fun

[04-Jan-20 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@denio check this bug out

[04-Jan-20 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM can you tell me if it consistently happens at that block height? And which OS are you using, anything like a Docker container or anything being used?

[04-Jan-20 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
that looks suspiciously like our old sync bug problem, are you 100% sure you are on the new code?

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
aha! That line number seems to be old @zatJUM . I think maybe you are running old hush code somehow

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
`coins.cpp:564` does not correspond to that line in hush3.git master right now

[04-Jan-20 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you must be running different/old code

[04-Jan-20 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM you might have done a compile before a `git pull` perhaps ? Or maybe your git remote is not the main hush3 repo

[04-Jan-20 02:26 PM] zatJUM#9924
I've `git clone`d a few hours ago, then `git checkout master` on Debian 9, with no Docker container or anything like that.

[04-Jan-20 02:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't understand what happened... I had launched `./hushd -pubkey=$pubkey` like 7 or 8 times before, with old code (see <https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/456828345871761408/654449041026842625>) and hushd always stopped (see <https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/456828345871761408/661173044588576789>).
A few hours ago, I deleted ~/hush3 and cloned version 3.3.0, following your message (see <https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455755767132454913/662678792770420744>), and ran `./hushd -pubkey=$pubkey` again, with same issue (not same height). And now you are worrying about this issue, I've run it again and it works! ü§î

[04-Jan-20 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
so what is the issue?

[04-Jan-20 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to do a `make clean` and recompile, if using an old repo

[04-Jan-20 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
or just do a fresh clone for simplicity if you want. I speak of hush3.git, not komodo.git

[04-Jan-20 02:47 PM] zatJUM#9924
I don't know! I have done nothing between this morning when it failed and now that it works, except, restarting it

[04-Jan-20 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM can you do a fresh clone and fresh compile and test it that way ?

[04-Jan-20 02:48 PM] zatJUM#9924
I `git clone`d this morning from <https://github.com/myhush/hush3>

[04-Jan-20 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
You may have some weird partial compile stuff going on

[04-Jan-20 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, fresh clone rules out some issues

[04-Jan-20 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@denio maybe this bug is only triggered with -pubkey? We haven't seen it at all with a lot of testing

[04-Jan-20 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be that only a NN pubkey triggers this

[04-Jan-20 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM the fact that it failed at a different height is a clue

[04-Jan-20 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
we will do some testing with -pubkey to see if it can be triggered with any pubkey or maybe it requires a NN pubkey

[04-Jan-20 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure this bug is new in 3.3.0, i think it was there already

[04-Jan-20 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think only -pubkey triggers it

[04-Jan-20 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`i think it was there already`
It was, it's the main reason I removed HUSH from chicken pool

[04-Jan-20 03:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
It was (see link above)

[04-Jan-20 03:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think I have tried without pubkey too with no success, 11 days ago

[04-Jan-20 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
we can't seem to reproduce this, so that is what makes it challenging to debug. This is the most info we have ever gotten about the bug, nobody had given us the error from STDOUT before

[04-Jan-20 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
so thanks to @zatJUM for that, we know a lot more now

[04-Jan-20 06:48 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_is OK with being called a "nobody"_

[04-Jan-20 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
So to recap, this is the first time anybody has given us the actual error to work with:

[04-Jan-20 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
komodod: coins.cpp:564: const CTxOut& CCoinsViewCache::GetOutputFor(const CTxIn&) const: Assertion `coins && coins->IsAvailable(input.prevout.n)' failed.
```

[04-Jan-20 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is suspiciously similar to the "sync bug of death" inside KMD that Hush discovered

[04-Jan-20 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
eerily similar

[04-Jan-20 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
but now it seems only users who use -pubkey are affected, i have not heard any reports of this from average users

[04-Jan-20 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
1 mining pool reports similar issues, i am sure they use -pubkey

[04-Jan-20 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM do you have high CPU load by chance? is your server close to maxed out on CPU?

[04-Jan-20 06:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`this is the first time anybody has given us the actual error to work with`*
*in the Komodo discord

[04-Jan-20 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`1 mining pool reports similar issues, i am sure they use -pubkey`
No, I don't

[04-Jan-20 07:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
Seems like this is a core KMD bug

[04-Jan-20 07:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM so, after talking with James a bit, I have a few ideas. Either try a fresh sync (get rid of datadir) or try a -reindex and see if that changes stuff. A previous error (maybe Hush coredumped a while ago?) might have corrupted some data

[04-Jan-20 07:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
this especially happened to me with zaddrs recently

[04-Jan-20 07:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
a coredump or other bad error, will break the state of our zaddrs and your wallet will think you are trying to double spend, until you reindex

[04-Jan-20 07:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
because it never got to say "this zutxo is spent" and write out the data

[04-Jan-20 07:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
```do you have high CPU load by chance?```By chance: no üòâ ```is your server close to maxed out on CPU?```No, it's on my main NN, and I do not mine KMD on it, but 5 smartchains with `genproclimit=1` only

[04-Jan-20 07:55 PM] zatJUM#9924
I hadn't noticed it, but hushd had stopped: ```[HUSH3] ht.151813 txi.3 signedmask.810122120a20a200 numvins.13 numvouts.2 <<<<<<<<<<<  notarized

[04-Jan-20 08:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM ok, a fresh sync might be the only way to fix corrupt data, but -reindex might work. That error protects against corrupt local data

What I have learned recently is that `-reindex` fixes many sins, but some can only be fixed with a resync, such as some coredumps or `kill -9` issues where data is not written correctly

It's ok. All synchronized and running. Let's wait for the 1rst nota for 11 days on hush3 üò´

[04-Jan-20 10:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zatJUM that is very good to hear! Now I know to recommend people a fresh sync if this ever happens. Most likely a previous coredump or `kill -9` got your datadir into an inconsistent state

[04-Jan-20 10:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
thank you very much for reporting the bug, it's still very good to know things work for you. And what to suggest others who run into this
