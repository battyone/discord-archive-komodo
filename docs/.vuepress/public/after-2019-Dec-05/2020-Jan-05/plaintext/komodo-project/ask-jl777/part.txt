Is this expected?
`DEXpurge.3299`

[04-Jan-20 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if it actually purges, it prints at any offset

I'll start a blast.

[04-Jan-20 06:11 PM] CrisF#3405
With 4 blasters on same node got 
`DEXadd openind.-1 invalid or non-empty spot 00000000 (nil)
hashtable fullhashtable full`

[04-Jan-20 06:12 PM] CrisF#3405
Shut them down and soon recovered

[04-Jan-20 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you exceeded the speed limit!

[04-Jan-20 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
or mem maybe?

[04-Jan-20 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if it didnt crash and recovered from that, it is very good

[04-Jan-20 06:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
did you hit swap?

[04-Jan-20 06:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, 3k+ on each.

[04-Jan-20 06:15 PM] CrisF#3405
10 limit isn't it?

[04-Jan-20 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there is virtually no mem allocation going on, most of the memory is statically crated

[04-Jan-20 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
hashtables in a single second is a fixed size. if you exceed it, it wont fit any more and prints some errors

[04-Jan-20 06:17 PM] CrisF#3405
64gb mem on this node.

[04-Jan-20 06:18 PM] CrisF#3405
will try the same on smaller node and check memory usage.

[04-Jan-20 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you filled up the hashtable for one of the seconds

[04-Jan-20 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it printed that the hashtable was full

[04-Jan-20 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what the mystery is

[04-Jan-20 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
did it crash?

[04-Jan-20 06:19 PM] CrisF#3405
No, not a mystery.  Worked and recovered well.

[04-Jan-20 06:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
I read that as  DO IT AGAIN!

[04-Jan-20 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
this system uses a best efforts method, like UDP

[04-Jan-20 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if you go too fast, it is too fast and it wont be able to process all of it

[04-Jan-20 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
packets will be dropped in hopes that the node can stay caught up after dropping packets

[04-Jan-20 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that there are types of data where it isnt a big deal (maybe annoying) and not going to lose funds even if all the data doesnt get to everyone all the time

[04-Jan-20 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
for such types of data, this is a good solution

[04-Jan-20 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if losing even a single packet is a disaster, them this is not the proper system to use, we have plenty of lossless blockchains

[04-Jan-20 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and these are not transactions, though nothing prevents the datablobs from being actual transactions

[04-Jan-20 06:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it worked well.  I'm curious to see how the smaller vps will perform.

[04-Jan-20 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is a good test

[04-Jan-20 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
my small nodes are doing perfectly fine, until it goes above their limit, which seems to be 3k/sec for one of the 10 nodes. at that point, it gradually loses ground until it is hopelessly behind

[04-Jan-20 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
some networks just wont be able to handle 3k/sec

[04-Jan-20 06:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
So... with a sinlge node online... should I be trying anything other than seeing how many blasters I can run?

[04-Jan-20 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
a single node isnt testing much, need at least 2 nodes

[04-Jan-20 06:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
what would you say are absolute mins epcs for a VM?

[04-Jan-20 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever can run a komodod

[04-Jan-20 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
without a blockchain

[04-Jan-20 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
+ 1GB RAM

[04-Jan-20 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all RAM based, HDD doesnt matter

[04-Jan-20 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
unless not enough RAM and you need to use swap

[04-Jan-20 06:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
K lets play the resource game then... ill spin up a few and see what can be done with a tiny build

[04-Jan-20 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the CPU and bandwidth will be the limiting factor and even small node can handle 3k/sec, just not 10k/sec

[04-Jan-20 06:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS states minimum as:

2 GHz dual core processor or better
2 GB system memory
25 GB of free hard drive space

[04-Jan-20 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if you had enough swap to be able to build the komodod, that would be enough to run the node at full speed

[04-Jan-20 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all RAM based and very fast

[04-Jan-20 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF i wasn't blasting. i was out to collect my new eye glasses

[04-Jan-20 07:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

restarted  and  will  report  in 60  minutes

[04-Jan-20 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
run just 1 blaster, until that is running stable

[04-Jan-20 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it will go fast and consume a lot of bandwidth

i had one of the 11 nodes missing half the packets. restarted and it joined up to the ongoing 4k/sec blasters and now it is keeping up.

[04-Jan-20 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it is working as well as it ever did and is able to join an ongoing blast and also recover from being overloaded. seems i can start debugging the tagged messaging
