countries consider cash their favourite payment 
method and more than half believe cash will 
always be around. Indeed, in Germany, nearly 60 
per cent of in-store purchases are paid in cash 
and Germans hold ‚Ç¨52 in cash on average ‚Äì the 
highest rate amongst advanced economies. 
Furthermore, the average German plans to use 
even more cash over the coming six months.
Overall, people pay cash because they 
find their¬†spending easier to monitor, the 
transaction fast and convenient, they have no 
trouble with acceptance, and their purchases 
remain¬†anonymous.```","",""
