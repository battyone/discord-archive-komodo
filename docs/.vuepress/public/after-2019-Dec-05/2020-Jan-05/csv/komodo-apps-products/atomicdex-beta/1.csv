tldr: it is necessary for initiating the p2p swap according to the protocol. If there was enough liquidity, there shouldn't be many failed swaps. you won't notice the quantities lost to failed swaps in your total time using AtomicDEX as the fee is aready tiny compared many CEXs. Every successful swap should offset fee lost due to a failed swap","",""

I think there is a maker for DEX that is on a older version of the app, causing swaps to fail
a new version is in development which will ban(locally) pubkeys that cause failed swaps","",""
