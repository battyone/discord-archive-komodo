[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> If Hush goes z-address only, atomic swaps will stop working? Is there a plan to somehow allow t-address -transactions for the purpose of atomic swaps? If t-address has to be allowed for this particular purpose, could it be possible to limit the transactions to fixed amounts, like 10, 100, 1000,10k, 100k? This way metadata leakage related to sums might not give away so much information. Or has someone come up with a way to do z-address atomic swaps?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda zatomicDEX will allow atomicdex to work with zaddrs via a zaddr-enabled CC. jl777 has described the protocol on his blog, but the specifics need to all be worked out

Even I had said that doing atomic swaps on a blockchain with only private transactions is not possible. At first (and second and third)‚Ä¶

[09-Jan-20 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda it will utilize zaddr viewkeys and CC's and there will need to be new rules that allow smart contract (CC/Antara) addresses to receive taddr funds, but not normal addresses, which would allow for zaddr atomic swaps. Using fixed amount sizes might happen, JUMBLR did a lot of that too. Using a few fixed amounts helps to prevent analyzing amounts that are unique
