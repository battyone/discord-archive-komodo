I highly recommend tuning into this. @wolfofwaves is one of the brightest devs I have met in this space. This project he is working on utilizing $ARRR is one of the coolest , yet least known endeavors for @PirateChain

Crypto Trading Privacy Gets a Boost as $15M of Tether Moves to Liq...
Innocuous at first glance, the transfer of $15 million worth of USDT from ethereum to Liquid has big implications for the tether market and digital asset trading more broadly.

[dscrd-prt] <ph03nix> @jl777c care to share your thoughts?

[09-Jan-20 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> 15mil is small compared to the billions

[09-Jan-20 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> also the so called privacy is not very private when on a controlled chain like liquid chain

[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> Can I get the bounty if I run it through 100 translations?

[09-Jan-20 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> like, 100 translations and back to English

[09-Jan-20 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> or better yet, if I translate it into Pirate Speak

[09-Jan-20 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Pwnz> Pirate Speak would be :shexy:

[09-Jan-20 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Yesss

[09-Jan-20 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Pwnz> Cool idea haha

[09-Jan-20 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> @Draeth  Thank you very much, man!

[09-Jan-20 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ectocooler give me a sample of the pirate speak version of the website (just a small bit). If it's good, I'll give you ARRR to do it

[09-Jan-20 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> One moment, translating "PirateChain (ARRR) is a 100% private send cryptocurrency. It uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users activity on the network. Most privacy coins are riddled with holes created by optional privacy. PirateChain uses ZK-Snarks to shield 100% of the peer to peer transactions on the blockchain making for highly anonymous and private transactions."

[09-Jan-20 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <JiuCrypto> Did someone look into HUSH's new tracking tool? According to them ZEC and another z-z project want to implement it. Could it be of interest for ARRR?

[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> now, granted, I'm like a potato that has been in the oven for 60 mins at 425.

[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> I'm baked

[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> PirateChain (ARRR) be a 100% private send cryptocurrency. She be built of a privacy protocol that can withstand the surly winds of the seas, and from saboteurs from within her hull. Most ships in her class are plauged with "Optional Privacy" termites that bored holes in their hull. PirateChain, she was built with a keel using ZK-Snarks to protect her precious cargo, making it not only secure, but private and incognito.

[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> quick and dirty version

[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> went with "incognito" because saying it with a "pirate" accent made me laugh

[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Hahaha awesome

[09-Jan-20 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> anywho, hope it gave a smile

[09-Jan-20 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Yea, I'm good with the pirate translation if you wanna do it
