[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Anything going on? Been quiet here.

[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> Quiet is very good. It means all the hard fork network issues are sorted and the team is heads down coding pbaas

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes i can't say i'm unhappy about the fact that it has gotten a bit more quiet again in here as well 🙂

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> We all know what happens when things go quiet in the Verus discord for a bit. Just means Mike is about to drop some mind blowing update soon 😀
