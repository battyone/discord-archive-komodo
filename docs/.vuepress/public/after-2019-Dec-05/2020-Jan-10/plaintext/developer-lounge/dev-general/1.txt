Hello guys, I setup the VPS at AWS and run two instances for two nodes. Do I have to install komodo and zcash in both instances to create a Smart Chain?

[09-Jan-20 06:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
You should install it on both nodes yes

[09-Jan-20 06:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
Connect one to the other and start mining

Thanks for quick info!

You don't need to install zcash, installing komodo is sufficient

[09-Jan-20 10:07 PM] riemdelhi#7234
The install didn't work. Setup: AWS-Free Account via ssh on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.(VM) - I'm getting in the instance on AWS and the instances have connection.

After I enter the command, directory: ~/komodo$ ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
It begins to install but stops at the point:

".....-DHAVE_BUILD_INFO -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -DMULTICORE  -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wstack-protector -fstack-protector-all -fPIE   -pipe -O1 -g -fopenmp -fwrapv -fno-strict-aliasing -Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch -MT cc/libbitcoin_server_a-import.o -MD -MP -MF cc/.deps/libbitcoin_server_a-import.Tpo -c -o cc/libbitcoin_server_a-import.o `test -f 'cc/import.cpp' || echo './'`cc/import.cpp"

I have tried it many times but it stops always here. Does somebody know why?

@phm87 Couldn't start ./komodod & without zcash. üò¶

I don't see the error, can you scroll up to check if you see the error in red in the console ?
Maybe it is trying to build the qt version of komodo after building komodod and komodo-cli. A server without graphical interface will  have difficulties to build the qt (GUI version)
If you want, some binaries are available (but it is better to build from source).
About zcash, I don't understand, maybe it is new or something else. Some parameters should be downloaded before running it but

[09-Jan-20 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
``virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory``

[09-Jan-20 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
you don't have enough RAM, you can define a swap file to be able to finish the build

[09-Jan-20 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
(sorry for my previous msg where I asked more logs, I posted too soon)

[09-Jan-20 10:21 PM] riemdelhi#7234
My mistake, I'm really new and didn't post the Error! üò¶

[09-Jan-20 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
No problem, everyone is new nearly everywhere on earth

[09-Jan-20 10:21 PM] riemdelhi#7234
That means, I need a stronger instance on AWS?

[09-Jan-20 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
not necessary

[09-Jan-20 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
building requires 8 GB or RAM but running komodo only needs 1 or 2 GB

[09-Jan-20 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
so it is cheaper to define a swap file (on the disk) to be able to build

[09-Jan-20 10:23 PM] riemdelhi#7234
Ok, I will check where I can find how to define a swap file. Is there an option for Testing reasons I can use?

[09-Jan-20 10:24 PM] phm87#7395
```Swap Space (Optional)
You will need at least 4GB of RAM to build hush from git source, OR you can enable a swap file. To enable a 4GB swap file on modern Linux distributions:

sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile```

Thank you!

[09-Jan-20 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry for the delay, I had the solution not far away because I had the same problem on a raspberry pi when installing hush. Hush is similar to KMD about its needs to be build and to run

[09-Jan-20 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
and sorry only 4 GB are required to build, not 8 (I said 8 earlier but it was an error as I read)

[09-Jan-20 10:27 PM] riemdelhi#7234
@phm87 Thank you for your help!
