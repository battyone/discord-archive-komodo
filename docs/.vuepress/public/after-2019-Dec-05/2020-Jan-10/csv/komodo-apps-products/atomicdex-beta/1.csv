Swap contract address is `0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871`","",""

"440030719386058762","CiPhEr#2091","09-Jan-20 07:04 AM","so a little confused on connecting mm2 to an erc20 token (such as busd). 
The BTC based coins are easy I just copy one of the connect scripts to a newly named one, open it and change say for instance KMD to VRSC, save and run and i'm connected.
It looks like BUSD is listed in the coins file already, but it seems there is an additional file that I need to create in order to connect, what file and where do i put it?","",""

"440030719386058762","CiPhEr#2091","09-Jan-20 07:14 AM","seems there might be an ""Ethereum info file"" required that starts out with ""swap_contract_address"":""0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871"" would this address be the same for any erc20 token? Would this file be placed into my atomicDEX-API/target/debug/ folder?
I have no idea what I would put in the url / contact fields, all of this seems more like if I was applying to have a coin listed into adex?","",""

I know there is a lot of work going on in the background but github looks a bit dead.
I suggest adding a bit of info in the readme and perhaps a link there to the playstore app.
Also if it's possible, you should be adding the release versions to the 'releases' tab, even if it is just links to the playstore. Perhaps adding what fixes/features etc. have been done.
I expect more serious people will be looking for info on github rather than playstore and at least they can see something is happening.","",""
