What i see up to now, those guys are scammers. and being partner with RFOX makes me very nervous btc benny and whatever (re @Regnar: No idea tbh. I don't know much about them and honestly don't keep track of every project in the ecosystem. I think you are right about Redfox working with them though so they might have more info in the RFOX channel.
I did just search a little in discord and saw there is some relation between Zaddex and Dune (Tezos fork?) But I know even less about Dune and Tezos lol. 
I suggest trying the Redfox channel for that question)","",""

"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","09-Jan-20 08:13 PM","[telegram] <Regnar> Yes it does! The AtomicAPI is the backend engine that let's anyone build a DEX using the API and immediately get access to a single shared liquidity pool. This means HyperDEX desktop app shares liquidity with Chainswap desktop app, which shares liquidity with AtomicDEX mobile app, and anyone else, even if they are JUST running the engine on their computer. 
So these DEXs all have their different fee structures built into their GUI (The API gives fee ability to be easily implemented for GUI developers) to make revenues as people use their GUI, but still share liquidity with other GUIs.
See developer docs here:
