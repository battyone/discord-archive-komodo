Is there a plan to somehow allow t-address -transactions for the purpose of atomic swaps? If t-address has to be allowed for this particular purpose, could it be possible to limit the transactions to fixed amounts, like 10, 100, 1000,10k, 100k? This way metadata leakage related to sums might not give away so much information. Or has someone come up with a way to do z-address atomic swaps?","",""
