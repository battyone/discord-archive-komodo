I went to Github and saw the komodo 0.5.0 obsidon dragon file, downloaded it, but have no clue what to do from there. I have komodo on a Linux machine, and I also have a windows 7 machine. I don't use the komodo, but needed to start it so I could then run THC on an associated chain, and it all  works fine, but now I am told I have to upgrade komodo before the THC fork Dec 20. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thx.","",""
"272003866906722306","TonyL#3577","17-Dec-19 09:37 PM","Just:
1) replace current komodod binary you have with binary from 0.5.0 release archive
restart THC chain:
2) stop THC chain (`./komodo-cli -ac_name=THC stop`)
3) start THC chain with new binary
