Hi, 
We've added RedFOX (RFOX) to http://zpool.ca/ equihash. See below for connection details.

Fee only: 1.15% or less
BTC payouts are processed once a day for balances above 0.0025
Payouts for all other currencies are made automatically every 4 hours for balances above 0.05 and balances more than 0.0125 are included in one of the payouts each day.

- Sample configurations -
To mine and get paid in RFOX:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u RFOX_ADDRESS -p c=RFOX,zap=RFOX``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only RFOX:
```-a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.mine.zpool.ca:2142 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=RFOX```

All of our ports are NiceHash friendly, no need to specify any extra details

We also provide stratum servers in:
Europe: `equihash.eu.mine.zpool.ca:2142`
South East Asia: `equihash.sea.mine.zpool.ca:2142`
Japan: `equihash.jp.mine.zpool.ca:2142`

the pool is a legit pool

[17-Dec-19 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's actually one of the 1st pools I mined in when I started mining

I'm just confused as to "why now?" 8 months after most interest in it died down
Was there an announcement for RFOX that I missed?

dont  know  -  I  did talk with  him/them on Linkd in  - he  said  they have  some  things  they  are  working  on  that is very cutting  edge with larger  corporations  -  they  do not use Discord  ATM
