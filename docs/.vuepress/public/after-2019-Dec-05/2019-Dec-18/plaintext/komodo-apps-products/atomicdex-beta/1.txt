@ca333 could you please check difference between columns <2 columns to create password when restoring> and <column where to enter password when logging back to existing wallet>. First <2 columns> seems like leaking, but second not leaking....

[17-Dec-19 12:13 AM] fazer#0903
just create and confirm password by restoring offers word autocomplete.

[17-Dec-19 12:14 AM] fazer#0903
but enter password to existing does not offer word autocomplete

[17-Dec-19 12:15 AM] fazer#0903
i will check it more tomorrow. now is too late here to use brain... sleeping....

[17-Dec-19 12:16 AM] ca333#0118
the above one is from the password creation page - however, the unlock wallet pw-field has the same setup.

[17-Dec-19 12:17 AM] ca333#0118
if you don't mind could you please DM me info about your phone model.

Why isn't the ability to see liquidity for pairs without having deposited said coins possible?

[17-Dec-19 02:20 AM] klein#5233
Seems like a pretty essential feature

[17-Dec-19 02:23 AM] klein#5233
Like having a tab at the top right next to "History"

[17-Dec-19 02:23 AM] klein#5233
"View Orderbooks"

[17-Dec-19 02:24 AM] klein#5233
>select pair

[17-Dec-19 02:25 AM] klein#5233
degenerate gamblers want this plus its useful

[17-Dec-19 04:01 AM] klein#5233
Depth plus  time and sales would be nice

[17-Dec-19 08:07 AM] smk762#7640

All of my KMD to DEX trades seem to fail (either not getting paired or fail at step 2 "swap in progress"). Tried several days, several small and bigger trades but same result. Other trades work fine (ie BTC to KMD worked fine yesterday).

[17-Dec-19 04:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I cleared most of the orderbook @ 0,05xxx DEX per KMD but they are now either failed of i can cancel them in the order tab but nothing is happening

[17-Dec-19 04:08 PM] gcharang#6833
there seems to be a maker for DEX who hasn't updated in quite a while
a feature to locally ban bad makers is in development

[17-Dec-19 04:12 PM] jorian#4555
you want to buy DEX?

[17-Dec-19 04:15 PM] TonyL#3577
best working order in AtomicDEX @22 KMD at the moment (just bought a little)

[17-Dec-19 04:24 PM] Oszy#5734
One at 22 works fine

[17-Dec-19 06:11 PM] aldomex#2968
what should I do when a trade is sending a message as "Timed out" but the coins are not back to my wallet?

[17-Dec-19 06:13 PM] gcharang#6833
let the app stay in the background and wait for upto 4 hours
they should come back automatically

[17-Dec-19 06:13 PM] aldomex#2968
ok, thanks

[17-Dec-19 06:22 PM] richardt#2807
Could there be some kind of pop-up message that informs users about what happens when a swap fails? Seems like that's the majority of complaints here and the same answer has to be given over and over

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #131 Give a hint to a user about unlock Time when swap times out or fails
Indicate the approximate amount of time to wait for the coins to be available for a swap again.

[17-Dec-19 06:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Now i got a more serious problem: made a decent swap with KMD to DEX and now my DEX app is empty

[17-Dec-19 06:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
all wallets gone 😅

[17-Dec-19 06:45 PM] wl#4107
Why the change sounds never stops?

[17-Dec-19 06:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@CoinKing88 can you send the log to me in DM ?
in the meanwhile, search your address in an explorer. you should see the coins
please wait to reinstall it
we might need your installation to stay like that for debugging

[17-Dec-19 06:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
busy now ill be back in a hour

[17-Dec-19 06:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@wl tldr: it is for iOS to allow the app to stay alive in the background
this post has all the info: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/584762059430821909/653639320640552961

Good day. I just sent BTC from the AtomicDEX Android app to a segwit address starting with 3. Or I tried, because after sending I saw that the app did not send to my address, but it sent to a legacy address that I don't know and that never received funds before. How come the Android AtomicDEX sends to an unknown legacy BTC address when sending to a BTC segwit address?

[17-Dec-19 08:27 PM] Acura#2748
Segwit actually not supported in AtomicDex

[17-Dec-19 08:32 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@TonyL @smk762 can anybody help me with above? @gcharang is offline

[17-Dec-19 08:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Have you already tried to restart the phone?

[17-Dec-19 08:35 PM] neonesk#9055
Steps to reproduce:
1. Use AtomicDEX on Android, version 0.1.4-6d
2. Tap Bitcoin
3. Tap Send
4. Fill in amount & segwit adres
5. Tap "Withdraw"
6. See segwit address show up in confirmation screen
https://i.imgur.com/t0NSmKV.jpg
7. Tap "Confirm"
8. See BTC sent to a legacy address instead of the address in confirmation screen

`1. Use AtomicDEX on Android, version 0.1.4-6d` is `very` old version, please update

{Reactions}
👌

[17-Dec-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
actual version is 0.2.8, you're using version almost half of year old. New mm2 and GUI not allow to send btc to segwit addresses

[17-Dec-19 08:37 PM] neonesk#9055
That sounds good. Didn't know I was on an old version like that 😮

[17-Dec-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
0.1.4 was released on Jul 24 😅

[17-Dec-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
legacy already hehe

[17-Dec-19 08:39 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@TonyL ill try that first

{Reactions}

[17-Dec-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
If it'll not help please DM me the app log (settings -> send log)

[17-Dec-19 08:51 PM] neonesk#9055
@TonyL Thanks for your replies! The Play Store said I installed the latest version. Though the app still said 0.1.4-6d. Had to uninstall app & re-install again to see the latest Android app version, 0.2.8. When I try to send to a segwit address is now shows "Error, please try later". That's good & safe.

[17-Dec-19 08:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Always glad to help! From my experience Play Store got some problems with caching (sometimes Play Store cache clearing helps to see the new version)

[17-Dec-19 11:15 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
To recap, we can't disable the sounds for now, but we're making them configurable. The option to pick a local sound file is in the works.

Now, I wonder if someone else likes to create sounds, with https://tonematrix.audiotool.com/ ( https://youtu.be/TaeeiLzfVmc ) and the like? I wonder what the consensus would be on adding support for such custom sounds into the AtomicDEX sound configuration.
