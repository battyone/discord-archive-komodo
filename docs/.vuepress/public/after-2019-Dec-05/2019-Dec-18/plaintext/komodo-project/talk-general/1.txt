BDoS: Blockchain Denial of Service. Attacker incentivizes miners to stop with far less than 51%, bringing a Nakamoto-like chain to a halt if miners are profit-driven.

TL;DR We have discovered a denial-of-service attack on Bitcoin-like blockchains that is much cheaper than previously described attacks. Such blockchains rely on incentives to provide security. We show how an attacker can disrupt those incentives to cause rational miners to stop mining. Technical report here.

[17-Dec-19 05:49 PM] phm87#7395

@ellenoor  Verus Discord can better help you,  I do know that SPV servers were being updated so that might have something to do with it

[17-Dec-19 08:22 PM] crumb#2550
if only people would use correct terminology... staking means something else entirely. tweeting about KMD staking will just confuse a lot of people who are not familiar with Komodo
