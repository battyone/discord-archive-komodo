[17-Dec-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763

What Is Automated Market Making and Why Does It Matter?
In the world of traditional trading, automated market making is a relatively new technology. Automation replaced human market makers who were the worker bees of trading pits. For decades, manually created order books were seen as a staple of the industry. Then came computers ...
https://digitexfutures.com/assets/thumbnail/6574.jpg

[17-Dec-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Market makers are automated trading bots that possess specialized algorithms. These algorithms are neither programmed to hoard tokens, nor to strip away profits, instead, they are programmed to break even. This their break-even algorithms makes them participate actively in trading, and thus these bots keep the DGTX token(s) in circulation. They are funded by 20% of the tokens currently in circulation.

[17-Dec-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's a few paragraphs of bullshit jumbled together ... You think they are okay with break-even algos? Me, I don't believe a damn thing that any centralized exchange says. They aren't here to market make, for you or for me. They are here to profit. That is what am exchange does.

[17-Dec-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why do they need to provide liquidity? 
Because it won't be there otherwise.

[17-Dec-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> A centralized exchange does everything with one thing in mind, and that is to profit.

[17-Dec-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Look at Topia

[17-Dec-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> ofcourse they want to make profit. But plenty of people lose with trading as well

[17-Dec-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Don't you see?
