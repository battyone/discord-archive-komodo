[17-Dec-19 03:19 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea maybe if 5k sat support doesn't hold first

[17-Dec-19 03:20 PM] coingirl87#6489
No TA i have seen here worked

[17-Dec-19 03:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
Volume is too low to work with TA

[17-Dec-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
not true

[17-Dec-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
last pump to 13k was hitting target perfectly

[17-Dec-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
retraced to 0.618 fib from previous high

[17-Dec-19 03:24 PM] Markus#5464
our current bottom of 5k was also a target on the weekly chart

[17-Dec-19 03:24 PM] Markus#5464
and it worked very well

[17-Dec-19 03:26 PM] coingirl87#6489
My TA says that kmd go somewhere between 1k and 1000k in next year

3K would be a cool christmas present

[17-Dec-19 03:27 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
5k sat prob low as it will go unless BTC goes to 100k then I can see below 5k sats

[17-Dec-19 03:28 PM] KTnoc#4131
100K is for 2022 üòÑ

[17-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Markus#5464
btc dumped 2-3% kmd just dumped twice that in btc valueation

[17-Dec-19 03:28 PM] Markus#5464
and almost 10% in usd

[17-Dec-19 03:29 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
well have to figure in that the gains were fake on KMD since exchange deposits were offline during that rally

[17-Dec-19 03:30 PM] Markus#5464
well it was probably some binance whale taking advantage of the situation

[17-Dec-19 03:30 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I'll be happy if 5k sats holds

[17-Dec-19 03:31 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
will prob take 3-5 years for organic growth as new users find out about AtomicDex

[17-Dec-19 03:58 PM] Tnrgdk#8251
ƒ∞f it will be 3k, i will sell my var and Buy kmd

[17-Dec-19 04:08 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
all the money is going into US equities cause the FED is printing and propping everything up.... until that fails crypto will prob stay bearish

[17-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464
ppl betting on btc going to 1-3k, to me its ridiculous but we will see

[17-Dec-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464
i can see 5k happening tho

[17-Dec-19 04:37 PM] Markus#5464
not so far away from now so it can be realistic

[17-Dec-19 04:45 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea 5k seems realistic

[17-Dec-19 04:47 PM] Oszy#5734
anything can happen considering it went from 4k to 13k in 2 months this year

[17-Dec-19 04:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we are about to completely invaliate the impulse up in USD chart

[17-Dec-19 05:04 PM] Markus#5464

BTC dominance is going up. Bullish c fork and bullish WW

[17-Dec-19 05:53 PM] Markus#5464
printing bullflag on btc monthly dominance chart

[17-Dec-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
i remember a discussion like a year ago in here that btc dominance could reach up to 90% it might actually happen after all

[17-Dec-19 07:07 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm fine with Btc at 90%, as long as we make it to 1%. üòÉ

[17-Dec-19 07:57 PM] KTnoc#4131
wen 3k @Markus ?

[17-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Not ek

[17-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Bittersweet#9376
3k*

[17-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Bittersweet#9376
4-4.5k

[17-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Maybe in 4/2020?

[17-Dec-19 08:12 PM] jspook16#3059
Dark times ahead it seems

[17-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Maybe 5/2020

[17-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Cristal ball told me long time ago July 2021 is reversal ‚è≤Ô∏è

[17-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Also hope everyone is doing well üëã

[17-Dec-19 08:36 PM] coingirl87#6489
Not for waves and tezos

[17-Dec-19 08:36 PM] coingirl87#6489
Lol

[17-Dec-19 08:36 PM] coingirl87#6489
Good projects with good demand

[17-Dec-19 08:36 PM] coingirl87#6489

[17-Dec-19 08:39 PM] kaks#6612

[17-Dec-19 09:07 PM] CoinKing88#1540
KMD is getting very very cheap

[17-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Mark81#4505
Hey, it's a buying opportunity! üòÇ

[17-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Waiting on bank loan approval

[17-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Let‚Äôs go boys

[17-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
:awthanks:

[17-Dec-19 09:12 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Getting into debt to buy crypto is the worst idea ever

[17-Dec-19 09:13 PM] CoinKing88#1540
But i guess you are just trolling

[17-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I‚Äôm not trolling hahaha. It‚Äôs smart debt imo. If I was going to buy 1000kmd a week for 2 years

[17-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Why not all now then pay it slowly. $1000 or so interest isn‚Äôt so bad

[17-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If I think komodo will be at least 5-10% higher anytime in 2 years

[17-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Taking into account 5.1% reward as well

[17-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Getting my credit score up

[17-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And forced savings üòÇ maybe not a smart thing to do

[17-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But not horribly bad either

[17-Dec-19 09:20 PM] crumb#2550
taking a loan to buy anything has risk. if a person can keep making monthly payments even if investment made with loaned money fails, you'd still be OK

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] crumb#2550
one way to think of it is: if you buy a huge flatscreen tv. you have also lost your money. and a lot of time will be spent behind that, so double loss

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Hypothetically if I were to hold like I‚Äôve done for past years. Add in 5% kmd interest

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Bank loans roughly 4%

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Not bad to get all 2 years of buying in at this price

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Unless we drop for 2 more years üòÇ

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] crumb#2550
4% apr is not bad at all

[17-Dec-19 09:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Well 9

[17-Dec-19 09:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But 5% kmd rewards

[17-Dec-19 09:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
üòÅ

[17-Dec-19 09:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Also have a whole 2 years to sell at profit and pay off early if wanted. Once again it‚Äôs a risk, but to me it‚Äôs a decent one

[17-Dec-19 09:22 PM] CoinKing88#1540
5% of 0 is still 0

[17-Dec-19 09:22 PM] crumb#2550
small loans tend to be over 10% or in some cases over 15% even

[17-Dec-19 09:23 PM] crumb#2550
i highly doubt it would be 0

[17-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Well if komodo goes to 0, my past few years of life have already gone üòÇ

[17-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
What is another year or so of payments

[17-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Kmd toptech kek :PeepoThink:

Blockchain gaming alliance what is that

[17-Dec-19 09:34 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Kmd amd partnership? üò¨

[17-Dec-19 10:02 PM] Markus#5464
since they mention eth i dont think so

[17-Dec-19 10:06 PM] richardt#2807
Anything under 50 cents is a good buy

[17-Dec-19 10:06 PM] richardt#2807
Looks like another opportunity here

[17-Dec-19 10:06 PM] richardt#2807
