I have not seen such levels of delusion with the amount of people bashing HEX

[17-Dec-19 01:16 AM] klein#5233
USD kmd pairs would be awesome is this happening? If KMD is going to be listed on US binance now would be the time

[17-Dec-19 01:43 AM] tolken#2655
Indeed, but keep in mind Bittrex has usd Kmd pairs already

[17-Dec-19 01:44 AM] klein#5233
HEX sounds like it has a decent size community that could onboard more users and volume to AtomicDex

[17-Dec-19 01:45 AM] klein#5233
(I own zero HEX)

[17-Dec-19 01:48 AM] tolken#2655
You‚Äôre saying it isn‚Äôt a scam?

[17-Dec-19 01:48 AM] klein#5233
theres also some Gold back erc20 tokens

[17-Dec-19 01:49 AM] klein#5233
would be cool to see atomic swaps for gold

[17-Dec-19 01:50 AM] tolken#2655
yeah, paxg I think is one of them

[17-Dec-19 01:50 AM] tolken#2655
tempted try and get some onto atomic dex.

[17-Dec-19 01:50 AM] klein#5233
a Gold stablecoin on komodo would be cooler

[17-Dec-19 01:51 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, still a little ways off still. But yes.

[17-Dec-19 01:52 AM] tolken#2655
one thing I‚Äôm not clear on with KmD loans. Seems with such low volumes for Kmd, price can be thrown around like a rag doll and seemingly lead to easy liquidations. Maybe not so easy, but seems so.

[17-Dec-19 01:52 AM] klein#5233
@tolken I was out of the loop but recently listened to Peter McCormack/What bitcoin did podcast guy with Richard Heart

[17-Dec-19 01:52 AM] klein#5233
What a moron

[17-Dec-19 01:52 AM] tolken#2655
I guess that would just be when using Kmd as collateral.

[17-Dec-19 01:53 AM] klein#5233
People bashing HEX without even putting any effort into understanding it are morons

[17-Dec-19 01:54 AM] klein#5233
and also are delusional and incapable of any sort of self reflection

[17-Dec-19 01:54 AM] klein#5233
look a where we are standing right now

[17-Dec-19 01:54 AM] tolken#2655
yea not too bright to dismiss without any real understanding, but it does seem fishy at first glance.

[17-Dec-19 01:54 AM] klein#5233
This is crypto

[17-Dec-19 01:56 AM] klein#5233
Its risky

[17-Dec-19 01:56 AM] klein#5233
crypto has had exponential growth

[17-Dec-19 01:56 AM] klein#5233
traded like a pump and dump

[17-Dec-19 01:57 AM] klein#5233
as far as I can tell Richard has been brutally honest about that

[17-Dec-19 01:57 AM] klein#5233
Denying bitcoin is any different you are absolutely delusional

[17-Dec-19 01:59 AM] tolken#2655
bitcoin is a much simpler concept to grasp@in my opinion.

[17-Dec-19 02:08 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
Let‚Äôs make a KMD airdrop and call it say ‚ÄúDEX‚Äù and do the same thing Richard did just to get the plebs attention and create a Twitter shit storm ü§ì

[17-Dec-19 02:15 AM] klein#5233
more volume on atomicdex would be of some value as opposed to trolling

[17-Dec-19 02:16 AM] klein#5233
one thing that I found frustrating with the AtomicDex app that is bad for onboarding users: Why can't you view the liquidity and trades without having deposited any coins?

[17-Dec-19 02:33 AM] tolken#2655
You want more volume for volume sake, or you mean there‚Äôs not enough liquidity for your trades? @klein

[17-Dec-19 02:34 AM] tolken#2655
Kmd volume specifically or you mean other pairs?

[17-Dec-19 02:36 AM] klein#5233
Total traded volume

[17-Dec-19 02:36 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs relatively easy to make the orderbooks (i assume this is where you‚Äôre viewing/estimating liquidity) viewable. I‚Äôm sure devs are just really trying to nail down the reliability first, but agreed it would be very welcome to see.

[17-Dec-19 02:36 AM] klein#5233
and more users

[17-Dec-19 02:37 AM] klein#5233
Yeah I get its still beta devs are doing amazing work

[17-Dec-19 02:37 AM] tolken#2655
Seems like some would have to manually track that, unless somehow it‚Äôs recorded to an Oracle at some point.

[17-Dec-19 02:37 AM] tolken#2655
Would be badass of it ultimately ends up stored like that.

[17-Dec-19 04:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@klein saying i am running a ponzi does it make it any less legal? Let's call a spade a spade, he gets 50% of all the coins, it is a scam to make him rich, well deserving of the hatred.

[17-Dec-19 04:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Every scam damages the rest of the cryptos actually trying to benefit society

[17-Dec-19 05:45 AM] coingirl87#6489
Lol....you make jokes about waves...look where they are and look what happened to komodo

[17-Dec-19 05:50 AM] coingirl87#6489
Seems that natural selection of good projects with demand will begin

[17-Dec-19 06:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Time will tell who will last,  but waves being only 10 or so spots ahead is not impressive when they raised 10x .

[17-Dec-19 06:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Their current marketcap is less than half of what he raised .  Komodos is 3.5x what was raised.  Who is doing better?

[17-Dec-19 06:07 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd is best coin ...üëç

[17-Dec-19 06:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just comparing apples to apples.

[17-Dec-19 06:12 AM] coingirl87#6489
In tech view its not possible...kmd is a big  fresh apple and most of all others were old wringled  pears

[17-Dec-19 06:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tech wise we are top tier most of our competitors though aren‚Äôt in the traditional coin space except tendermint via cosmos.

[17-Dec-19 06:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
Only projects we can compare were eth and tezos

[17-Dec-19 06:36 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes they have much more funds but to whom we should compare?

[17-Dec-19 06:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
subaru?

[17-Dec-19 06:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
Biggest problem is demand...i Analyse  that after every big pump for kmd the supernet address  raised the amount. That means that the biggest part from demand came from kmd itself....i dont know if its good but i think it would be better if demand came from outside, new users....

[17-Dec-19 06:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
the killer applications are being built. not much else you can do besides hype. It's getting pretty ungly out there right now though.

[17-Dec-19 06:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_manufacturing_companies_by_revenue  this list, I'd say KMD is like the Lockheed-Martin of blockchain. Pirate is the skunkworks.

falling wedge is good most of the time

[17-Dec-19 09:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
that is what i hear all the TA gurus on youtube say anyways

[17-Dec-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@coingirl87 we are in a marathon not a sprint. It does not matter where they are short term, i know where KMD will be long term.

[17-Dec-19 10:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
@hyperDEX also in a marathon we could be one of the best

[17-Dec-19 10:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
Its not a matter of distance

[17-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
I like how ppl defend with bittrex got usd pairs for kmd, that exchange is literally dead tried to trade on it cant even get filled

[17-Dec-19 11:09 AM] Markus#5464
not to mention they have bots that keep posting and canceling orders non stop

[17-Dec-19 11:42 AM] richardt#2807
