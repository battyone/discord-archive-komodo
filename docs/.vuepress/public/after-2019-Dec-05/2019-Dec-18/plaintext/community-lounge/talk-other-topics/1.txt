the explanation frame of Bitcoin's robustness predicts,

1. Robustness against malicious hacking of bitcoin systems.

2. Resisting vitality despite near-cursive criticism from elites and media.

3. Maintaining a dominant position in relation to alternative technologies, including ethereum.

4. CBDC(credit-monetary central banknotes) are inherently difficult to replace.

In particular, as we saw through the example of Libra, most of the projects are in limbo at the stage of the conception, rather than replacing Bitcoin.

well... good intentions... but of course carefully read the fine print and listen to what eg Fifi Lagarde has to say to this.. üê©

bit weird

[17-Dec-19 02:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
she made clear what she understands under the term 'privacy' in a speech a year or so ago...
like, privacy from being watched by baaaad üëø  guys, but when the ECB watches, that must be goood.. üëº  right?!?! ... _RIGHT?!??!_

[17-Dec-19 02:45 PM] LocoMB#8593
for Fifi, semi-privacy  is something similar to semi-pregnant, no problem at all, just a matter of perspective

Winds of Change: The Case for New Digital Currency
By Christine Lagarde, IMF Managing Director
Singapore Fintech Festival, November 14, 2018

c) Privacy
The third benefit of digital currency I would like to highlight lies in the privacy domain.
Cash, of course, allows for anonymous payments. We reach for cash to protect our privacy
for legitimate reasons: to avoid exposure to hacking and customer profiling, for instance.
...
Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency?
Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals.
..:
Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the
background. If a suspicion arose it would be possible to lift the veil of anonymity and
investigate.
...
This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to
cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration.
...
The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially
semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments.

[17-Dec-19 04:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
.... ü§£  sure, Fifi, _semi-anonymous_ so that the veil can be lifted if a suspicion arose ü§£ .. as somebody wanted .. üíê

Stock-to-flow model predicts the long term trend, and greed & fear cause the actual bitcoin price to dance around this trend. #cointegration
