@cipi , the log can be found at /data/data/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter, but in order to access it you'd usually need the debug version of the app, as it allows for `run-as`:

```
adb shell
run-as com.komodoplatform.atomicdex
cd /data/data/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter
ls -laF

Usually when we start the native wallet it needs some time to synchronize the chain. What might have happened in this case is that perhaps the swaps were failing due to chain not being fully synchronized yet; the pubkey was (temporarily?) banned due to failed swaps; later both problems resolved.
(Would be cool for the peers to exchange the blockchain number during the order matching and detect this problem early - just a note to myself).","","👍 (1)"
