Nice work @dukeleto with testnet.  I was reading how kusama (polkadot) testnet works yesterday.  Sort of like KMDLABS

to put it very simply, the chain params say "you'll pay this much to *a* payments CC plan" then the data in earlytxid opret specifies which payment plan it must pay

Ok yep familiar at high level with this and read code during dev.
I wonder how retrofitting an existing CC into a dynamically loadable CClib would work for dev onboarding?  I‚Äôll give it a go in my spare time using existing CClib example and maybe faucet cos it‚Äôs simpler than others.
