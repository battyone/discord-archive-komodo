how to convince Binance to reduce confs for KMD deposits? 120 confs makes it the slowest (?) coin for Binance tranfers. shouldnt dPoW alone justify a reduction?

[28-Dec-19 02:47 PM] Regnar#6164
should, but it's hard for them to willingly do things like that. I personally understand. As a business they take risks on accepting any coin at all, and a sure way to mitigate those risks for ALL coins is to raise conf numbers. Easier to do that than to look at each individual project and weigh risks of reducing the conf times.

[28-Dec-19 02:47 PM] Regnar#6164
however I don't mean we shouldn't try and get them to anyway. Just have to keep reaching out and talking about dPoW

120 does seem like overkill

[28-Dec-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
almost every exchange that has 120 did so after that article came out about how easy it was to 51% most chains in the crypto-sphere and they've not been convinced to lower it since

`Easier to do that than to look at each individual project and weigh risks of reducing the conf times.`
yes, that
it was a blanket thing for all equihash coins at the time

On verus agama eallet

restart Agama and start up with the `daemon param: rescan` option (don't use the shortcut on the welcome page but the `Activate coin` button)

[28-Dec-19 08:22 PM] joe_sd#9053
Does it metter if it is 0.5.7-4 wallet ver.

[28-Dec-19 10:35 PM] bishop#9773
Yes, update to the latest. It always surprises me when people ask about issues but don't bother to check the main site and update their wallets.

[28-Dec-19 10:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes to look for "the main site" for Bitcoin_

[28-Dec-19 10:48 PM] joe_sd#9053
@bishop I’ve tried with 0.6.0 it was the same issue
