If you're thoughtful, you can imagine that a currency that doesn't have the ability to store value is useless as a medium of exchange. 
however, the more the ignorant public is used to the concept of a "total society" that the elites claim, the more swayed by this logic.

Elite deeming the gross economy, early on realize that the ability to hedge money granted by unknown individuals interferes with operating the gross economy.

Conflict between individuals and the elite over money as a means of coping with ignorance is an inevitable attribute of the system of currency.

At this time, people are easily misled by the elite, especially the currency as a medium of exchange, which can exist independently of the nature of dealing with uncertainty.
