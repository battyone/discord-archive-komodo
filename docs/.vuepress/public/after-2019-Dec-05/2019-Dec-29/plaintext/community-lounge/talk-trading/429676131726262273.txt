Ok... ü§îü§î

[28-Dec-19 10:58 AM] Acura#2748
Did you also write here when KMD was worth more than Waves ?

[28-Dec-19 11:07 AM] phm87#7395
Good for waves hodler. But with low volume, I don t think that it will hodl

I write it here because many make jokes about waves....some weeks ago waves was behind kmd and now 50% more....ü§î

[28-Dec-19 11:20 AM] coingirl87#6489
Low volume?? Waves volume is round about 50x kmd volume

[28-Dec-19 11:25 AM] Acura#2748
Technically Waves is a joke compared to Komodo (in my opinion)

üëÜ üíØ üî•

[28-Dec-19 11:25 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...maybe some volume is fake but same for kmd...whole bilaxy volume (800.000$) is fake....kmd volume on binance is ridiculous 50k üôà

[28-Dec-19 11:26 AM] Acura#2748
WoW - Dogecoin have more volume as Komodo ... and now ? ^^

[28-Dec-19 11:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
And probably volume on binace came from supernet account

[28-Dec-19 11:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
There is sadly no demand for kmd

[28-Dec-19 11:31 AM] Acura#2748
Then please sell all your kmd - now you have the Solution üëçüèª

[28-Dec-19 11:32 AM] coingirl87#6489
You dont listen to me...i often say i never will sell my kmd for such a low price

[28-Dec-19 11:32 AM] Acura#2748
So you no longer have to worry about prices and volume.

[28-Dec-19 11:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
Wromg....if there no higher price and no volume i never can sell my kmd

[28-Dec-19 11:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
So they are worthless

[28-Dec-19 11:33 AM] Acura#2748
then why do you get upset here once a week?

[28-Dec-19 11:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats not my goal

[28-Dec-19 11:33 AM] Acura#2748
What's your purpose here?

[28-Dec-19 11:34 AM] Acura#2748
You can also set a sellwall - then you can sell your kmd , no need to do a marketsell

[28-Dec-19 11:34 AM] coingirl87#6489
Same purpose like you...you post optimistic ta

[28-Dec-19 11:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
I post true facts which are not optimistic

[28-Dec-19 11:35 AM] Acura#2748
and now ?

[28-Dec-19 11:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
You inform people

[28-Dec-19 11:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
I inform people

[28-Dec-19 11:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
Whats the problem?

[28-Dec-19 11:36 AM] coingirl87#6489
By the way i like it to upset you

[28-Dec-19 11:36 AM] coingirl87#6489
üòâ

[28-Dec-19 11:37 AM] Acura#2748
Yes you write things that are not true, such as that apparently the SuperNet account on binance is responsible - lol - Jl does not trade on CEX

[28-Dec-19 11:38 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok my informations are wrong?

[28-Dec-19 11:38 AM] coingirl87#6489
Waves not near 1$

[28-Dec-19 11:38 AM] coingirl87#6489
Vomume is not 50x kmd volume

[28-Dec-19 11:38 AM] coingirl87#6489
Waves was not behind kmd few weeks ago?

[28-Dec-19 11:39 AM] coingirl87#6489
Okok...

[28-Dec-19 11:39 AM] coingirl87#6489
I am so sorry

[28-Dec-19 11:39 AM] Acura#2748
"And probably volume on binace came from supernet account" WRONG FACT

[28-Dec-19 11:39 AM] Acura#2748
stop posting wrong facts üòâ

[28-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Acura#2748
And what do you get out of all these examples?

[28-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Acura#2748
Every week always the same with you, always complaining, volume too low, there is no interest, nobody wants to kmd - It has become boring - you have no new arguments ?

[28-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Acura#2748
üôÑ

[28-Dec-19 11:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
Lol...the problem is that my arguments are all correct

[28-Dec-19 11:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
You post  ta where kmd go to moon

[28-Dec-19 11:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
Wow

[28-Dec-19 11:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
No ta came true

[28-Dec-19 11:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
My arguments are all the time the same because thats the problems of kmd...no volume, no demand, no interest

[28-Dec-19 11:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
For you it seems boring but thats the truth

[28-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Acura#2748
Okay, so you have no new arguments-- it's boring. Write with someone else.

[28-Dec-19 11:45 AM] Acura#2748
I ask myself all the time what you want to achieve with your complaining texts?  üòÑ

[28-Dec-19 11:45 AM] coingirl87#6489
Problem is that nobody respond to my arguments

[28-Dec-19 12:43 PM] smk762#7640
depth graph implies no one wants to sell.

[28-Dec-19 12:55 PM] Markus#5464
waves price increassing and volume decreassing is pretty bearish

[28-Dec-19 12:56 PM] Markus#5464
watch it go back down to where it started

[28-Dec-19 01:07 PM] phm87#7395
I agree with Markus but I also agree with CoinGirl87 about the absence of volume on KMD and no clear direction for price (except maybe the bearich altcoin trend). Maybe we will have good surprises coming from Asia

[28-Dec-19 01:24 PM] richardt#2807
KMD has been looking quite weak for alot of 2019. Some pumps here and there, but back to bear market lows (USD) multiple times

[28-Dec-19 01:25 PM] richardt#2807
Good thing it's almost 2020. Maybe better luck next year

[28-Dec-19 01:27 PM] richardt#2807
Alot will depend on how BTC behaves after halving

[28-Dec-19 01:33 PM] richardt#2807
Another way to see it is that KMD hasn't broken below bear market lows despite going there multiple times, so probably a good range for accumulation.

[28-Dec-19 01:36 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I'm adding on every pull back..... 5200 sats 6500 sats.... 7200 sats.....

[28-Dec-19 01:37 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I'm in for the long term potential , when DEX becomes the standard

[28-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Privatoshi#9487

Is Bitcoin correction really over, or is it a Bull trap? for BNC:B...
isn't that happen too quickly, i mean just before around 40 days bitcoin prices pumped meteorically from 4200 to 4800 on a rumor of a fake news which was circulated as april fool joke that SEC approves Bitcoin's ETF, and weird thing is that no one panics even after this news ...

fibonacci retracement is a powerful tool

[28-Dec-19 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
1100 BTC/USD is unlikely imo

[28-Dec-19 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
unless government destroys BTC

[28-Dec-19 04:26 PM] jorian#4555
but in other regard, BTC is much like gold, which is starting to get bullish

[28-Dec-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
hard to say but im sure those giant btc farms in china have breakeven point probably between 2000-3000 per btc, quite sure they have asic miners that are not released to the average joe

[28-Dec-19 04:27 PM] jorian#4555
of course

[28-Dec-19 04:27 PM] jorian#4555
why sell

[28-Dec-19 04:27 PM] jorian#4555
you literally create your own competition

[28-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Markus#5464
well they do sell it when they already used it for a year and its half burnt already and by then have newer once with way more hashrate

[28-Dec-19 04:28 PM] Markus#5464
easy ROI üòÑ

[28-Dec-19 04:28 PM] jorian#4555
"if you're good at something, never do it for free" kind of applies here

[28-Dec-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
for sure

[28-Dec-19 05:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
given a network hashrate of 97 EH/s (this is subjected to adjustment), 10 minutes block time, elec. price of $0.05/kwh (super cheap), ASIC efficiency of 40J/TH (advertised on bitmain site, not available yet), the mining cost of a BTC would be:
```
97,000,000*600*40*0.05/3,600,000/12.5 = $2587
```

Ahhhhhh, the great "I'm not a CEO" exit pump in the making

[28-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Markus#5464
below 7k its pretty much free fall for kmd, orderbook very thin below 7k

[28-Dec-19 06:44 PM] richardt#2807
Don't think many are willing to sell below 7k sats though

[28-Dec-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
down it goes

[28-Dec-19 06:58 PM] coingirl87#6489
@Markus are u suprised about that?

[28-Dec-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
nope, u have a huge descending triangle on 4H

[28-Dec-19 07:02 PM] coingirl87#6489
Where kmd goes? Under 5k?

[28-Dec-19 07:02 PM] Markus#5464
nobody knows

[28-Dec-19 07:02 PM] coingirl87#6489
I mean on your ta

[28-Dec-19 07:03 PM] Markus#5464
target of this descending triangle would be 6.8k but they dont rly tend to get the full target reached

[28-Dec-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
7k might hold

[28-Dec-19 07:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok..i hope so

[28-Dec-19 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
ofc depends on what btc does
