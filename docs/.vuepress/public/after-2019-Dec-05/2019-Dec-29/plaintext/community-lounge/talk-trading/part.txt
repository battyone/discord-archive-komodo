if btc suddenly moonshots 500$ then 7k probably will get wiped out

[28-Dec-19 07:06 PM] Markus#5464
good sign is that litecoin making moves

[28-Dec-19 07:07 PM] Markus#5464
litecoin tend to lead alt seasons

[28-Dec-19 07:07 PM] coingirl87#6489
That would be great

[28-Dec-19 07:16 PM] richardt#2807
How long have we been waiting for alt season now? üòÑ

[28-Dec-19 07:19 PM] SHossain#0007
almost 2 years

[28-Dec-19 07:21 PM] richardt#2807
With BTC halving getting closer, it's unlikely alt season will happen anytime soon

[28-Dec-19 07:28 PM] Bitfinger#6245
LTC just finished a huge measured move... should be some decent bounce

Now I'll look at the stuff that isn't pumping, bc that is too late to jump in. I was alrasdy in WAVES, so lol.
I think I'll look more at XTZ.

[28-Dec-19 08:01 PM] Privatoshi#9487
0.0001830 btc

[28-Dec-19 08:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Still in LTC

[28-Dec-19 08:02 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Will probably get into BNB, to hold mid-term

[28-Dec-19 08:03 PM] richardt#2807
That's pretty good!  Whenever I trade, I lose. So I just accumulate and wait 3-4 years üòÑ

[28-Dec-19 08:05 PM] Privatoshi#9487
You mean you trade, probably without learning how to read a basic charts... You can't expect to make gains, if you aren't willing to put in a small amount of time to learn. It's not realistic.

[28-Dec-19 08:06 PM] richardt#2807
Even with charts/TA, most traders are unsuccessful

[28-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Markus#5464
but TA doesnt work :troll_lol:

[28-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Markus#5464
ppl made fun of me saying it was just a massive bulltrap when we broke up to 5k.....i quess i was right in the end cause it sure looks that way

[28-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Markus#5464

This post is my updated vision to Bitcoin future price dynamics in context of broken all time log trend (blue in picture).
So the Bitcoin lost its huge momentum to stay in this trend - this was going to happen sooner or later.

Easy to say after the fact. Question is, did you profit from your predictions?

[28-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[28-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Everyone makes bad trades..
Nobody gets it right always

[28-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I make shit trades every once in a while

[28-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Privatoshi#9487
When it becomes more than once in a while, I stop to fix it

[28-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Privatoshi#9487
What good is trading, if you always lose

[28-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Be resourceful. You don't have to always lose.

[28-Dec-19 08:12 PM] richardt#2807
Maybe I should clarify and say, whenever I make short-term trades, I tend to lose

[28-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Pick one coin and only trade it

[28-Dec-19 08:12 PM] richardt#2807
My long terms have been very successful

[28-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Do you have an entry, exit, target and SL?

[28-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Markus#5464
use risk management when u trade, if ur trade goes to shit just exit and accept it instead of holding a loosing position that could make u end up with 30% loss intead of maybe 3%

[28-Dec-19 08:13 PM] Markus#5464
also never trade with whole ur account

[28-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Privatoshi#9487
It sounds lame to some.
But always write down an entry, exit, target and SL.
And set the trade up on the exchange with an OCO, and exit. And don't watch it

[28-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Markus#5464
a great tool for trading i would recommend studying and mastering is fibonacci, its rly powerful

[28-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Trade with only 1-3% of your holdings, that is what the professionals say. Risk management of your port, is key.

[28-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Fibs are legit. I like one specifically

[28-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I don't use crazy color charts

[28-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Support/Resistance, RSI, trend lines and occasionally fibs

[28-Dec-19 08:16 PM] Markus#5464
yepp, rsi is good to spot divergences aswell

[28-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I keep it basic and chart it w/what works for me.
I'm not a TA professional. But I am good enough to do what I need to get done, to have an overall profit in trading

[28-Dec-19 08:17 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I use FA, too

[28-Dec-19 08:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
You could, if you really wanted to, monitor price increases to find good trades

[28-Dec-19 08:25 PM] steinsg8#0288
I believe TA is fake news, prove me wrong üòÇ
