Hi, is the `public AtomicDEX profile` implemented yet?

I heard Q1 2020 or maybe it was in the beginning of 2020

[28-Dec-19 06:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I heard within the next 3 months

[28-Dec-19 06:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
But someone else said before April, so I might be wrong

any idea why AtomicDex might be displaying a different KMD address than when I use the address in mm2 cli? I have checked/rechecked that I typed it in the same probably 20 times. I've checked the formatting/spaces to the best of my knowledge. I should be able to use the same exact pass phrase (generated from AtomicDex) in mm2 cli and have it display the same address right?

[28-Dec-19 08:31 PM] tolken#2655
Certainly not ruling out user error, I just don't know what the discrepancy might be. Everything looks identical.

[28-Dec-19 08:35 PM] tolken#2655
ahh, i see docs are calling for a 24 word phrase, atomicdex generates 12 word. I suppose that's the root of the prob.

[28-Dec-19 08:56 PM] tolken#2655
ahh, forgot about modifying the mm json....

[28-Dec-19 09:00 PM] tolken#2655
That's all it was, cool.

[28-Dec-19 09:06 PM] phm87#7395
what did you change in the mm json to be able to use the other seed ?

[28-Dec-19 09:07 PM] phm87#7395
sorry to ask but I'm curious @tolken

[28-Dec-19 09:56 PM] tolken#2655
well, I for whatever reason put the passphrase in all caps the first time, in the start.sh and then the mm json. Address was  wrong, so made sure case was the same, but forgot to update the mm Jason, that‚Äôs all.
