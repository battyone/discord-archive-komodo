[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So  no more nspv?

[28-Dec-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @AkiraX Unfortunately no

[28-Dec-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @AkiraX 
Privacy or nSPV?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh radix42 took code others wrote for ZEC and put them into KMD

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash still hasn't merged it

[28-Dec-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi and yes, ZUSH is a big deal, but people might not understand

[28-Dec-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> When is zatomicdrx coming

[28-Dec-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I like having my hush tradable

[28-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> In t addresses

[28-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I hope that some transparent features will be kept (just for exchange that prefer to stay in transparant)

[28-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Exactly

[28-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I agree

[28-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's one of the reasons I didn't mine too much arrr

[28-Dec-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> or maybe do a deal with ECB to have the right for privacy (this is a half troll)

[28-Dec-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> How would you feel about that, if zatomicdex was ready and two or three zaddr supported exchanges were running?

[28-Dec-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Ecb?

[28-Dec-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Maybe I'll start mining more hush

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Kek

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @phm87 Try and mine some ZUSH

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It's test coin?

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Try out our new feature

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's awesome

[28-Dec-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I don't have the ac_param of ZUSH, I mined some Hush with NH, I was not lucky with my gpus

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I don't have asics

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Just try it w/CPU

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> ``./hushd -ac_name=ZUSH -ac_private=1 -ac_blocktime=120 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=150000 -addnode=81.169.218.223``

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> dukeleta shared this

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> DukeLeta lol

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hehe

[28-Dec-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yeah I changed his sex accidentally, he won't be mad about it

[28-Dec-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hehe

[28-Dec-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Try this
```./hushd -ac_name=ZUSH -ac_private=1 -ac_blocktime=120 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=150000 -addnode=81.169.218.223```

[28-Dec-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think this is an awesome feature for HUSH

[28-Dec-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I'll compile Hush first ... I'm still using komodo binary everywhere as a standard hammer (I'd like to use it to run BTC but joker didn't tell me all the tricks he did to do it)

[28-Dec-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't understand the Joker reference

[28-Dec-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> blackjok3r told me (maybe on a private channel sorry) that he ran BTC with komodo binary

[28-Dec-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Ahhhh

[28-Dec-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Gotcha

[28-Dec-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> not for mining but for syncing chain and doing tx

[28-Dec-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> because if komodo can be enhanced to be able to catch up any chain on any algo, it can be cool (and BTC is still the biggest coin so it is a good start)

[28-Dec-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> About Hush and Zush, for dpow, some transparant stuff will still be needed

[28-Dec-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yeah I saw dukeleta tweet but I though it was marketing about the unstable branch/test

[28-Dec-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think it's huge if you can run your own HUSH SMARTCHAIN

[28-Dec-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> if I have uptodate ccpeg, I may be interested in running a Hush smartchain for test and fun

[28-Dec-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why not?

[28-Dec-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The implications are ...

[28-Dec-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I like it.

[28-Dec-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I don't think people understand it completely, yet

[28-Dec-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Are you afraid about blockchain analysis on zonly chains such as ARRR or ZUSH ? You showed me papers and ITM it working on his POC and responsible disclosure. If a blockchain analysis found a leak, I don't think that they will warn everybody

[28-Dec-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Me personally, on z-only chains? Not as much, no.

[28-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Sorry I though you were excited about Zuch and I though and Zuch was zonly chain

[28-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think the risk for exposure is greatly reduced.

[28-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @phm87 I am

[28-Dec-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ZUSH is a z-only chain

[28-Dec-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Let me ask you this. If you are a privacy project, and you knew about the risk for users being exposed, their txs---and you could prevent it---would you?

[28-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 z-only chains give blockchain analysts almost nothing to work with

[28-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only mining xtns can be seen

[28-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Is zush thhe deanknumizjng coon

[28-Dec-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No

[28-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> duke : BTCP zpool analysis was easy when I saw the graph : + few millions, - same amount few months later

[28-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZUSH is a test for when HUSH goes z-only. It's a testcoin, or testnet if that makes more sense to you

[28-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> but I can add some deep learning and IA on it

[28-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCP had horrific bugs

[28-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not sure why anybody looks at it, with inflation bugs and some old dev injected zfunds during one of the many airdrops

[28-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i stopped tracking that coin

[28-Dec-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @Privatoshi in the readme pic you sent me earlier, the ``cd src`` should be placed before the ``git checkout dev``

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Lol this is why I like you  @phm87

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 why?

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's missing `cd hush3`

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yeah cd hush3 that's right

[28-Dec-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just fixed it ðŸ™‚

[28-Dec-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you got me, i just typed out the commands from memory ðŸ˜‰

[28-Dec-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Missed that one.

[28-Dec-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I guess that I should compile it before running ``./hush-smart_chain ...``

[28-Dec-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> derp

[28-Dec-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fixed!

[28-Dec-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hey guys, the last thing we would do is leave everyone is a position where there is no liquidity. We understand the concern. We are right there with you.

[28-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes.

[28-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are a good community. 
This won't change.

[28-Dec-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @dukeleto do you plan to send a letter to ECB to ask privacy quotas ? (it can help for marketing if they reply)

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> (* help a lot)

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will be coordinating with the whole ecosystem before pulling the rip cord on this, it's a large change. It's not some "lol we did it last night, fix stuff" kind of thing

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @phm87 I am not a European citizen, not sure why they would want to talk to me

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> if ECB buy some Hush, it can't be bad

[28-Dec-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> why would I do that, instead of writing zaddr code?

[28-Dec-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not interested in ECB buying Hush, I guess.

[28-Dec-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you're interested in it, you ask them.  @phm87

[28-Dec-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I'm not in the active twitter sphere ðŸ˜‰

[28-Dec-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is probably good

[28-Dec-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's settled then lol.

[28-Dec-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What else is going on?  @phm87

[28-Dec-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you like this? Zush

[28-Dec-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Feedback is appreciated

[28-Dec-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> it seems fun, something similar to ARRR but maybe more mature
