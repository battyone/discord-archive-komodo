You know that blockchain has already improved all the industries, but I wonder if there are any solutions for this field. I think that art sphere must be transparent, especially the information about the certain piece of art, it‚Äôs history, dates, centuries, owners, and so on. There are so many fake art pieces. I know that Tilcoin solves these problems, like Fresco, Veristart. But I enjoyed the first one more as it has its own ecosystem and token with benefits like compensations, participation in art events, as well as the high-quality precision.","",""
