All cryptocurrencies I know are experimental, including BTC. Good news is that the script seems compatible between AtomicDEX and submarine swaps. The last attraction for LN reckless users was to feed chicken by paying with LN (a video camera was present in front on chicken, some food was given when you pay a LN invoice). If we can get some of these users interested in doing LABS, Hush or KMD submarine swaps, it can be cool. I used the #developers channel of Hush to discuss my dangerous reckless ideas.","",""

```https://komodoplatform.com/equihash-algorithm/```

I also took some time to scroll through the last 6 months of Komodo's twitter feed to see if Komodo is actually showing any kind of favoritism. As it turns out Hush, received more tweets and retweets than any other ecosystem projects:

```https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fqMuN0oB3wiSMefP4wsAbZqx7IRMTC3Si2hYieNyTNk/edit?usp=sharing```

HUSH received 12 tweets/RTs, whereas Chainzilla and RedFOX labs were in second place with 7 tweets/RTs each.

For anyone interested in taking the time, you can also scroll through Komodo's twitter feed to verify the results.

We've also mentioned Hush in a number of newsletters, as I linked to above.

And, last thing, Hush was actually mentioned (with a link to the website) in the recent announcement about today's upgrade:

```https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-to-activate-platform-wide-update/```

As I said above, we are all on the same team here. We try to help as much as we can, if there's something that we're not doing that HUSH would like us to start ding, a simple DM would solve the problem","",""
