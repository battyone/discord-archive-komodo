[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> howdy, my AMD R9 3900x finally arrived today, only 5 weeks after ordering ðŸ˜‚ . Can't wait to get it set up and running

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 nice, you will need to flash the BIOS of your MB unless you bought a brand new MB

[20-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I did get all brand new, i had a ddr3 system before

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's weird KMD marketing writes us out of history, so I must politely poke them: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1208007988482461696

@KomodoPlatform it's kind of weird that you list 5 other coins that use Equihash but forgot $HUSH, which predates 4 of those 5 coins https://t.co/nqX0HtjT81

@KomodoPlatform Since $HUSH has submitted *so much code* to $KMD over the years, it feels like you are purposefully deleting us from history. Perhaps you are a fan of the "memory hole" from 1984? https://t.co/zlzqxuUYsj

[20-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c it feels KMD marketing purposefully deletes Hush from history, so I am done being quiet about that, I guess

[20-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c telling people about AION but not HUSH? That is borderline criminal negligence

[20-Dec-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In an article about Equihash, they ignore HUSH but give VRSC an entire paragraph about it's FPGA-friendly verushash. Am I being trolled?

[20-Dec-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD social media DM'ed me already, seems that I didn't follow the rules

[dscrd-hush] <denio> Lol

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Fucking hilarious

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I hope they don't

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ðŸ˜…

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Ignoring us, treating us like shit

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then telling me not to tweet, from some social media manager scammer

[20-Dec-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Alper Can't

[20-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> They rly asked you to not tweet? ðŸ¤”

PROTIP: If you DM me to not tweet about something, say how $KMD likes to delete $HUSH from the history of the world: Maybe learn you who are dealing with.

[20-Dec-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @alperC plz do not DM me anymore. You can say anything in front of my friends here

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no respect for "SEO Gurus"

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so don't expect much here

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So @alperC runs KMD social media, folks

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He wants to suppress my thoughts

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> while also suppressing telling anybody about Hush

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lol

[20-Dec-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> It's not about position. Asking this is maybe normal in north korea

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Imagine me asking James not to tweet his opinion

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> IMAGINE IT

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TRY TO IMAGINE THAT

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Lol

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Then, imagine I was an "SEO Guru" asking James not to tweet

[20-Dec-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the pure lack of respect is astounding

[20-Dec-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @alperC you should have cleaned up this shitty diaper before blasting it to twitter

[20-Dec-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Now you must use your SEO/Content Marketing skills to fix it

[20-Dec-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Enjoy

[20-Dec-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am sick of Hush not being respected, so the time of me being respectful to those people is now over.

[20-Dec-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> You can't force them to be respectful... Maybe we should just ignore them

[20-Dec-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c if you tweeted "I think Hush is worthless" I would respond " I respect your opinion". I can't imagine DM'ing you and chiding you for saying your opinion via freedom of speech

[20-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I guess that is the real problem

[20-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lack of respect, and then faking it

[20-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The price KMD pays for ignoring HUSH are my tweets @alperC

[20-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And I got a lot more dank memes

[20-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I blocked Alpo

[20-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Hi Duke, I'm Daniel from the Komodo marketing team. The Equihash post was from a new guy we're working with named Delton, who just failed to mention HUSH because he's new to the ecosystem. I'm happy to go and add HUSH in

[20-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Daniel CP at this point, whatev. It's ongoing Hush-hatred

[20-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Just a simple mistake, nothing personal

[20-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is not one story, this is Alper ignoring us for months

[20-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you think HUSH is so worthless, that you will tell people about AION and BTG before us, well, that is sad

[20-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's sad for the entire KMD ecosystem

[20-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush will not beg. We will meme.

[20-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD can decide what they want.

[20-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Like I said, it was a new writer who isn't familiar with the ecosystem. Just an honest mistake

[20-Dec-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> I will add you guys in but in the future, maybe just DM us if you want us to lend a hand in marketing

[20-Dec-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Ok. That honest mistake, adding to months of Alper ignoring us, looks like a pattern

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> I don't thin anyone is ignoring anyone

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Daniel CP no thank you. We don't want help. Either mention us or don't

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I wrote the first KMD test suite

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have fixed countless bugs

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Submitted countless PR's

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you don't think there is a reason to mention Hush, then fuck, don't

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will speak how we want about KMD

[20-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you need us to follow rules, do not ask. Just never mention us again

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> I've said a few times-- honest mistake. This isn't anything personal

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Easy to say

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Months of actions say otherwise

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> There are dozens of ecosystem projects and we try to promote all of them when we can

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Anyway, do what you want

[20-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SUPERNET owns 100,000 HUSH

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's in your own fucking damn interest to talk about us

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> If you guys want us to take some action, just reach out

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Fucking insane that you don't

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> We cannot monitor dozens of ecosytem projects and do all of the marketing for all of them

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But whatev

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Daniel CP how many of those projects wrote the KMD test suite?

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Your excuses are lame, to be honest

[20-Dec-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> I've been in touch with Berg several times before and let him know he can ping me any time for a mention in the newsletter or a retweet

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Same with Alper

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I cannot speak for @Berg

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> We're here to help, I assure you

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Doesn't feel like it at all

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> All you've gotta do is reach out

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Might as well not be there

[20-Dec-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, i guess this has been a large waste of time, nothing accomplished

[20-Dec-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Same old same old

[20-Dec-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Daniel CP i don't expect special treatment for HUSH by KMD. You better be sure I will be the largest KMD critic on Twitter
