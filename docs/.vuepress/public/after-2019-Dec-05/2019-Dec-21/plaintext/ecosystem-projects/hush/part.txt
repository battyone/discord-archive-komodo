[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Ok that's your choice man. I obv can't tell you what to do

[20-Dec-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Dec-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> There's no need for us to be hostile

relax man, think you're thinking about it too much

[20-Dec-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Here are just a few recent examples of us trying to give HUSH a shoutout

[20-Dec-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
and Daniel, to be fair, there was a mention of HUSH in the changelog notes for the fork I gave you

[20-Dec-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
and it was removed for some reason

[20-Dec-19 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
Again, Duke, I really don't think it's an intentional slight against HUSH

[20-Dec-19 02:08 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright I'm trying to experiment reckless stuff on LN (submarine swaps), I'm not here to judge which project is the most reckless between LN, Hush and LABS. All cryptocurrencies I know are experimental, including BTC. Good news is that the script seems compatible between AtomicDEX and submarine swaps. The last attraction for LN reckless users was to feed chicken by paying with LN (a video camera was present in front on chicken, some food was given when you pay a LN invoice). If we can get some of these users interested in doing LABS, Hush or KMD submarine swaps, it can be cool. I used the #developers channel of Hush to discuss my dangerous reckless ideas.

just use paypal :troll:

[20-Dec-19 02:09 PM] phm87#7395
Good news 2: there are some CEX and DEX with LN but few support withdrawal with LN. Few support more than 10 altcoins

[20-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry, that's a bit of a harsh joke

[20-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Alright#0419
Yea, I have no experience with a "submarine" swap

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
just a BTC LN -> KMD/HUSH/LABS swap?

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] phm87#7395
There if I can manage to make submarine swaps working on AtomicDEX, we'll have the biggest DEX to sell/buy altcoins to LN with withdrawal enabled in LN

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush discovered a critical bug in KMD, Alright listed us in the release notes

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and magically, we were DELETED!!!

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Amazing

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
mannnnn

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And Duke is just imagining shit

[20-Dec-19 02:11 PM] phm87#7395
Hush and KMD were added into the beautiful repo but it is in JS so it can't be used on mainet:
<https://github.com/submarineswaps/swaps-service/compare/master...phm87:hush>

[20-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <Alright> you promised to never speak to me again, why are you here?

[20-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Alright#0419
I'll go if you want, ya loon :L

[20-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Go fuck with that fucked up LABS code I just deleted from Hush codebase

[20-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Good riddance.

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
just don't understand your reactions to some things lately

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
yea took a few tries

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I take that as a compliment

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
eh?

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> still here?

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
lol chillllll

[20-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Alright#0419
take a vacation

[20-Dec-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Daniel CP to be honest, i don't subscribe to those newsletters, and never saw any of that

[20-Dec-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if it doesn't go in a blog post, on a permament webpage, it might as well not exist

[20-Dec-19 02:14 PM] Alright#0419
nothing is going to make him happy, Daniel, he's angry for the sake of being angry

[20-Dec-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <Alright> I will take your advice when I have nothing left to live for, thanks

[20-Dec-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <alright> go fix those CVE's-without-numbers and leave this place

[20-Dec-19 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
just did buddy

[20-Dec-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> groovy. It was a joy to delete most LABS code from HUSH recently

[20-Dec-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> y'all were smoking some serious shite

[20-Dec-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419
how many attempts did it take?

[20-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <Alright> I have no respect for you, don't even want to joke with you. You promised me you would never speak to me again, and now you are a liar

[20-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Alright#0419
lol

[20-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Alright#0419
best of luck on your mission to burn all your bridges for no reason

[20-Dec-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not sure what that fucking tool is saying, but I have blocked the bridge bot and will turn it off soon.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When we have the next stock market correction, it will be very interesting to see how much of those funds flow into cryptocoins

[20-Dec-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @dukeleto i prefer to stay out of any issues you have with the marketing guys, i am not any dictator that is controlling anybody and website stuff is very far from what i do. i dont review or approve what goes out on the website, or twitter, or whatever. from what i see you are already in contact with them, just wanted to make it clear that direct contact with them is the best way to influence what they do. please dont put me in the middle

[20-Dec-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Daniel CP> Just want to say that I updated the equihash post to include Hush.

```https://komodoplatform.com/equihash-algorithm/```

I also took some time to scroll through the last 6 months of Komodo's twitter feed to see if Komodo is actually showing any kind of favoritism. As it turns out Hush, received more tweets and retweets than any other ecosystem projects:

```https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fqMuN0oB3wiSMefP4wsAbZqx7IRMTC3Si2hYieNyTNk/edit?usp=sharing```

HUSH received 12 tweets/RTs, whereas Chainzilla and RedFOX labs were in second place with 7 tweets/RTs each.

For anyone interested in taking the time, you can also scroll through Komodo's twitter feed to verify the results.

We've also mentioned Hush in a number of newsletters, as I linked to above.

And, last thing, Hush was actually mentioned (with a link to the website) in the recent announcement about today's upgrade:

```https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-to-activate-platform-wide-update/```

As I said above, we are all on the same team here. We try to help as much as we can, if there's something that we're not doing that HUSH would like us to start ding, a simple DM would solve the problem

[20-Dec-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Agreed that we need not fly off the handle

[20-Dec-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We are one team and should behave as such

[20-Dec-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm just curious. Did anything get said to this other guy?

[20-Dec-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He gets entertainment from this. And honestly,
it kind of pisses me off.

[20-Dec-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Daniel CP  Thank you for supporting Hush

[20-Dec-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Which guy ?

[20-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Alright

[20-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We do not appreciate that

[20-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> He is not a bad guy. He had words with duke

[20-Dec-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Well they agreed not to talk to each other

[20-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And he finds it amusing to use the bridge bot, to mess with Duke

[20-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And that needs to be addressed

[20-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That is the key issue here.

[20-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I'd prefer to distribute free condoms and force their govts to make them kiss and hug. Honestly, I don't think that alright is hostile

[20-Dec-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hostile or not, if two individuals do not get along, they should not speak.

[20-Dec-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We do not need that, here. We prefer to not turn off bridge bots either.

[20-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I think it was isolated cose. Bridge not is used for good in most cases

[20-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Do not close a bridge due to one incident

[20-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Agreed.

[20-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I know you love the bridge bot

[20-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I've bridged telegram-discord before

[20-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @phm87 How's submarine swaps going?

[20-Dec-19 08:15 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Good @Privatoshi

[20-Dec-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yes, I found that amusing

[20-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> About submarine swaps, I realized that on our LN wallets, maybe we can know the preimage. So no need to run btc and lnd for experimenting

[20-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nice

[20-Dec-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I need to understand better how addresses and scripts work. Duke sent me some links in #developers channel

[20-Dec-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I saw

[20-Dec-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Because if you generate a LN invoice on eclair mobile or else, if you know the preimage, paymenthash, that s perfect, you keep it secret. Then based on the LN invoice and your pubkey, I can write redeem script

[20-Dec-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> For testing, I am using php to decompose, print parts and calculate scripts, hash secret and so on of the submarine swap

[20-Dec-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> Using php is a bad idea but I need to understand in details what I am doing

[20-Dec-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Phm using php

[20-Dec-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> 2 letters off being the same 👌

[20-Dec-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you use zaddrs? Thank you for your honesty

[20-Dec-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Over the last month, on Hush mainnet, we had 7.2% of transactions contain a zaddr, i.e. a "shielded transaction"
