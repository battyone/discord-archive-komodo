I'm having issues activating Verus, is there a known issue? Using 0.2.11

[20-Dec-19 02:44 AM] benzo365#8202
Also, that horrible coin sound!?? ðŸ˜³

[20-Dec-19 02:45 AM] benzo365#8202
It still sounds even when I log out of the app.

[20-Dec-19 02:51 AM] benzo365#8202
Ahh, versus hardfork...

[20-Dec-19 04:51 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Yeah, there is a PR on the way that updates the VRSC configuration.

[20-Dec-19 04:52 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
And soon you'll be able to configure the sounds.

Noticed issue when coin is removed from atomicdex. It leaves orders still there even when coin is nit present, dont know if this can cause other issues.

AtomicDEX is compatible with monero?

[20-Dec-19 08:26 AM] Lennart#9331
no.. but should support pirate chain sometimes soon

In the orderbook i see SUPERNET/BTC (https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/), yet i can't add SUPERNET in the app?

[20-Dec-19 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
On this website fetching orderbook for a whole AtomicDEX P2P network (not only for assets added into mobile GUI)

[20-Dec-19 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
AtomicDEX mobile is just an interface for AtomicDEX-API

[20-Dec-19 02:06 PM] TonyL#3577
there might be infinity amount of interfaces (GUIs/TUIs and etc) each with same or own coin set. Supernet you can trade via AtomicDEX-API by CLI

[20-Dec-19 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX also you may try terminal interface (but please note that it's just demonstrational/testing software so it's better to not trade huge amounts)

or you build hyperdex yourself and trade there

[20-Dec-19 02:10 PM] jorian#4555
hyperdex will have all assets at launch

Hello, I would like to ask if you could change/fix the NAV logo on AtomicDEX
Currently it is little bit cutted and the edge has white pieces left:
