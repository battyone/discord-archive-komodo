in every way I think this bitcoin will be one of the main pillars.
I'm sure it will. 
besides, I think the next two years will set the direction for the next 10 years.

[20-Dec-19 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
`all  non  KYC  users in europe` meaning all Euro users on EU exchange or all users of an EU exchange?

@Alright watchtowers are useful if your LN node is not always online. Everyone that I know is using a node 100% online. Now, LN is super young so it was super centralized around LN.big (huge ln player) and eclair node. Since 1 week, big CEX are coming (bitfinex). Do not be afraid, I use Hush discord to discuss submarine swaps

`meaning all Euro users on EU exchange or all users of an EU exchange?` all users.. it applies to an EU exchange and they have to comply with the law or get out of the business
