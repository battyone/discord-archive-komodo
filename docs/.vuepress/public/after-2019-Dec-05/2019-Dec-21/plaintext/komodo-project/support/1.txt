👋 Just came across this thread https://nxtforum.org/unity/supernet-assets-nxt-ae-gt-komodo-migration/ What's the status of this swap? Are all former jl777 issued assets that are still on Nxt now worthless? Thank you.

Hey guys if you have a hardware wallet do you need to do something for the upgrade to ensure it still operates normally

[20-Dec-19 05:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@sir just wait for an announcement that the hardware wallet provider updated to the latest version
you, as a user doesn't need to do anything other than updating the app/firmware if the hardware wallet provider recommends it

@k_day Swap is already done. In my point of View the NXT Assets are worthless.

[20-Dec-19 07:26 AM] k_day#4857
Interesting. Will be informative to go back through the various jl777 offering docs and see if arbitrary "action required or you lose everything" deadlines are part of the terms of his ICOs.

[20-Dec-19 07:32 AM] k_day#4857
Fully aware that those were very much wild-west times, but making new rules after the fact that financially harm your earliest supporters is at best not in good faith, and at worst unethical. But I'll withhold judgement until I hear from @jl777c

[20-Dec-19 07:48 AM] Acura#2748
I only know about one Ico - Komodo Ico - all the other SuperNet Assets there was no ICO in my knowledge

[20-Dec-19 07:57 AM] k_day#4857
yeah, this was a very long time ago so my memory is fuzzy 🙂 I _think_ they were listings on the Nxt Asset Exchange where I bought them

[20-Dec-19 09:00 AM] k_day#4857
was able to catch up with @jl777c tonight and go over my account history. SupertNet was the most valuable thing I owned, but not in a quantity that is worth my time to pursue. I do own some MGW* assets that don't show up on nxtportal (according to my accountant, and I haven't sync'd  Nxt client in a long time) so not sure what the deal with that is.

[20-Dec-19 09:03 AM] k_day#4857
Summary is: 1) not sure I trust nxtportal so I'll probably try to sync a Nxt client 🤞 . But it nxtportal is correct everything is probably fine

@lc123456 which chain are you running?

I tried searching back a bit, but could not find any info on ARM releases of CLI wallet 0.5.0. (I admit, I didn't spend too much time, due to other matters)
Before I spend my time on it, this question: is the CLI source compileable for 64-bit ARM devices?

[20-Dec-19 07:16 PM] Oszy#5734
i'd ask @radix42 about arm version

[20-Dec-19 07:17 PM] radix42#3743 (pinned)
i just released arm version of 0.5.0, link is on janemercer.us

On it like a hawk... thank you 🙏. That saves me migrating loads of wallets.

[20-Dec-19 07:20 PM] radix42#3743
you're very welcome!

[20-Dec-19 07:22 PM] radix42#3743
I'd recommend the binary release, the source is fussy to compile

[20-Dec-19 07:31 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
With the time left, I'll gladly take the binaries

[20-Dec-19 07:32 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I'll have a look at compiling when it's less hectic for me.
