Final reminder @everyone. We are 483 blocks, ~8.5h away from the Network upgrade. This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update will not run on the correct network.
