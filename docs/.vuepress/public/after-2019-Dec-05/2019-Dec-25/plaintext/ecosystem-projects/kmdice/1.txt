Looks like ill have to fire up my pi4 not a great linux user (total noob) but i will try......... Do i need my KMDice in a wallet to play, mine are on an exchange atm as cant find a wallet that supports KMDice. Any help or links to anything KMDice appreciated

yes, you need them in a wallet where you control the keys
you cannot spend coins you do not own

<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/latest> is the current cli wallet release from komodoplatform

[24-Dec-19 01:27 PM] coolermaster#4963
Just closes straight away do i need to change something in the fetch params file or just some issue with my setup (windows 7 most likely) ill just have to setup the pi and try the linux version guess its a good way to start to learn linux

open cmd, then drag-n-drop the file into it and press <enter>

[24-Dec-19 01:48 PM] coolermaster#4963
Awesome Thank you

[24-Dec-19 02:50 PM] coolermaster#4963
sorry for all the questions but do i play straight from the wallet or is KMDice a separate install?

[24-Dec-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
all komodo assetchains/smartchains can be run from the same daemon/cli
the parameters to run KMDICE from komodod are in this channel's topic
