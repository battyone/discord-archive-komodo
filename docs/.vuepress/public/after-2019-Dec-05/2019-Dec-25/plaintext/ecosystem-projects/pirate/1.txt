[24-Dec-19 12:57 PM] Senzacervello#8651
@kaks the message came on twitter asking to download a "arrr" file, to upload the file on website and to get an address and PK for a wallet

[24-Dec-19 12:59 PM] kaks#6612

[dscrd-prt] <Cryptofist> The buccaneer bot is a legit bot that hands out arrr, everyone. 
FYI

[24-Dec-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> Does verus agama still work for pirate? I'm struggling to access my arrrs

[24-Dec-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> Can't seem to figure out how to import a private key anywhere either.

[24-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Cryptofist hello my friend how are u doing today

[24-Dec-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> Can anonyone point me to a wallet import private key procedure that works? Any wallet will do.

[24-Dec-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> I've tried loading up my whole .dat file in pirateocean, but the address with a balance doesn't show up in the list.

[24-Dec-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wieprz1999> @mrlynch  is there a way to do that?

[24-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wieprz1999> @Potato Guy 9000  there was a hf for komodo, you should update wallet program.

[24-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> I'm using the newest wallets

[24-Dec-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> my wallet.dat and private keys are old, though

[24-Dec-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> I'm trying pirateocean and -reindex now. I forgot about that one

[24-Dec-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> good move @Potato Guy 9000 re-indexing does it most times

[24-Dec-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> @Potato Guy 9000 if reindex doesn't work then remove old wallet.dat  start pirateocean, go to help tab, then debug window and type    z_importkey (secret-extended-key- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx) (your private key) then you may have to reindex to show your address and coins

[24-Dec-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> may take some serious time unless you have downloaded the bootstrap file

[24-Dec-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> @Bradbury shit, I was leaving out the "secret-extended-key" part at the beginning of the address. I guess I needed to leave that in?

[24-Dec-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> yes, it's part of the key

[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> ok cool.

[24-Dec-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> I assume PirateOcean is the same as the last version. I've not updated yet as a small mishap with my wallet machine has left it in bits.. lol

[24-Dec-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> Pirate version v3.0.0-beta1-b840e2a-muddy (64-bit)

[24-Dec-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> think this is the last one for win but have a look at pins üìå

[24-Dec-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> can you cancel a reindex?

[24-Dec-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> sure, I don't see why not

[24-Dec-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> I mean, I closed it and opened the wallet again, but it resumes the reindex. lol

[24-Dec-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> oh,

[24-Dec-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> if computer genie was here he'd be able to help more. I'm not sure where he is. I know it's Christmas Eve, but he doean't have any friends he could be out with :troll:

[24-Dec-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> did you try to bootstrap @Potato Guy 9000? this will really shorten the indexing

[24-Dec-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> see #pirate-ocean for more info

[24-Dec-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Bradbury> yeah. start again... I'd delete the wallet.dat, bootstrap it and then import my key

[24-Dec-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> I already got the chain synced with the bootstrap yea.

[24-Dec-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> oh ok.

[24-Dec-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Potato Guy 9000> Thanks for the help sirs! merry christmas and all.

[24-Dec-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
