[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not if you wanted some privacy after death

[24-Dec-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hahaha

[24-Dec-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm not worried about privacy after death

[24-Dec-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But that's some serious hacking right there

[24-Dec-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I wonder if someone can 3d print my face for facial recognition.

[24-Dec-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Mission impossible stuff now

[24-Dec-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cops will just put your face in front of the phone to unlock it. Do not use face-unlock, ever.

[24-Dec-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> EVER

[24-Dec-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> EVER

[24-Dec-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> EVER

[24-Dec-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cops will unlock your phone with your face and do whatever they want. Face-lock is really really dumb. Also, somebody can use a picture of your face to unlock it and other really dumb stuff

[24-Dec-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> And fingerprints üò∞

[24-Dec-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The only thing safe is your mind

[24-Dec-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Fingerprint or face is good *in addition* to a PIN/password, but it's no substitute
