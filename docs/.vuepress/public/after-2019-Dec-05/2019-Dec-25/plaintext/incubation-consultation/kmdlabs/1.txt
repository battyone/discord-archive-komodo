Bleh, chainstall, purging and resyncing

[24-Dec-19 04:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
are there  any  wallet-cli TUIs or  GUIs for basic api calls? super basic

[24-Dec-19 04:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
where  do  I find  calls like -zapwallettxes ??

[24-Dec-19 04:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
what  url?

[24-Dec-19 04:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
it should all be in help

[24-Dec-19 04:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
every komodo cli command is listed in -help

[24-Dec-19 05:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah

[24-Dec-19 05:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
are you looking for something that sends calls to the daemon?

[24-Dec-19 05:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah  --- somthing easy

[24-Dec-19 05:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
or  I was going to make one

[24-Dec-19 05:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
i made something windows side...

[24-Dec-19 05:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
but you will need a binary of the current LABS daemon

[24-Dec-19 05:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
uhh -- wat  u mean

[24-Dec-19 05:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
Using the AGAMA binaries, I can drop these CMDlets into the folder witht the cli bionary

[24-Dec-19 05:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
and make calls directly to the daemon

[24-Dec-19 05:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
is that bash?

[24-Dec-19 05:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
why not  current komodod?

[24-Dec-19 05:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
It was a work in progress to help early PoS64 coin holders stake in aGAMA since there still arent any buttons to start staking

[24-Dec-19 05:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
for all other coins komodod is fine

[24-Dec-19 05:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
We were all warned about LABS

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
and things in our daemon not being all in the main KMD master

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
right

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
so its a bit different

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I am running current labs komodod

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
I am only learning how to sript things with bash etc

[24-Dec-19 05:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
blackjok3r branch

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
but I have a decent handle on how to use Windows commandline

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ECHO 1 - START MINING

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
this is bash?

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
No

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats basic Windows command line

[24-Dec-19 05:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
oh

[24-Dec-19 05:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup

[24-Dec-19 05:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
just a batch file with some interactive menus in it

[24-Dec-19 05:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
So i could structure some of the basic needed commands a staker would use

[24-Dec-19 05:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
wine cmd

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
guess im installing wine  today

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol dont do that

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
why

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
i mean... why?

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
wine cmd.exe /c FILENAME.bat

[24-Dec-19 05:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I can learn these  easy command

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok go for it

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
python sucks for super  noobs

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
i agree

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I understand  it

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
its frustrating at times lol

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
you could try PHP

[24-Dec-19 05:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
I hear CHMEX has his tools written in PHP

[24-Dec-19 05:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  think if I  took  like  12 hours of  python  courses  I would  get  it fully

[24-Dec-19 05:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
PHP  --- will  look  at it

[24-Dec-19 05:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
PHP made the most sense to me when first starting

[24-Dec-19 05:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I had success using t to make a web API to a shit ass old DB to help pull customer data in better detail

[24-Dec-19 05:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
snappy and highly integrates with lots of things

[24-Dec-19 05:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok  -- you  talked me  in  to  PHP

[24-Dec-19 05:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  need  to make a program  for  my comapny  anyway

in PHP

[24-Dec-19 05:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Then you could even use WordPress as the front end, enable plugins and just add what calls you want that dont already exist in these

[24-Dec-19 05:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
well  ---  this  is  a  few days  of  research

[24-Dec-19 05:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
it always is here...

[24-Dec-19 05:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
merry christmas

[24-Dec-19 05:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
thanks

[24-Dec-19 05:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
worldpress front end  -- meaning  a website  that will  accept  data from  my  sales  accociates  and put it in  a  DB

[24-Dec-19 05:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
easily

[24-Dec-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
well I need trade show sales tracking

[24-Dec-19 05:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill just  pay you

[24-Dec-19 05:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think I have  WP on  my web  store

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
your tlaking about exactly what I am trying to plan out for a KMD/LABS based Point of Sale system

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
my shit  is dated

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
but I dont want WordPress

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
my  POS  system called  VaraPAY

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
used MM2 to  accept all cryto

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
Im mostly stuck gathering the raw DB structure details I have and trimming it for what I know I need

[24-Dec-19 05:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but no liquidity yet

[24-Dec-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
Payment Gateways are cool... but still the standard go to

[24-Dec-19 05:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
I want to use oracles to populate blockchains with DB data

[24-Dec-19 05:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
and link the entire ERP system to connected chains

[24-Dec-19 05:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
awesome

[24-Dec-19 05:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
Almost all the pieces are here under KMD/LABS/VRSC

[24-Dec-19 05:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
KMD has the dPoW to BTC

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
like I  was going to  use IPFS

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
LABS has the APoW POS64 and NN model

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  now oracles  are  the way

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
which is  Greek to me

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
and VRSC has merge mining launching soon

[24-Dec-19 05:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
A single master chain can churn dozens of sub chains in one hash

[24-Dec-19 05:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ohh  boy

[24-Dec-19 05:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
you see my vision lol

[24-Dec-19 05:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
the tech is here

[24-Dec-19 05:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
this is  what  I tallked  about in late  2016 early 20117

[24-Dec-19 05:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
gotta plan and figure out the integrations
