[25-Dec-19 06:52 AM] JohnHenryCo#8775
Now for the question I came here for... Can anyone tell me if there is a way to upload funds from a paper wallet to the atomodex mobile wallet?

@JohnHenryCo first create a wallet in AtomicDEX mobile and note down its address
then use https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newTransaction
from an offline computer to send coins to the address from AtomicDEX

@JohnHenryCo I am assuming you have Komodo in the paper wallet
if you are new to atomicDEX, I recommend to first try a swap using the test coins Rick and Morty
