does anyone know how to load funds from a paper wallet?

[25-Dec-19 07:47 AM] Oszy#5734
import the private key into the wallet of your choice

trying out atomicdex for first time on android, wow nice job guys what progress from barterdex days! Are there any plans to release it on linux or windows soon?

[25-Dec-19 07:49 AM] gcharang#6833
the desktop version is under development
should be out by end of  Q1 2020

[25-Dec-19 07:52 AM] CiPhEr#2091
nice! yeah just doin a rick / morty swap right now. I'm mainly looking into trying this out to buy / sell verus since i don't think any exchanges have wallets open atm

[25-Dec-19 07:56 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so, if i deposit like say 1 VRSC i'll be able to see the whole orderbook for VRSC pairs i'm assuming?

[25-Dec-19 07:56 AM] gcharang#6833
I think there might be some issues with SPV servers of Verus too, becase of the recent network upgrade
if they are upto datea and online, it shouls work

[25-Dec-19 07:56 AM] gcharang#6833
> so, if i deposit like say 1 VRSC i'll be able to see the whole orderbook for VRSC pairs i'm assuming?
yes

[25-Dec-19 07:57 AM] CiPhEr#2091
or just use that oracle earth site i saw for orderbook, that is reliable?

[25-Dec-19 07:59 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, the order book at <https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/> is correct
but the data is 15 minutes old

[25-Dec-19 08:01 AM] CiPhEr#2091
nice

[25-Dec-19 04:17 PM] jong#4037
Is the order book decentralized? Are orders placed off-chain? As a user, do I need to trust third parties to find out the price and to find the best possible counter-offers?

[25-Dec-19 04:20 PM] jong#4037
Other question: Would it be possible for a single order to be matched against multiple counter-offers in the future or there is a fundamental reason why it must be 1-to-1?

the order book is decentralized and p2p
more info here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>
> Would it be possible for a single order to be matched against multiple counter-offers in the future or there is a fundamental reason why it must be 1-to-1?
a maker order, once placed, does allow multiple takers who need lower volumes to fill it
but, it might happen with some delay as each taker's offer has to be filled by hash and timelocks on a blockchain(for utxo coins) and some confirmations are needed for confident trading

[25-Dec-19 05:03 PM] jong#4037
@gcharang Thanks, that sounds good. Can the order go through partially if one of the counterparties is offline/slow?

[25-Dec-19 05:03 PM] jong#4037
or it's an all-or-nothing situation

[25-Dec-19 05:05 PM] gcharang#6833
if one party is slow, the order can still go through (the blockchains have blocktimes and confirmation requirements for safe trading )
but if one of them is offline, the swap won't go through

[25-Dec-19 05:07 PM] gcharang#6833
the taker and maker need to execute alternate steps
if one of them doesn't execute a step, the swap timesout/fails and the coins will be refunded to the respective users after a fixed time

[25-Dec-19 05:11 PM] jong#4037
Interesting. Thanks.

[25-Dec-19 05:59 PM] criptobear#6402
Where can i find the withdrawal fees?

[25-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Dankin#0524
Has anyone had any luck running Atomicdex on bluestacks or any other PC android emulator?

[25-Dec-19 06:13 PM] allbits#5898
There are no withdrawal fees because the coins are already in your own wallet that only you control and there is no concept of "withdrawal". If you wish to send to another address you control you will need to pay the typical transaction fee for that chain.
