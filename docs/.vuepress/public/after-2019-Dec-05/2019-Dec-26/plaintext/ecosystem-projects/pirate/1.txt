[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Did you guys get any gifts?

[25-Dec-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> I didn't.

[25-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> sent 10k arrr for hotbit listing :cutesmile:

[25-Dec-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hember> Well, there was one thing. My car is dying and the fan that pushes fresh air has been broken for a few months now. Just today I had to drive 500km to visit my dad. As I started the engine, the fan started blowing. This was really a great thing as my windows are freezing and you can't see through the wind shield. But now the fan lasted about 430km before it went silent again. Just enough time for me to safely arrive to my destination.

[dscrd-prt] <C.Bailey> Have you seen Poloniex updates? They introduced a new level of accounts ‚ÄúLevel 1‚Äù, which allows traders to withdraw up to $ 10,000 daily without having to go through an Identity Identification (KYC) procedure. New customers can register on the exchange without having to go through the KYC procedure, make deposits for any amount and trade without restrictions. To activate your account, you only need an email address and password. In addition, users of this level can participate in competitions, chat and perform staking.

[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> yeah circle sold polo and its now based in Seychelles out side of US jurisdiction so it doesnt need kyc

[dscrd-prt] <Hember> @jamesmarkx with your clever buying that is pennies... and it will cause your bags to moon. Well played! üëå

[25-Dec-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jamesmarkx> arrr should apply for polo too, its btc cold wallets are still among the largest

[25-Dec-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <C.Bailey> Yeah, after this update to disable KYC, ARRR must be on Poloniex:realpirate:

[dscrd-prt] <C.Bailey> And no more feking google captcha at login page, only puzzles with animals

[dscrd-prt] <Senzacervello> For what's up to me, whatever related to Justin Sun, Tron and Binance is a big no. Masters of centralization, shady projects/exchanges and prone to retaliation. What they did with Digibyte (Poloniex) is ridiculous

[25-Dec-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <nille> Merry Christmas for everyone

[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> Rumours have it that Binance and many other exchanges will go suddenly KYC overnight. Stay alert and secure your funds!

[25-Dec-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> This is connected to EU regulation kicking in soon

[25-Dec-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> if Chris Dunn is one of the examples, I'm not sure it actually has to do with crypto itself, but rather content

[25-Dec-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <C.Bailey> Chris Dunn, Chico Crypto, The Cryptoverse, Crypto Tips and BTC Sessions

[25-Dec-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> many market TA channels skirt the rules to begin with and merely "this is not financial advice" isn't really true when you look at the actual content
