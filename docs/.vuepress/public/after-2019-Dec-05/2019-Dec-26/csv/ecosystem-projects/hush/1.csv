The aim is then to redistribute the taxes with maximum transparency (Belgian have many data and analysis on the expenses of the govts, France is less transparent in comparison). These huge amounts of tax money are not centralized in 1 single govt but splitted to 7 entities that have their own separate budget, this system was very useful during 2008 crisis: the govts were limitated in their stupid choices.","",""
