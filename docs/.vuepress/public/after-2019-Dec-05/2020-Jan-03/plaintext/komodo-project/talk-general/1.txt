How much ram you have

[02-Jan-20 03:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
With less than 4gb it might kill becuase of lack of memory

Hi guys! First of all happy new year! I've been hodling some KMD ( and mining it ) for the past few months. This year I'm planning to build a bigger position in KMD. Could you please tell me what progress did the Komodo team made in 2019 and how the whole project went forward? I'm in it for the long run, so I'm curious. Thanks for your insights!
