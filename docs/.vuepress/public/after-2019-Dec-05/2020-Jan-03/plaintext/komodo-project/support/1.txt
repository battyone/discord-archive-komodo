if backup the android atomic dex seed, are all available coins kmd&co in the dex be recovered (after eg uninstall) ?

[02-Jan-20 01:39 PM] snowh#3542
if how come, how is it possible to recover all these chains from one seed? even erc20s

[02-Jan-20 01:39 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, just make sure you have a correct backup by restoring the seed before uninstalling

[02-Jan-20 01:41 PM] gcharang#6833
> if how come, how is it possible to recover all these chains from one seed? even erc20s
the seed words just provide randomness. using it, private key for any chain can be calculated
as it is a deterministic process, a seed word gives the same address for each chain every time

the swaps dont go through right now, and take >30min until timeout etc, "user not happy"

[02-Jan-20 01:49 PM] gcharang#6833
are you using the latest version (0.2.11) ? 
which pair are trying to swap?

[02-Jan-20 01:56 PM] snowh#3542
latest version, who is putting the orders, who is MM?

[02-Jan-20 01:56 PM] snowh#3542
low liq at bad rates is killn user experience (still)

[02-Jan-20 01:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@snowh the app is still in beta and in development
low liq/bad rates are the expected state

anyone can place orders and anyone can be MM
if you don't find a pair with the price you want, simply create an order and leave the app in background
(you can see a "+" button with the text "Create an order" in the orders screen)

[02-Jan-20 02:04 PM] snowh#3542
ty, how long are placed orders valid?

[02-Jan-20 02:11 PM] gcharang#6833
if you are the maker, the orders will stay online as long as your app stays online or the order is filled

I moved my kmd to ledger bc of the agama fiasco. Now I want to move them back to a recent verus agama wallet download. I am unsure, though, whether the verus download is still using my old agama private key, and I want to get the new seed phrase and make sure it is not the same old phrase.  How do I get the new seed phrase and ensure I am moving to an entirely new safe private key?

[02-Jan-20 11:18 PM] smk762#7640
lite or native?

What is a seed?
A seed or passphrase is a random string Â (24 words in Komodo's case) that generates your private keys. One seed generates one set of keys (public and private) in Agama and BarterDEX.     Same seed will work with Agama, barterDEX and any other Kom...
