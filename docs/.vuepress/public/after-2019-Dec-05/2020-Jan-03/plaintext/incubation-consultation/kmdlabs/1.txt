Anyone would like to join this blasting game of new tech? https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/662380905108865044 are the steps. We will announce the next test date soon in #ask-jl777 channel (please keep an eye there). If you are interested to participate, please prepare your server or computer and wait for the announcement. You need to have basic Linux skills along with knowledge on using `komodod` and `komodo-cli` on command-line. This is a quite new tech from jl777 with a lot of possibilities including realtime decentralised orderbook. We already made some records on txs per second. With the next test we aim to do even better.
