The best Cryptonote implementation IMO is Zano (swapped from boolberry, PoS & PoW based) , lead dev is CryptoZoidberg, who was part of the original Bytecoin dev team, which Monero cloned, and founder of BBR. It's quite bizarre how Monero has the credibility while Zano has the CryptoNote equivalent of Satoshi at the helm, and flies completely under the radar.

If Blur can add dPoW it adds something Zano doesn't have.

My understanding is scammers launched Bytecoin in secret and stealth mined, and tried to falsify the history of Bytecoin to get 80% of the coins before anyone else heard of cryptonote, afaik zoidberg was just a developer of the tech, and not part of the stealth mine scam.

I assume he launched boolberry to run his own coin and distance himself from Bytecoin and Monero, and then later created Zano PoS hybrid cryptonote and let BBR holders opt in for a swap.

Zoidberg is Russian afaik, and is focused purely on tech, (a bit like jl777), and so Zano remains very obscure, but definitely cutting edge, and far superior to Monero IMO

Yes, I was the primary dev for Cryptonote. I'm proud it served as the foundation for other mass adopted projects like Monero. https://t.co/vbtym0QGEN
