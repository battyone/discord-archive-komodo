[dscrd-hush] <snowh> any exchange listing upcoming or still on mobile only + shitchanges
can graviex be trusted?

[02-Jan-20 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> its halfway liked, wallet working there?

[02-Jan-20 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> @CrisF maybe?

[02-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrisF> I'm not the one to ask about exchanges but @Berg would probably know, @snowh .

[02-Jan-20 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> i just checked some pairs: the price is 23% overpriced on barter dex ðŸ˜¦

[02-Jan-20 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> (kmd atomic dex thingy)

[02-Jan-20 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @snowh with barderdex/atomicdex, you always own your privkeys and coins, no 3rd paries. That is not free.

[02-Jan-20 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> as more people use the service, the premium will lessen

[02-Jan-20 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, Hush price can go up/down 50% in a few minutes, so 23% overprices is within noise range ðŸ˜‰

[02-Jan-20 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> @snowh post your own offers, fill the orderbook, lower the bid/ask-gap

[02-Jan-20 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> someone posted an order at fair price, feel free to check (ppl cant have app online forever i understand)

[02-Jan-20 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fair price is decided by Alice+Bob, not a CEX ðŸ˜‰

[02-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <snowh> in terms of kmd:hush 1:10-12 seems fair imo

[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> @AkiraX why would I sell it at it's lowest point

[02-Jan-20 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> but fr, it's just nose diving.

[02-Jan-20 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> probably from everyone selling it as it drops

[02-Jan-20 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dirtymikelikesfeet> I could use 10 bucks rn though. ebay is like "hurrr gonna send you to a collection agency"

[02-Jan-20 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
