It shows differences between Boomers, Gen-X and Millennials.  They show that Millennials hold Grayscale Bitcoin trust (maybe this is a basket of cryptos?) at levels higher than some major bluechips.    They hold percentage wise more GBTC than they do in Disney, Berkshire, and Netflix.  Hope they don't get fleeced, but it shows in their eyes that crypto is legit. People pay a premium for that GBTC basket too.  I have much more than I can afford to loose in crypto with ""unhealty bias"" towards KMD, but I sleep well at night.  I don't think I would sleep well at night knowing the fifth largest holding of my retirement portfolio was mostly BTC.   https://pressroom.aboutschwab.com/press-release/schwab-corporate-retirement-services-news/schwab-report-self-directed-401k-balances-ho";"";"";
