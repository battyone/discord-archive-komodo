are you guys aware of KaiOS?
personally, I think that Android and IOS are steaming piles of bullshit üêÑ  üêÑ  üêÑ üí© üêÑ 
and I take pride in stating that I have never owned such a spydevice, but: this antipathy is not to scorn mobile connectivity in general.
So: travelling with a mobile access point and some linux mobile device is method of choice, but this can be a bit cumbersome at times.
I will certainly take a close look at KaiOS, since not only is it for feature fones, but it also offers tethering for linux devices and has also a full Browser sitting in it- speaking of which: Will the upcoming KMD/DEX wallet be available for the HTML5 Browser in KaiOS?
Would seem a good idea to me..
