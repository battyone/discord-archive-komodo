""whatever any collateral gained value, bank will sell everything at a stupid price to get their money.""  - if you have money (saving account as collateral) and it gained value but you didn't have the money to repay the loan what happens? They liquidate it (for the sum of the loan plus interest plus fines whatever) and send you the rest... it's very simple";"";"";

But when you say ``They liquidate it (for the sum of the loan plus interest plus fines whatever) and send you the rest... it's very simple`` I think that jl777 said it is possible here
