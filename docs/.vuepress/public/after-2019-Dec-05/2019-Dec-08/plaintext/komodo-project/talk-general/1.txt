Hy to everyone,I got a question,I see many people are mad for this defi projects,....to me looks only like banks but only they are hiding under name of decentralised and Blockchain,...any suggestions

[07-Dec-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
with pegs CC, each person controls their portion of the money supply. each person independently decides how much, if any, pegged coins to issue or redeem

[07-Dec-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
also, interest is not charged for the issuing of coins. the coins are created and then freely usable

[07-Dec-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD that is collateral is locked until the account is closed

here is a Q/ comment regarding browser implemention:
are you guys aware of KaiOS?
personally, I think that Android and IOS are steaming piles of bullshit üêÑ  üêÑ  üêÑ üí© üêÑ 
and I take pride in stating that I have never owned such a spydevice, but: this antipathy is not to scorn mobile connectivity in general.
So: travelling with a mobile access point and some linux mobile device is method of choice, but this can be a bit cumbersome at times.
I will certainly take a close look at KaiOS, since not only is it for feature fones, but it also offers tethering for linux devices and has also a full Browser sitting in it- speaking of which: Will the upcoming KMD/DEX wallet be available for the HTML5 Browser in KaiOS?
Would seem a good idea to me..

@LocoMB i just ordered the Nokia 8110 4G KaiOS phone last night. B2G OS wasn't that good. It lacked a lot of things and had plenty of bugs. I still have a Mozilla developer tablet running FirefoxOS (B2G) that they were using for testing.

[07-Dec-19 12:21 PM] SHossain#0007
Mozilla gave up the idea continuing to develop the Firefox OS after a while.

I can‚Äôt claim my KMD rewards through a ledger nano s, I saw some comments saying it was due to ledger new firmware . Do we have a solution to that?

whats so special with the nokia that make it attractive?

[07-Dec-19 03:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from a developer's point of view it's the cheapest hardware for smart mobile apps.

[07-Dec-19 03:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the wikipedia page says that aprox 71% users in India are using Android, and from the rest KaiOS based phone's users are above iOS based phones!

[07-Dec-19 03:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so, if KaiOS takes place for the most basic mobile OS for the cheapest phones affordables by the rest of the world who can not afford expensive smart phones, it's good to have support for such OS.

[07-Dec-19 03:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KaiOS as I read supports HTML based Apps on it.

[07-Dec-19 03:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
having just 512 MB RAM on it, with only 4GB of storage and expandable 32GB microSD and only 1.1 Ghz CPU, if our KMD tech can work on it, we should consider our tech the MOST reachable in the world.

[07-Dec-19 03:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and as I understand nSPV is already supportable for such low end mobile hardware.

[07-Dec-19 03:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I guess AtomicDEX's core mm2 must be supportable.... at least I can hope since we have seen it being possible to run purely over web, using WASM.

@Markus not primarily that is is Nokia, but that it is KaiOS, which is _not_ Android /IOS.
also, it is supposed to be _not_ a battery hog like those other filthy spy bitches

[07-Dec-19 04:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
so you get a 4G access point that has full browser and App capability, which you can also use to make phone calls
... I still need to verify that it is possible to also install your own apps and access your data directly w/o illegally rooting the thing

[07-Dec-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
The main reason i bought that phone is just only for calls and 4G hotspot

[07-Dec-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
this will allow me to be less dependent on other smartphones (except for testing on Android /iOS)

[07-Dec-19 04:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah same here.. I found out a few months ago that many hotel 'free' wifis block VPNs.. silly fuckers- of course it can be tunneled, and what concern is it to them?!?! but having a mobile 4G access point is cool, I have been using for several years, but it is difficult to handle

[07-Dec-19 04:50 PM] skerberus#7584
I used the magnumwallet to claim my kmd rewards, but it seems like it stopped working (It can't find the ledger nano x). Anyone else having issues? I can link the ledger perfectly fine but when I press claim rewards it can't find the ledger

[07-Dec-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
it's because of the ledger firmware update
this one works @skerberus
