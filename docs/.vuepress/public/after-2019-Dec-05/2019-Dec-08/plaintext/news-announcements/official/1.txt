**November Community Awards Are Here**
November is the second month we sent community bounties. We awarded a total of 3000 KMD this month.

Huge thank you for all our contributors! Also, those that didn't get a mention in this month's blog post. There are just too many.

Remember that you can give us a hint about who you think should receive a community reward. We try to award the bounties based on the contributions the member has done during the previous month.
