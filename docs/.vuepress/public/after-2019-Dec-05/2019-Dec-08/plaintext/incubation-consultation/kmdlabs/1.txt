would not recommend using keys generated for that for real money, code used for generating addresses is from here https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/19meq0/hey_bitcoiners_here_are_my_short_python_3_scripts/

back it a bit if anyone new tries to sign up, tell them they don't need komodod in the pos64staker dir

[07-Dec-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
they might have trouble with depends, will make the list when I'm back

[07-Dec-19 02:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
K giving your fix a shot... building it now

[07-Dec-19 02:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
cant remeber what the make command is that does this faster than build.sh...

[07-Dec-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
from src dir `make -j$(nproc)`

[07-Dec-19 02:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
thats it... ty

[07-Dec-19 02:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
git  pull?

[07-Dec-19 02:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
nope

[07-Dec-19 02:41 AM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[07-Dec-19 02:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
git pull is ez... the make command only builds files with cvhanges... build.sh rebuilds everything

[07-Dec-19 02:43 AM] daemonfox#6136
and cant you do something like  ```git pull; make -j4```

[07-Dec-19 02:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Git pull from src?

[07-Dec-19 02:49 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Need to get off my couch

[07-Dec-19 02:49 AM] daemonfox#6136

that's the dependencies for new entercomp script

[07-Dec-19 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when im not finsihed testing it, pointless trying because its liekly broken

[07-Dec-19 03:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
glad i kept a copy of the previous daemon

[07-Dec-19 03:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
but does that mean anyone that pulls opos64 branch right now is going to have same roken daemon?

[07-Dec-19 03:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
update? or   dont  update  ...that  is  the  question

[07-Dec-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[07-Dec-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181

once thing at a time

[07-Dec-19 03:26 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
