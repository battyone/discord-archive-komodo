[dscrd-hush] <Captain> What?

[07-Dec-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Craptopia

[07-Dec-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Well we have to wait until we can verify ourselves with our id and account, then we can get our coins back

[07-Dec-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> The plan is to do a KYC to verify yourself with your old account to have your assets back

[07-Dec-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> wait craptopia giving our coins back?

Update for Cryptopia account holders 25 October 2019
Since our last update we have made further progress towards securing and preserving Cryptopia crypto-asset holdings for the benefit of those entitled to them. Below is an outline of the progress we have made since our last update on 20 August 2019.

[07-Dec-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> an update on cryptopia liquidation should occur in December

[07-Dec-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Captain MtGox told me they would give me funds back too, and had people do KYC. Nobody ever got their funds back. I would not give your personal details to random 3rd parties and also don't hold your breath

[07-Dec-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> yes better dm

[07-Dec-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> might be best ever holding strategy ü§£
