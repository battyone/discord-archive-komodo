how do i increase the number of transacations I can export to csv file?  I don't see that under the settings window.  So it must be a command line option I suppose....

Use `listtransactions` RPC to export in JSON, then - convert it to CSV or anything you want.

Here is small example how to export address and amount fields to CSV for 10 transactions:
```
komodo-cli listtransactions "*" 10 | jq -r '[.[] | {address, amount}] | (map(keys) | add | unique) as $cols | map(. as $row | $cols | map($row[.])) as $rows | $cols, $rows[] | @csv'
```
Result will be like:
```
"address","amount"
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",-0.01209162
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",12.012906
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
```

thank you for the information.  Is there a way to include the date and time for each transation ?

[06-Dec-19 08:09 PM] erav3n#9290
You can export `blocktime` field also, it's time of block in which it included. Just add blocktime to this `{address, amount, blocktime}` in expression above. Blocktime will be exported in Unix Timestamp format.

[06-Dec-19 08:09 PM] spudboy999#5256
Excellent!  Thank you  very much for assisting me.

@erav3n   When I use the entire command string I get "Error:  Error  JSON:|"  If I parse it  down  to just  :  listtransactions "*" 100 ....that works but only gives me the last 53 transactions, which is exactly the same amount I get from the csv export button in the app

I think I need to change something  in the configuration file and reboot the wallet so it has a larger list of past transactions?  I seem to remember having to do that with the Agama wallet before exporting a larger than default setting list of transactions....

[06-Dec-19 08:46 PM] spudboy999#5256
Its definitely not in the conf file I just viewed it  in notepad.

[06-Dec-19 09:15 PM] erav3n#9290
If after `listtransactions "*" 100` you get only 53 txes - seems it's all for all addresses in your wallet. Mean, you have no more transactions associated with your wallet.

[06-Dec-19 09:31 PM] spudboy999#5256
I have been mining KMD for over a year now.  My wallet address did change after the Agama wallet sweep.  I can't remember how long I have been using this address though.  I may have changed it in Oct when I transfered all my coins to an exchange, reformated my HD and reinstalled the QT wallet and then sent my coins back to Ocean wallet..

[06-Dec-19 09:57 PM] spudboy999#5256
Ok that is definitely what happened and since I don't remember the other address, I will just have make a generic entry in cointracking.info for those coins I mined....

[06-Dec-19 09:57 PM] spudboy999#5256
The good news is haven't lost any coins though....

[06-Dec-19 09:58 PM] spudboy999#5256
thank you to everyone for helping this clueless (at times) KMD miner....

[06-Dec-19 10:07 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah if you ever reset your wallet those tx'es  won't be in the new
