im trying to get a community team together to push hyperDEX forward.

We have a working version but would like to have other things in place to make sure we can support this properly.

what do you need?

[06-Dec-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am trying to get devs / QA / general support / marketing all aligned. I already have jl777 who will be chief complainer for hyperDEX üôÇ

[06-Dec-19 10:43 AM] Oszy#5734
Count me in on support

Might need a project manager as well as my time is mostly split doing useless real life stuff üò¶

When GUI earnings generate anything decent, it will be used to reward the community of helpers and or projects to help komodo in general.

[06-Dec-19 10:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586

@hyperDEX I would be interested in helping out with QA, that & UX design/support is my day job. I can muddle along with CLI, but no scripting/coding skills.
