Can anyone send 3D printable stl files related to other projects in Komodo ecosystem such as Komodo, Verus, Pirate etc? We have Marmara Innovative Solutions (MINS) lab. They produce 3D printers. They told that they would print free 3D printed logos to distribute during Marmara Workshop.

Also notified Dreath, since he has 3D designs for the coins. Maybe he can be of help.
