and then in BIOS make sure that the logical drive you created is in the boot priority list

[06-Dec-19 11:11 AM] hastrup#8742
ofc

[06-Dec-19 11:11 AM] hastrup#8742
logical drive  is that just what you call a normal drive?

[06-Dec-19 11:12 AM] Oszy#5734
no

[06-Dec-19 11:12 AM] Oszy#5734
`A logical drive is a drive space that is logically created on top of a physical hard disk drive`

[06-Dec-19 11:12 AM] Oszy#5734
depends on the windows installer you have, you might also need to load the drivers for the RAID controller but that is for later if it still doesn't want to work 🙂

[06-Dec-19 11:13 AM] Oszy#5734
linux should have no problem

[06-Dec-19 11:13 AM] hastrup#8742
ok cool i try that

[06-Dec-19 11:14 AM] Oszy#5734
info for the future, if you create the logical drive and you swap HDD's around you have to re-create them or it won't work

[06-Dec-19 11:15 AM] hastrup#8742
i dont think i totally get what a logical drive is. is it like a patition?

[06-Dec-19 11:16 AM] Oszy#5734
yes

Ok thx cant wait to try it out 😄 i keep you postet

`cuz winders`

[06-Dec-19 12:50 PM] hastrup#8742
Does the hdd have to have drive cage on them befor the server will see them?

[06-Dec-19 12:51 PM] Oszy#5734
Well I wouldn't use them without anyway.

[06-Dec-19 12:51 PM] Oszy#5734
not sure if there's a sensor or not

[06-Dec-19 12:51 PM] hastrup#8742
There is a senser

[06-Dec-19 12:51 PM] Oszy#5734
then probably yes

[06-Dec-19 12:52 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have a DL380-G6 - booting from the onboard USB header

[06-Dec-19 12:52 PM] hastrup#8742
Well there are 2.5 in a 3.5 slot

[06-Dec-19 12:54 PM] hastrup#8742
@Bar_F1sh_Rel isn't you boot drive slow whit usb2?

[06-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think you can also connect to the CD slot without a cage

[06-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I dont boot often - use ProxMox and install VM's

[06-Dec-19 12:55 PM] Oszy#5734
Is it also a non-hp drive? hp used to refuse to work with non-hp stuff in raid 😄

[06-Dec-19 12:55 PM] hastrup#8742
Both I have is hp

[06-Dec-19 12:57 PM] hastrup#8742
But it is 2.5 and my server only have 3.5 in it. I have not found a tray that could convert 2.5 to 3.5 in a hp server

[06-Dec-19 12:57 PM] Oszy#5734
I'd still use a caddy, vibration is not a friend of the HDD

[06-Dec-19 12:57 PM] hastrup#8742
I'm not good enough to use proxmox and wm yet

[06-Dec-19 12:58 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you really need to use the caddies - even if you mount 2.5 in 3.5

labs 

[06-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
the backplane won't see them (I think) and will report errors to the RAID

[06-Dec-19 12:59 PM] hastrup#8742
Ok I will try and find a caddy then

[06-Dec-19 12:59 PM] hastrup#8742
Thx for info

[06-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Oszy#5734
love the last line @kmdkrazy 😄

looking at the pad... i think i see my fuck up... --branch pos64

[06-Dec-19 01:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
i just pulled the repo as is so built on master...

[06-Dec-19 01:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
see --- I knew it would help

[06-Dec-19 01:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i made the same damn  mistake

[06-Dec-19 01:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
was used to running off other peoples repo and git pulling  from their updates

[06-Dec-19 01:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[06-Dec-19 01:58 PM] jorian#4555
after updating LABS komodod to latest, i'm staking a lot more blocks

[06-Dec-19 01:58 PM] jorian#4555
compared to before updating

[06-Dec-19 01:58 PM] jorian#4555
didn't update for a while though, maybe that can be a reason

[06-Dec-19 01:58 PM] jorian#4555
or did CG decide to stop staking 😛

[06-Dec-19 01:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
probs -- thats how he got me to buy more coins ---

[06-Dec-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`or did CG decide to stop staking`
life decided for me

[06-Dec-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the thing with strategies for staking, they change based on who else is/isn't participating

[06-Dec-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw:
`computergenie@NewBeast:~/labsTest$ cat ./participants.json | jq length

[06-Dec-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, counting PRs it looks like 10

_goes back to making an @Alright-proof pool_

[06-Dec-19 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao wtf does that ^^^ mean?

[06-Dec-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it means that he's managed to break every pool of mine he's ever tried to run (and usually in a way that I cannot replicate on my rig)

[06-Dec-19 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
nice!

[06-Dec-19 02:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
queue me in when rdy... if I cant break it no one should be able to... and you have watched me break just about everything here lol

[06-Dec-19 02:09 PM] CrisF#3405
`noob instruction updated` Good stuff.  Thanks @kmdkrazy

[06-Dec-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, mostly I'm adding
```        switch (vouts[i].scriptPubKey.type) {
            case 'pubkey':
                txb.addOutput(scriptCompileP2PK(vouts[i].scriptPubKey.asm.split(' ')[0]), amt);
                break;
            case 'pubkeyhash':
                txb.addOutput(scriptCompile(vouts[i].scriptPubKey.addresses), amt);
                break;
            default:
                txb.addOutput(scriptCompile(vouts[i].scriptPubKey.addresses), amt);
                break;
        }```
to a public release (and a few other things) because I still dislike disablecb

looks like Barney puked on it

[06-Dec-19 02:12 PM] CrisF#3405
The colors are a problem with etherpad.  saw some people accidentally erasing the colors on year old pads.  Only way to fix was by hand :abusedsmily:

[06-Dec-19 02:13 PM] jorian#4555
ironically it's the same color as your handle

[06-Dec-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there is no command
that was an example to show that you don't need to "run a full chain" to do certain things

[06-Dec-19 02:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  you kan see the keys with a command right?

[06-Dec-19 02:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
getinfo  wasnt correct

[06-Dec-19 02:24 PM] Oszy#5734
no keys are in the json

[06-Dec-19 02:24 PM] Oszy#5734
you can't bulk query private keys

`to use CGs method to get keys`
That was to someone that I believe wanted to do it manually, without the py that alright wrote
I included no method to get keys
