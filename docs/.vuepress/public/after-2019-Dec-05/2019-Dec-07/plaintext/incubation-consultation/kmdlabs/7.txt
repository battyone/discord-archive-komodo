2. NOT PIP3 blah blah... ALL commands ran as pip3.8 blah blah
3. So like this... pip3.8 install --user base58
4. pip3.8 install --user slick-bitcoinrpc python-bitcoinlib
5.  python3.8 ./entercomp.py  and it finally works

[06-Dec-19 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
sometime today I'll strip down the repo, if anyone is having issues, just wait a couple hours

[06-Dec-19 04:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ooohhh --- instructions

[06-Dec-19 04:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah  - I hate em

[06-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Alright#0419
so did anyone play around with CFEKPOS1 and try to formulate a distribution strategy?

[06-Dec-19 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie will jst win again so theres no point :troll:

[06-Dec-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what happens when you formulate a plan, follow it, and don't let the daemon decide what you should do with your finances :troll_lol:

{Reactions}
🤣 

[06-Dec-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully I stopped that but not sure exactly

[06-Dec-19 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
Whats the proposed block reward for the comp chain... same as CFEKPOS1?

[06-Dec-19 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
probably 1 coin

[06-Dec-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
shoiuld be liek a billion or something so genie cant PoW mine any blocks

[06-Dec-19 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand how coinage affects POW

[06-Dec-19 04:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, demons are always messing my plans up.  Just when I'm about to sleep one or another causes trouble...

[06-Dec-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the difficulty gets pushed up with loads of coinage

[06-Dec-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`shoiuld be liek a billion or something so genie cant PoW mine any blocks`
_PoW mines chains that have 0 block rewards, so that will not stop him_

[06-Dec-19 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only thing it still does is without PoW to compete it eventually goes to 100% PoS

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
right... PoW SUPERNET and others before... nearly 0!

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
yea... near 0, keep believing that

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nearly 0>0

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
Will NN need to add the comp chain tomorrow?

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
definitely not profitable to mine, I promise

[06-Dec-19 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
yes @daemonfox

[06-Dec-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we need a couple of chains at least I will add one before I go to sleep

[06-Dec-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> definitely not profitable to mine, I promise
says the guy that rents nh to mine chains with a diff of 1

[06-Dec-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> Mining SUPERNET paid for my 1st equihash ASIC
says the guy that mines for a living

[06-Dec-19 04:42 PM] Alright#0419
I roi'd a 1080ti in like 5 days

[06-Dec-19 04:42 PM] Alright#0419
mining DEX and SUPERNET

I do miss the "double your money with CHIPS" scheme ;_;

[06-Dec-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha that was nice ...

[06-Dec-19 04:46 PM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't here for that, but enjoyed the more hash = more value circle.

🤣 

[06-Dec-19 04:46 PM] CrisF#3405
Looks like we need 8 more to make 20, btw

[06-Dec-19 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing compares to getting drunk and minng the entire supply of PIRATE for a week just to troll ppl.

Sold too early 😦 but free money is free money

[06-Dec-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless you're asleep and mine it on a fork :troll_lol:

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
how about burning $1100 in NH because humans need to sleep once a day

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$1100? that's it? I was spending that every 2.5 hrs 🤣

[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*should have been selfish and not given the pool code out*

[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_didn't need your code, never liked it, and still refuses to use it_

[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:troll_lol:

[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nar .. money makes life worse ... never thaught I would say that

[06-Dec-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_contemplates getting t-shirts made that say "Fek disablecb!"_

[06-Dec-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[06-Dec-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
may as well wear one myself 🤣

[06-Dec-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
disablecb is a gift from the gods

[06-Dec-19 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`disablecb is a gift from the gods`
or a way for lazy pool writers to use some ZCL spaghetti  instead of actually making something for komodo

[06-Dec-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```if (spaghetti) { addmore.spaghetti }
else { do nothing }```

[06-Dec-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
everythign starts as spagetti... if you dont bother to iterate and improve it then it stays spagetti and breaks

[06-Dec-19 05:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
*likes spaghetti the food... would love a non spaghetti pool for LABS I could run myself*

[06-Dec-19 05:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
tried other previous pools and got a few to work here and there

[06-Dec-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
solo will be 1st
not sure if/when I'll release what I have for mininglabs.rocks

[06-Dec-19 05:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
everytime i get close... and can get shares in, something eventually breaks and its toast

[06-Dec-19 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
solo is a lot easier because there's no messing about with payments and/or pool fees

[06-Dec-19 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is majorly conflicted about his opinions on open-source and his being "the only one to have it"_

[06-Dec-19 06:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
i agree with you CG

[06-Dec-19 06:01 PM] Markus#5464
not everyone have the space to have that many miners 😬

[06-Dec-19 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
if you do something well never do it for free...

[06-Dec-19 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
but at some point... having a LABS compatible stratum as part of this eco system will need to happen

[06-Dec-19 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the free bit isn't where my concern lies, it's the part where on day one of release any ding-dong can open a pool and charge people for it

[06-Dec-19 06:02 PM] phm87#7395
CG: I have sometimes the same problem:
"is majorly conflicted about his opinions on open-source and his being "the only one to have it" "

[06-Dec-19 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 but your reasoning is quite different

[06-Dec-19 06:03 PM] phm87#7395
CG it happened to yiimp: 3 companies are selling its installation

[06-Dec-19 06:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
release it under license

[06-Dec-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't want jackwagons charging folks for pools they can't support
conversly, you yiimp feks just don't want to expand the ecosystem 🤷🏽‍♂️

[06-Dec-19 06:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
the Apache licenses, if I recall correctly, state no resale unless license is paid

[06-Dec-19 06:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
but allows for free open use if not selling the actual repo bundled

[06-Dec-19 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
Had to ask Apache directly in previous years gone by when I was using XAMPP for a project II made inside the company I worked for

[06-Dec-19 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
it helped us "make more" money by showing more data to our employees to help maintain the customers

[06-Dec-19 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
their response was as long as I wasnt reselling the code in a package or my own disto... we could continue for free

[06-Dec-19 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it happened to yiimp: 3 companies are selling its installation`
taking issue with someone selling a service is not even close to the same as wanting to ensure that a service is actually provided

[06-Dec-19 06:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
so I was able to resell my php code but deploy XAMPP without licensing it to a few other groups

[06-Dec-19 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```computergenie@NewBeast:~/LabsKomodo/master$ komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKPOS1 getpeerinfo|jq length

error code: -9

```
well, that's feked nicely

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
master?

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
That chain require pos64test

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽‍♂️

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
wouldnt sync while I was on master

[06-Dec-19 06:14 PM] phm87#7395
CG: yiimp community is still helping for free. It is sad to attract noobs with 1 clic install script (that contained security leaks at start) then provide paid help. I still help for free.

[06-Dec-19 06:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
who knows what else is broke there lol

[06-Dec-19 06:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you release a copy of the equihash bits so that I can add LABS bits to it, then maybe we can talk about "help for free" 🤷🏽‍♂️

[06-Dec-19 06:16 PM] phm87#7395
I won t lie to friends sorry. Secret is secret.
Note: it was done in 3 days of dev

[06-Dec-19 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3 days more than I have to spare on a pool system I don't really care about 🤷🏽‍♂️
