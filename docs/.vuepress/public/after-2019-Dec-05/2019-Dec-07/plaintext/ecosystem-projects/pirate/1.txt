[06-Dec-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Im surprised you pay with fiat, not BTC :troll:

[06-Dec-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <P3L3> you mean arrr

[06-Dec-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> BTC crypto and decentralization may bring as much good as evil

[06-Dec-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> the fact you can pay hitman online or survailance cameras ...

[06-Dec-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> BTC and decentralization are opposing concepts

[06-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Hi, does anyone have 3D printable stl files of Komodo and/or ecosystem project's logos?
There is a request for them here `https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/448496811271782416/652507541778989120` for distribution at a Marmara Workshop.

[06-Dec-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> a 3d rendition of mammalian conception, in green, why would anyone want that?

[06-Dec-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> `... and/or ecosystem project ...`
As Pirate is a Komodo ecosystem project, it would generate publicity for Pirate too!

[06-Dec-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Anyway, already informed Draeth

[06-Dec-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Maybe the person / group involved in the Pirate Chest has something readily avilable.

[06-Dec-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> (iirc that chest was 3D printed)

[06-Dec-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I just couldn't resist "taking a jab" at that hideous logo that I abhor
