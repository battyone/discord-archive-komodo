stable URL > patches & updates
👍🏽

unsure how official mirror is not stable

[06-Dec-19 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because 🦄s?

One controlled & monitored by you is sometimes better for a workflow, sometimes using official is better.  Each has its responsibility & reaction to fault.  Part of computers...

arrr fix  problem already?

[06-Dec-19 10:45 AM] Oszy#5734
i believe so

@Mylo you are a good student. libsodium "stable" URL has changed twice since other devs started working on KMD codebase, they don't have the perspective of what "stable" is

[06-Dec-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Just keep doing what you have always done and you will get what you always got.

`has changed twice since other devs started working on KMD codebase`
ironically to do the exact opposite of what HUSH did 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
`they don't have the perspective of what "stable" is`
True story:
The creators of a library are less stable than a random website that's being phased out

[06-Dec-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tl;dr: it's better to host your own outdated version of a library than to update to a newer version hosted by the creator(s)

[06-Dec-19 10:25 PM] Mylo#8306
Upstream libs move URLs all the time.  Github commits in KMD codebase support this assertion.
When URLs change it breaks the CI pipeline.
This can be an interruption for end users too, minor inconvenience.  Moreso it affects the badges on github for project readme files - when stuff appears broken/not-building it can affect developer adoption or media coverage instantly.

The devteam of a self hosted url no doubt would have a separate branch that uses upstream, to detect a CI pipeline failure.  Then inspect the changes of upstream before blindly committing if they are choosing this for security reasons.

Relying on upstream without code review is essentially how Agama happened.

All other comments seem to be part of the Pirate/Hush bru ha ha that seems to have evolved in this kumbaya environment we affectionately know as crypto.

Anyway, I recommend paying attention to the collateralized lending system of the cc-pegs being introduced with the next update.  It will do more for ecosystem innovation and participation than upstream URL.  Last few days chat in #ask-jl777 is worth catching up on.

Peace 🧖🏻‍♂️

@Mylo
the lib in question is libgmp. in the depends there is a clear version (6.1.1) and a sha256 hash therefore basic security measures are in place
this is not part of any bru haha but really, common-sense and if jabs are thrown, expect some back 😉 

the lib in question is not pulled from latest blindly so the agama comment here is unnecessary 
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/commit/9d1af22230c33feb2cba18d2bcf18681d13cbf8a>

looking forward to cc-pegs

If that were true, then this wouldn't even be conversation 🤦🏽‍♂️

Ok yeah not my expertise and def not my area of attention atm.
I’ll poke my big nose out of those comments :)
Was a bit of a reach 🙏

[06-Dec-19 10:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It *was* Komodo "self hosted", that was the problem!

[06-Dec-19 10:46 PM] Mylo#8306
Was a bit messy, not gonna try to continue, I’m on an iPad and that’s a history not worth digging up...

[06-Dec-19 10:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
good plan
PS - the "Pirate/Hush bru ha ha" is all in duke's mind, and if he stopped attacking Pirate then members of the community wouldn't feel the need to respond
