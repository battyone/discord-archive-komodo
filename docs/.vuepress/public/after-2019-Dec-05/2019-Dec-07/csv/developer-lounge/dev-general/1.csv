ironically to do the exact opposite of what HUSH did 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
`they don't have the perspective of what ""stable"" is`
True story:
The creators of a library are less stable than a random website that's being phased out";"";"";

When URLs change it breaks the CI pipeline.
This can be an interruption for end users too, minor inconvenience.  Moreso it affects the badges on github for project readme files - when stuff appears broken/not-building it can affect developer adoption or media coverage instantly.

The devteam of a self hosted url no doubt would have a separate branch that uses upstream, to detect a CI pipeline failure.  Then inspect the changes of upstream before blindly committing if they are choosing this for security reasons.

Relying on upstream without code review is essentially how Agama happened.

All other comments seem to be part of the Pirate/Hush bru ha ha that seems to have evolved in this kumbaya environment we affectionately know as crypto.

Anyway, I recommend paying attention to the collateralized lending system of the cc-pegs being introduced with the next update.  It will do more for ecosystem innovation and participation than upstream URL.  Last few days chat in #ask-jl777 is worth catching up on.";"";"";

the lib in question is libgmp. in the depends there is a clear version (6.1.1) and a sha256 hash therefore basic security measures are in place
this is not part of any bru haha but really, common-sense and if jabs are thrown, expect some back 😉 

the lib in question is not pulled from latest blindly so the agama comment here is unnecessary

If that were true, then this wouldn't even be conversation 🤦🏽‍♂️";"";"";
