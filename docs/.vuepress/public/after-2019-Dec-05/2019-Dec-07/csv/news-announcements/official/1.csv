**Komodo is upgrading the code base to version 0.5.0!**

On December 20, 2019, at block height 1670000, Komodo will activate a platform-wide update that provides improvements to the Antara Framework, including upgrades to Komodo’s Proof of Stake (PoS) implementation and new modules that make DeFi capabilities available within the Komodo ecosystem.

This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software prior to block 1670000. Those who do not update prior to December 20 will not run on the correct network.

Find all the details you need in this post.👇
