@Notary-Operator Happy holidays. Please, spin up VRSC daemon on  all your mainnet (!) nodes. Code in iguana/dpow repo was updated for that.

There is now a page to have each notarized coin details, including repo and possible custom instructions (version field): https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW#dpow-asset-status
