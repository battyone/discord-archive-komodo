@Mylo there are instructions to build on Android, using Termix. But that will give a binary nSPV.
@dimxy made a separate module which calls nSPV functions and made it compatible for Android. Check his Github repository. But it has to be compiled on Android OS itself, using Termix I think.
I will try to solve compiling it over computer after New year.

I was just practicing C and learned how to make a separate C file to call nSPV functions. dimxy's implimentation is obviously great and much better.

ok thanks @grewalsatinder for info - very useful to know.  i'll not be looking at nspv on arm immediately, but good to know for some manufacturers
