Electrum servers for mm2 configuration. I see the two example scripts for KMDconnect and LTCconnect. Is there any guidance and/or list of electrum servers for other coins, BTC. Example how to connect to ETH, ERC-20 etc?

Found the ETH config, skimmed docs too quick (Thanks CrisF) Just need to find electrum list now for other coins.

MM1.0, I'd monitor the DB for the various states of completion to detect when a trade has completed. Each trade would produce its own UUID from what I remember. I haven't seen a successful trade on my mm2 host yet, so not sure what to expect, or the best way to monitor it. Any suggested techniques to monitor and detect completed swaps? Should I just frequently query using "my_recent_swaps", then use "my_swap_status" and watch "succes_events"?

[29-Dec-19 07:30 AM] smk762#7640
thats one way. swap status is written to a json file under `DB/{pubkey}/MAKER` or `DB/{pubkey}/TAKER`

[29-Dec-19 07:30 AM] smk762#7640
what language are you coding in?

MM has log tags ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/116#issuecomment-420019109 ) and in AtomicDEX we're going to use them to get some of the status updates - *in order to avoid* the periodic polling of the MM API. I'll likely be touching that UI code next week.
(alternative is to implement http long polling for such updates in the MM API, but that will take more time as we already have log monitoring in place)

@smk762 had a trade go through, mm2 as a maker, didn't get anything designated as Maker or Taker, just a couple files that have names that may be pub keys, but have no content. Out of familiarity, I'm coding with Python

[29-Dec-19 06:10 PM] tolken#2655
@artemciy_dice Thank you. I'll read that and see if I can derrive what I need from it. I don't have any experience parsing a running log, will have to figure out how to process a live/open log.

Those are swap id's not pubkeys
