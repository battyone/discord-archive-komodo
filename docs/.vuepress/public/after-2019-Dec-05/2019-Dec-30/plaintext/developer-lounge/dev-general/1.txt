Here are the layered docker files for the tutorials.

There are two OS _sets_, one based on Ubuntu 18, and one based on ca‚Äôs komodobuilders image on Ubuntu 16.  I did this so there‚Äôd be a bit of upgradability in the future for next maintainer.

From these two sets, one has zcash params included in the container for brand new devs, and one without zcash params for those with a local copy of them to save for downloads (by mounting the .zcash-params dir).

To update to obsidian dragon release, the 03-dev-komodo-bins layer needs a (likely) two line change here at line 2 for d/l and line 3 for extracting.

The readme has instructions for publishing to dockerhub.

The layers above this, then need to update line 1 of their builds, eg, which layer the container bases it‚Äôs build from.

https://github.com/Komodo-Cakeshop/tools-for-blockchain-dev/blob/master/04-dev-komodo-in-a-box/Dockerfile#L1

The naming convention for images starts with *dev* , this is important!!  These are using bins downloaded then hosted on dockerhub.  They are intended for tutorials.  For production, the best practice is to compile from src when ready to go to prod.

The version numbers include the release of kmd-bin, eg 0.4.0 so it‚Äôs clear which release the tutorials are built from.

@Mylo that is some very nice dev infra, with support for multiple OS's and flexibility with zcash params. Nice work üëç

Cheers mate, lmk if HUSH can use with something in coming months - bit busy for 4-6 weeks, but when I fool around with docker again, can make something useful for your project if the need arises

I‚Äôll be following your use of cclib too
