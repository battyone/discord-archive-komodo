@steinsg8 it's not fake news , it's just that it makes it user predicable for marketmakers , so they can trade against you

[29-Dec-19 04:43 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably the only reason those ,,secret teqniques ,, was released to retail traders in the first place

[29-Dec-19 04:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
What brought me good fortune is just setting the trade in a journal , note where I would put my stop loss , and then set buy order where I would have set the stoploss

[29-Dec-19 04:48 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Whales love buying stoplosses and then pump it

Are we in a $BTC bear market?

No, we are in the re-accumulation phase of a bull market.

Need more hopium

[29-Dec-19 03:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
ouch.  i have kind of tuned out KMD daily prices since I am just bag holding at this point.  But... ouch.  Rough looking charts.

[29-Dec-19 03:03 PM] richardt#2807
All eyes will be on BTC the next several months. The market could care less about alts like KMD right now

[29-Dec-19 04:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
True. I myself am trying to take a lesson from the market and not give a shit about my alt bags either.

[29-Dec-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464
btc is in a pretty rough situation

[29-Dec-19 05:14 PM] Markus#5464
bear flag on weekly

[29-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Markus#5464
and there is rly no signs of a reversal, to reverse u would have to atleast create a lower high and we have not done that

[29-Dec-19 05:22 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
need to get above 8k

[29-Dec-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
8k doesnt rly mean anything, can go to 9k just to make a 61.8% retrace then dump hard and go to 5k

[29-Dec-19 05:23 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
we will see

[29-Dec-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
but 7.7k is significant resistance now

[29-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Markus#5464
but if tether decides to pump then resistances wont even matter

BTC despite not looking great, is still more than 2x its low this year

[29-Dec-19 08:14 PM] richardt#2807
If looking at yearly lows, it's not too bad at all
