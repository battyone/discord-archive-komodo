I admit that blockchain is needed to break the absurdity of the existing platform business monopolized by a company, but at least no one will use it without logic to convince consumers of it. 
exactly balancing demand and supply is the core of the platform, and frankly I dare not imagine how difficult it would be to maintain that balance without easy control. 
reality is that even strongly and strategically controlled platforms are going to collapse.","",""
