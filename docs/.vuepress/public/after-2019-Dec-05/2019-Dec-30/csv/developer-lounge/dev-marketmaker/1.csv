Each trade would produce its own UUID from what I remember. I haven't seen a successful trade on my mm2 host yet, so not sure what to expect, or the best way to monitor it. Any suggested techniques to monitor and detect completed swaps? Should I just frequently query using ""my_recent_swaps"", then use ""my_swap_status"" and watch ""succes_events""?","",""

I'll likely be touching that UI code next week.
(alternative is to implement http long polling for such updates in the MM API, but that will take more time as we already have log monitoring in place)","",""
