The above summary of your though has some good ideas worth implementing, imo, @artik123 .

With the goal of having your ideas provide true benefit I have a question.

I'm curious, what are you going to contribute (**do**) to start putting these ideas into practice?

---
Here is an example of what I mean:

I also would like to see more people build on the modules.  I recognize that for many devs this can may take more resources and skills they have at the moment.

As steps towards having more people start building on the platform I have been actively approaching both projects that have the resources and devs that have the motivation to start working on this.  There have been enough minor successes to continue down this path.

Also, I have found that actively participating in testing and using the various tools has given me the chance to see some of my (small) suggestions implemented.

My technical skills are very low, but even so I have found many areas where I am able to **do** things that contribute towards seeing my ideas becoming reality.
---

I'm not suggesting that this is the path you should take.  Just giving an example of **do**ing what my current skills and situation allow to see my ideas bring concrete results.

With your technical skills I imagine that your contributions would bring everyone great benefit, as your ideas are realized.","",""

Although I shouldn't be replying in this channel I felt a strong need to.  Apologies ðŸ™‡

I'll head over to #dev-general after suggesting that others, who are interested, follow the full discussion in the other channels.","",""

In the past I have made a project or two for this community and also been a x4 notary node operator for a year and a half. If these ideas go through, it's worth x100 more than I could ever possibly do.","",""

Would like to see `how, who, what, etc`. Not expecting big ideas like that to be done by one person.
Yes, business dev is not just ideas and thoughts though.  It's also putting them into action by making a concrete plan, implementing those plans, etc.
I'm very curious on your ideas on implementation and am willing to put some time into  this.","",""

it's the same model parity uses with substrate.  it's all a timing (when ICO was) & budget (bear market) related thing.  all the pieces are in place, are still being built etc.

another 6-12 months, plenty more tech to build on & a flagship GUI trading network (atomicdex api) with the flagship security application (dpow) which offers an IoT solution with nSPV.","",""
