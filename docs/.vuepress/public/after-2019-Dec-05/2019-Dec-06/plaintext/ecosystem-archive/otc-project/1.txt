Topic: OTC aims to provide a decentralised exchange network for counter-party transactions and fulfil current and evolving regulatory requirements. The OTC platform allows counter-parties to create assets and facilitates exchanges through physical, digital assets or non-liquid assets. Dedicated to producers, merchants, brokers, and end-users, OTC offers comprehensive trade solutions from point of contact between buyers and sellers to contract agreement and settlement of transactions. OTC  users can create assets, other digital currencies, currency exchange services, on line voting protocols, and even set up Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) with many-layered functions and applications.
