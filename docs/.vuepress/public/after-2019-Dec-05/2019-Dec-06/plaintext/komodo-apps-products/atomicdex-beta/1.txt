hi, how to add a coin to atomicdex?

[05-Dec-19 12:05 PM] Oszy#5734
To add to marketmaker: 
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/additional-information-about-atomicdex.html#add-your-coin-to-marketmaker-2-0

To add to the phone app, contact a service provider.

I noticed that even tho my app is active and i have internet connection my orders are not showing in the orderbook if I check on a different device, after some time. 
If I restart the app they show up again.

Hi,
I am a Cointelegraph journalist looking to ask some somewhat technical questions concerning the AtomicDEX platform.
Is there anyone that I can contact to get an official response?

When Verge and PIVX support for atomic DEX ?

[05-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When will they pay the listing fee?

I though it was free on atomicdex-api ...

[05-Dec-19 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
api != GUI
and people keep confusing/conflating the 2

[05-Dec-19 08:14 PM] phm87#7395
CG: maybe a new opensource GUI based on the api is in the making ... who knows ...

[05-Dec-19 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
@fazer you can use them with marketmaker2 (the api/brains behind atomicdex) right now, but there are costs involved to get a coin added to the mobile app
