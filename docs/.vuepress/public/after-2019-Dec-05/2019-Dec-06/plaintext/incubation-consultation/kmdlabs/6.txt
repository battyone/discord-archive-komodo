@Alright - Tried to run the sign-up on debian - Doesn't like `secrets` in the entercomp.py
Secrets also wants openssl etc etc. only had a couple of minutes - so leaving this for now.

[05-Dec-19 08:03 PM] phm87#7395
Can we use #labs-nn for kmdlabs nn stuff ? And another one for staking tests ?

[05-Dec-19 08:04 PM] mrlynch#5735

All the channles except this one are not visible to normal users as far as I know

Ok

@Bar_F1sh_Rel sorry man, that is just a result of me being lazy, it doesn't actually need that if you want to rip it out

[05-Dec-19 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
I just used the same library I've been using for pos64staker as it let me make it very quickly

[05-Dec-19 08:07 PM] Oszy#5734
asset-cli works

[05-Dec-19 08:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes asset-cli is good..

[05-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
has anyone taken a look at what this chain is doing?

[05-Dec-19 08:08 PM] Alright#0419

@Alright - Lol - Debian Stretch has none of the bitcoin libraries. Fail.

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why I dont use them

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
it's pretty simple to do manually

[05-Dec-19 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
uhhh

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
well not manually

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
you can use iguana to generate them

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
True - but the comp asks you to use a script

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
or use genaddresses.py

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bash script of 20 lines would do it

[05-Dec-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
yep, not sure anyone has made one though

[05-Dec-19 08:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gewt tro work then :troll:

[05-Dec-19 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, don't do bash

@blackjok3r do you intend to fix ac_perc + ac_notarypay block?

[05-Dec-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
`-splitperc=100` in startup params or `setstakingsplit 100` rpc command will combine the utxo used to stake a block with the coinbase entirely. 

a value of 50 will send 50% of the utxo used to stake the block to coinbase transaction

[05-Dec-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
make sense?

[05-Dec-19 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
have some docs, will get them up soon

[05-Dec-19 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
basically, `splitperc=100` is what pos64staker does

[05-Dec-19 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
`splitperc=0` (the default) is what we're used to

[05-Dec-19 08:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
`[CFEKPOS1:717] suppress 1 more KMD blocks` am getting quite a few of these.. does that mean i'm a bad guy? ü§î

[05-Dec-19 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
oh a value of 100 isn't quite the same as what pos64staker does, it will merge it to the coinbase address

[05-Dec-19 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
so recommended to not use -pubkey with `splitperc=100`. If you do, all your utxos will end up in `-pubkey` address eventually

[05-Dec-19 08:35 PM] Oszy#5734
so with this new daemon, do we need to split at all? or just enable staking after setting stakesplit percentage?

[05-Dec-19 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
do need to split initially still yes

[05-Dec-19 08:38 PM] Alright#0419

pushed fix for notary pay

[05-Dec-19 08:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
counts the vouts from end of tx until it reaches the number of notaries who notarized... ignores vouts before that, so any ac apram will work

[05-Dec-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
hard fork or what
