for ^^ the bug testing what version of komodod should we be using?

`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/commits/kmdHFtest`
I am pushing LOTS of bug fixes to this branch. So far its seems fairly solid. Its not the same as KMD repo exactly however. But as we are starting new chains anyway it does not matter.

[05-Dec-19 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pinned a message.

[05-Dec-19 04:17 AM] dude#6062
@blackjok3r  thank you

[05-Dec-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries. The Hardfork timestamp is set to some hours ago, so most chains will stop syncing near the end.

[05-Dec-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Was hopeing @Alright  would be back soon so we could start some chains... I guess I can just post this chain we have for now.

[05-Dec-19 04:18 AM] dude#6062
good to know, just trying to get everything prep'd - setting it all up from scratch on new machine... so i'm sure i'll hit some hicups along the way

[05-Dec-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for sure lol

[05-Dec-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That branch I added the ability to use notarypay with more assetchain params than before, but cant test it unless we add it to the LABS notaries.

[05-Dec-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Doing what I can, but I guess its time to get some people helping now/

[05-Dec-19 04:25 AM] dude#6062
for `https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/tree/pos64test#linux` i kept getting `"python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1` for `slick-bitcoinrpc` i had to install `libcurl4-openssl-dev` might need that added to list of dependencies needed...

[05-Dec-19 04:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry I dont really use any of that stuff..

[05-Dec-19 04:26 AM] dude#6062
me either - which was why i had a headache figuring it out 😂

[05-Dec-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ill see if I can add ot.. thanks

[05-Dec-19 04:28 AM] dude#6062
for the contest/bug find - is it necessary to use the pos64staker?

[05-Dec-19 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly not. I think for initial utxo split you need *something*

[05-Dec-19 04:29 AM] dude#6062
i made something already for the hempcoin/THC sure i can mod that for the asset needed

[05-Dec-19 04:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there is enough tools in the daemon itself now not to need scripts... if the wallet destroying transactions is actually fixed you cna basically just tunr it on and leave it for a year. 😂

[05-Dec-19 04:31 AM] dude#6062
well thanks for the info, off to bed, work in the am 😦

[05-Dec-19 04:31 AM] dude#6062

[05-Dec-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
catch ya. about to cruise myself I guess. done enough for a few days 😅

[05-Dec-19 06:54 AM] Oszy#5734
yes libcurl4-openssl-dev needs to be installed. hm i thought i pushed a PR for the readme.. 🤔

[05-Dec-19 08:46 AM] Oszy#5734
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Labs pool running fine? balance doesn't seem to update and payments are stopped?

[05-Dec-19 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
someone used a bad address and it stopped up payments will fix and reboot the pool right after my gravy is done

[05-Dec-19 08:56 AM] Oszy#5734
sure thanks

thanks @dude are you CzBaer?

[05-Dec-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
libcurl4-openssl-dev is in the readme already?

[05-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
Ah joker added it

[05-Dec-19 11:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

What was the purpose of CFEKMYLO6 and CFEKMYLO

[05-Dec-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
can I kill them? Anyone using them?

[05-Dec-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mylo was doing something with them iirc

[05-Dec-19 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
will leave them for now

[05-Dec-19 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo let me know if you're done

[05-Dec-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
could use some help testing something if anyone is available

[05-Dec-19 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
will only take a few minutes, just launched a new CFEK chain, need to see if stakednotary works properly for others

[05-Dec-19 12:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
chain parameters ?

[05-Dec-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
will push it in a moment

[05-Dec-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
2 minutes

[05-Dec-19 12:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok

[05-Dec-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
@PHBA2061 do `./start.sh` on NN please

[05-Dec-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
likely to fail, did for me at least. Trying to figure out the simplest solution

[05-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
I just deleted komodo repo and recloned, but that takes a long while to rebuild

[05-Dec-19 12:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok, on it

[05-Dec-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
ty

[05-Dec-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
not quite sure what happened, but seems something recent broke builds. Couldn't figure out why it was happening, but I just ended up recloning repo and it's fine

[05-Dec-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
would rather not everyone have to do that

[05-Dec-19 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry @PHBA2061 do not start that yet, botched the assetchains.json, fixing one moment

[05-Dec-19 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
sorry

[05-Dec-19 12:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah it failed anyways 😅

[05-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
Sorry, no it's fine

[05-Dec-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
would it not be easier to have a fork for NNs that has a unified depends dir (containing all of the depends for all of the branches) and a dir for each branch?

[05-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
how did it fail?

[05-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
sorry what?

[05-Dec-19 01:00 PM] PHBA2061#2530
```
[master] ABORTING!!! failed to update please build manually using ~/komodo/zcutil/build.sh to see what problem is! Help Human!
```

[05-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
```
rm ~/komodo
git clone https://github.com/kmdlabs/komodo
cd StakedNotary
./start.sh```

[05-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
do that please

[05-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
simplest solution I guess, just takes a few minutes

[05-Dec-19 01:00 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok

[05-Dec-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```
LabsKomodo
    depends
    master
        src
    testa
        src
    testb
        src
    etc..```

[05-Dec-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
basically like the multi-dir that we run the daemons from, but to build them

[05-Dec-19 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
that would make the dir several gb

[05-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
would be 2-3gb each

[05-Dec-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah? and?

[05-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
oh no sorry, wouldn't be quite that much, but still more than it needs to be

[05-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Alright#0419
what's the issue with how it is now?

[05-Dec-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what's the issue with how it is now?`
besides the general probability that switching branches tends to fail to build for at least 2 people, nothing

[05-Dec-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the depends is generally the fail point, so I had a thought that might help that

[05-Dec-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no real "issue", just sharing my 2 cents

[05-Dec-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
is everyone running blackjok3r branch of StakedNotary?

[05-Dec-19 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
don't quite understand what he did here

[05-Dec-19 01:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm on master

[05-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
yea, it's not optimal, but depends problems are so occasional and so easy to fix, it's not much of an issue

[05-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
using several more gbs than needed because of something that might happen twice a year and is incredibly simple to fix when it does doesn't seem smart

[05-Dec-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

master didn't have CFEKMYLO chains, are you not running them?

[05-Dec-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, I am running them

[05-Dec-19 01:10 PM] Alright#0419

the new staking algo will activate in about 6.5 hours

[05-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 would appreciate if you could setup a stratum and do some basic mining tests

[05-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
I distributed some coins to anyone who already signed up for comp as well, if anyone else needs some just let me know

[05-Dec-19 01:14 PM] Alright#0419

`the new staking algo will activate in about 6.5 hours`
that should give me enough time to finish my 🛀🏽

[05-Dec-19 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
might as well just do `./start.sh` and update while you're at it

[05-Dec-19 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
