[05-Dec-19 05:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[05-Dec-19 05:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IU cant debug it without notaries. what is the block hash for that block?

you didn't fork the repo did you?

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
just cloned

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeahhhhh

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
you can't commit changes to the original repo

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
you need to fork first

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
awesome

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
then change in your fork

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
then push to your fork

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Oszy#5734
them pull request to original

[05-Dec-19 05:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[05-Dec-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
screw all that --ill comment

[05-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Oszy#5734
good practice of git 😄

[05-Dec-19 06:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill learn -but notrightnow

[05-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Oszy#5734
can't go wrong if following the instructions 😛

[05-Dec-19 06:01 PM] Oszy#5734
if it says fork the repo you need to fork it :p

[05-Dec-19 06:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ohhhh

[05-Dec-19 06:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
to my repo

[05-Dec-19 06:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats what the fork forking is

[05-Dec-19 06:01 PM] Oszy#5734
do you have a github account?

[05-Dec-19 06:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah -i lost my corporate login

[05-Dec-19 06:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
so just my personal playground

[05-Dec-19 06:02 PM] Oszy#5734
log in to that and fork pos64staker, then clone your own forked repo

[05-Dec-19 06:02 PM] Oszy#5734
and so on

[05-Dec-19 06:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i got it --- i just woke up and and have never push pulled forked for real - but i understand

[05-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Oszy#5734
no worries

[05-Dec-19 06:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even 9if you dont know what you are doing just pretend that your do and it will be fine 🤣

abusedsmily 

[05-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Oszy#5734
might do a readme to attract more ppl for testing who don't know git

[05-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Oszy#5734
will see how much time i'll have when i get home

[05-Dec-19 06:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just make it easier to sign up 🤷‍♂️

[05-Dec-19 06:05 PM] Oszy#5734
well that's out of my hands 😄

[05-Dec-19 06:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181

hash of block 480

[05-Dec-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yrah its moving and it notarized... I think something wrongtho

[05-Dec-19 06:09 PM] Oszy#5734
think so. it was stuck for quite a bit.

[05-Dec-19 06:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
`even 9if you dont know what you are doing just pretend that your do and it will be fine` that sounds like the slogan of my former employer

🤣 

[05-Dec-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gets stuck when a notarizxation tx is being mined in a founders block, this was expected

[05-Dec-19 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
need what from me?

[05-Dec-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r

[05-Dec-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
Ahhh

[05-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r just going to prevent miner from adding notarization tx to them or...?

[05-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
oh

[05-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
not sure we'll ever actually need it

[05-Dec-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no it should work, need to fix it... but I need to wait for a block

[05-Dec-19 06:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just stop my node at the block and try to mine a block wont be hard

[05-Dec-19 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r fix is a hard fork or what?

[05-Dec-19 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
when would we ever have an ac_notarypay ac_perc chain?

[05-Dec-19 07:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should work with all chains, I just did it stupid... i have fix but runnign into a random deadlock trying to sync this chain

[05-Dec-19 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
do you intend to hard fork this chain?

[05-Dec-19 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
it's about to hard fork right now

[05-Dec-19 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
10 minutes

[05-Dec-19 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
sorry 5

[05-Dec-19 07:19 PM] Alright#0419
`[CFEKPOS1:604] starting PoW with 26s until block is elegible for broadcast...` fucking love it :shexy:

[05-Dec-19 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only way to break it is to PoW min blocks with time in the past... but I dont think you can do that either, havent tried it yet tho

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
lol sure you can

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
you serious? 🤣

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to mine PoW blockswith timestamp before the block before it.

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
it must be >MTP

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
which can be in past

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
and is

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can submit utxo in future

[05-Dec-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
yes you can do that

[05-Dec-19 07:32 PM] Alright#0419
please tell me you haven't been working on the assumption that timestamps always move forward

[05-Dec-19 07:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I couldnt get it to accept blocks> 60s past the previousblopck timestamp... but... you can make the block before an earlier time to trick it I assume

[05-Dec-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant comp is pushed back until Sunday

This CFEKPOS1 chain just hard forked to the new algo if you want to start playing with it.

[05-Dec-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
if you need coins, let me know or try to POW mine them

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
man it's the mean block time of the last 17 blocks

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
which is always in the past

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using timestamps isnt best idea, but thats just how it has always been

[05-Dec-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure what we're talking about here

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
what is assuming timestamps always move forward right now?

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
`then you can submit utxo in future` how?

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the PoS645 algo, each utxo has an elegible time .. each utxo can stake at that time or after it, but the blockchain doesnt know exacty what the time is

[05-Dec-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
There is `-splitperc=` startup command that allows you to specify how much of the staking utxo should be combined with coinbase

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
this can be set with `setstakingsplit` rpc as well

[05-Dec-19 07:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
umm bno i did
