If only that app was out of beta ðŸ˜„

Worst case scenario with atomic swaps is that you have to wait a few hours.

[05-Dec-19 01:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomicdex is primarily going to be for OTC trading after all.

I really hope that's not a bear flag on the daily coz it points to 40c

really looks like one

[05-Dec-19 07:01 PM] richardt#2807
40cents would bring KMD below bear market lows. That's a scary thought

[05-Dec-19 07:13 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah it is, not sure what could cause such a devaluation, but I just show what the chart says. Don't want to cause panic, the flag isn't perfect, but that was a pretty strong rejection after our mystery shopper yesterday

[05-Dec-19 07:20 PM] Bitfinger#6245
And heres an update btc chart if anyone is interested. Looks like we might be in a little bull flag inside the larger channel, but we're under the pressure of the death cross: https://www.tradingview.com/x/k4N4iiVi

Anyone know where to find the best fresh list of exchanges KMD can be found on, volumes etc? I thought CMC (markets) had a tab for this, but canâ€™t find it. Maybe Iâ€™m just overlooking?

Little bit of fiddling on the chart and it looks like we bounced off the bottom of the 'bear flag': https://www.tradingview.com/x/EWLxB9BD

Just some interesting parallel alignments. The top of yesterday's spike lines up exactly with the top of the dead cat bounce on Nov 20 and parallel to the bottoms:
