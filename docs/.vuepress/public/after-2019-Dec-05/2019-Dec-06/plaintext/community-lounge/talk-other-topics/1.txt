Crypto is fucking surreal.

DigiByte founder posts a thread criticising TRON and its usurpation of Poloniex.

Hours later, Poloniex replies saying that DigiByte is going to be delisted from their platform after a miraculous and entirely coincidental "careful review".

HEX will be one to watch for sure, most of the Ponzi like qualities are built into the smart contract, even if Richard Heart ends up in prison and the website is taken offline the HEX smart contract will still work, this makes for a fascinating experiment IMO. RH might even be forced to refund the ETH, and maybe he even expects that and his personal payoff will be the origin accounts share of HEX (estimated to be as high as 30%). It's certain HEX will attract SEC attention and maybe RH is hoping for a small fine like EOS,  but he's obviously not an idiot, so I think he has a plan to avoid prison. My hunch at this stage is he either donates the ETH or refunds it, and his plan is to keep the origin HEX.

Everything in crypto looks like a scam at the start, Bitcoin NXT NEM ethereum Doge, etc every single project I have followed is called a scam by someone. One thing HEX has in it's favour is marketing, RH is a master of getting attention.
Pro tip: claim your HEX,  but be warned,  if you follow the daily transform AA you might get addicted, HEX is like a game, and it *might* become popular

The difference between the dollar and the gold from the Bitcoin is

Bitcoin increases participants in global supply chain and blockchain solves problems of trust in supply chain. The dollar or gold has no ability to execute contracts beyond the state-controlled financial system.

If the government to which the producer belongs extremely controls foreign exchange, the producer will receive the currency in its own currency, which is worthless. The manufacturer then loses the incentive to keep the promise, so the buyer does not initially place an order for the troubled producer.

However, if bitcoin is paid that does not go through the financial network, the producer will be tempted to deliver it on time without considering being taken over by the government, so hundreds of millions of new global citizens can participate in the global supply chain.

Blockchain boosts confidence among the numerous stakeholders involved in the supply chain. Most wines imported to nation are subject to the hot equator, which makes them taste bad. The use of refrigerated containers does not guarantee proper temperature. However, if temperature sensors inside a container record abnormalities in blockchain, not only retailers but also end consumers can compare information and prices. Due to blockchain, value-added product lines will be added to global supply chain and more opportunities will be opened.
