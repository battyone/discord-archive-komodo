[telegram] <Craig> Binance doesn't respect Komodo enough to open wallets in time or figure out how to "stake" correctly. 
KMD treated by like a plaything by pump and dumpers at least once, maybe twice in 30 days.
Flagship product is a DEX that doesn't really work yet (at least not if +300 people use it at once, or you want to see order history, or you want liquidity). In a few months, assuming it does work, the tokenomics won't necessarily pump KMD.
Other multi-chain style projects eg cosmos have more stuff going on in their ecosystem.
Community doesn't have any memes.
It's a cool project but it isn't shocking that 1300 or even 900 haven't held (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: Dumping hard)

[05-Dec-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
9k to 8.5k was the "crash"?

[05-Dec-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the chart, i cant even tell when exchanges reopened, its almost as if there was no effect from that

[05-Dec-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you were ranting that it would drop back to 6k

[05-Dec-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Where did I say 6k?

[05-Dec-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Not to mention the pump and dump that happened hours b4

[05-Dec-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> So 13000 to 8500 technically

[05-Dec-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
not really, binance didnt open until most of that retraced, all with the wallet closed

[05-Dec-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
your theory was that the price went up only due to wallet being closed. implying that when wallets reopened the price would go back to where it started from

[05-Dec-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Well in the case of USD I was right.

[05-Dec-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
all price movement prior to wallet reopening was supposed to be some sort of manipulation, yet OBV is near highest levels seen

[05-Dec-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the only market for KMD/USD was bittrex, which remained open the entire time. so your theory seems to have not much basis in reality

[05-Dec-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
my theory is that new chinese volumes drove the price much higher and that the effect of wallets being closed was on the order of 5%, the difference between prices at different exchanges

[05-Dec-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes the price moves because people accumulate large amounts. definitely strange that somebody buys 200BTC worth right before the exchange reopens wallet at 20% premium.

[05-Dec-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but a pump and dump would see the OBV end up at below where it was before the price rise started, wouldnt it?

[05-Dec-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <iqly_almond> Its funny jl777 even talk about p&d

[05-Dec-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it is unfortunately part of the crypto scene, so i want to clarify what is and what isnt a pump and dump.

[05-Dec-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in a real pump and dump, the volumes go extremely high and after it is done, the OBV (on balance volumes) end up about where it was before the price rise.

[05-Dec-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> So the binance p&d and the bittrex pump hours before wallets are enabled was all just a big coincidence?

[05-Dec-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not anything like what happened with KMD price from the 6k level

[05-Dec-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yesterday was a big accumulation. look at the OBV. do you know what OBV is?

[05-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Nope, Ive been trying to look it up

On-Balance Volume (OBV)
On-balance volume (OBV) is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.

[05-Dec-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
whoever bought the 200 BTC worth, paid a premium and sold LESS than what they bought, even if 100% of all sales after the price rise was them. my guess is they bought 200 BTC worth and didnt sell any of it

[05-Dec-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the sales were likely done by other parties and at lower volumes than the buy. if this was a pump and dump, they forgot to do the dumping.

[05-Dec-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Could they possibly caused a Fomo effect on binance, cashed out, and then bought back in on the low at Bittrex?

[05-Dec-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
what was the volume on bittrex? it seems it is 10x lower than binance

[05-Dec-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you have interesting theories, but without correlating actual numbers, it seems the theories are not supported

[05-Dec-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
$20k volume on bittrex, 200 BTC bought on binance. seems a very inefficient way.

[05-Dec-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
others have posted some random buying going on across several other coins, so it could indeed be a coincidence that some BTC whale decided to market buy various altcoins. no idea, but it certainly wasnt a pump and dump.

[05-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
after a steep price increase, there is always a correction. and if the price increase was just one trader paying a premium, it usually just decays back to where it was. that appears to be what the 200 BTC spike to 13k was the other day.

[05-Dec-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
as opposed to the more widespread and gradual rise from 6k to 12k, which then corrected to 9k (roughly speaking) half the gain retraced, which i think is some standard TA levels

[05-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Fair enough. Still seems kinda odd for all that to happen right before Binance wallet enabled. But anywho. Best of luck with the upgrade, hope you are able to convince binance 120 confirmations is bullshit in the near future.

[05-Dec-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
they have some custom system that doesnt look at the "confirmations" field, if they did that they could just set it to 2

[05-Dec-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kriptodan Batan Adam> hope it doesn't come back to bottom levels

[05-Dec-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
since the recent price spike happened on other coins too, it seems unlikely it has anything to do with the wallet status. but i agree, it was indeed a strange thing. last year we had a spike to 100k+ at huobi and thousands of BTC volume. in crypto, strange things happen

if you can predict price of BTC, dominance of BTC, KMD rank on CMC, then you can likely make a decent prediction of price

[05-Dec-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems KMD rank on CMC ranges from 40 to 60 for the most part

[05-Dec-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810

To be sure, the vast majority of investors have no confidence in KMD, but just use it as a short-term speculative tool. This is completely different from what I feel in the XTZ community. Some people are optimistic that KMD is worth 30 $. I think that might be ten years later or even more. That's too long for me. . . But I will keep one thousand in the future.
