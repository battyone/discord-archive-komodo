@molab yes

[05-Dec-19 07:07 AM] molab#4930
Recently had coins sent from my wallet that i did not authorize just wondering how this happens and how to prevent in future

[05-Dec-19 07:09 AM] gcharang#6833
what is the version number of the wallet you are using?

[05-Dec-19 07:10 AM] molab#4930
Latest v05.9-2

[05-Dec-19 07:11 AM] molab#4930
Its the only version i have used  i am 
new to verus coin

[05-Dec-19 07:12 AM] gcharang#6833
oh, I am not really sure
did you install any suspicious programs recently?
you can get direct support from the Verus Coin team here: https://discord.gg/7FY4cG

[05-Dec-19 07:16 AM] molab#4930
Only installed ccminer for cpu and gpu, already tried verus team no help, wallet was down loaded from verus.io and only one specific address was compromised

[05-Dec-19 07:17 AM] molab#4930
Address was generated by agama wallet

[05-Dec-19 07:22 AM] Oszy#5734
lite mode? is it an address that was generated and used before March 2019?

[05-Dec-19 07:23 AM] Oszy#5734
oh sorry i see it's first time using agama

[05-Dec-19 07:23 AM] Oszy#5734
are you staking verus?

[05-Dec-19 07:27 AM] molab#4930
Native mode generated around mid november 2019, yes staking,

[05-Dec-19 07:28 AM] Oszy#5734
And did you get a stake recently? because a stake will show as an outgoing tx, but it comes back as well. 
did you ever use the private key of that address to log in in lite mode or anywhere else?
send me the address if it's not a secret

[05-Dec-19 07:32 AM] molab#4930
Have not received stake back, how long does it take to get stake back, never used priv key anywhere
U want pub key

[05-Dec-19 07:32 AM] Oszy#5734
just the public address (starting with R)

[05-Dec-19 07:32 AM] Oszy#5734
usually it's straight away agama might not show it properly

[05-Dec-19 07:33 AM] Oszy#5734
let me check on explorer what happened

[05-Dec-19 07:34 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@Oszy molab posted a screenshot in Verus Discord. The funds are sent to a private addres. It may give some insight into the issue to read that as well.

[05-Dec-19 07:34 AM] Oszy#5734
oh.

[05-Dec-19 07:34 AM] Oszy#5734
thanks Oink

[05-Dec-19 07:35 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
The transfers out happen shortly after the funds arrive in his wallet. In my opinion his address is compromised

[05-Dec-19 07:35 AM] Oszy#5734
if that's the case the address is indeed compromised,  I would delete everything you downloaded and installed since the address was created something is malicious.

[05-Dec-19 07:38 AM] molab#4930
Can you give me insight how address was compomised so i can avoid in future please

[05-Dec-19 07:38 AM] Oszy#5734
hard to say, in my opinion you must have downloaded something that got access to either your wallet.dat or your clipboard

[05-Dec-19 07:39 AM] Oszy#5734
if possible keep the wallet separate from your everyday / mining computer.

[05-Dec-19 07:39 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Let me post my suggestions here too:
>>> @molab If those transfers out of your wallet have not been done by yourself your address is compromised, so I suggest these actions:
1) Stop all transfers to this address (change mining / payout address as soon as possible)
2) Transfer all funds in this wallet to a newly created different wallet on another system (like Verus Mobile).
3) Remove this wallet and the wallet software from your system.
4) Check your system thoroughly on malware (which is a likely cause of that address being compromised). Use consequtive sweeps with different Malware / AntiVirus / Rootkit scanners.
5) If you are convinced your system is clean, reinstall Agama to create a new (uncompromised) wallet.
6) Transfer funds to your new wallet and adjust mining addresses to it.
7) make regular backups of your `wallet.dat` and/or WIFs to a secure, off-line device.

[05-Dec-19 07:40 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Never use your WIF to log in to any untrusted application, like a webwallet, explorer. And never give anyone access to your private keys.

[05-Dec-19 07:41 AM] Oszy#5734
and when downloading miner software make sure you are downloading from the official github channels, don't download from anywhere else.

[05-Dec-19 07:41 AM] molab#4930
Ok thanks appreciate your help  does verus have a paper wallet

[05-Dec-19 07:42 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

Paper wallet is reachable after a refresh (one of the servers has a problem). Refreshing will trigger a new DNS-round robin entry.

[05-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Arno#3334
What's the derivation path of Agama Wallet addresses? The problem is that when you enter the same 24 word seed into Agama and bip39 tools, different KMD addresses are derived. The path of the bip39 tools is m/44'/141'/0'/0/0. So what's the path of Agama? Just want to make sure to be safe just with the seed even without Agama, but if I use Agama's addresses, I cannot find them anymore with bip39 tools, which feels dangerous to me.

[05-Dec-19 09:42 AM] gcharang#6833
Agama address generation doesn't follow bip39
it is something unique for the komodo ecosystem

even if agama wasn't available, all the other wallets in komodo ecosystem support the passphrase

it is even baked into the komodo core daemon itself
```
./komodo-cli help convertpassphrase                                                                                                  

convertpassphrase "agamapassphrase"

Converts Agama passphrase to a private key and WIF (for import with importprivkey).

Arguments:
1. "agamapassphrase"   (string, required) Agama passphrase

Result:
"agamapassphrase": "agamapassphrase",   (string) Agama passphrase you entered
"address": "komodoaddress",             (string) Address corresponding to your passphrase
"pubkey": "publickeyhex",               (string) The hex value of the raw public key
"privkey": "privatekeyhex",             (string) The hex value of the raw private key
"wif": "wif"                            (string) The private key in WIF format to use with 'importprivkey'

Examples:
> komodo-cli  convertpassphrase "agamapassphrase"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "convertpassphrase", "params": ["agamapassphrase"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```  
the wif format is the universal format and will work in all wallets

[05-Dec-19 09:43 AM] gcharang#6833
@Arno ^

[05-Dec-19 09:43 AM] Arno#3334
WIF is just the private key for a given address, right?

[05-Dec-19 09:44 AM] Arno#3334
regardless of seed words

[05-Dec-19 09:44 AM] gcharang#6833
wif means "wallet import format" 
it is the privatekey in a form that can be imported into any wallet that supports KMD

[05-Dec-19 09:44 AM] gcharang#6833
> regardless of seed words
yes

[05-Dec-19 09:45 AM] Arno#3334
What about atomicDEX's incapability of importing a 24 word seed? Or Agama not offering 12 words to generate? Already in that regard the wallets seem not so compatible

[05-Dec-19 09:45 AM] Arno#3334
And you can't import a WIF into atomicDEX

[05-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Arno#3334
So in some cases you have to rely on seed words

[05-Dec-19 09:46 AM] gcharang#6833
> atomicDEX's incapability of importing a 24 word seed
you can use agama's 24 word passphrase in atomicDEX and viseversa

[05-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Arno#3334
with "custom seed" enabled?

[05-Dec-19 09:47 AM] gcharang#6833
> So in some cases you have to rely on seed words
this is true right now
in regards to atomicDEX
but, it will definitely support wif import before it comes out of beta

[05-Dec-19 09:47 AM] gcharang#6833
> with "custom seed" enabled?
yes

[05-Dec-19 09:48 AM] Arno#3334
so with a regular bip39 tool it is impossible to retrieve from a 24 word seed the keys and addresses that would be used in the Komodo ecosystem?

[05-Dec-19 09:49 AM] gcharang#6833
not the default ones atleast
the ledger wallet uses bip39 address for KMD also

[05-Dec-19 09:51 AM] Arno#3334
ok

[05-Dec-19 11:21 AM] Cabey#3299
Anyone able to help privately with an unexpected transfer?

[05-Dec-19 11:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@Cabey coins from your wallet were moved without your knowledge?

[05-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Cabey#3299
I believe so yeah

[05-Dec-19 11:23 AM] gcharang#6833
wallet name and version?

[05-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Cabey#3299
Verus Agama v0.5.9-2

[05-Dec-19 11:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 this is the second instance, today ^
should we raise an alarm? 😅

[05-Dec-19 11:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@Cabey send me the affected address in DM

[05-Dec-19 11:26 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@gcharang Please check how long this address has been in use, as to determine the possible timeframe when this address may got compromised.

[05-Dec-19 11:29 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah, sorry for the ping
the address was used in the old agama 😦

[05-Dec-19 11:30 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
No problem, better safe than sorry... Two reports in one day is certainly reason to be vigilant.

[05-Dec-19 11:37 AM] Cabey#3299
Thanks for your help but holy fuck I'm going to be sick
