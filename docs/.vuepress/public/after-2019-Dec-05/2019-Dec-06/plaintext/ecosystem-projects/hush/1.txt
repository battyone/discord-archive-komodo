After a careful review, we decided #DigiByte is not qualified per our listing standard. We will delist $DGB soon. Details to be announced.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
DigiByte founder posts a thread criticising TRON and its usurpation of Poloniex.

Hours later, Poloniex replies saying that DigiByte is going to be delisted from their platform after a miraculous and entirely coincidental "careful review".

Stunning.

Scoop: Kashmiris disappeared from WhatsApp overnight due to a FB policy that deletes inactive accounts automatically after 120 days. The internet has been shut down in Kashmir for 4 months now. No word on any concessions given the circumstances in Kashmir https://t.co/cwTL...

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> A bunch of bots signed in a half of hour ago. @gilardh can you delete them?

[05-Dec-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Nevermind, just saw in general-support.

[05-Dec-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @halo kitty rules I banished'Angelic Mix'. The others were expelled. Maybe I should be less nice and ban them directly.

[05-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Those who are expelled may return

[05-Dec-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes, that is a possibility. If I were you, I would delete them...

[05-Dec-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He has been making money off of everyone's coins by staking

[05-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think he even stakes coins being traded in the hot wallet
