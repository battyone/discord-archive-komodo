KMD treated by like a plaything by pump and dumpers at least once, maybe twice in 30 days.
Flagship product is a DEX that doesn't really work yet (at least not if +300 people use it at once, or you want to see order history, or you want liquidity). In a few months, assuming it does work, the tokenomics won't necessarily pump KMD.
Other multi-chain style projects eg cosmos have more stuff going on in their ecosystem.
