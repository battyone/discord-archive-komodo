"242635006516658197","jorian#4555","06-Jan-20 03:58 PM","i have an issue regarding locktime on multisig addresses on an assetchain. I'm using VRSC Agama and it creates a tx which i decoded on the left side of the screenshot. on the right side, it is the manually created one on the command line, witihout a locktime set (but with expirytime set, as i see now)

i checked the locktime of the left transaction and it is the current time, so after the creation of the tx, it has elapsed and it should be unlocked to be broadcasted. However, when trying to broadcast, it shows me a `code: 1, the transaction was rejected by network rules. non-final code -26` error. 
can anyone tell me why the Agama VRSC created tx is non-final?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463445317136809984/663773282671001602/unknown.png",""
