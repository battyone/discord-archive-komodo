I'd like to see him put 1000Eth in there and see what happens.","",""

```The US prosecutors are conspiring with the British to ensure thatÂ Julian Assange never goes to trial

The US and British will killÂ Julian Assange before they ever allow him to go to trial for he was defending the public against a corrupt system.

The British will not allow independent doctors to visit Assange meanwhile they have been keeping him like Jeffrey Epstein in solitary confinement.
