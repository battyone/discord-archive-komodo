"440030719386058762","CiPhEr#2091","06-Jan-20 08:38 AM","hi there just slowly learning more about and using atomicdex, have a question (thanks for the answers yesterday by the way)
As far as the transaction fee in a transaction (aka network fee that goes to miners on chain) which side pays this, the maker, taker or both? 

Am I correct in assuming it is both, of which the fee is taken from each leg of the transaction's journey? i.e. tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade, tx fee #2 from taker sending to hold address, tx fee #3 sending from hold address to maker, tx fee #4 from maker to holding address and finally tx fee #5 from holding address to taker.

In this case, for the transaction fee that is displayed in app when setting up a trade (for instance 0.00006038 btc for a btc trade right now) is that amount an estimate for total needed for all 5 payments to go through, or is that the fee for each tx (so for maker would be the above fee * 2, the taker would be the above fee * 3?)","",""

it should be tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade (chain A),  tx fee #2 from maker sending to intermediate address(maker payment, chain B),  tx fee #3 from taker sending to intermediate address(taker payment, chain A) , tx fee #4 maker claim (chain A), tx fee #5 taker claim(chain B)","",""
