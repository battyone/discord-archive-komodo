[06-Jan-20 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It is a decentralized project, there isn't a set decision maker, if you want to try and raise funds to get on an exchange then you are free to do that. However going with official team members is probably the better route. (re @lindamercy: may i know who is the decision making for donating and do marketing)

[06-Jan-20 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Full disclosure to everyone here, please beware of people offering exchange listings. It is very common for scammers to pretend to be admin from exchange channels and message people in here in order to try and get people to send money. I have yet to find an actual exchange that will reach out to projects on telegram offering listings. 
Go through the proper channels and apply for listings on the exchange sites (don't use links to sites they send to you in DMs!) And if someone reaches out to you don't be afraid to ask the community in Discord to help you vet the source!

[06-Jan-20 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> All addresses are, but not everything has a name. The site manually adds names to those who openly state their addresses. Notice binance has a ? Because we THINK it's Binance lol. The nature of psuedo anonymous blockchains (re @Debodebeli: Ledger adresses are not on this list?)

[06-Jan-20 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And ledger addresses are still decentralized so it's not like Ledger is holding KMD for their users like Binance or Bittrex

[06-Jan-20 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Besides Komodo devs, not sure. But I don't fully understand your question. The link I sent is how you make BTC or other coin sidechains, with additional Antara modules to do smart contract type things (re @Qblu32ooth: Any smart contact platforms working on these build outs that you say are in existence)

[06-Jan-20 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Qblu32ooth> I understand

[06-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Qblu32ooth> RSK is pegged to BTC through RBTC it's a smart contract, you can do atomic swaps, it's just not built out.  Switching to RBTC faster would help money on chain platform which is like maker dai

[06-Jan-20 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> RBTC seem to be super illiquid, $235k vol in the last 24h, and with crazy spikes O_o In december it spiked to $43500

[06-Jan-20 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> BTC doesn't need a side chain with smart contracts to do atomic swaps though, Komodo already does atomic swaps with BTC just using BTC. Use Atomicdex and you can swap BTC with any other coin, no need for KMD or some side chain. (re @Qblu32ooth: RSK is pegged to BTC through RBTC it's a smart contract, you can do atomic swaps, it's just not built out.

[06-Jan-20 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Qblu32ooth> That's cool and all but I'd like to see RBTC to BTC swaps soon (re @Regnar: BTC doesn't need a side chain with smart contracts to do atomic swaps though, Komodo already does atomic swaps with BTC just using BTC.

[06-Jan-20 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't really see the appeal tbh. As I said Komodo can pretty much do that with a single Antara module. Build a BTC side chain that can have any of the features you want of other Antara modules, quantum security, instant on chain swaps, smart contracts, tokens etc. (re @Qblu32ooth: That's cool and all but I'd like to see RBTC to BTC swaps soon)

[telegram] <Qblu32ooth> Why isn't anyone utilizing it? Defi on bitcoin side is non existent....

[06-Jan-20 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But I mean it's still cool, just not as groundbreaking as it is hyped

[06-Jan-20 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think this question is more for the market as a whole, why isn't Defi as big as it has been hyped. Realistically there aren't a ton of players building projects around Defi beyond the use as a currency, and those that are bigger aren't nearly the size that was expected. I think the whole market will need to grow including purposeful use cases for Defi like projects. 
Komodo itself is building a pretty cool Defi project using Komodo tech. Let me see if I can find the good summary and links real quick (re @Qblu32ooth: Why isn't anyone utilizing it? Defi on bitcoin side is non existent....)

[06-Jan-20 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Actually there is an end of year report being prepared. But there is the Atomicdex which is a mobile friendly DEX that uses AtomicSwaps. This is a different and more improved backend engine than the old BarterDEX. Auto order matching/utxo. 
Smart chains that provide limitless scaling capacity while maintaining decentralization and security with dPoW.
Antara modules, the brand name for custom consensus/smart contracts. These include things like decentralized stable coin creation, pegged assets, tokens, decentralized trust less Oracles, quantum resistant addresses, and more.
nSPV, a new way for Komodo and other smart chains to make ultra light wallets, thousands of times more efficient than traditional SPV. This is perfect for IoT, mobile wallets, and smart watches. Currently testing antara modules with nSPV.
Currently testing a new messaging layer that can be used for faster decentralized orderbooks, or even building a decentralized Twitter or Discord.
