So, what happens if a miner creates a TX with a 99% fee and mines it himself? If rbf is used, the fee would need to be even higher meaning they would lose 99% of their balance to miners anyway.
I'd like to see him put 1000Eth in there and see what happens.

The author also goes on to call miners dumb for mining the TX with higher fee and not the older one... well then rbf wouldn't work at all would it... duh! Who's the dumb one?

Say goodbye to Julian Assange it appears he will be killed soon, unless you feel Armstrong is continually wrong, in which case he'll be fine.

```The US prosecutors are conspiring with the British to ensure that¬†Julian Assange never goes to trial

The US and British will kill¬†Julian Assange before they ever allow him to go to trial for he was defending the public against a corrupt system.

The British will not allow independent doctors to visit Assange meanwhile they have been keeping him like Jeffrey Epstein in solitary confinement.

Remarkable. Mexican bitcoin exchange @Bitso says it processes around 2.5% of all US remittances sent to Mexico and is on target to grow that to 20% this year. https://t.co/tL7EgRE0BJ
