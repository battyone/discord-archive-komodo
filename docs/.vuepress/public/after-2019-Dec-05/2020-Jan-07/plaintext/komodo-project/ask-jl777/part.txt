and the smallest number of cli commands that reproduces a bug will be best

[06-Jan-20 07:13 PM] TonyL#3577
sure, will prepare it now

looks like volume filtering works as expected

[06-Jan-20 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that's is unexpected! i never had a chance to test it

a lot of the lines have [] in them. probably that could have confused things?

[06-Jan-20 07:25 PM] TonyL#3577
it were my tries "to learn new language"

[06-Jan-20 07:25 PM] TonyL#3577
let me try to reproduce it cleanly on restart

[06-Jan-20 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
most likely is that the minpriority is being parsed as 0

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BGBvRRhjry/ output I'm getting from `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_list "" 3 "BTC"`

[06-Jan-20 07:31 PM] TonyL#3577
maybe `02` pubkey is matters, trying without pubkey

[06-Jan-20 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810

@Sir Seven Please connect to this tech testing and write CI test (at least for filtering for start)

also, basic tag tracking is not really tested much. i just sent a few tagA tagB combinations and it looked sane, but didnt explore all possible edge cases

[06-Jan-20 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
also the broadcast of ffff is a special case for load testing. if you can setup a decent p2p network with 100+ nodes. you can run a blaster loop to see how much packet/sec can be handled

`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_list "" 3 "BTC"` displaying now only entries with priority >=3 so it is fixed it seems

[06-Jan-20 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
```while true
do
./komodo-cli -ac_name=XUZ DEX_broadcast ffff
done
```

[06-Jan-20 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
above is a blaster loop. it seems you can launch more than one on a single node, but with current txpow it will saturate pretty fast. for max throughput change:
#define KOMODO_DEX_TXPOWBITS 12   -->
#define KOMODO_DEX_TXPOWBITS 1
at that setting, a single node can push out about 500 to 1000 per second

[06-Jan-20 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
a p2p network should have each node having random 3+ other nodes as local peers

[06-Jan-20 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you are able to set up such a network automatically

[06-Jan-20 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont want it fully connected

[06-Jan-20 07:47 PM] TonyL#3577
if write such test suit on python we'll have rpc proxies for all nodes - the just `getpeersinfo` for each and some combinatorics peers ban before the test start

[06-Jan-20 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, it is lower priority than functionality testing as we already did a bunch of load testing

[06-Jan-20 07:48 PM] TonyL#3577
or even start 4th node with hardcoded `addnode` ips of previous three and so on

[06-Jan-20 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that wont work

[06-Jan-20 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to generate all the nodes and make a list of ip addresses

[06-Jan-20 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
then on each one, pick 4 random nodes and addnode those

[06-Jan-20 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the important thing is that it is randomly selected peers, any pattern in the peer selection will lead to suboptimal connectivity

[06-Jan-20 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but before any stress test, i need to fix the mutex (lack of) problem and speed up the tag creation/lookup, once that is done, there shouldnt be any more significant changes to the internals
