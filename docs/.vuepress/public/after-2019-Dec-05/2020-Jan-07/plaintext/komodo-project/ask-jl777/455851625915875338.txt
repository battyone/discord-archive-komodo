not sure what errors this indicates, it also would help if you use the latest versionj

[06-Jan-20 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL  @SHossain updated to a new hardforking version. this one is close to feature complete at the messaging layer. untagged packets (like from broadcast ffff) will get a general tag. i tested filtering by priority, and basic tracking based on tags, but there should be some bugs to find in complex cases. i didnt test the min/max amount filters, so that is a good one to test.

keep in mind that i expect things can crash after an hour, i need to add protection against that, so if it crashes after an hour, then just restart for now. i will work on that after i increase the 64 tags total limit.

please ask questions, the DEX_broadcast and DEX_list have quite a few parameters

my tests show that as long as you dont exceed the p2p network capacity (determined by the network topology and speed of nodes), then only about 1 in a million packets are out of sync

[06-Jan-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
with low end nodes, we saw the limit at about 3000/sec

[06-Jan-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
with higher end nodes, around 10000/sec

[06-Jan-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
txpow is active now at a minimal level and it would take a lot of cores to reach 10,000/sec

[06-Jan-20 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have priority based routing implemented yet, but the idea is that if the network is under spam attack, the nodes could detect this and increase the priority level they broadcast at. so without changing "consensus" limits, each client can increase the priority level until it sees all its packets arriving in the peer nodes

[06-Jan-20 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the one hour limit is a bit arbitrary and can be increased, but it doesnt seem like too much overhead for a GTC order to have to broadcast once per hour

[06-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i imagine realtime games designed for UDP could work without too much changes to use -dexp2p mode

`~/komodo/src/komodod -ac_name=DEXRDO -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=37.9.62.186 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &` is this AC from pinned message actual one?

[06-Jan-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use any chain now, but needs a -dexp2p=2 added to it, using my DEX branch

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no blockchain, nothing to sync

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
though you can have normal blocks too, they dont affect the dexp2p and dexp2p doesnt affect blocks

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] SHossain#0007
i can launch `DEXP2P` chain on those seed nodes

[06-Jan-20 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so only p2p connections matters for data broadcasting across p2p network

[06-Jan-20 08:51 AM] SHossain#0007
let me compile latest and launch those chains. will share the param shortly

[06-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it just uses the bitcoin peering to establish peers and send/recv messages

[06-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a custom DEX message is supported with -dexp2p set

[06-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
everything is in RAM, if you exceed RAM, well bad things will happen

[06-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
100% sync is not guaranteed, though unless you overload the network, you will get 99.999%+ in sync

[06-Jan-20 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe we should limit it to some specific `-ac_name`s only? Who knows what scary bugs might be inside of it and if all assetchains peers will accept it after code propagation means that everything can be stalled/crashed if bug is discovered

[06-Jan-20 08:52 AM] SHossain#0007
it is limited to DEX... chains only

[06-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
only nodes that add -dexp2p will enable it

[06-Jan-20 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have a subset of nodes with -dexp2p

[06-Jan-20 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
and only they will be doing messages. though i do need to add a nServices bit for this to prevent sending to a node that doesnt support dexp2p, would just be a waste of bandwidth

one seed node seen this. other one still compiling latest

[06-Jan-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL yes, for ffff it is a special packet for blasters

[06-Jan-20 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
seems they are in sync

[06-Jan-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it will send out 10 packets

[06-Jan-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the printout you see is the tag creation of "general"

[06-Jan-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it you send a normal packet with tagA of "general" before the ffff packet, it should be totally silent

[06-Jan-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
packets that are not ffff can be "an ascii string inside quotes" or a hexstring

[06-Jan-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810

updated the pinned guides with new chain param

[06-Jan-20 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i just updated (untested yet) using nServices bits to let other nodes know if dexp2p is supported, also made it so komodod -nSPV=1 nodes (superlite) will be able to do dexp2p messages. there are no nSPV remote access commands for dexp2p data (yet), but the plan is to add that and nodes with dexp2p=2 will be the fullnodes that respond to such requests, with dexp2p=1 nodes not responding

[06-Jan-20 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang i think it is ready to start documenting -dexp2p mode

for now it is just in my DEX branch, at some point it will be possible to make it compatible with normal branches (ie. not allocate a bunch of static data)

[06-Jan-20 09:13 AM] SHossain#0007
2nd seed node up

[06-Jan-20 09:18 AM] SHossain#0007

[06-Jan-20 09:20 AM] SHossain#0007

[06-Jan-20 09:21 AM] SHossain#0007
with 3 blasters, ~300txs/sec

[06-Jan-20 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i confirmed that the latest node wont send messages to nodes without the dexp2p bit in nServices

[06-Jan-20 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this is in effect a hardforking change from a few minutes ago

[06-Jan-20 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but now, we should be able to have dexp2p nodes on the same network as normal nodes and they wont interfere with each other

[06-Jan-20 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
nice

[06-Jan-20 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
also please try nSPV=1 nodes to make sure in superlite mode it works. i think that would be the preferable way as dexp2p nodes should be very lightweight

[06-Jan-20 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL @gcharang while dexp2p is designed specifically for DEX orderbooks it is done in a general way so that many other usecases are directly supported. tagA and tagB would be "base" and "rel" (or maker and taker) orders, which can also have a volA and volB field. this will allow the dexp2p to create an orderbook with volumes and price of tagA/tagB

the destpubkey is so you can send a DM to a specific address and even though it will be broadcast to all nodes, the data will be encrypted. with network analysis, the sender can be identified (the node who first broadcasts it) and the destpubkey is in plaintext, so the fact that a specific ip address is sending encrypted traffic to a specific pubkey can be determined. though, similar to GRIN it would take having a lot of monitoring nodes nearly fully connected to all the network to find the ip address, so it isnt anything that is easy to do, but then again not too difficult

[06-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if privacy of the sending ip is needed, do not use this for such comms

[06-Jan-20 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
wow, so pubkey is for OTC inside the DEX network

[06-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
in most cases other people knowing that an ip address (even if identified as you) is known to be sending messages to a brand new and never used anywhere else pubkey, it seems that is very little info leaked

[06-Jan-20 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you can implement a discord type of channel based public comms with DM using this, and by discord type, i mean tagA == name of discord, tagB == channel

[06-Jan-20 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can be connected to multiple dexp2p-discords, each with their own set of channels and send DM to specific pubkeys. you can publish your pubkey and even with monitoring of all traffic, it shouldnt leak that you send a DM, but of course if you link yourself to a pubkey, anything sent to you will be known you got messages, so to keep privacy, have 2 pubkeys. one that is public and linked to your handle, another (one for each other person) that is known only to you and the other person. this is exchanges in the public DM.

[06-Jan-20 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, you can get a persons secret pubkey and DM to that and nobody would know who the destination is. but as you can see, using this system for private comms will take a bit of extra work

[06-Jan-20 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is designed for speed above all else and will drop sync to maintain speed of following the realtime messages

why broadcasting node might set not max `priority` ?

[06-Jan-20 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
each priority level increase, doubles the time to calculate the txPoW

[06-Jan-20 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
priority of 10 is 1024 times harder to find that priority 0

[06-Jan-20 09:44 AM] TonyL#3577
so if I want more "prioritized" orders I need better server?

[06-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and currently priority 0 is equivalent to an internal priority level of 12

[06-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
bigger is better

[06-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but unless the network is overloaded, all messages get through, other than the background loss of 1 in a million

[06-Jan-20 09:44 AM] TonyL#3577
is time for txPoW is const  and not depends of my CPU freq?

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is SHA256 hash with enough 0 bits

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
actually it starts with the lowest bits matching 0x777

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
then additional 0 bits on top

[06-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
12 bits for 0x777 seems to take a few milliseconds

[06-Jan-20 09:46 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so hardware matters just a little bit

[06-Jan-20 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be noticeable even on a slow system

[06-Jan-20 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
at a priority of 5, i think it will take about 1 second

[06-Jan-20 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
`DEX_list stopat minpriority tagA tagB destpub33 [minA maxA minB maxB]` last param I wanted to clarify:
is `stopat` in `DEX_list` a unix timestamp?

[06-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that if you dont see your orders appear in the orderbook (from a remote nSPV request) and there are indications that the network is lagging, then boost the priority. that will then give preference to your packets. [this routing preference is not implemented yet]

[06-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
