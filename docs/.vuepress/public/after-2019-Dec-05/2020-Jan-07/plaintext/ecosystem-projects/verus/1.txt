[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> I downloaded the automatic bootstrap. And the new wallet version. It synced up and was 100% but when I activated staking and mining it dropped to 97% and had only come back to 97.99%. Is this normal ?

[06-Jan-20 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ႠႬႣႽᛕᛕ·ᵛʳˢᶜ＠> that would mean you're approx. 160 blocks behind now, after you already were on 100%?

[06-Jan-20 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> Yep

[06-Jan-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ႠႬႣႽᛕᛕ·ᵛʳˢᶜ＠> does it show 5 connections?

[dscrdvrsc] <wwhitley> Good morning to all my friends on VRSC this fine day,Just woke up and have my first cup of coffee. I hope everyone is doing fine and has a great day.

[06-Jan-20 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> @ႠႬႣႽᛕᛕ·ᵛʳˢᶜ＠ yes it does

[06-Jan-20 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ႠႬႣႽᛕᛕ·ᵛʳˢᶜ＠> I that case I'd try adding a few more temporary nodes to it. Unfortunately I don't have the respective IPs at hand... @𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 Could you help here please? 🙂

Just asked the tipbot a list of peers

[06-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ႠႬႣႽᛕᛕ·ᵛʳˢᶜ＠> ah, good to know, I'll note that

[06-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> add them using `addnode <IP-from-list> add` in `settings` --> `<CLI>`

[06-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> @𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠  do I add all of those ?

[06-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> about 5 of them should do the trick

[06-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> Okay now I need to find where to add them. On my computer

[06-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> Or is it in the wallet

[06-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> In Agama: add them using `addnode <IP-from-list> add` in `settings` --> `<CLI>`

[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> Got thanks. I’ll do that when I get home. Appreciate y’all

[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> The stake and mining thing in the wallet is great

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Meyse sent in new emojis 😍 
`:verus:` or `:verusheartblue:` :verusheartblue: 
`:verusheartwhite:` :verusheartwhite: 
`:veruscircleblue:` :veruscircleblue: 
`:veruscirclewhite:` :veruscirclewhite: 

and we still have the classic logo as `:vrsc:` :vrsc:

[06-Jan-20 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thank you!

[06-Jan-20 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> awesome, thank you! :veruscircleblue:

[06-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> now we need to determine wether or not the right icon has the "default" denominator `:verus:` 😛

[06-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or if it should point to another one 😄

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> Hi I understand that a new VRSC wallet is due out soon....one that will mean IDs can be created thru the GUI. Any idea when that will be released?

[06-Jan-20 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What's the latest Verus desktop alpha wallet version that you have? I think we're on -.7 now?   @Crypto Rich
<https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.0.7-alpha>

[06-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> Oh. I am on 0.5

[06-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> I need to get a move on

[06-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> LOL

[06-Jan-20 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Heh 👌

[06-Jan-20 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> Does 0.7 allow ID creation thru GUI?

[06-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes. But .5 does too.. is there something specific you're trying to do or just to create IDs? The ID tab should bring up some more options

[06-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You'll have to set a revocation and recovery address

[06-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If I were home now I'd pull it up but it wasn't too hard to do. Picked up a few thumb drives too to keep things neat 😉

[06-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> Thanks

[06-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <georat> the hashrate is in time bigger than 2 weeks before, the price decreased 🙂

[06-Jan-20 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well, it looks like standardpool just  unleashed a whole fresh buttload of grade-a hash on the network so that's not *too* unexpected 🤷‍♂️ - just more friendly competition is all 😄, more interest. Mining profitability is like a balancing act🩰 , or maybe more like a rollercoaster ride🎢  but it all comes back around in the end. ♻️

[06-Jan-20 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I couldn't help it. The new emojis got me excited! 🤟 🥳 :verusheartblue: :veruscirclewhite: :veruscircleblue: :verusheartwhite:
