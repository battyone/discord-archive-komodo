_NOW_ is the fucking bear dead for once???
smells like warming up for a nice spring in any case!

Too early to tell

[07-Jan-20 04:46 AM] Markus#5464

@Markus I was told there was big demand for alts :troll_lol:

[07-Jan-20 12:13 PM] Lanii#8302
Any potential pullback should not go further then 7.4-7.5 in order to keep this local uptrend going...

and alts dump

[07-Jan-20 06:46 PM] Markus#5464
ofc dump, if btc decides to start a new bullrun from here u will see alts pretty much non existant

[07-Jan-20 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
but macro trend is still bearish until we have a weekly close above 9500

@Markus good call on bch the other day. That pump surprised me.

[07-Jan-20 08:55 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
didnt know there were so many weak hands sleft in KMD to dump it so bad lol

[07-Jan-20 09:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
standard alt bleedage when btc pumps hard

[07-Jan-20 09:01 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I did mention we'd probably need to retest 52c. I expect a bounce thereish

it doesn't take many "weak hands". when books are thin @BoBot-BUY KMD

[07-Jan-20 09:02 PM] crumb#2550
this all has been discussed ad nauseum here

[07-Jan-20 09:02 PM] Bitfinger#6245
See the bearish div on RSI? Market see that and dumps, that's just how it works

[07-Jan-20 09:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
there are only 5 alts in the green in sats on Binance right now, every alt is bleeding its pretty simple

[07-Jan-20 09:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
4 of those are only up 1% or less

[07-Jan-20 09:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540
It still hurts a bit though when you look at the sats you lose while dollarvalue stays roughly the same

[07-Jan-20 09:04 PM] crumb#2550
when almost all market moves at once, it's pretty moronic to start bitching about the "dumpening" of your favourite coin

[07-Jan-20 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
all discords sound almost the same atm

[07-Jan-20 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
aaaah, why is XYZ dumping so hard?

[07-Jan-20 09:06 PM] crumb#2550
we need more marketing :troll:

[07-Jan-20 09:06 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus nah, got stopped of a trade on binance shitcoins, sitting comfy in btc long taking PT‚Äôs on the way

[07-Jan-20 09:06 PM] Lanii#8302

@coingirl87 that volume u are looking for, you'll get it but you'll also have to buy a potential pump of the lows

[07-Jan-20 09:18 PM] Lanii#8302
@Cryptoon Yes, TA usually says 50% dump after a couple of big red candles and then says pump after a couple of green dildos. :troll_lol:

[07-Jan-20 09:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[07-Jan-20 09:20 PM] jspook16#3059
Crash ..?

[07-Jan-20 09:22 PM] Lanii#8302
@jspook16 Perhaps, but probability wise the time to be bearish is not now

[07-Jan-20 09:22 PM] Lanii#8302
Was when we pumped to 1.1 - 1.3k levels

[07-Jan-20 09:22 PM] coingirl87#6489
At the moment only hodlers with big bags waiting that something happened to kmd....there were no new investors or people who are interesred in kmd...volume is best proof for my claim...only 300k -500k  volume is real...rest is fake...and low volume came from bots and maybe team members

[07-Jan-20 09:23 PM] Lanii#8302
Do you even know what a bot does

[07-Jan-20 09:23 PM] Lanii#8302
?

[07-Jan-20 09:24 PM] Lanii#8302
Also speculating in how much of the volume is fake or not is not proof

[07-Jan-20 09:25 PM] coingirl87#6489
Coinmarketcap liquidity is a very good indicator for knowing which exchange is fake and which not

[07-Jan-20 09:27 PM] looye29#2126
There are not so much exchange  and the one there are trade on unrealistic prices

[07-Jan-20 09:28 PM] Lanii#8302
@coingirl87 Yeh, I agree and thats because I've seen no name exchanges having 40 bill volume on btc a day

[07-Jan-20 09:28 PM] Lanii#8302
However I only worry about the volume on the chart Im looking at, cant remember when I last went into coinmarketcap to keep track on volume there

[07-Jan-20 09:28 PM] jspook16#3059
So this might be the end then..

[07-Jan-20 09:29 PM] Lanii#8302
I look at relative volume on a specific chart

[07-Jan-20 09:29 PM] Lanii#8302
@jspook16 It might, it might also be the bottom, nobody truly knows. Anyone implying they do, they are just plebbing

[07-Jan-20 09:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Keep droppin, keep accumulatin

[07-Jan-20 09:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
üêù

[07-Jan-20 09:32 PM] coingirl87#6489
Many people here always say accumulation but low volume shows that nobody is realy accumulating except supernet account

[07-Jan-20 09:33 PM] Lanii#8302
Volume tends to die out in accumulation

[07-Jan-20 09:33 PM] Lanii#8302
Bear market into range lows for a long time and while accumulation happens volume drops down and you'll get that spike you are looking for when there is a break out

[07-Jan-20 09:34 PM] Lanii#8302
But imo you don't want to buy that spike cuz you are already some way up off the bottom

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Depends on your definition tbh

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
for most of us, im sure a few thousand kmd every week or 2 is quite a good amount

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
but overall volume that is but a drop

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Komodos volume has never been that great, but that just shows how much more potential we have

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
for when people do find out about kmd and all it has to offer üòõ

[07-Jan-20 09:35 PM] Lanii#8302
How does one possibly "accumulate" if a whale market buys 10 mill usd of kmd

[07-Jan-20 09:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Im suprised kmd has managed to hold onto its 50-70 cmc spot

[07-Jan-20 09:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
with the not so many people hearing about/talking about/marketting komodo

[07-Jan-20 09:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
compared to the other coins overly hyped

[07-Jan-20 09:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
komodo has done well

[07-Jan-20 09:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
:pirate:

[07-Jan-20 09:37 PM] Lanii#8302
if you have multiple whales accumulating by market buying this would pump 300% right away, thats not accumulating

[07-Jan-20 09:37 PM] Lanii#8302
Thats also why you usually need longer period of times to accumulate, specially illiquid shitcoins

[07-Jan-20 09:39 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I think the past has shown the whales accumulated quite a large amount without moving price if I remember correctly they managed to do a few mil and price remained the same

[07-Jan-20 09:39 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Over an extended period of time, 2 weeks or so

[07-Jan-20 09:39 PM] Lanii#8302
yes

[07-Jan-20 09:40 PM] Lanii#8302
Thats how accumulation works

[07-Jan-20 09:41 PM] Lanii#8302
btc accumulation around 3ks was for 3 months or smth like that
