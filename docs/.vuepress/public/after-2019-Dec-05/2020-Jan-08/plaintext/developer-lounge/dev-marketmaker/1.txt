DO NOT CHANGE KMD LOCKTIME TO BTC LOCKTIME

[07-Jan-20 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the first tx can be timedout at 2/3rd and the second at 9/10 ?

as long as there is a gap between them to avoid a race condition, i think that is sufficient

[07-Jan-20 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont have to be symmetric in time

[07-Jan-20 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so at 90 minutes and 110 minutes

removed my previous post...
watched a swap live and the problem is/can be indeed the notas... not because the gap between 2 notas is more than 40 min, that is not the case, but because it can still take 40 min for the block (where the KMD transaction is included) to be notarized... 2 gaps of 20 min in a row is enough, or 20+10+bad luck (regarding the timing)
so i think that a small increase will be enough to solve the problem

time between KMD notas in seconds, checked every 5 minutes... the yellow line (never passed) would be 20 min.

@jl777c `maybe the first tx can be timedout at 2/3rd and the second at 9/10 ?` - the sum of the maximum wait times should be lower than payment locktime. E.g. if we use 2/3 and 9/10 with 2 hours locktime the maximum waiting time will be 4/3 + 9/5 > 2. Which means that payment will become refundable during confirmation waiting which doesn't make sense actually: taker will refund the payment while maker would be still waiting for it to be confirmed.
So when slow confirmation coins are swapped we have to increase the payment locktime accordingly. The KMD becomes as slow as BTC when we require notarization.
And that's what I meant initially. Please read carefully before starting to CAPS something, this looks offensive and non constructive.

can't we just try it with 2/5 instead of 1/3 and without changing locktimes?
