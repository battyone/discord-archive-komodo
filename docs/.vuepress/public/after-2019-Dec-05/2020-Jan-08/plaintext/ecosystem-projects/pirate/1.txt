[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> I have to say that the translations have been amazing, so many ppl jumping in to help, and many pirates we have not had the pleasure of talking to in the past :pirate:

$ARRR: Even more translations availbale now! Which other project pushes things forward that actively?

Diligence on this level doesn't make a bad project good. But it gives a great project like $ARRR a bigger deserved audience!

[07-Jan-20 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> .......might be awhile

[07-Jan-20 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> nah i have calculated it all well

[07-Jan-20 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> i mean yeah maybe it will be a while

[07-Jan-20 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <digital bullion> @Tek I believe you would be battling an army of buyers at 1 cent.

[07-Jan-20 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> glad we agree its going to 1 cent

[07-Jan-20 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Tek> >> nice

[07-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> agree that all things are possible, but the likelyhood anytime soon, maybe even millions of yrs

[07-Jan-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> awhile is a very long long logn long time possibly too lol

[07-Jan-20 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Tek, I **really** can't understand how you can possibly interpret 
> `.......might be awhile`
and
> `I believe you would be battling an army of buyers at 1 cent.` 
as
> glad we agree its going to 1 cent
But I guess people hear what they want to hear...

[07-Jan-20 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> dunno if you had picked a better name I would have bought at 2 cents

[07-Jan-20 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> but pirate?

[07-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> 1 cent.

[07-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> >> bruh you got anny ARRR?

[07-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> it sounds like a joke

[07-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> but i'll pay 1 cent for it

[07-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I'll have to be patient.

[07-Jan-20 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Stacy doesn't want any pirates.

[07-Jan-20 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You should have picked a stacy proof name

[07-Jan-20 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I know a Stacy. She said Monero.

[07-Jan-20 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> Stacy's mom has got it goin' on

[07-Jan-20 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> will 8k break tonight?

[07-Jan-20 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> who cares? and why?

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> cause if it doesn't the alt market will tank

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> together with bitcoin

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> bitcoin is an alt

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> ooooh 8k hit

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> but will it pump through?

[07-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> it would confirm the bullmarket

[07-Jan-20 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> 10% gain = "bull"?
so glad you don't handle my investments

[07-Jan-20 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> there she goes

[07-Jan-20 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> nigga 8k was a major resistance

[07-Jan-20 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> now its probably gonna pump to 9k

[07-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> and it confirms the bullmarket

[07-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> also, everyone is gonna dump pirates when Bitcoin and other Big alts soak up all the new money

[07-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> and i'll buy pirates at 1 cent

[07-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> HEHEHEH

[07-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Also, after this bullrun I'll finally have more KMD than you, geenlet

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I will have completed the spitening of the geenlet

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> after years of waiting

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> God bless

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `I'll finally have more KMD than you`
well, that might impress the ugly chick at the Burger Center, but no one else

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> HEHEH

[07-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> can't get any worse than your wife am i rite 😄

[07-Jan-20 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> i wonder if BCH will keep 0.03

[07-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stimhack> Seems like it's going to be an interesting night.

[07-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> seems like i cant go to bed on time again and have to watch charts

[07-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stimhack> Atm pretty much all alts are tied to BTC in one way or the other.

BTC bullrun is needed for the eventual rise of the price of ARRR.

[07-Jan-20 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stimhack> @Tek oh the sleepless nights of 2017.

[07-Jan-20 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Yes.

[07-Jan-20 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I was new too,

[07-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> but soon i'll have a bigger stack than the computergeenlet.

[07-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Haha!

[07-Jan-20 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <stimhack> Might be. Remember to take profits :treasure:

[07-Jan-20 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> tek your comedy is just not on game today...i was hoping for better material

[07-Jan-20 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> 😦 tfw

[07-Jan-20 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I bought a bunch of xmr

[07-Jan-20 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> is 50xmr enough to make it?

[07-Jan-20 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <theekgb> maybe....it will be close

[07-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> seems like i loaded up at the perfect time

[07-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> NNNNNNNICE

[07-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I'm estimating xmr will keep mooining until atleast the bitcoin halving, since the inflation is lower

[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Tek please refrain from using racial slurs and toilet humor (banter and the occasional troll are fine) but ad hominem attacks will not be tolerated

[07-Jan-20 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Bradbury bans are ineffective.. the silent treatment however...
