Question on how orders are matched- I know in a typical exchange if I put an order in for say 200 sats and there are orders for 150 sats 175 sats and 200 sats, the coins offered at lower prices will be matched first. 

How does adex work in this regard? I noticed there are numerous orders listed, would it let me 'pay too much' if I chose the wrong one?

@CiPhEr you can think of it more like localbitcoins (p2p) where you can choose a different 'ad' with a higher price rather than a regular CEX which will match the top of the order book.

Any one have input on kmd to dex swaps. I have tried about 10 times since Sunday, with all different amounts of kmd all timeout or i get unsuccessful swap. Fyi i Have been able to swap in the past.
