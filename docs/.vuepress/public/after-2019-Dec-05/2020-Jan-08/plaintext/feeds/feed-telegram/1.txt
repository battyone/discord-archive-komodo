[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> This lady is totally real and not a bot (re @Paulien: )

[07-Jan-20 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I'm mean, the majority of bitcoiners are females aged 50.

[07-Jan-20 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Derivatives are an exciting thing going on in the larger DeFi space. 
Permissionless ownership of (synthetic) apple, Tesla, oil, not to mention you can short or long other crypto
Komodo is a bit late to the stable coin game (better late than never!) but there's lots of room for innovation in defi besides currencies, lending, and prediction markets. Especially if Komodo is confident in its on chain oracles. I'm a bit fuzzy on those

[07-Jan-20 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Aka pegged assets I guess. A bit optimistic to suggest that Komodo is the brand name solution there, but maybe soon?

[07-Jan-20 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Komodo gonna be in legal trouble me thinks (re @Craig: Derivatives are an exciting thing going on in the larger DeFi space.

[07-Jan-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Mr boob grabber, care to expand on your legal opinion? (re @Suzycrabgrass: Komodo gonna be in legal trouble me thinks)

[07-Jan-20 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Pegged assets, anon exchange, etc. It will be an exciting thing for scary people (whom the gov want to stop). (re @mwtnky: whooaat)

[07-Jan-20 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Add security issues and u get scary compliance legality issues.

[07-Jan-20 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> The howey test killed some coins.

[07-Jan-20 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> My name is grabaz, be nice. (re @Craig: Mr boob grabber, care to expand on your legal opinion?)

[07-Jan-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mwtnky> Nash and KMD are my fav projects. I thought KMD didn't need to obey the legal stuff (re @Suzycrabgrass: Add security issues and u get scary compliance legality issues.)

[07-Jan-20 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Technically no, the dex should be fine. But practically, I give it 1.5 years. (re @mwtnky: Nash and KMD are my fav projects. I thought KMD didn't need to obey the legal stuff)

[07-Jan-20 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> There are other concerns with other tokens in the ecosystem, but I dont want to mention.

[07-Jan-20 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mwtnky> Yeah I know what you mean. üëç (re @Suzycrabgrass: There are other concerns with other tokens in the ecosystem, but I dont want to mention.)

@BinanceAmerica Considering @KomodoPlatform is on Bittrex US with BTC and USD (not USDT) pairings, is already on Binance, and has received legal opinion that $KMD is NOT a security (passes Howey Test) services are compliant etc. I'm surprised it isn't on the list already. ...

[07-Jan-20 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> But ecosystem coins like DEX.

[07-Jan-20 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> And others.

[07-Jan-20 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That is EXACTLY why KMD is not tied directly to anything. (re @Suzycrabgrass: But ecosystem coins like DEX.)

[07-Jan-20 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> People gave jl777 shit for not making KMD required for everything but really it was just excellent foresight. At the non protocol level KMD can be integrated into dapps, like a GUI using Atomicdex that gives lower fees for holding KMD

[07-Jan-20 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I agree, jl777 is a smart cookie. (re @Regnar: People gave jl777 shit for not making KMD required for everything but really it was just excellent foresight.

[07-Jan-20 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Even getting rid of anon features was very smart.

[07-Jan-20 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Most of all, the fact he is anon makes him the most resilient dev in crypto. He can do a lot of innovative things before the law catches up.

[07-Jan-20 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And things like AtomicDEX are underlying software, not just an app. Anyone can run the daemon and trade with anyone else, even if the AtomicDEX app goes away. I don't think we can attribute governments with all encompassing powers, wave a regulatory wand and poof! things go away, especially those that have good and potentially "bad" (through a particular gov eyes) capabilities. Torrents are still like 1/4 of the internet bandwidth some are even legal, because at protocol level there isn't anything wrong with them.

[07-Jan-20 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> You are right. It would live beyond regulatory pressure.

[07-Jan-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> I believe with some ecosystem coins, they buy in kmd. Smart move to help kmd without making the projects intertwined in legality issues.

[07-Jan-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But even with the pressure, you may see apps springing up that do abide by their country's regulations

[07-Jan-20 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed. Even DEX buys KMD and pays it out to holders. It would be no different than it buying BTC to pay it out, doesn't make BTC a security (re @Suzycrabgrass: I believe with some ecosystem coins, they buy in kmd. Smart move to help kmd without making the projects intertwined in legality issues.)

[07-Jan-20 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Suzycrabgrass> Yes, I agree. I guess my original statement was mis phrased. (re @Regnar: Agreed. Even DEX buys KMD and pays it out to holders. It would be no different than it buying BTC to pay it out, doesn't make BTC a security)

[07-Jan-20 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
