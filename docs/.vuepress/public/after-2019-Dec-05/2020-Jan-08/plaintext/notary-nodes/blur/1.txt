OK, why is Blur better than Monero and what are the things you know that make Blur better than Monero.
From a Blur perspective please.

We don’t claim to be “better than Monero” we’re innovating in different ways. However, our nodes are more secure to run. This is due to not having miniupnp, unbound, or ZeroMQ as dependencies. We’ve removed all of them. Monero *just had* and vulnerability related to ZeroMQ after they told me it wasn’t an issue 😉

That would be the second time I’ve warned them of a potential issue, that they’ve ignored until someone else reported it
