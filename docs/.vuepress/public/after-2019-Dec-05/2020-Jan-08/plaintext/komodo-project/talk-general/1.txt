What does it exactly mean with the antpool ‚collaboration‘?

[07-Jan-20 01:21 PM] alperC#7758
AntPool belongs to BITMAIN (AntMiner etc.) AntPool is the worlds leading cryptocurrency mining platform if I'm not wrong. 

PS: I'm not a Miner

[07-Jan-20 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810

it could be the recent days price action was influenced by the antpool

from an extra hashrate point, maybe not so significant, but from an industry recognition standpoint it seems significant

:2561_feelsevilman: Make more attraction from Chinese mining community!

[07-Jan-20 05:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If anything, given that China has a totalitarian regime, with HUGE export to other countries, seems they are probably last to have an economic collapse

[07-Jan-20 05:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or at least after the collapse of EU/US 😄

Can somebody enlighten me, when exactly was Chainzilla airdrop ?? And also, is Jumblr still alive ??

[07-Jan-20 11:27 PM] PTYX#6840
@Harvester the chainzilla airdrop was a 1M coin drop that we did last year when we launched the project.

[07-Jan-20 11:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Jumblr was the asset for the Jumblr mechanism on Komodo. I think it's still alive, although I'm not certain about the details of how the distribution of funds will work.

[07-Jan-20 11:53 PM] Harvester#1532
@PTYX 2019 ? What month ? I try to dig my old accounts to find them. Just don't know where to start.
