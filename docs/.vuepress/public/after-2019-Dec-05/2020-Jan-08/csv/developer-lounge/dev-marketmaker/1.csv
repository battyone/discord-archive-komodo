watched a swap live and the problem is/can be indeed the notas... not because the gap between 2 notas is more than 40 min, that is not the case, but because it can still take 40 min for the block (where the KMD transaction is included) to be notarized... 2 gaps of 20 min in a row is enough, or 20+10+bad luck (regarding the timing)
so i think that a small increase will be enough to solve the problem","",""

E.g. if we use 2/3 and 9/10 with 2 hours locktime the maximum waiting time will be 4/3 + 9/5 > 2. Which means that payment will become refundable during confirmation waiting which doesn't make sense actually: taker will refund the payment while maker would be still waiting for it to be confirmed.
So when slow confirmation coins are swapped we have to increase the payment locktime accordingly. The KMD becomes as slow as BTC when we require notarization.
And that's what I meant initially. Please read carefully before starting to CAPS something, this looks offensive and non constructive.","",""
