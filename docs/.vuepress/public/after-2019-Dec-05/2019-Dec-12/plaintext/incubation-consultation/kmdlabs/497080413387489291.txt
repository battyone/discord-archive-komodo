watch debuglog and stdout as you do it please

[11-Dec-19 12:43 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - where is the debug log

[11-Dec-19 12:44 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Std out gave no messages

[11-Dec-19 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
`tail -f ~/.komodo/LABS/debug.log`

[11-Dec-19 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
what did the rpc command respond with?

[11-Dec-19 12:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
no response from the reconsider tail is:

[11-Dec-19 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
you're on pos64 branch

[11-Dec-19 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
switch to master

[11-Dec-19 12:47 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hmmm - komodo folder already on master

[11-Dec-19 12:48 AM] Alright#0419
rebuild?

[11-Dec-19 12:48 AM] Alright#0419
could be wrong, but it sure looks like you're on pos64 branch

[11-Dec-19 12:48 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
something wrong - how can my dir be ahead of git?

[11-Dec-19 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
it might not be wrong branch, but those errors would indicate that it is

[11-Dec-19 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
please make sure you build from latest master and try it again

[11-Dec-19 12:49 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
``Already on 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 307 commits.``

[11-Dec-19 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
O.o

[11-Dec-19 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
`git remote -v`?

[11-Dec-19 12:50 AM] Alright#0419
are those your commits?

[11-Dec-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
that is pos64 branch

[11-Dec-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
lol what

[11-Dec-19 12:51 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
oh wait - got to page down

[11-Dec-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
that is still a commit from pos64 branch

[11-Dec-19 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
that doesn't exist anywhere else

[11-Dec-19 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
simplest solution is likely to delete dir, reclone, rebuild

[11-Dec-19 12:54 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
recloning KMDLabs/komodo.git

[11-Dec-19 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
ping/pm me if you have issues still

[11-Dec-19 12:56 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
cool

[11-Dec-19 03:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
so many orphaned LABS blocks since moving to Ubuntu node...

[11-Dec-19 03:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
watched at least 6 in the last couple hours

[11-Dec-19 03:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
just watched one stake, followed by a nota 5 seconds later.... block aint mine

[11-Dec-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
been trying to debug this, is damn near impossible

[11-Dec-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
possible this is the issue that was experienced on POS64 chain, just more apparent

[11-Dec-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
if that is the case, doesn't seem critically broken, just *a bit* broken ðŸ˜…

[11-Dec-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I keep telling you I have fixed it but you wotn try it

[11-Dec-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so i do myself

[11-Dec-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop wasting yor time

[11-Dec-19 05:55 AM] Alright#0419

@blackjok3r what komodo repo are you using... pls link im over the 99% orphans...

[11-Dec-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
checking it out guys ðŸ˜…

[11-Dec-19 02:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
im reading through your LabsNotary repo now

[11-Dec-19 02:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
Looks like /komodo/beta branch and /LabsNotary/blackjok3r branch last commits?

[11-Dec-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[11-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just use blackjok3r branch of LabsNotary

[11-Dec-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont need anythhing else

[11-Dec-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not really ready though

[11-Dec-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
what komodo does it use then?

[11-Dec-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS/saveit

[11-Dec-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
so KMDLABS/komodo

[11-Dec-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but like I said not ready... not a grat idea for  ppl to run it thinking it wont break or fork

[11-Dec-19 04:42 PM] jorian#4555
who has good peers for LABS?

[11-Dec-19 04:42 PM] jorian#4555
is `80.240.17.222` any good?

[11-Dec-19 05:03 PM] daemonfox#6136

[11-Dec-19 05:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but  it  wasnt peers

[11-Dec-19 05:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
it was my wallet from using new bad komodod from  kmdlabs/src - this  komodod  is bad -  do  not use  it

[11-Dec-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
chain is very broken atm, can give you steps to get on proper chain, but it's a bit of a headache

[11-Dec-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
meant to be waiting on joker to fix, but haven't heard from him. He's aware of what the issue is

[11-Dec-19 05:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
peers  did help get on track but wallet kept forking while staking

[11-Dec-19 05:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
had to dump wallet and I used the newest bootstrap and then  imported wallet

[11-Dec-19 05:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
took me 10 minutes  to fix but 40 hours  figuring out what was wrong

[11-Dec-19 05:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
used old komodod from komodo/src

[11-Dec-19 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
yes an old build prior to HF merge will work just fine

[11-Dec-19 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
need to fix depends if you checkout the specific commit prior to that though

[11-Dec-19 05:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
for  some reason my cash.wav is broken which is pissing me off!! everyone  else is forked up and I am staking blocks like a rock star!!

[11-Dec-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
would not recommend sending anyone LABS (or receiving) until issues are fixed

[11-Dec-19 05:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lol, is notarizing considered the same as sending LABS ? ðŸ˜…

[11-Dec-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
no, keep at it please if your node is on same as explorer

[11-Dec-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
if not, kill it, don't think notaries would fork
