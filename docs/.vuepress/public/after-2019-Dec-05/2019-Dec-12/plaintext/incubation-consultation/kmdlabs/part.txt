i'm also not notarizing on LABS

[11-Dec-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
everything borked

[11-Dec-19 06:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
just going  to guess  you updated komodod  in the past  week

[11-Dec-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[11-Dec-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
so why was this done again? üòõ

[11-Dec-19 06:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do you have the older  version?

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] jorian#4555
pretty sure it gets overwritten

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
it  might have  jacked  your wallet.dat  file (s)

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] jorian#4555
```~/StakedNotary/komodo$ ls
master  pos64  utxocache```

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
mine  doesnt  overwrite

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] jorian#4555
i think utxocache is still an old build

[11-Dec-19 06:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i have  to  move  it  to  build

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] jorian#4555
well if such change borks your wallet then i'm feked. but i dumped it, so my privkeys are safe

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
do you  have /komodo/src/komodod

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] jorian#4555
yes, but that is a new build, i build it myself today

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ahhhhh

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
did you keep  the  old as  backup?

[11-Dec-19 06:28 PM] jorian#4555
no

[11-Dec-19 06:28 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
above my  paygrade

[11-Dec-19 06:28 PM] jorian#4555
```Oct 20 13:30 komodod```

[11-Dec-19 06:28 PM] jorian#4555

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] jorian#4555

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
you can even  use last  weeks  bootstrap

[11-Dec-19 06:30 PM] jorian#4555
yeah

[11-Dec-19 06:30 PM] jorian#4555
syncing isn't too slow either

[11-Dec-19 06:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
syncing takes  1.75 hours for  me

[11-Dec-19 06:31 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
you  can be up in  15  minutes

[11-Dec-19 06:32 PM] jorian#4555

[11-Dec-19 06:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:36 PM] jorian#4555
oh üòõ

[11-Dec-19 06:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
should just  let  everyone  fork  up  a few  days and  collect my stakes  ---

[11-Dec-19 06:36 PM] jorian#4555
yes, you should encourage everyone to update right now

[11-Dec-19 06:38 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[11-Dec-19 06:47 PM] jorian#4555
guess you are lucky

[11-Dec-19 06:47 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@Alright please create branch for LABSdev builds  for  komodod - no master should ever have  this mistake.. ever

[11-Dec-19 06:48 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
--------------------------------------

[11-Dec-19 06:49 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
did you follow directions  completely or almost completely? @jorian

[11-Dec-19 06:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
you may need  to zapwallettxs

[11-Dec-19 06:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but if you  exported and imported

[11-Dec-19 06:51 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
you shouldnt have to

[11-Dec-19 06:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe move old  komodod to stakednotary location

[11-Dec-19 06:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
since  you are a nota

[11-Dec-19 06:55 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
looks like  /user/kmdlabs/src

[11-Dec-19 06:55 PM] jorian#4555

[11-Dec-19 07:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll have a better strategy next time  - like sit back and  listen to my cow  bell  ring

[11-Dec-19 07:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
never updated my staker in the last round (not the same machine as my NN) - so at least I think I have a stable komodod.

[11-Dec-19 07:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
build from Nov 4th has got me past the broken bit.

[11-Dec-19 08:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
how do I pull that specifc commit build?

[11-Dec-19 08:28 PM] jorian#4555
git checkout <hash>

[11-Dec-19 08:28 PM] jorian#4555
then build it

[11-Dec-19 08:28 PM] jorian#4555
but like alright said, you probably need to account for different dependencies

[11-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
if you desperately need to get a node up for some reason, will walk you through it

[11-Dec-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
if not wait for joker üò´

[11-Dec-19 09:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
I do... looks like staking node is just not going to stake... and NN wont come back at all

[11-Dec-19 10:12 PM] jorian#4555
I gave up on NN for now

[11-Dec-19 10:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
not me im building an 18.04 VM for staking right now...

[11-Dec-19 10:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
and have another setup currently syncing LABS from the repos Joker linked... just testing eberything at this point

[11-Dec-19 11:27 PM] Alright#0419
@daemonfox 
`git checkout fe28f4143245ab9d8ba22bdaa9b54b983ac09bb5`

then make these changes manually
