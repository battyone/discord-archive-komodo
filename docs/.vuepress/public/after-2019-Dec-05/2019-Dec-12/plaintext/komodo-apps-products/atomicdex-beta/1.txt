was already discussed, doing that would likely get it rejected by apple review process

[11-Dec-19 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
"likely" is almost certainly

call it 'AtomicDawg' -  swaps crypto and calls your dog at the same time

Imo the best solution would be to allow users to select their own sounds and then make a silent mp3 available to download on github so users can use that.

not grandma proof

[11-Dec-19 04:39 AM] Bitfinger#6245
Grandma can just turn off her hearing aid

[11-Dec-19 04:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

What are the key differences between Komodo AtomicDEX and Atomicwallet.io?

[11-Dec-19 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
Atomicwallet.io doesn't have a dex and they might use atomicDEX-api in the future

[11-Dec-19 11:27 AM] farl#9964
They present it as a decentralized Atomic Swap app, but that‚Äôs not correct?

[11-Dec-19 11:30 AM] gcharang#6833
they use services like changenow for swaps
and have removed mentions of dex from their website
but they still say dex in their twitter bio ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
not sure why

[11-Dec-19 11:35 AM] Lennart#9331

[11-Dec-19 11:35 AM] Lennart#9331

[11-Dec-19 05:09 PM] gcharang#6833
@DRE  you can only send to a BTC address that starts with "1"

[11-Dec-19 08:41 PM] fazer#0903
Guys there seems like s something wrong with atomic dex: 
1, all time i start atomic dex i must add all coins again....
2, by adding any coin i must re-add it again to be added...
3, time to time adding stuck and add button disappear with infinite loading message instead of add + button

[11-Dec-19 08:42 PM] fazer#0903
just for case if you are interested in feedback....

[11-Dec-19 09:22 PM] Acura#2748
Which version? Did you tested it to first deinstall and then Reinstall ?

[11-Dec-19 11:13 PM] fazer#0903

[11-Dec-19 11:13 PM] fazer#0903
will do

[11-Dec-19 11:30 PM] miles#6381
Just did my first few swaps with app in the background on iOS - was like a great weight was lifted! Luckily my phone lives on silent .......

[11-Dec-19 11:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The noise is so it can run in background,  it will be optimized in the future
