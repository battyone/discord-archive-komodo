@erav3n you say 4 gigs of free ram, does the program do a check and shutdown or is this just a suggestion?

doesn't check, will attempt to build regardless

[11-Dec-19 05:26 AM] Alright#0419
then cause a lot of issues if it runs out

you can get by with 4gb RAM and large swap space, will just be pretty slow

Closes after what? In which moment? At start? Attach your `debug.log` here.

Also there is a big difference between native wallet (full node) and lite wallet based on Electrum like Agama. JFYI.
