From a technical stand point, not too bad of an area to start slowly building a position.

[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Craig, I wish I could get my guys to do some komodo content, but they would look at me like im crazy if I asked to commission free marketing content with our current workload. Last time we did free content for a project, the coin got sued by the SEC and tanked to oblivion.

[11-Dec-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Epidemic I didn't mean you should direct company resources to KMD.
Just that perhaps you would have the talent and inclination to Google image search komodos and create meme templates or something like that. As an individual with talent and ten minutes on his hands, not as company director or whatever

[11-Dec-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Komodo has high level branding at this point for sure. 
But if you're in a few tg groups it's quite striking that the Komodo group generates zero memes. 
I don't expect memes to create tons of value, but it weird that they aren't out there, at least some

[11-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> A famous critique of ETH, from a long term investment point of view, is that the ethereum network could work just as well with the token worth $1 as worth $10,000
 (cf Pfeffer Dec 2017)
Certainly there is at least some truth to this, and it is possible that ETH is overvalued even if the network itself is potentially highly valuable.
We can extend this critique to Komodo and KMD. Assuming that Komodo tech sees massive traction, there is still a risk that the KMD token will not capture much value.
How does this line of thought inform your investment thesis regarding KMD?
I can answer this for myself but interested in others thoughts

[11-Dec-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> You can turn the sound down to completely down.
This has something to do with the fact that the app does not lose its internet connection due to inactivity. (re @CryptomanXX: There is annoying sound of coins in that app that I can’t turn off, why would you install something stupid like that?)
