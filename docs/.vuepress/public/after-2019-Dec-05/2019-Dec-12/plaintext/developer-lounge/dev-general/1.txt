Do anybody tell me can i able to fork komodo paper wallet generator for my coin

[11-Dec-19 08:40 AM] phm87#7395
@pandaanu73 it should be easy, I guess that few constants need to bd changed or maybe nothing

[11-Dec-19 08:40 AM] phm87#7395
All smartchains and kmd share thr same address space so one adress valid for kmd is valid for smartchains

[11-Dec-19 08:41 AM] phm87#7395
So if your coin is a smartchajn, maybe you sjould change nothing in wallet generator

[11-Dec-19 08:41 AM] pandaanu73#7907
@phm87 yes i know but i want to fork the code

[11-Dec-19 08:41 AM] pandaanu73#7907
For my smartchain

[11-Dec-19 08:42 AM] phm87#7395
Maybe some names and labels can be changed but technically, it should work for uour smartchain with no changes

Hi guys, im looking to having a coversation with an official developer within the community about abilities and limits of the platform could someone DM me with official credentials. We are considering KMD as a platform for our project and just need more direct info.

@phm87 if i fork the code can it work on live site or it will work only offline

[11-Dec-19 08:45 AM] phm87#7395
If you fork it, maybe some url should be adapted. It should work online bug maybe url need to bd adapted

If you test with small amounts, you can minimize risk

Yes you can just click on the fork button, rename index.html into index.md, then create Creating a GitHub Pages site, like this
https://noctljrne.github.io/KomodoPaperWalletGenerator/
You can alternatively clone the repo & host it on local server w/o renaming index.html
I fork the repo from KomodoPlatform
