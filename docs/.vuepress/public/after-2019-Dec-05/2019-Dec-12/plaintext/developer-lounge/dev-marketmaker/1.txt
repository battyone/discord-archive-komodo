just completed my first swap w/ atomicdex. actually completed two in a row w/ morty for rick coins. i was having issues around 2 months ago - getting a type:takerfeesendfailed error. @smk762 suggested coinsfile may be outdated and after updating that, everything worked. this was quite some time ago (oct 19), but thought it would be useful to provide feedback..better late than never
