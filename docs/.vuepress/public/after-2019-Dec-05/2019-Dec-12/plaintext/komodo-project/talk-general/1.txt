I suppose KMDice will be added to AtomicDex GUI as well?

Didn't the bank get paid out in that?

chain is not well maintained

[11-Dec-19 09:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@Hobot it is in development

When pegging to major currencies is done I think that komodo can also support pegs to the value of a basket of currencies just like Libra and Saga.

A blockchain firm advised by Nobel laureate Myron Scholes just lau...
Saga is launching a virtual currency which pegs its value to the basket of currencies that form the IMF's special drawing rights.

yes, the peg can be to any synthetic price, which can be composed of any DTO pricefeed, which includes 32 fiat prices. so make a synthetic price that is a weighted basket of fiat prices in the oracle definition of the peg. now you can back that with KMD

[11-Dec-19 06:09 PM] artik123#2884
But instead of the IMF top-down approach, maybe it can be done bottom-up, so parties can decide by themselves the relative percentage of each currency in the basket. 
Will it be possible?

[11-Dec-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there can be many different pegged chains

KSDR

[11-Dec-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but for each specific chain (that makes its own coin) it really cant have more than one synthetic basket

[11-Dec-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
different peg, different coin

[11-Dec-19 06:13 PM] artik123#2884
usdk eurk etc. are they technically side chains?

[11-Dec-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[11-Dec-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
each is an independent chain, that will get dPoW

[11-Dec-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is deposited and that allows the user to withdraw pegged coins

[11-Dec-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
technically a sidechain is when it is pegged 1:1 with the backing coin, right? so i guess if your synthetic price is 1:1 with KMD, it would be a sidechain, but for any other synthetic price it isnt 1:1 with what is backing it

[11-Dec-19 06:19 PM] artik123#2884
I know they are independent but I mean having a proof of lock in komodo chain by federation (notary) and issued on a different chain to the same public key address. Is it how it is done?

[11-Dec-19 06:27 PM] t-ya#8379
"giveaway" bots just joined discord

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a federated backing, by 7 of 13 multisig signers. will be notarized, so there is proof on the KMD chain

[11-Dec-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
#cc-gateways will describe how a gateway chain is setup, the pegged chain builds on top of a gatewaychain

[11-Dec-19 06:30 PM] artik123#2884
Ok thanks

[11-Dec-19 06:58 PM] artik123#2884
A few days ago I was reading on a project called Orbs. To me it looked like an advanced version of eos concensus mechanism where there are entities called Guardians that are incentivized to  keep an eye on their 22 validators.   

Maybe here we can have at least some sort of monitoring so if something strange is happening with notaries it could be exposed and handled immediately.

But if I remember correctly here they cannot do much. Only if 33 of them collude ,most that can happen is that komodo state will not be notarized to BTC. And regarding to 7 signers with mal intentions I'm not sure what can happen.

[11-Dec-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a federated chain, so the signers do have a lot more powers that dPoW operators

[11-Dec-19 07:00 PM] artik123#2884
Yes

[11-Dec-19 11:05 PM] artik123#2884
I wrote something in #blur channel (but probably jl went to sleep ðŸ˜´ ) and I'm writing it also here because it happens to be related to something alot bigger and I want as much people as possible see it and discuss it.

I was thinking about an idea of oracle that tracks BTC fees. 
So that notaries tx fee will be just enough to be included in the BTC chain but not more than that.  My guesstimate is that over time it will save at least half of the costs and also increase notarization reliability (I remember a problem that we had when notaries tx's were not included because of BTC tx's fees were rising and the chain was full).

For a different use case it can be applied for tracking KMD in a way that a user can pay a predictable amount of fees in usd terms regardless of kmd pump or dump.

Tracking kmd fees, for example, can also be applied for smart chains that are notarizing into kmd. It could help them also to lower costs.

Maybe it can even support something very close or even zero fees (Just up to the point tx's are included) for smart chains.
So if tx's are not included in kmd chain because miner decides not to include them or the chain is spammed it can be raised back dynamically.

Even if technically there is no viable way to have zero fees, it is still worth thinking about it and developing it because everyone is trying to do that and in order to compete we would have to find ways to do the same and this direction looks like the best effort so far. 

But no matter how low fees can be, "zero fees" still makes a huge psychological difference in terms of decision making.

[11-Dec-19 11:05 PM] artik123#2884
I'm not sure that you aware to the magnitude of this such small difference but yet technically so problematic in terms of blockchain economics.

Generally people are full with irrationalities and this one is a well known bias studied by Dan Ariely(behavioral economics prof). People are hopless suckers for the word "zero". I Don't know how exactly zero fees can be implemented here(or at least just for the smart chains) but it could be a huge huge step forward.
(In order to do that others are adding a layer of trust and it kind of conflict with kmd principles).

Tl;dr this feature alone worth millions in marketing terms and it has a totally different perception in the eye of the user or decision maker imo.

I'm a bit behind, does magnum still support KMD

[11-Dec-19 11:34 PM] artik123#2884
Yes but I'm not sure if claiming rewards still working there

[11-Dec-19 11:39 PM] bushybro#7649
Thank you.  I tried claiming rewards but the site is now not recognizing my nano-x, will not allow me to send KMD either.  Thought it might just be me.

[11-Dec-19 11:59 PM] artik123#2884
@bushybro you can use your ledger live to send them
