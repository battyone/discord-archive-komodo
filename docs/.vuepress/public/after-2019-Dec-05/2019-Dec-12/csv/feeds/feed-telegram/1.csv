 (cf Pfeffer Dec 2017)
Certainly there is at least some truth to this, and it is possible that ETH is overvalued even if the network itself is potentially highly valuable.
We can extend this critique to Komodo and KMD. Assuming that Komodo tech sees massive traction, there is still a risk that the KMD token will not capture much value.
How does this line of thought inform your investment thesis regarding KMD?
