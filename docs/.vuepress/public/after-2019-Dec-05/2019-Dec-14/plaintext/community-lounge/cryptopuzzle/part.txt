You are given 9 segments whose lengths are 1 cm, 2cm, 3 cm, . . . , 9 cm respectively.  If you chose three segments at random, what is the probability that the three segments will be able to form a triangle.

*p.s.* Answer should be represented as float number with 2 deciamals after point. Example of valid values are: `1.56`, `0.99`, etc.
