[13-Dec-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
is the chain linear?

[13-Dec-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
ie, no forking, branching off

[13-Dec-19 02:09 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I tried to do a little illustration

[13-Dec-19 02:09 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
idea is to make `-------- (8 Links)
------- (7 Links)
----- (5 Links)
---- (4 Links)
--- (3 Links)
-- (2 Links)`

[13-Dec-19 02:10 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
turn into ` -----------------------------` 29 links in a row

[13-Dec-19 02:10 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm sure my formatting will improve in time

[13-Dec-19 02:11 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I might even create jpegs for a lot of the puzzles

[13-Dec-19 02:12 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Might play around with raising reward if puzzle goes unanswered for too long...

[13-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
maybe x 2 reward each day it goes unanswered

[13-Dec-19 02:13 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269

1.25*5 (6.25) with linear chain as described above assuming all links are initially closed and you need to close all of them back, 1.25 total if one link can be used to combine all sections into one forking mess

`You've lost your wallet :(

But perhaps you are in luck as a wallet has been submitted to the local lost & found!

Of course you'll need to prove you are the true owner of this wallet.

To prove the wallet is really yours, you confirm there are 6 bills totaling USD$63.00 in the wallet.

Also, none of the 6 bills is a USD$1.00.

To simplify, provide what are the 6 bills in your lost/found wallet?`

1. Power bill = $10
2. Gas bill = $9
3. Phone bill = $8
4. Hotel bill = $10
5. A photo of someone called Bill = Priceless (also, worthless)
6: A crisp USD$100 bill

100 - (10+9+8+10) = 100 - 37 = $63

[13-Dec-19 07:58 AM] smk762#7640
Also, my name is Bill. its a photo of me. Gimme back my wallet.

[13-Dec-19 10:39 AM] ciumete#3212
4x2$ + 5$ + 50$ =63$

Puzzle #4 [SOLVED]
For 10 KMD!

`We need to determine exactly how many coins are in our massive bag!

We know there is a mix of quarters (Each worth $0.25), half dollars (Each worth $0.50) and silver dollars (Each worth $1.00) in our bag.

We also know that the total dollar sum of all the coins in our bag is $700.

Lastly, we know that our bag contains the exact same number of each of the three coin denominations.

What is the number of each coin type found in our bag?`
