Does the Agama wallet generate a seed phrase each time you activate a coin, or does it only create one seed for the entire Agama wallet? Because I did not see a seed phrase when I activated the Komodo wallet in Agama.

[13-Dec-19 05:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
one seed phrase is for one address

[13-Dec-19 05:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If you activate native mode, agama won't prompt you to enter seed phrase. However if you use native mode , make sure that you save the wallet.dat

[13-Dec-19 05:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
seed phrase is only needed when you use lite mode @Cryptonian

Any other way to send from ledger in a safe way?

[13-Dec-19 06:03 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Bad tx inputs apparently when trying to send, even lower amount D:

@Crabby Paddy I am not sure what the issue with ledger is, but you can access your coins using Agama
get priv key: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000026855-how-to-retrieve-kmd-private-key-from-a-ledger-nano-s-using-agama>
login to move coins: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>

@gcharang can you vouch for using magnum with ledger will be safe and private keys won‚Äôt leave device? Thanks for response üòÉ

[13-Dec-19 07:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Long term storage prefer not to get private keys out

[13-Dec-19 07:03 AM] gcharang#6833
> can you vouch for using magnum with ledger will be safe and private keys won‚Äôt leave device? 
ofc I can't vouch for that. I haven't used the wallet and don't own a ledger

but, from what I know of ledger, it won't allow privkeys to leave the device
the feasible way to  cheat a user is change the displayed destination address on the computer, but  I think ledger has a contermeasure for that too
you have to confirm the destination on the ledger also

[13-Dec-19 07:04 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Gotcha thanks so as long as ledger only asks for public key request and not private ones, and I double check destination address then funds should hypothetically be safe
