[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Unless there‚Äôs another way to access ledger funds safely

[13-Dec-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t0sma> Many of ledger owners here use Magnum wallet to access to their KMD and claim rewards

[13-Dec-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t0sma> You can import your wallet from ledger. You will have access to your funds.

[13-Dec-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheCrabbyPaddy> Thanks. Is magnum open source / 100% trustable? Did not Oml now about ledger support üòÑ

[13-Dec-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t0sma> You're privat keys stay of course on the ledger. You have to confirm transaction on the device.

[13-Dec-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <t0sma> It's not open source. But secure with a ledger. Maybe an admin can confirm.

[13-Dec-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
