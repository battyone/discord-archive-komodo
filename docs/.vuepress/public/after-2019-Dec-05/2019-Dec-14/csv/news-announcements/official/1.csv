As a precaution, we have also advised all services and Exchanges to pause the deposits and withdrawals from Dec. 19th - 21st, 2019.

**This is a mandatory platform upgrade, so all miners, exchanges, and individuals running full-seed nodes must update to the latest software before block 1670000. Those who do not update before December 20 will not run on the correct network.**

All ecosystem Smart Chains (asset chains) will upgrade on Friday, December 20, 2019 11:06:40 AM UTC (timestamp: 1576840000)
