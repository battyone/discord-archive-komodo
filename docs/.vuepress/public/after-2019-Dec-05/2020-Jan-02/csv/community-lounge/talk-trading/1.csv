BAT I think is a novelty. Who wants to view ads? That said, I've gotten kicked in the ass and bitten by too many KMD asset chains. Verus has been the only one who has not completely blown up on me(because I sold out near the top and bought back in).

"457884604167225374","meatspoon#7860","01-Jan-20 03:20 PM","@Patrick Crypto I sign up to view ads on Brave.  I can see how at first glance BAT might not be impressive.  But at first glance I didn't realize how big the digital advertisement space is.  The main guy is Brendan Eich (a real name, not an alias!!) who created Javascript, founded Netscape and Mozilla Firefox.  The way that digital ads are served now is about the most inefficient way and most intrusive way possible.  If you have a smart phone, about $20 of your monthly bill is used to stream ad info that you dont even want to your device.  $20 worth of bandwidth per month of crap you dont want to see.  But Brave allows you to turn on the ""crap"" in a very contained way (a little toolbar popup) and you get a sliver of the BAT used to buy it whether you click on it or not.  So the BAT project has a working product.  Over 8 million active users and growing.  It certainly may fail, but it is a legit project on the ETH network.  Does KMD have any legit project?  Any team with a leader who isnt anon and who has a very professional reputation?  I am not going heavy on BAT.  Made a couple small buys and I have Brave installed on 5 devices, so i farm BAT and hodl it.  But in my opinion, it is more than a novelty.","","üëè (1)"
