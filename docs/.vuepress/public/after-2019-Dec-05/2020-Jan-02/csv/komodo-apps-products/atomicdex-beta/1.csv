I wonder if it can be done in a way that a trader send his coin to a smart contract that would automatically trade the trader's coin for the targeted coin once the smart contract found the right/lower price target? then automagically send the traded coin to the trader address","",""

CPU usage of 15% on a receiving only node, bandwidth between 2MB and 8MB/sec, using 1kb datablob size. RAM usage is whatever amount of data in an hour with a half GB overhead.

i think these are sufficient performance for DEX orderbook usage, assuming it can maintain this level of performance as the network size scales up.","",""
"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","01-Jan-20 01:48 PM","keep in mind this is just the low level transport layer for the datablobs. it uses a fully decentralized p2p network and current tests show the datablobs are 99.99% in sync across the nodes. at this rate of order flow, the bandwidth usage was about 4MB/sec, with peaks of 12MB/sec. not that much for any decent bandwidth provider","",""
"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","01-Jan-20 01:50 PM","if this survives a burn in test, then i will be ready to add an api wrapper for the querying of the datablobs. this can be used by mm2, or any other dapp that needs a mostly synchronized set of data across all nodes. think of it as a UDP level instead of TCP. so it will always be fast, just that if you oversaturate things, it will drop some packets","","KMD (7)"
