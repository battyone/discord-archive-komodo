"455021680935436290","Gateway#3763","01-Jan-20 08:59 PM","[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo created an algorithm called dPoW which uses a system of notarizations to Bitcoin to fortify KMD chain integrity. KMD is mined using the Equihash algorithm and like all blockchains it abides by the ""Longest chain"" rule, however, Komodo adds an additional criteria that must be met. The hash of the Longest chain must also match the most recent notarization made to Bitcoin.
So if someone were to try and 51% attack KMD and reverse a transaction that has already been notarized, then there is no way for them to maintain the correct Hash and therefore match the notarization. So they could release a chain that is far longer than the main chain, however because it doesn't match the notarization, all the nodes will ignore it. (re @valerianb: Why is it delayed?)","",""
