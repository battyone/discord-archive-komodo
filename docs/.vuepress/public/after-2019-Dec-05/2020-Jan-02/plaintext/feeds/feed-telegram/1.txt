[telegram] <Regnar> Came across some awesome work being done by some devs in Komodo working on an AtomicDEX GUI that let's you automate trades and even automate trades between AtomicDEX and Binance to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities

[telegram] <changemymindk> To be fair that expression could mean a lot of things (re @icantgiveyou: That didn‚Äôt work out eh)

[01-Jan-20 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> A big piece for adoption of atomic swaps. (re @Regnar: )

[01-Jan-20 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea it is an awesome piece of art. I foresee them adding tons of different exchange API keys in the future (re @polycryptoblog: A big piece for adoption of atomic swaps.)

ccxt handles 120 exchanges, it is a unified library, it can be cool to add atomicdex into ccxt then dozen of trading bots and arb bots will use atomicdex. I began to shill ccxt around for this

[01-Jan-20 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> It can be fault by the web browser? dont remember which one I use usually before.

[01-Jan-20 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> Trying already on Firefox and Chrome. No have more browsers :P

[01-Jan-20 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> I will try clear cache

[01-Jan-20 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> Not working clear cache the same errors. I tryed on different computer on Windows but this time atomiclabs website shows  me different adress transaction first time see this one so I dont start claim. I back to Linux PC and he shows and ledger shows too the adress I saw before lol. So I dont try send my coins on windows PC because he shows different adress maybe its scam. I dont know what to do :DD

[01-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> I tryed on other computer with Windows and errors are the same and one new with pbca26: Error No device selected.

[01-Jan-20 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> Maybe my ledger is broken its old but I have update firmware and Komodo app too

[01-Jan-20 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> Hey guys, was just reading about Comodo algorithm

[01-Jan-20 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> I found a source that says Komodo use delayed Proof of Work

[01-Jan-20 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> What is that?

[01-Jan-20 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> its Proof of Work but delayed :)

[01-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> Why is it delayed?

[01-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> 60 seconds block time

[01-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> And enormous TPS capacity

[01-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> What is the block size of Komodo network?

[01-Jan-20 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> A secondary blockchain, so it's something like lightning network?

[01-Jan-20 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo created an algorithm called dPoW which uses a system of notarizations to Bitcoin to fortify KMD chain integrity. KMD is mined using the Equihash algorithm and like all blockchains it abides by the "Longest chain" rule, however, Komodo adds an additional criteria that must be met. The hash of the Longest chain must also match the most recent notarization made to Bitcoin.
So if someone were to try and 51% attack KMD and reverse a transaction that has already been notarized, then there is no way for them to maintain the correct Hash and therefore match the notarization. So they could release a chain that is far longer than the main chain, however because it doesn't match the notarization, all the nodes will ignore it. (re @valerianb: Why is it delayed?)

[01-Jan-20 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> This security feature also has a ton of ancillary benefits, for example these notarizations made nSPV possible and exclusive to Komodo ecosystem that uses dPoW. nSPV is a new ultra light weight wallet that can even work with IoT, websites, and embedded devices. It uses thousands of times less resources than traditional SPV wallets.

[01-Jan-20 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> dPoW also allows Komodo to protect other 3rd party chains. They can notarize their chains to KMD and protect themselves from 51% attacks as well.

[01-Jan-20 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <valerianb> That's awesome, very interesting, I have never seen such an algorithm

[01-Jan-20 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> I heard Chrome updated and Firefox not support U2F so Ledger not working with them. How people use ledger now ? MEW not working too I send last time eth tokens using Ledger Live app because with browser MEW not works. But I cant claim KMD directly from ledger live app. I trying Opera browser too but claim kmd not working too.
