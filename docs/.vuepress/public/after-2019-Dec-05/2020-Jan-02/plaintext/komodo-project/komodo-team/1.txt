@Mylo might be better to build out ledger AC support on ledger if that is something you would be interested in

Ok, of the list of stuff - hardware wallet stuff is definitely reaching beyond my available skills for the short term turnaround/result, but seeing as most of the stuff is already done for KMD, maybe itâ€™s a good bridge to cross to learn with.

Interested, but not keen atm.  Will check out.  Currently setting up a new Komodo blog for personal quick turnaround + community impact.
