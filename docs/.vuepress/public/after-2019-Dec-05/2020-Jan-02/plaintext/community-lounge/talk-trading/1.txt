$7050 is key

[01-Jan-20 12:04 AM] Lanii#8302
U should draw a line or 2 so we can see the levels you are looking at

[01-Jan-20 12:09 AM] Markus#5464
thats 200%

[01-Jan-20 12:09 AM] Markus#5464
without pullback

[01-Jan-20 12:09 AM] Markus#5464
u can expect pullback to between 0.5 and 0.618 on fib to have a healthy trend

[01-Jan-20 12:10 AM] Privatoshi#9487
This isn't a trade I would take.

[01-Jan-20 12:12 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'd wait for confirmation, before I entered a short.
Like I said, $7050 would be an entry.
But I'm not taking this trade.

[01-Jan-20 12:13 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Lanii @Markus Your opinions?

@meatspoon I guess you could say AtomicDex is not dependent on KMD, but I think it's a pretty strong development-- with a huge potential if they could get it to a point where any dummy can use it. BAT I think is a novelty. Who wants to view ads? That said, I've gotten kicked in the ass and bitten by too many KMD asset chains. Verus has been the only one who has not completely blown up on me(because I sold out near the top and bought back in). I get the same reaction any time I suggest that VRSC isn't going to be worth anything less than a million dollars tomorrow too.

[01-Jan-20 02:00 PM] richardt#2807
@Patrick Crypto you're just a really really bad trader and should've DYOR üòÑ

[01-Jan-20 03:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Patrick Crypto I sign up to view ads on Brave.  I can see how at first glance BAT might not be impressive.  But at first glance I didn't realize how big the digital advertisement space is.  The main guy is Brendan Eich (a real name, not an alias!!) who created Javascript, founded Netscape and Mozilla Firefox.  The way that digital ads are served now is about the most inefficient way and most intrusive way possible.  If you have a smart phone, about $20 of your monthly bill is used to stream ad info that you dont even want to your device.  $20 worth of bandwidth per month of crap you dont want to see.  But Brave allows you to turn on the "crap" in a very contained way (a little toolbar popup) and you get a sliver of the BAT used to buy it whether you click on it or not.  So the BAT project has a working product.  Over 8 million active users and growing.  It certainly may fail, but it is a legit project on the ETH network.  Does KMD have any legit project?  Any team with a leader who isnt anon and who has a very professional reputation?  I am not going heavy on BAT.  Made a couple small buys and I have Brave installed on 5 devices, so i farm BAT and hodl it.  But in my opinion, it is more than a novelty.

anyone got up to date KMD chart? Suspect we're gonna bounce here? ü§û

[01-Jan-20 03:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Patrick Crypto I should also add that the Brave Browser is awesome.  It blocks probably 99% of pop ups and ads.  And the option to open a privacy TOR window is really cool.  Works great.

hmm, i am not part of the linked in Wage Cage crowd.  Dont have an account.  I will google the name tho.

[01-Jan-20 03:32 PM] richardt#2807
Is that confirmed? I remember some lady that supposedly worked for IBM was praising and working on KMD tech. That turned out to be completely false.

Verus has been around for awhile now , their discord is active

[01-Jan-20 03:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
He ported sapling over to the kmd ecosystem ,  currently they just released a beta of a blockchain id system

[01-Jan-20 03:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
i just skimmed like 8 pages of an article on Toutonghi and Verus and it didnt say what the coin was for.

[01-Jan-20 03:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
i saw "Endless possibilities" mentioned a few times.  that sounds good

[01-Jan-20 03:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
veruscoin.io

[01-Jan-20 03:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
ok, this is when i get old and crotchety.  There is no doubt this Toutonghi guy is a smart guy.  Why make a cookie cutter website that does not ELI5 the shit out of the coin?

[01-Jan-20 03:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
so he is offering yet another coin that promises to make anyone elses' good ideas actionable....  it makes it look like he is selling the blank canvas for others to build on... .kind of like KMD

[01-Jan-20 03:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can‚Äôt say , you can go ask him in their discord.  They are creating a merge mining style ecosystem for certain kinds of chains such as temporary chains and voting chains.

[01-Jan-20 03:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
i guess my point is that at first glance, Verus is just another smart contract sort of platform that is organized slightly differently from others.  it has no defined use case, it does not seem to have any product beyond allowing people to build their own blockchains

[01-Jan-20 03:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Literally just said they just released a beta of an id system

[01-Jan-20 03:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
so if this is the winning example of a KMD ecosystem coin.... if this is what is pointed to as the success story...  I dont really know what to say.  Verus may be great.  It also may be a cookie cutter project with 3 developers (as per the website)

[01-Jan-20 03:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, ID systems will certainly be a growing market

[01-Jan-20 03:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
but this project does not seem to be developed if their only product is a beta ID system that isnt even mentioned on their web page

[01-Jan-20 03:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You claimed no reputable person is working on kmd

[01-Jan-20 03:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, i asked what a legit project was

[01-Jan-20 03:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
what the crown jewel of the KMD empire was

[01-Jan-20 03:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
or any functioning, working project

[01-Jan-20 03:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
‚ÄúAny team with a leader who isn‚Äôt anon and who had a very professional reputation‚Äù

[01-Jan-20 03:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
fair enough, i was listing that as a potential criterion for a larger example of a working project that is a success

[01-Jan-20 03:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
but this is the kind of disconnect that is so jarring around here.  I am not lumping you into the following category, poly, but people around here talk shit on everything.  I have seen people talk mad shit on BAT here.... yet BAT has a full team, funding, their product works, they are getting revenue right now.  Their model is thus far successful.  But KMD people will tear it down, talk smack on it despite the KMD ecosystem having almost nothing of note in it

[01-Jan-20 03:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
i have seen people talk shit on Celsius Network in here.... the CEO is the patent holder for VOIP and brought wifi to the NYC subways.  They have tens of millions in funding and a working project.  And the KMD crew will shit talk it.

[01-Jan-20 03:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
it shouldnt be hard for a group of people who are so gung ho and into KMD to point to a success story to justify their superiority complex.  If a success story exists, that is.

[01-Jan-20 03:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Scroll through the telegrams of Grinhub and Zcoin and Beam  shittalking is commonplace .   I haven‚Äôt heard anything talked about Celsius , in fact I am reaching out to them following previous discussions at WCC

[01-Jan-20 03:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
they are looking for stake/reward coins

[01-Jan-20 03:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
so i think thats a good thing to do

[01-Jan-20 03:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
i have heard people talk shit on it though.  "Not your keys, not your crypto!" and "sounds like a scam" comments

[01-Jan-20 03:50 PM] designer#4893

[01-Jan-20 03:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And we give pretty wide berth for free speech around here

[01-Jan-20 03:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
fair enough.  i just chime in to talk about the culture here from time to time and to offer up some crow to those who should be chowing down on it by now

[01-Jan-20 03:51 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
KMD is the only coin I own where the tech gets better and yet my only option for a wallet is to use one with less functionality than the one I had a year ago, or to use one from another coin.

[01-Jan-20 03:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
that is true, i like how y'all respect free speech... even though i was threatened with a ban for making a joke in a channel that at the time was labeled "a free for all of opinion" or some such

[01-Jan-20 03:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Kitchen Table yeah, i would much rather store my KMD with Celsius than in one of the existing wallets... adds some irony to the "not your keys, not your crypto!" when that comes from a member of a community that has had enormous trouble with wallets

[01-Jan-20 03:55 PM] cascrypto#8206
he spoon fork that talk off yours no need to start the new year winning ;0)

[01-Jan-20 03:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
"he spoon fork that talk off yours no need to start the new year winning"  I am gonna spend the new year puzzling that one together... its like a cryptic fortune cookie message.

[01-Jan-20 03:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends on the channel , I can‚Äôt say what mods will take ,  people such as Tek have exploited our laissez faire policy so we had to tighten up a bit.      Regarding wallet issues a normal QT wallet is available for KMD, Agama was an experimental wallet where we kept making updates and for the most part if kept updated no issues occurred.  Npm Malware  issue being an exception .
