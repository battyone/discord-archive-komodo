Everything is upstreams fault!
Monero is the shittiest shitcoin!
Am i right? @Biz

Nope. You’re wrong @Morningstar. Wouldn’t have forked them if I thought that. But there’s a lot of areas for improvement, as with anything. Their unwillingness to adhere to established best practices is most of my bone to pick

I disagree with a lot of their decisions lately, however. I suspect many would, if they knew what I know

It got bad enough where I stopped porting Monero code altogether about 6 months ago

Believe me when I say that I would like our upstream to be more .. hmm... reliable
