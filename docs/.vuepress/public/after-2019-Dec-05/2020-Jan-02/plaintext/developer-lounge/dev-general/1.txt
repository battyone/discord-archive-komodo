was looking at smart chains docs on komodo docs

[01-Jan-20 06:37 PM] akshaynexus#3840
how does the chain progress/ new blocks get created?

[01-Jan-20 06:37 PM] akshaynexus#3840
is it pow?

[01-Jan-20 06:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that depends on the paramaters of the chain

[01-Jan-20 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one can start a chain and use PoW, PoS, or a combination of both

[01-Jan-20 06:54 PM] akshaynexus#3840
interesting.Does the smart chain have the normal network messages like a kmd fork would have?

[01-Jan-20 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, you cannot send out system alerts without a full fork of the code and changing the alert key

[01-Jan-20 06:57 PM] akshaynexus#3840
other than the alert system?ie getheaders and other normal network messages

[01-Jan-20 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, all relevant cli commands work
you simply need to add the param of `komodo-cli -ac_name=MYCHANNAME somecommand`

[01-Jan-20 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
@akshaynexus they're the same as zcash other than a couple custom ones created for nspv

[01-Jan-20 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
