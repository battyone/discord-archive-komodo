@Andersen some really interesting correlations tbh

[30-Dec-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if you look at the data one should be inclined we are due for a move upwards

[30-Dec-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
open intrest dropping, fear index rising etc

[30-Dec-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
in the past that always preceded a move up

@meatspoon alot have been said to be the best ever üòÑ

I sold some ARRR at the top

[30-Dec-19 03:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
for once

[30-Dec-19 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, this crypto space is full of pretty awful predictions.  They are kind of fun to look back and marvel on.  The idea of Pirate Chain overtaking Monero was floated as "probable" or "obvious" by some of the more fanciful personalities in here.  And they were making such predictions on a short time frame as well, like within a year or two.  Heh.  Time may prove my opinion incorrect, but with the hindsight we have, ARRR looks like a thrown together cash grab by the KMD mining community.  Much (if not all) of the hype was projected by the miners (surprise!).

ARRR, if indeed superior (which I have no reason to believe it isn‚Äôt) then the rest is just a matter of marketing, word of mouth etc. AtomicDex integration is a big milestone I would keep an eye on.

"thrown together cash grab" - more casual slander from meatspoon. Does he even bother to check their discord to see the real work that goes on there week after week after week before hurling his uninformed accusations? Their work does not guarantee market acceptance, and indeed it has not succeeded in price, but to call it a thrown together cash grab is pure slander.

Did TA predict that KMD will be back at 2018 lows?

[30-Dec-19 06:31 PM] Andersen#8337
@meatspoon     If (when) Pirate is capable of atomic swap  to KMD  or any other coin , it will be  game  change.
Many  times i heard people  ask  here  in discord  then monero swaps ? Looks  like  never.
And  Pirate  in  next year  probably .....

[30-Dec-19 06:34 PM] richardt#2807
You do have to admit though, the words "best tech" and "game changer" does get thrown around alot around here. It's become pretty meaningless at this point

@Cryptoon I agree. Nothing is better than DYOR and thinking for yourself

[30-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, wouldnt be the first time someone lost all of their money by blindly following whatever some cryptotwitter personality declares the next big thing

[30-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362

veriblock comes to mind üôÇ

[30-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
other than that, ARRR is pretty solid and seems pretty bottomed out atm, it's just marketing and adoption atm, but the underlying tech is top notch as far as privacy coins go

[30-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as far as what is needed to make it grow in price, it's the same for any coin/project. Adoption + usage is key

[30-Dec-19 06:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
everything else is just hype and temporary

[30-Dec-19 06:40 PM] Markus#5464
@richardt yes it did and it might not be over yet

[30-Dec-19 06:40 PM] richardt#2807
I don't recall anyone predicting when KMD was about to release rebrand/Antara/AtomicDEX

[30-Dec-19 06:40 PM] Markus#5464
we are in a bearish trend so u look for potential targets until there is signs of a reversal

[30-Dec-19 06:41 PM] richardt#2807
Even so, no one predicted it would go this low

[30-Dec-19 06:41 PM] Markus#5464
first sign u want is a higher low, kmd might maybe be doing that now, nothing confirmed

[30-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
when btc went to 12k earlier this year everyone was predicting 50k and would 'go allin' if we ever saw 6-7k levels again...

[30-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hindsight is always 20/20 :p

[30-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now everyone is shouting 1500$ and shorting it to the bottom blabla

[30-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Markus#5464
14k was obvious if u know some basic TA using fibonacci, btc did a 61.8% retest

[30-Dec-19 06:42 PM] Markus#5464
61.8% is a golden target

[30-Dec-19 06:43 PM] richardt#2807
I'm just talking about KMD right now

[30-Dec-19 06:44 PM] richardt#2807
I'm not saying TA isn't useful, but it doesn't really take into account the bigger picture. It's like winning small battles, but losing the entire war

for fib?

[30-Dec-19 06:51 PM] Markus#5464
nope, u can even draw fib on BLX chart from previous cycle low to 19k high and u see that 3k bottom was not a coincidence

[30-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
on btc that is

[30-Dec-19 06:53 PM] richardt#2807
Of course it's not a coincidence. The people who control the markets wanted it that way to make people like us feel like we know what we're doing üòÑ

Doing TA and talking in absolutes don't go hand in hand

[30-Dec-19 09:58 PM] Lanii#8302
It's really dumb to draw some fibs and say smth like "we are gonna go here"

[30-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@Lanii You tell Fibonacci, Leonardo Bonacci, that it is dumb.. I'll side with the math

[30-Dec-19 10:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
well if the majority decides to follow the TA, then it will happen.

[30-Dec-19 10:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't do TA, but I see TA as something like "trading consensus" among traders, the more people follow the more chance it can be accurate

[30-Dec-19 10:52 PM] Lanii#8302
@Privatoshi muh fibs are actually levels that form these fibs. Go to monthly and you can see why btc rejected there. Its not because they are magic in any ways, if you know price action then you dont need no fibs

[30-Dec-19 10:53 PM] Lanii#8302
@PHBA2061 Majority never makes money. Proper TA works (over time) because it gives you good probability trades with specific entries and stops

[30-Dec-19 10:54 PM] Lanii#8302
Not because the majority uses it and hence it works out

[30-Dec-19 10:55 PM] richardt#2807
I guess at the end of the day, we all need some kind of model to predict what the whales are thinking and give us the feeling that we have some form of control when we really don't

[30-Dec-19 10:55 PM] richardt#2807
The same could be said with many other aspects of life

[30-Dec-19 10:56 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont agree with that, good traders definetely beat the market over time

[30-Dec-19 10:56 PM] Lanii#8302
If you have proper knowledge and good dicipline you make money

[30-Dec-19 10:56 PM] Lanii#8302
If you bother with indicators, patterns etc. you dont, simple as that

[30-Dec-19 10:57 PM] richardt#2807
with the proper "inside" knowledge üòÑ

[30-Dec-19 10:58 PM] Lanii#8302
It is sort of ‚Äùinside‚Äù because it is very limited info on it out there unless you have a mentor of some sort

[30-Dec-19 10:59 PM] Lanii#8302
However you‚Äôll find hundred of books on indicators, trend lines and patterns

[30-Dec-19 10:59 PM] Lanii#8302
Hence why in my opinion it doesnt work

[30-Dec-19 11:00 PM] Lanii#8302
If someone can show me consistent profits for 2 years using those then I‚Äôll change my mind

[30-Dec-19 11:04 PM] richardt#2807
Yup, pretty easy to be a good trader when you have inside info.

[30-Dec-19 11:06 PM] Lanii#8302
Its not inside info

[30-Dec-19 11:07 PM] Lanii#8302
Its knowledge about how price moves

[30-Dec-19 11:07 PM] Lanii#8302
Im not talking about ‚Äùinside calls‚Äù

[30-Dec-19 11:07 PM] Lanii#8302
And this knowledge is hard to come by

[30-Dec-19 11:07 PM] Lanii#8302
And if you do, you need to put down a good amount of time to understand and utilize

[30-Dec-19 11:08 PM] Lanii#8302
Meanwhile you‚Äôll memorize all patterns within one hour and you can easily spot it

[30-Dec-19 11:08 PM] Lanii#8302
And retail wants easy way out so thats what they use

[30-Dec-19 11:11 PM] richardt#2807
Sure, I won't argue with that. But also can't ignore that most of the price movements are controlled by a small number of people

[30-Dec-19 11:11 PM] richardt#2807
Especially in a highly speculative market like crypto

[30-Dec-19 11:12 PM] Markus#5464
ofc trendlines and support/resistance work

[30-Dec-19 11:12 PM] Markus#5464
the trend is your friend

[30-Dec-19 11:13 PM] Lanii#8302
People here using trendlines Dont even know how to use it üòÇüòÇ

[30-Dec-19 11:13 PM] Lanii#8302
Just drawing them to fit bias

[30-Dec-19 11:13 PM] Markus#5464
let me give u a quick overview of why bitcoin stopped at pretty much exactly 6.5k and not lower or higher

When big boys are moving price they Dont do it randomly (mostly) and for that reason they have to do some things and protect some things from happening for their purpose

[30-Dec-19 11:15 PM] Lanii#8302
And thats Why price action matters

[30-Dec-19 11:16 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus Thats price action, tell me What pattern or trendline would tell you to buy There
