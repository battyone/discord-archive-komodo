i'm getting a lot of `2019-12-23 14:31:59 socket recv error Connection reset by peer (104)` on my staking node

I  think  they  programmed the  camera to  see if  the staker  is watching the outputs -- If staker('dude.watching') then sys('stake.none')  else sys('Stake.5fast') + print("Go back to your  real  job!")

more like
`if (PoW.diff != BTC.diff) { PoW.mine}`

ohh -- makes  more sense,  but  you forgot  + print("Go back to your  real  job!")
