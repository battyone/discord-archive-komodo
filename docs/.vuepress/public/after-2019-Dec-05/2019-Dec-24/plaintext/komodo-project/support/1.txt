Any updates on ledger sync issues?

[23-Dec-19 03:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
This question should be addressed to ledger

[23-Dec-19 03:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
In my experience they tend to be slow upgrading daemons

Hello, I'm try to sign an offline Komodo transaction using the wallet AGMA Windows-v0.5.7-4. I'm following the instructions at this link, https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

Everything works fine until I try to broadcast the transaction. I get the error, {"code":1,"message":"the transaction was rejected by network rules.\n\n64: scriptpubkey\n[0400008085202f8901c22c7c2ce948bbe1104f29a464b9d9f484a70f596d5549c69feaba5726218e6b010000006b4830450221009b727505f27516d9fbd5f467f2a0f3c26b85c8ca0737a631d353c433db03f5f8022060f8fbd569c0db1189115d914ce4716df3c379b7e7b760215448c1f5df5d1ad2012103b911e4de8db9d0aab36b234b4b34609eb24a1f0e993ab6b07c29b199e6717d8effffffff02baf97653000000000576a90088ac7c4a0800000000000576a90088ac8529015e000000000000000000000000000000]"}. Any ideas what is wrong ? Thank you

I also tried to broadcast the same signed transaction at https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/send where I got the error, An error occured:
64: scriptpubkey. Code:-26

Try to update your Agama

[23-Dec-19 09:30 PM] PacificK2A#4591
What is the latest Agama version ? Is it a portable version (so I don't need to install it) ?

It's in such a sense portable that the program holds all it needs to run in the extracted folder. The settings, wallet.dat and chaindata are standard written to %AppData% (windows) or comparable locations in Linux & MacOS

[23-Dec-19 09:35 PM] PacificK2A#4591
OK, thanks. Its no longer called Agama, so that threw me off the trail. I will try it. Thanks again !

[23-Dec-19 09:58 PM] PacificK2A#4591
I am now running the new Versuscoin wallet Versus Desktop v0.0.4-alpha. I do not see anyway to generate an transaction for offline signing, like the Agama wallet had. How can I generate and then sign a transaction offline on a 2nd computer in the new Versus wallet ?

[23-Dec-19 10:02 PM] PacificK2A#4591
Forget it. I think I need to use the 2nd wallet on the page called the graphical wallet v0.6.0-6. I will try that one.

@pbca26  just a follow up question... the only wallet that supports KMD and Trezor is the Magnum wallet. Correct? And when I want to claim my rewards, I use the link you posted earlier, right?

[23-Dec-19 10:58 PM] PacificK2A#4591
It worked. I confirm for you that the offline signing of a transaction and then broadcasting online worked successfully with Agama-Windows-v0.6.0-6. Thanks again for the help !
