@androkles devs and admin here won't PM you asking for anything, please make sure you report them to admin here. Sometimes people imitate us and look legit, do NOT send money, ever!

[23-Dec-19 04:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Also obviously don't download anything they send you either

[23-Dec-19 06:14 AM] androkles#6591
Thank you for the response. If he is the dev in this project I appreciate the info about his involvement of another project.

[23-Dec-19 06:24 AM] Regnar#6164
@androkles this includes anyone sending you a PM with a github link or something to download "the newest wallet" or something. Always verify PMs in the official channels, I'd hate for something bad to happen

[23-Dec-19 06:37 AM] androkles#6591
Yes,  thank you for notifying. But can you confirm that Aamodt is developer here?

[23-Dec-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@androkles I am not familiar with that name
he could be contracted to work as a free lancer for a project related to Komodo
if you can share his github profile or any other online info, you might get an answer

[23-Dec-19 07:28 AM] androkles#6591
Unfortunately I only know pseudonym "Aamodt".
