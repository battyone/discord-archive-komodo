I think that the goal should be so that every developer could have his own chain with his own cc up and running over a weekend. 

Including his logic, possibly with an oracle, in his own preffered programming language and on windows.

Maybe we could contact zcash to see is they have plans to make a port for windows.

If they don't, then maybe we could take it on ourselves. (As far as I know it is not a priority for them because they are a digital currency and not a platform. I think here we differ from them)

I've looked around and found this guy.

He is enthusiastic to do such porting, but he couldn't get the funding.

The funny thing is that he is already involved within komodo ecosystem/pirate chain...

komodo runs on windows

[23-Dec-19 06:28 AM] artik123#2884
Can i compile it on windows using visual studio?

[23-Dec-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure the oceanQT can

[23-Dec-19 07:02 AM] artik123#2884
@Decker can I? Last time this project was updated was more than half a year ago, and I don't see *.sln file

[23-Dec-19 07:06 AM] artik123#2884
But I do see *.pro file. Seems It is compiling on windows but just not up to date

[23-Dec-19 07:19 AM] Decker#3767
@artik123 Compiling with MSVC not longer supported. Use default `static` branch and cross-compile Komodo-Qt for Windows from *nix.

[23-Dec-19 07:21 AM] Decker#3767
If you have any other questions about Komodo-Qt, plz ask them in #wallet-ocean-qt .

Latest release was 19 days ago. 19 days is not "half a year".
