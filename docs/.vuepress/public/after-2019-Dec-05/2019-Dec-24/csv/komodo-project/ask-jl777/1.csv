Including his logic, possibly with an oracle, in his own preffered programming language and on windows.

Maybe we could contact zcash to see is they have plans to make a port for windows.

If they don't, then maybe we could take it on ourselves. (As far as I know it is not a priority for them because they are a digital currency and not a platform. I think here we differ from them)

I've looked around and found this guy.","",""
