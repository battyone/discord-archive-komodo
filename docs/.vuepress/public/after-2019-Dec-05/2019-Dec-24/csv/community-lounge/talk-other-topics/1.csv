"352577127494713345","phm87#7395","23-Dec-19 09:08 AM","Sorry for my wrong interpretation. As far as i know, there are limits (for safety) into LN around 0.04 BTC per channel and it is written everywhere that it is in development and subject to risks so unsure why someone will put 10 BTC on LN (maybe for profit/greed). I'd prefer that you discuss segwit with a LN developer rather than me.
About the centralization/decentralization, the network is very young and some big players tried to centralize it with bad results (LN.big still loose money). Mobile light wallets are using the default node (so LN mobile wallets suffer from the same problem that Ethereum have with infura infra)","",""

If anybody change the code to be able to play with several BTC, he should know what he is doing (same apply if I overclock a CPU or if I tune up a car: most insurances don't work from this point).

There seems to be a loophole right now with the gift cards. When I tried to buy an American Express debit card and load it with a couple hundred for a gift to send overseas, I was told I could not. It can only be in my name. As it stands now, if governments eliminated paper money but still allowed gift cards in bearer form, then they would simply become cash. It would seem that store cash gift cards would become the circulating cash in the black market economy. When that becomes more commonplace, they would probably shut that down or make them non-transferable in some name that is specific.```","",""
