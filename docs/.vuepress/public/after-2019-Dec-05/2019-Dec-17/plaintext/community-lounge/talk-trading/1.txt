Coins that never die despite years without innovation and development. Impressive actually

[16-Dec-19 01:21 AM] richardt#2807
Just like the fiat system

[16-Dec-19 01:24 AM] richardt#2807
Or maybe I'm just salty because I sold my bags of ltc and doge before 2017 üò•

[16-Dec-19 02:14 AM] klein#5233
Hmm might have to look at HEX now because so many BTC maximalist shitheads are talking about it

[16-Dec-19 02:26 AM] IamTrader#6042
Whos long with KMD

[16-Dec-19 03:09 AM] actionslacks#4072

Anyone else taking a loan now to buy kmd üëÄ

[16-Dec-19 09:22 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Thoughts on this being near the bottom fist wise? Or think we have a long ways to go

[16-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just handed in my application, my logic is if I was going to buy xxxx a month, may as well buy xxxx * 24 now, pay off the rest, as long as I see komodo being worth more than 10% of its current value

[16-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
5% if we include the rewards

[16-Dec-19 09:23 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Not some sell the house unplayable loan. But stable job, same amount I‚Äôd be buying monthly but at once

[16-Dec-19 09:31 AM] klein#5233
coinexchange.io is closed

[16-Dec-19 09:31 AM] klein#5233
is there anywhere else that trades DEX?

[16-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Atomicdex üòÉ

[16-Dec-19 09:46 AM] Acura#2748
AtomicDex or OTC Deals

[16-Dec-19 09:47 AM] klein#5233
Yes I am actually after some price charts

[16-Dec-19 09:48 AM] klein#5233
Also any websites where you can view the current orderbook liquidity of AtomicDex

[16-Dec-19 09:50 AM] klein#5233
thankyou

[16-Dec-19 09:53 AM] Acura#2748
I can offer Dex - my price is 25kmd by the end of the year

[16-Dec-19 10:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Anyone selling largish amount of kmd @market rate, dm me. Willing to use atomicdex

[16-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
No one? :c

[16-Dec-19 01:09 PM] jorian#4555
no one is selling

[16-Dec-19 01:09 PM] jorian#4555
we're all holding the bag and queueing for spaceX mission to moon and mars

[16-Dec-19 01:10 PM] jorian#4555
how much are you buying?

[16-Dec-19 01:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I see some drama going on wity HEX

[16-Dec-19 01:18 PM] Markus#5464
HEX seems rly fishy, would not touch it

[16-Dec-19 01:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have no intention to touch it, i just find it funny

[16-Dec-19 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
now roger ver listed it on his exchange, bitcoin.com

[16-Dec-19 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
not sure what to think of that

[16-Dec-19 02:00 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Good to see everyone is holding üòÅ meet you all on the moon

[16-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh with trevon james joining the HEX bandwagon

[16-Dec-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and richard hart not distancing himself from those scammers, it's just obvious he is scamming himself and probably contacted the bitconnect scammers himself

[16-Dec-19 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
HEX reminded me of Paycoin.

[16-Dec-19 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
too good to be true

[16-Dec-19 02:42 PM] jspook16#3059
I see 35k KMD orders for btc on atomicdex..

[16-Dec-19 02:45 PM] cipi#4502
same for BCH, ETH, LTC and ZEC...

[16-Dec-19 02:53 PM] richardt#2807
Looks like Waves is mooning. Our flippening of Waves was short and sweet

[16-Dec-19 03:35 PM] Neko#5830
they got in the binance.us

[16-Dec-19 03:59 PM] jspook16#3059
Is kmd still in the mix for possible binance.us?

[16-Dec-19 04:39 PM] richardt#2807
Guess we know what will happen to KMD once accepted

[16-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Neko#5830
considering it has a lot more features than waves..

[16-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Neko#5830
kmd needs a decent fiat pair

[16-Dec-19 06:15 PM] jspook16#3059
Hoping for the best..

[16-Dec-19 06:46 PM] Markus#5464
