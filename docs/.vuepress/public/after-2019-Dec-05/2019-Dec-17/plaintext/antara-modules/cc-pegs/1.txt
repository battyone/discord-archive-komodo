Nothing has changed after chain stabilization, it is on block 800 almost and there are still very fast blocks and parts without block for 30mins +

[16-Dec-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will investigate. for now, lets just test without adaptivepow

[16-Dec-19 12:42 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok üëç

[16-Dec-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
please keep at least 2 nodes on this chain. i think best if the mining is turned off so i can control the mining when testing

[16-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
You are talking about 5 minute chain?

[16-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
I will turn off mining

[16-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, mining turned off, 2 nodes running

[16-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
chain params up there

[16-Dec-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
dealing with vrsc today so wont get to it till later this week. hopefully the idling chain will just wait for me to debug.

[16-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
To get back on pegs (which is the point of this channel üòõ ), command to close account can be used in this cases:
1) covering whole debt with coins and getting deposit back
2) without coins getting back the deposit minus the value of debt in deposit coins at that moment (what happens here when price goes down, the coins were covered then but now depoist is missing for total number of issued coins)
3) if user has partial number of coins for the debt he could return that and get deposit minus the rest of debt in deposit coins (same issue as previous)
2 and 3 could only be done if it doesn't put global ratio in red zone (60% current).

[16-Dec-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as the global ratio is not put in danger and the user gets back the net equity, that is what is important. having some fee (that rises) as the global ratio gets worse and worse, with a cap at some percentage, like 70%. maybe is the way to allow someone to liquidate their position at a slight cost

[16-Dec-19 02:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
OK, but what happens with the coins for which the debt is covered and then the price fell. There is no more account for those coins, but it should be accounted somewhere and be covered by some deposit. We can maybe use the global deposit (those 5% that goes to the system from liquidation) but then what happens when that deposit is covered with debt and there is more?

[16-Dec-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if the account is being closed, then it should be totally closed. not sure the scenario you mean

[16-Dec-19 02:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
The two scenarios I mentioned up there (2 & 3). So if user spent all coins but he has more equity than the debt, he should be able to close account and take the rest. That we talked about last time. That is ok, but at that moment those coins that he don't have anymore are covered from his deposit and he closed the account, but what happens with the coins now, they are not accounted anywhere...

[16-Dec-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
they should be out of the system totally at that point. the global balance is updated. not sure what the issue is. what coins?

[16-Dec-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the fee can be based on how far away from the global balance you are. so basically if your account was better than the global balance, there is no fee at all

[16-Dec-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
as closing both sides of it, just improves the global balance

[16-Dec-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is worse than the global balance, then depending on how much worse, the fee is changes

[16-Dec-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
though if you have less than 50% equity, you wouldnt be able to close the account anyway, so maybe it is a moot point

[16-Dec-19 02:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Scenario like this:
1) user funded account (100KMD)
2) took 10USDK coins
3) spend 10USDK, balance 0
4) close account and take the rest of deposit (let say KMD 1$ so 90KMD redeemed and 10KMD has stayed in pegs to cover 10USDK)
Now there is no user account, maybe we should ad it to a global account and add 10USDK debt and 10KMD deposit. And price of KMD went to 0.5$ where is the cover for 10USDK now (5USDK un covered)?

[16-Dec-19 02:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
Initially when we had option to close account only when you cover whole debt was ok as there was not more coins and everything is covered. But this creates wierd cases.

[16-Dec-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the 10 USDK debt needs to go somewhere, or maybe we make it so that only 80 KMD can be withdrawn, so not totally closed, but that leaves a 10KMD balance with 10 USDK issued, so they are in balance

[16-Dec-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
or 12.5 KMD to meet the 80%

[16-Dec-19 02:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is ok to transfer the debt somewhere, we can make a global account. But the problem is what to do when debt overpasses the deposit. We cannot liquidate global account üòõ

[16-Dec-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that keeps things in balance and still allows user to closeout most of a high equity account

[16-Dec-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
best not to mess with global account as we cant risk that

[16-Dec-19 02:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
Even if we leave twice as much deposit for left coins, what happens when price fells 2.5x

[16-Dec-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in a normal user account at the 80% loaned ratio. if it goes below 10% equity it is liquidated as usual

[16-Dec-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
basically "close account" is really more "take out as much KMD as i can and leave the balance at 80% borrowed"

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, but what when borrowed ratio goes to 101%?

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
After the close

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it?

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
after the close it is at 80%

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
And price changes right?

[16-Dec-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
then each block it can gradually go to 90%+ and then get liquidated, just as any account

[16-Dec-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to do the calculations as of the block it is being confirmed in

[16-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, you mean to keep the account as is just to reduce the deposit so it is at 80%.

[16-Dec-19 03:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
Then when it reaches 90% someone can liquidate it

[16-Dec-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
after the "close" account, the user is left with a max borrow percentage of 80%

[16-Dec-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt actually close it, but rather changes it to a max leveraged account that can be created normally. that covers the left over coins

[16-Dec-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
So in case I mentioned it woudl be like this:
- account 100KMD:10USDK (ratio 10%)
- "close" account with gettting out 87.5KMD and leaving 12.5 after which 10USDK is 80%
- price changes and account reaches 90%
- liquidated by someone...

[16-Dec-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is just a convenience function for the user, the system is put into a normal state of an 80% account

[16-Dec-19 03:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
Good, will do it like that. What should the command be called? Up to now it was pegsreedem, we could leave it that way. So you can reedem deposit with either covering all debt (then a real account close), or partial or 0 debt covered and get deposit to leave the account at 80% debt.

[16-Dec-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
however makes sense to you seems fine
