How can AtomicDex be to blame for adding every foreign word in your phone to your dictionary?

[16-Dec-19 11:12 PM] fazer#0903
if anyone try workaround password and get your seed will be able to

[16-Dec-19 11:13 PM] Acura#2748
your phone's dictionary is part of your operating system, not AtomicDex.

[16-Dec-19 11:13 PM] fazer#0903
Same way as another applications doing that by protected insert column

[16-Dec-19 11:14 PM] fazer#0903
i have another apps and even if i show passwords im entering they does NOT load pass into local db

[16-Dec-19 11:14 PM] fazer#0903
so same way should atomicdex do it

[16-Dec-19 11:14 PM] Oszy#5734
@TonyL text suggestions should be disabled on that field from within the code

If your mobile phone operating system currently adds any newly added foreign words to the dictionary, this cannot be the problem of AtomicDex.
I still know what problem you're bringing to my attention.

[16-Dec-19 11:15 PM] Oszy#5734
`InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS` if written in flutter

[16-Dec-19 11:16 PM] Oszy#5734
`keyboardSuggestions: false` for iOS

[16-Dec-19 11:16 PM] fazer#0903
yea exactly. enter password seems like have this enabled, but create password not

[16-Dec-19 11:16 PM] fazer#0903
so all newly created passwords goes out

[16-Dec-19 11:17 PM] Oszy#5734
``` if (obscureText) {
            // Note: both required. Some devices ignore TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS.
            textType |= InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS;
            textType |= InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_PASSWORD;
        }```
I am wondering which are those "some devices" that ignores this and why

@Oszy i have lots of another apps that works as it is expected, only atomic dex saving my passwords in dict

[16-Dec-19 11:20 PM] Oszy#5734
probably it's not implemented, just saying, even if it's added, i am wondering if it will work on all phones

[16-Dec-19 11:21 PM] Oszy#5734
*not yours*

[16-Dec-19 11:21 PM] fazer#0903
sorry, i understand

[16-Dec-19 11:50 PM] ca333#0118
@Oszy the reporting user likely has one of these devices:

[16-Dec-19 11:54 PM] ca333#0118
@Oszy as we said above `although we knew from the code that no data is leaked.`  - we can try to dig into the flutter engine as soon as we know which devices ignore these flags. Its weird since OS shouldn't behave _that_ different. Actually interesting if that is "by design".
