no need to be specific about who it is or what exactly is being done. just a general acknowledgement is good enough

Hey anyone tried to trade on VCC Exchange?

[16-Dec-19 09:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@crumb I thought dunedex was a RedFox project, not sure if kmd devs are working on that project

[16-Dec-19 10:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
That‚Äôs Zaddex

[16-Dec-19 10:16 AM] phm87#7395
I though that dunedex and zaddex were 2 different things

[16-Dec-19 10:16 AM] phm87#7395
Dunedex is a DEX so if zaddex is equal to dunedex, I should be able to claim my coins

[16-Dec-19 10:17 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I believe it‚Äôs put on hold atm. But waiting for someone to come forth with correct info üôè but yeah different projects.

hello all

do you know maybe?!

[16-Dec-19 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also atomicdex I believe

https://twitter.com/notsofast/status/1206562662341054464?s=19 I claimed that kmd solved the Oracle problem, I'd say what he is requesting is a valid argument.

@Bernzyyy This is not a claim you can make honestly until the oracles are battle tested against bribery, MITM, DDoS, etc

[16-Dec-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
how do you bribe all nodes in the network to accept an invalid timestamp?

[16-Dec-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses a similar mechanism as how timestamps are accepted. if there is a timestamp that is out of range, all nodes would reject it. so if you can bribe nodes to accept a timestamp from next month as valid, then it seems you can bribe the DTO, but that sort of thing isnt possible the way the consensus is done.

you could maybe bribe the source of the datafeed at the api level, but technically what the DTO is reaching consensus on is the value provided by the specified api, so if that api is changing its value, the DTO is technically correct to track that change

[16-Dec-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, i am curious as to what attack vectors there are to getting nodes to accept a timestamp one month in the future. since all nodes will reject such a timestamp as being too far from the future, no amount of bribery would work. MITM doesnt make sense in this context. you can ddos nodes from the network, but the ones that remain are still following the consensus rule

[16-Dec-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we should have some sort of battle testing of DTO for people that are not convinced by code. of course, there could be implementation issues as with anything, but at the high level putting the oracle in the actual block consensus itself is a new way for oracles and it avoids the issues that plague aggregated oracles

@Bernz - Selling LABS I think he felt the discord screenshot was about the DTO Oracle, but it was about Pegs
you can share the medium article with him

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

[16-Dec-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that the pegs builds on top of a DTO, so what i said is valid

[16-Dec-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
other pegged coins need to have some non-DTO oracle and are subject to bribery, MITM, and other attacks that make aggregated oracles not very reliable for large amounts. it is possible to make a complex deposit/reputation system, but that only works until the amount at stake is bigger than the value of all the coins deposited

[16-Dec-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the DTO avoids all that complexity

[16-Dec-19 03:20 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, I was talking about this screenshot which explained pegs

right after that, bernz mentioned oracles and notsofast countered with that tweet about ddos and mtm

i am eager to hear how you can MITM the timestamp

[16-Dec-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
every node is independently getting the price data via the same api

[16-Dec-19 03:37 PM] gcharang#6833
I'am not saying anything about the DTO implementation.
 I just said notsofast saw an explanation for pegs and thought that was about DTO, so I pointed the blog post to share with him about DTO

[16-Dec-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Dec-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a good point that we should try to break it, but other than finding implementation bugs, i am not sure how one would go about corrupting the price

[16-Dec-19 03:45 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, the worst that can happen is a stalled chain
but the mechanism ensures that, if the chain is progressing properly, the data is correct

[16-Dec-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and if the prices are being messed up, stalling the chain is probably a decent way to mitigate damages. by having it notarized, there will be a notarized chain that can be followed

@gekomodo just dont give any sensitive info to people like the one above. As long as not a team member better to have support convo‚Äôs in #support

[16-Dec-19 09:01 PM] Dave F.#7777
@Cryptoon with all due respect I followed what he wrote and where he went wrong he can't lose anything because he already lost everything when he deleted the wallet.dat file

[16-Dec-19 09:01 PM] crumb#2550
**no one** should share their privkeys or seeds with third parties. ever.

[16-Dec-19 09:02 PM] Dave F.#7777
agree

[16-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then explain him the steps in #support so others can find the help later as well üôÇ
