no. based on the problems you have been having doing the simplest things the LAST thing i would recommend is that you make your own source code fork. it will be impossible for you

[16-Dec-19 01:09 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Then when the problem will resolve or can i fork any other smart chain code

[16-Dec-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
from what i can tell, you need to hire someone with technical expertise

[16-Dec-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we cannot do your project for you

[16-Dec-19 06:59 PM] pandaanu73#7907
I want to raise a question ? I'm running smart chain on a single node if i want to use double node do i need to stop the node and run it once again and in place of localhost i need to use the 2nd node ip is it correct

[16-Dec-19 07:02 PM] phm87#7395
you don't need to stop the first one, just launch a second one but with -addnode=<ip of the first node>

[16-Dec-19 07:02 PM] phm87#7395
there should be a KMD documentation on this

[16-Dec-19 07:02 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry to ask but why do you want to run a coin ?

[16-Dec-19 07:03 PM] phm87#7395
and what do you mean by ``in place of localhost i need to use the 2nd node ip`` ?

[16-Dec-19 07:03 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Yes i have did this

[16-Dec-19 07:04 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Can i dm you

[16-Dec-19 07:04 PM] phm87#7395
here is an old documentation <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Creating-New-Assetchain#connecting-to-assetchain-as-a-node>

[16-Dec-19 07:04 PM] pandaanu73#7907
yes i have followed this document

[16-Dec-19 07:05 PM] phm87#7395
for secret stuff yes you can DM me but I prefer to discuss in public to have eyes and contributions of others

[16-Dec-19 07:05 PM] pandaanu73#7907
ok

[16-Dec-19 07:06 PM] phm87#7395
Here is a more recent documentation about launching a smartchain/assetchain <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/creating-and-distributing-a-new-komodo-smart-chain.html#the-process-of-creating-a-new-blockchain-in-the-komodo-ecosystem>

[16-Dec-19 07:13 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if ``listen=1`` should be set in the node whose IP is used in the -addnode= ...

[16-Dec-19 07:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`     -listen     Accept connections from outside (default: 1 if no -proxy or -connect/-noconnect) `

[16-Dec-19 07:21 PM] phm87#7395
<https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/common-runtime-parameters.html#introduction>

[16-Dec-19 07:23 PM] phm87#7395
I've never launched an assetchain/smartchain myself alone ... so I don't know all details of the 2 nodes setup to launch a new one. I'm guessing that (after choosing some ac_param) we need to open the p2p port on each machine and add the ip in addnode for both -addnode=<IP 1> -addnode=<IP 2>, check that each machine can ping the other one through that open port, launch the 2 nodes then mine the first 160 blocks only on one node then try to mine on both nodes.
