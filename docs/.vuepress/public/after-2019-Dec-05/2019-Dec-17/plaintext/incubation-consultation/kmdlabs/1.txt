You tipped @daemonfox **3 KMD**

@LabsAssistant  I can now confirm... pulling the StakedNotary repo from master, and letting it do its thing WORKS except I still used the KMD bootstrap to save time so cant atest to a full sync still.

no prebuilt KMD... let the script do it

and no branch changes for any of it... just push deps, git clone and follow usual steps
