1) covering whole debt with coins and getting deposit back
2) without coins getting back the deposit minus the value of debt in deposit coins at that moment (what happens here when price goes down, the coins were covered then but now depoist is missing for total number of issued coins)
3) if user has partial number of coins for the debt he could return that and get deposit minus the rest of debt in deposit coins (same issue as previous)
2 and 3 could only be done if it doesn't put global ratio in red zone (60% current).","",""
