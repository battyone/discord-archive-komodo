As of now no, it can be retrieved by checking the swap history and searching the swap with the banned pubkey. However it's not so straight-forward. I think I will add a bit more info along with `unban` method implementation requested by `cipi`: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/571#issuecomment-562535247","",""

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/lp_swap/maker_swap.rs#L823
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/lp_swap/taker_swap.rs#L332
Of course we will add more conditions and implement the feature rich reputation system, but the current workaround is sufficient to stop the node from always matching with bad maker having the best price.","",""
