"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","16-Dec-19 03:07 PM","how do you bribe all nodes in the network to accept an invalid timestamp?","",""
"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","16-Dec-19 03:09 PM","it uses a similar mechanism as how timestamps are accepted. if there is a timestamp that is out of range, all nodes would reject it. so if you can bribe nodes to accept a timestamp from next month as valid, then it seems you can bribe the DTO, but that sort of thing isnt possible the way the consensus is done.

you could maybe bribe the source of the datafeed at the api level, but technically what the DTO is reaching consensus on is the value provided by the specified api, so if that api is changing its value, the DTO is technically correct to track that change","",""
"455741312273219595","jl777c#5810","16-Dec-19 03:11 PM","anyway, i am curious as to what attack vectors there are to getting nodes to accept a timestamp one month in the future. since all nodes will reject such a timestamp as being too far from the future, no amount of bribery would work. MITM doesnt make sense in this context. you can ddos nodes from the network, but the ones that remain are still following the consensus rule","",""
