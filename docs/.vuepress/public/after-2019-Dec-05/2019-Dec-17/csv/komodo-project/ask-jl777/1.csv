Maybe seeing an image of the overall process, will help some people process it. Alchemint is a NEO project that issues SDUSD stablecoin, as collateral for NEO. You can be liquidated, or be the one that liquidates someone else. Like I said, I'm not trying to compare the specifics. Just posting so some can use this to visualize the process.
