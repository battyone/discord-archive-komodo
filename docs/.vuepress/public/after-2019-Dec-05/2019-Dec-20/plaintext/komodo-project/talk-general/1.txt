`If anyone wants to help w/ content creation via research/articles/key points and features to cover, I'm all ears.`
@sœÜldat I believe this comment to be sincere. 
It is useful for content creators to hear what the audience would like. 
Personally, I think the NN stuff is too ‚Äòinside baseball‚Äô and there‚Äôs a lot more that will have mainstream crypto interest.

Little bit confused here about NN.

I was also interested in putting me as candidate for future elections and I have read explanations how NN works. But I didn't read anywhere where it stated that NN has to fund Komodo news and tutorials. Where does this rule came from?

Other question how does any VOTE token holders know what the ICT experiences are from all the candidates, do they check there LinkedIn profile?

It's not a rule

Contains all of the "proposals" all applicants submitted for their bid for NN

Generally the ICT (and other skills) experience of candidates is demonstrated via previous activity within the community. Last year, a number of candidates that were highly active in LABS (which has its own NNs for testing new things) won a spot after showing capability. 
There is also a testnet for candidates to participate in prior to elections, which offers a chance to figure things out and show what you can do, both in terms of actual notarisation and with writing code (and sharing it) to help all NNs improve node management etc - https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

Which influence Bakkt has to bitcoin price? If i am right the daily volume on bakkt is physical ? That means, that bitcoins have to buy from bakkt...today volume is  more than 45 million $ (>6000 BTC) but there is no influence to bitcoin price...why that?

[19-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Andersen#8337
No.   It's   paper  bitcoin

[19-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Andersen#8337

Bakkt has bitcoin bulls excited. 

Volume is growing exponentially. From a low base, but growing fast nonetheless.

But what makes Bakkt special for bulls is not its volume, but how many bitcoins are physically delivered.

In November, the number was 17 bitcoins. In Octobe...

[19-Dec-19 04:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
And the whole bakkt seems to be a fake

[19-Dec-19 04:46 PM] Andersen#8337
They  call it  physical  but  traders  settled in fiat.   Sure  it;s  fake

[19-Dec-19 04:47 PM] Andersen#8337
CME  and Bakkt   both  is  true   paper  bitcoin

@artik123  we have similar services in the works, and a couple fiat portals already live ( Netcoins, Bitpanda, Metalpay, Coinmerce, Bitbns , Pungo ) I reached out to them awhile back but they weren‚Äôt offering much then,  I can see if they are more amenable now
