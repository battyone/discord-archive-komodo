[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> PirateOS is a safe and anonynous operating system for running basic functionality at the moment, including VPN and a PirateChain wallet.
More functionality will be built in soon.

[19-Dec-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <+dreamTim> you need to burn it on a USB stick

[dscrd-prt] <Acura> I had already asked Bitpanda about Privacycoins, they have no interest in Privacycoins I was told. Maybe they change their mind, I don't know.

[dscrd-prt] <cdcfff> can I run GS OS on every system via USB Stick??

[19-Dec-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> generally speaking, yes
You might run into some issues with a 1996 Compaq with a Pentium II

[19-Dec-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Llama> @AhmedDhaif93 it is still syncing

[19-Dec-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Llama 6 days its a lot

[19-Dec-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> It's just a discord bot though.

[19-Dec-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> How much time i will wait more

[19-Dec-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> no idea.

[19-Dec-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> last time it was syncing it crashed at 99.8%

[19-Dec-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> so we had to start over

[19-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Llama and there is a web wallet for arrr coin ?

[19-Dec-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> no

[19-Dec-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> web wallets are bad

[19-Dec-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> you could in theory use an exchange but it would be a terrible idea

[19-Dec-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> It is pretty easy to use pirateOcean and use the bootstrap to speed up the syncing process.

[19-Dec-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I'd suggest a major exchange long before a web wallet, myself

[19-Dec-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Llama because a have just a pc 32 bet im afraid off losing the coins if they tell me 25 days for syncing

[19-Dec-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> maybe buy a PC that wasn't made in '93?

[19-Dec-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> bruh chill out ur blood pressure is getting too high @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢

[19-Dec-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <AhmedDhaif93> @Llama my coins is the bot that he is for 6 days dont working

[19-Dec-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> oh you're fine. it might just take 2-3 days

[19-Dec-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> no need to worry about them
