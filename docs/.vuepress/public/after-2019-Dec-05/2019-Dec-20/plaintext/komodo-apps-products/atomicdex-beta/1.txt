Short question to how atomic swap work:
Step 3 - Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>
Takerpayment get locked for the taker and maker can spend it.
Why only the maker can spend this locked fund?

here's a good visual representation - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeavTHz8LSA

"Maker generates a "secret", creates a hash of the secret, and shares this hash with Taker"
If the maker creates the secret to unlock the makerpayment, then the maker can always access his makerpayment or not?

[19-Dec-19 05:33 AM] Audo#5667
The youtube video linked above is outdated. We upgraded the atomic swap process so few of the steps shown on the video are no longer there.

The 5 steps on our documentaiton page are correct & up-to-date

[19-Dec-19 05:39 AM] Audo#5667
_ _

2. Maker sends <makerpayment>
3. Taker now sends <takerpayment>

After this step both of the payments are in a temporary holding address.

There's a shared secret between the two payments, neither party has the full secret. At this stage only the maker can spend the <takerpayment>, and by doing that he reveals his part of the secret to the taker. With that information the taker can claim the <makerpayment>

4. Maker now spends the <takerpayment> (to spend it he has to reveal the secret to taker)
5. Taker now "spends" the <makerpayment>

[19-Dec-19 09:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Goku Hi, maker knows the secret, but he can only refund the maker's payment since there're following constraints (I will define a couple of terms first for more clarity):
0. `Swap secret` - the secret which hash is used to lock the swap payments. `Maker's and Taker's persistent secret keys` - main secret keys derived from seed phrase to which all maker's or taker's coins belong too.
1. Spending maker's payment with Swap secret also requires taker's persistent secret signature so maker just can't spend it.
1. Refunding maker's payment requires not only the timelock to pass, but also maker's persistent key signature.

[19-Dec-19 09:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Audo 
`There's a shared secret between the two payments, neither party has the full secret.` - there's no shared secret, the maker generates `Swap secret` randomly when swap starts so maker's knows the full secret. If there're any mentions of `shared secret` in such sence in our docs these mentions should be  deleted or changed accordingly.

E.g. from UTXO coins AtomicDEX-API code: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L302
There're 2 public keys, `pub_0` signature is required to refund the payment. `pub_1` is required to spend the payment using `Swap secret`.  These pubkeys are Maker's and Taker's persistent pubs (corresponding to their persistent secrets).

@artem.pikulin   @Audo
I think I understand now better.
If the Maker spends the <takerpayment>, Maker will reveal his persistent secret key in this tx and the Taker can extract this second key to spend the <makerpayment>.
Thanks for explaining

[19-Dec-19 12:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@Goku one small correction, the Maker reveals the "Swap secret" when he spends the takerpayment

[19-Dec-19 12:39 PM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
this is the whole process for swaps between utxo coins:
```
----------
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`
A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) Taker Sends <dexfee>

B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2) Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>

A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)  Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>

After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4) Maker Spends <takerpayment>

 A uses the `secret_A`  and claims the KMD revealing the secret 

5) Taker Spends <makerpayment>

B now uses the public `secret_A` to claim the BTC

---
The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and "ease of use"
Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A doesn't reveal the secret `secret_A`

-------------------
```

Pinned a message.

@gcharang
Understand thanks  so far.

Just one thing, how can B create the <takerpayment> so that it can be spend with "secret_A" without knowing the "secret_A"?

[19-Dec-19 12:56 PM] gcharang#6833
both B and A are locking their payments to the other party on condition that the other party knows secret_A
the "knows secret_A" is implemented through a hash lock
A hashes `secret_A` and adds it to the lock
B can see the hash of `secret_A` on the block chain and adds the same hash to lock his payment too

hope I made sense

[19-Dec-19 01:01 PM] Goku#9007
Ah ok, B will reuse the hash of the <makerpayment> lock, that used the hash of "secret_A". I think I understand now the whole process, thankful for the explanation!

there are also the timelocks for return of the coins to their respective owners if the swap fails midway for any reason

Hi, I am unable to get the app to open on my android phone. All I get is a blank screen. Currently using a galaxy S10+

@general_grievous if you have the seed phrase backed up, reinstall the app

[19-Dec-19 01:13 PM] general_grievous#6992
I'll reinstall the app.. I just have Rick and Morty tokens so happy to make a new seed.

AtomicDex is a mobile wallet right? Why is it not mentioned in the rich lists?

[19-Dec-19 04:02 PM] gcharang#6833
which rich list? @CoinKing88

I got some DEX in the Atomic DEX, i used to be on there when i held them in my AGAMA wallet

[19-Dec-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think those richlists are updated very frequently

[19-Dec-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain has no idea what wallet an address is using
