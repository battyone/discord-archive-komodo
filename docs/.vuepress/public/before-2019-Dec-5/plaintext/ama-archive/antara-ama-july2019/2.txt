Is there a plan to have a business consultancy team within Komodo platform

[02-Jul-19 05:15 PM] Daniel CP#2020
As for weaknesses, that's a great question. I'd say our biggest weakness is extreme decentralization! Which might sound crazy. But we have a globally distributed team, with people on 4 different continents, so it's tough to coordinate meeting times and stay in step with each other

[02-Jul-19 05:17 PM] Mylo#8306
Roadmap:  yes there are details to be revealed at & after rebrand.
Past roadmaps: Komodo did not exist during NXT, sure a lot of the technology was planned in those days, which culminated in komodo platform v1.   Basilik mode is a tech question to ask in a dev channel.  I'm not familiar with it.

[02-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Audo#5667
our technology offerings are very wide and that creates few challagnes for us, 1) our tech is little harder to understand, 2) we will have to rely on partners to build industry specific solutions (thus the partner network).

I think of it like this: Komodo is building a 'horizontal' platform and others have to come and build 'vertical' platforms that reach the end customers/use cases.

what is the use case for KMD token/coin

@acidbird   KMD pays for dPOW security and scaling in the KMD ecosystem

[02-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Daniel CP#2020
A few other reasons to hold KMD:

-- you get to participate in the annual Notary Node election, which allows KMD holders to vote for and choose 32 new operators

-- KMD is the primary trading pair for every other listed asset on the upcoming DEX

@tcy "What role does instadbx play in the rebranding"

InstantDEX is now AtomicDEX ... we haven't realeased all the details yet they are still coming. This is our thirdgeneration DEX, much more stable and usable than the previous versions. The new DEX product is part of the rebrand.

[02-Jul-19 05:28 PM] acidbird#7266
@bobtessier nope, usage of their infrastructure, you can check the ama for that.

How would Komodo describe current state of blockchain

[02-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Mylo#8306
KMD has always been a currency within the ecosystem, for ecosystem services.   These services have and are being built out continually.  Currently dPoW, liquidity between assets in the dexfee market.   In the future, the antara modules will be able to utilize kmd for the sidechains that will be created for some features.   At the moment half a dozen building block modules have been built. 
With the ability to add sidechains with purpose built functionality on top of these building blocks (like a token system, gateways to 3rd party chains so they can get tech upgrades by tokenizing onto a kmd sidechain....& any future building blocks). 
There are currently 255 slots for building blocks.   When we need more building blocks, we can add more slots when that time comes.

@acidbird  The scaling features are a new use case for KMD that came with Antara

[02-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Also, @acidbird , what you said  is not true. Komodo is an advanced technology partner of AWS

[02-Jul-19 05:29 PM] TS#7923
@susmech Komodo's financial position is stable. The company was even hiring when BTC was 3k (that's when I joined, hah!). We were maybe the only project expanding during the bear market!

@susmech "How would Komodo describe current state of blockchain"

Good question, we wrote an entire blog post about it some time ago: https://komodoplatform.com/the-promise-challenges-and-evolution-of-the-blockchain-industry/

As a summary, I think most projects are "technology followers" who take what the industry currently perceives as the best technology. They cut and pase an incrementally better solution together as their solution rather than look at the fundamentals and come up with new innovations that could revolutionize the industry.

@acidbird aws has hundreds of tech partners in different industries.
the aws partner network is tiered, and at different levels the partners work together to form new industry solutions.
blockchain tech is a new industry, and komodo is an innovator - so that's where we want to be, creating new industry solutions.

[02-Jul-19 05:43 PM] Mylo#8306
@acidbird hiring process is HR related.   i'm not in HR, however this is how i've seen komodo work with new hires:
 - we will always be ready to collaborate with talented devs with enthusiasm, drive & an exceptional history.   we cannot turn back great devs.   some devs and other techs have approached, and then find their own niche - sometimes it's in kmd, sometimes it's in a related project.  there are dozens of related projects with finite timelines.   and then these devs/techs move onto some other project.   then they drop in & out to fill some technology requirement.
 - when an advert is posted, there is a need to fill a gap for a longer term & hone the skills of the new hire to specific tech or specific new tech usually.   there is a focus on not creating technical debt.  technical debt is not a sustainable way to run a project like kmd, from a HR perspective.

@Vanncoins the role of nSPV is to scale to millions of users.   at release, atomic dex cannot use nSPV because it hasn't been implemented yet.
