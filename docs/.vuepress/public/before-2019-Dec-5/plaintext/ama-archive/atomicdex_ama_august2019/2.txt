@Smedley yes, our business developers and PR experts are actively reaching out to various communities for such collaboration and "DEX-partnerships"

[07-Aug-19 05:17 PM] phm87#7395
I have 3 questions/topics:
1 - if a group of persons wants to add one coin (BTC clone or Dash clone), should the group ask the KMD team to add the coin ? What if the team disagree to add the coin on atomicDEX ?
2 - I heard that the whole backend would be opensource, can you tell me where the repo is ? (maybe code will be released in the future)
3 - (similar question/topic to @Camilo Lopez ) websites such as zigzag.io allows to do trading between offchain (LN) and onchain (BTC, Dash, ...), do you plan to make this happen also on atomicDEX ?

Thx!

@Smedley yes, additionally - like the komodo community will learn how to become marketmakers, other coin communities will learn how to do it so they can effectively use the dex network.   e.g. run the makerbot which is being developed.  an answer in the linked document explains the CEX/DEX liquidity pool

Hi,
Will direct private trading be possible with Atomicdex through private netids created on private nodes (not created on AtomicDEX), or will this feature only be available on the cli version?

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] ca333#0118
@phm87 
1 - are you referring to the mobile application or to an official config integration on the API (mm2) repo?
2 - yes it is available under https://github.com/komodoplatform/atomicdex-api
3 - we are actively exploring other protocols and integration possibilities to improve our DEX technology - there is a prioritisation based on the github issue tickets. I want to invite you to submit this ideas as feature requests and to open the active dev discussion around this topic. We do want to support as many technologies and protocols in atomicDEX as possible.

Thanks, that's a powerful feature.

[07-Aug-19 05:25 PM] phm87#7395
@ca333  
1 - the question can apply to each one I think (I though it was the same backend for both)
2 - thank you
3 - the problem here is that jl777 have some concerns about LN security (in theory he is right, in reality, it was not exploited yet I heard) and I'm not sure that there is a way to do atomic swap securely between LN and KMD (in theory, it is possible but I'm not 100% sure). One idea can be to restrict topology (as jl777 did for CHIPS) to avoid long routes with possible stealers. I'll put some infos on github

[07-Aug-19 05:25 PM] ca333#0118
there are few options to achieve the "private trade" functionality. Using isolated/custom netIDs on UI side or using a pubkey whitelisting logic on the protocol side. The latter is the goal and more clean implementation.

At the moment dex doesn‚Äôt look good from the ux/ui, design point of view + there are bugs and errors in place which are to be fixed i assume.  Looking at dex now i don‚Äôt see many users using it + i am sure we will face liquidity issues (remember first dex which was used by few ppl only and was not popular at all). What is the plan? When are you planning to polish product and make it public? Will the community see marketing plan?

At what stage in the development process would Komodo like to see interested projects join in?

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] ca333#0118
1 - yes the backend is technically the same but the mobile application has the additional GUI layer. 
Adding a new coin to the atomicDEX API repository is trivial for any external party and consists of a simple set of git PRs. This gives any compatible coin native DEX support. For the mobile application listing projects have to reach out to us since this is considered a enduser application/product and being distribution through our official software distribution channels. i.e. we have to validate things and make sure that everything is good. 
3 - technically it is certainly possible to integrate it and to bridge LN<->atomicDEX. However, I do fully share James security concerns.

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the explanations ca333

@CrisF actually now is the right time - it is an official beta which means we still fix and optimize things. This is the stage where we are still able to modify fundamental layers in the DEX core/protocol but also on the UI/UX side and general system architecture and design. If you are around in other coin communities plz do suggest them to join this beta program and to sign up for the beta. The user feedback is the most valuable thing that devs get from a beta program.

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] ca333#0118
you re very welcome @phm87

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, maybe @Audo  could speak with you about this ‚òù

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@acidbird We are currently in phase 1 of our testing. UX/UI and final feature testing and requests will be the focus of phase 3 of testing.

I showed the beta to a wallet dev and a few others this evening.  They had some very good things to say.

We are currently talking to 3rd party coins, projects, and wallet providers. Referrals are welcome at any time.

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] CrisF#3405
And maybe  here too, @Audo . ‚òù

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] acidbird#7266
@Steve Lee and what about timelines? How long phase 1 will last, phase 2 and 3?

[07-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Steve Lee#1967
The goal is to release for general availability once we've met all our testing targets and we have a production ready product with a strong liquidity strategy in place.

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Markus#5464
I like the question asked by someone about private trades, i think it could be a really nice feature for OTC deals. Like lets say u create a "private order" and get a order ID which u then send to the trade taker which then searsh for the order ID

[07-Aug-19 05:47 PM] alperC#7758
Any other questions ? Last chance to get your questions in!

[07-Aug-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
Are u looking for potential exchanges to be partnered with to implement MM2?

[07-Aug-19 05:49 PM] Seko#7408
No question from me. I would like to wish Komodo much success with the DEX and say thank you. Thank you for your tireless efforts.

@Markus we are always looking for new opportunities and partnerships

[07-Aug-19 05:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Markus  yes we are in discussions with a couple interested parties

[07-Aug-19 05:54 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Markus , the private trade feature was in MM1.  It's quite a useful feature for sure.  Glad to hear it'll be back in MM2.
