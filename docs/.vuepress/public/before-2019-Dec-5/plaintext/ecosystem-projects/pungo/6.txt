is pungo wallet safe from this? https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/av7gfi/warning_coinomi_wallet_critical_vulnerability/?st=jsmwvu95&sh=0cb06b77

is pungo wallet coinimi?

[27-Feb-19 03:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I am not a coder, and i have pungo wallet installed on my android. So I can assume it is safe since it is not coinomi wallet :D

[04-Mar-19 08:11 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
no, it's not based on coinomi thanks for sharing @Gordon Komodo saw it last week too

[04-Mar-19 08:11 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
sorry was bit busy at MWC

[04-Mar-19 08:12 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes it's safe, we forked some months ago from early versions of agama mobile

[04-Mar-19 08:12 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !
