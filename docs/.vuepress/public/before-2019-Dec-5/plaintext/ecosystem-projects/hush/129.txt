[21-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh also, we could give people instructions how to download the web wallet, and how to use a few different insight servers, right? That would avoid everybody relying one website

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `a crypto exchange site can't stake users coins, only the amount they have made from trade percentage fee and withdrawals transactions.`
That's a complete fallacy

[22-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com Agreed. Not ur key not your coins.
 I feel exchange can stake coins. Lot people thing exchanges work for free, they margins are small yet need to keep up with security updates + 1000 checks.
They need to make a living. I studied 90% coins TS delisting and to be honest, less then 10% TS pull a bad move(Like KNT fees). But I still say the community should have use the transfer function and get out the coins. There devs(Tradesatoshi) are not smart people/ lazy, if wallet don't compile, they don't care to find out how. Crex24 still way better, lot scam coins they list but user responsibility to research.
The devs leaves default settings (Staking on), so I cannot really accused TS for stealing. So on TS am neutral still. Will love to hear TS comment about the above. Will I trade on TS, limited, I don't trust them with my money.
