[19-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <5indians> @dukeleto  donate bounty to radix42

[19-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> 0.0007 BTC at current price, is the most that can be mined per day

[19-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ahhh
_doesn't do BTC_

[19-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> is just a stat for reference : )

[19-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> KMD would be a better reference üòõ

[19-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> or HUSH

[19-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> or DogShitX

[19-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> fine, just under 5 KMD, if you get all it for the day : )

[19-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> (that's calc'd from the sell side on DP )

[19-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> why sell it, anyway
why not hodl for the dividends?

[19-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> so it's good while it lasts

[19-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> agreed, i wouldnt sell if i was getting it

[dscrd-hush] <penguin> bigmassive !

[19-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> nah, that's guppy $

[19-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> best as I can tell, it takes 150k+ to stake worth a dam

[19-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> with OUR ?

[19-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> multiple inputs is winning for me

[dscrd-hush] <penguin> `waits eagerly for airdrop`

[19-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> well, all I am 100% certain of is that the same staking method I use for MGNX doesn't work for OUR

[19-Apr-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> ahk, is mgnz actually a functional coin? i saw it on your pool then it was gone

[19-Apr-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> was going to mine a bit but couldnt find much about it

[19-Apr-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> it's functional, ~~but I took it down because I don't see it going anywhere~~ edit:seems I didn't remove it, it's still there :P
the chick that started it left and no one in the MGn community that it spawned from has any tech knowledge or real care about moving away from MGN masternodes

[19-Apr-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> ah ok, ye had thought as much as well - far too much bloated expectations floating around

The @MyHushTeam is aware that @Cryptopia_NZ has $HUSH trading paused and withdrawals are stuck, we are watching the situation and this is why the $BTCH snapshot date was pushed back to 1st Feb 2018 at Noon UTC.
It's all going to be OK people! üòå

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just wanted to give you all a blast from the past, that pic was from a meme contest we had

[20-Apr-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Ok. I was a bit confused

[20-Apr-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> look at the date

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _is 25% of all hashrate according to miningpoolstats_
that's just sad

[20-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> This is just too smart for us

[20-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> The public want pretty wallets in which we have no idea how they work

[20-Apr-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @dukeleto, I love how in the whitepaper how you note that the stolen funds from the Cryptopia double spend attack remain in the founders reward wallet. All that effort taken to perform that double spend attack was for nothing. Bad guys lost out with this Hush 3 upgrade. lol

[20-Apr-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dog-_-> well , now that we are KMD and not ZEC , is cryptopia gonna open trades?

[20-Apr-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised karma exists on the blockchain, too. But I will add, the attacker *did* steal BTC from Cryptopia, so they didn't do *all* their work for nothing. The attacker made the exchange doing 95% of HUSH volume stop trading, so they shot themselves in the foot and the HUSH they stole was no longer liquid enough to sell

[20-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> 14% of total btc is a lot

[20-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> on cryptopia

[20-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @longasleep 14% of what from where? what is this coming from?

[20-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> Currency 86% secured, 14% haircut processed. Deposits and Withdraws enabled.

[20-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> 14% was stolen of cryptopia there btc

[20-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> back then

[20-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> directly from there site

[20-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> could be worse could have had ethereum on cryptopia

[20-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> Currency 0% secured, 100% haircut processed,

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @longasleep are you talking about cryptopia as a whole, or just Hush? is there a direct link?

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> cryptopia as a whole

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> you said they did steal btc

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> so i went to check how much üòÑ

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ah, ok

[20-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> they havent checked yet how much of a haircut the hush deposits get

[20-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes, in a double spend attack, the attacker gets back both things they attacked with

[20-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> might be 0 % might be 100%

[20-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <longasleep> true

[20-Apr-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So the attacker gets the BTC and HUSH involved in the attack

[20-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crupti> Still same Equihash with Hush 3?

[20-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crupti yeah, i think i need to put that in the WP

[20-Apr-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crupti> Lockpool is coming up anytime soon?

[20-Apr-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Crupti yes, it's planned, hellcatz is traveling, rough timing

[20-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> LuckPool helped a lot with figuring various stuff for mining pools

[20-Apr-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crupti> kk, thanks üòÉ

[20-Apr-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Question of the day:
How high on the rich-list of a given coin must one be to be thought of as "a whale"?

[20-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are definitions

[20-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i haven't seen it defined that way, what I have seen is that at least 500 BTC is considered a "BTC whale"

[20-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool first page of the rich list, i think is the general rule üòÉ

[20-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not on first page? work harder

[20-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> On coins I value, I'm anywhere from #15 to #1800, so I'm always curious as to what people think and I'm usually saddened by the answers because most of them usually revolve around USD equivalency

[20-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have paid out all bounties related to the whitepaper, if you didn't get it, I lost your message

[20-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> so if I use swing wallet 0.72.2 beta and I see my HUSH in a t1xxx address there, is that what I want to see?
Or are the 'new' HUSH in another chain and accessible via another wallet?

[20-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> don't use an old SWING wallet

[20-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <LocoMB> I have privkeys for old t1 adresses- can I access the new HUSH3 with those?
