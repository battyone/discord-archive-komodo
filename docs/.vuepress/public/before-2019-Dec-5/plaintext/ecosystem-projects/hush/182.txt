[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and many more fine-grained questions like that

[08-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can rank coins by their shielded transaction % or absolute count

[08-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Which coin has more shielded transactions?" can be answered

[08-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on a rolling basis, all the time

[08-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without horrible backend nightmares

[08-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is probably how we want to do CI for making binaries/etc

[08-Aug-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Cool.

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But why would you want to know which one has more shielded txs?

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Wouldn't you want to keep that private?

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi there is constant debate-to-the-death about the topic

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's all some people ever talk about

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and there is no good data

[08-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That makes sense then

[08-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Good credible verifiable source

[08-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is not private data

[08-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's really annoying to calculate

[08-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Is it for the academics, grad professors?

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Privatoshi where are you from?   Are you new here?

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is how you compare privacy against coins. I am not sure how to explain it more. This is a measurement of actual privacy

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Versus a complete lack of privacy

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No, that's enough Duke

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I get it

[08-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It does not reveal private information. Just summarized stats

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Ahhh I see

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It allows us to see if people are actually using zaddrs

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the exact degree of their use

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Good credible data

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Prove use case

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> With pretty graphs/etc

[08-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I am a citizen of North America

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So what does the data say about hush so far?

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And I have known about Hush for I'd say, over 2 years

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi if you had a question about the actual use of it, I am sure many others did too. I am often so deep in the internals it's hard to decide which layer to describe things at

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe 6 months before the BTCH fork

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's still in development and no stats have been gathered yet. Still coding the logic to decide how to count all the stats

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Then you and I are here about the same time

[08-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice to meet you

[08-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I just haven't been "here"

[08-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I have always liked Hush tho

[08-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Unique privacy project

[08-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Are you a dev?

[08-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The messenger is legit

[08-Aug-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I see that one piece of tech making it damn near a good mobile privacy crypto, and I can't say that about many others

[08-Aug-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No I'm not .
I'd like to move in that direction tho

[08-Aug-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I mention mobile bc it is the main platform for users worldwide. It has shifted to mobile. But people avoid privacy & mobile, for good reason too

[08-Aug-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @AkiraX Are you a dev?

[08-Aug-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> No

[08-Aug-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm just a troll

[09-Aug-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Sometimes I mine

[09-Aug-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763

Looks like @coinbase is going to auto-liquidate all $ZEC owned by UK customers, and close accounts!
This adds massive sell pressure to Zcash the short-term, in addition to the pressure of new Equihash ASIC owners (A9++/Z11) trying to pay off their rigs. https://t.co/alqK4Z...

[09-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Gonna be a rough month for ZEC hodlers, if all UK customers are forced to sell

[09-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also means, Zcash is not viable with current UK laws

[09-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Meaning Zcash only got into bed with the US gov, not other govs

[09-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Didn't pay their tax

[09-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so, other govs treat them like just another rando shady company, which they are

[10-Aug-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> There is a crypto that has an Android app that has secure messaging

[10-Aug-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> FortKnoxster

[10-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice

[10-Aug-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I honestly think these are our competition

[10-Aug-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bc they are offering what they call secure messaging

[10-Aug-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm wondering how secure it actually is.

[10-Aug-19 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I believe in ZK

[10-Aug-19 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> With privacy, you shouldn't make trade offs, you want the best. And, even that will have flaws. There is no one privacy project with endless amount of resources, ie. money & intelligence.

[10-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I didn't know this was available yet.
Released 10 days ago.
It's Haven, from OB1, OpenBazaar...

So a few guys built DarkMarket, in response
to seizure of Silk.... They later abandoned it 
and a new team took over, created OpenBazaar 
as an online marketplace, and Haven as mobile.

You can store ZCash in it, too. Man.

You guys know bout this? @dukeleto 

Also has secure messaging

[10-Aug-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe HUSH can get in that wallet?

[10-Aug-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The only reason I listed these other projects, is too know what else exists, and see how best HUSH can benefit from it.

[10-Aug-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The work done here is top notch & very much appreciated

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This marketplace accepts ZCash

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi thanks for the good info. I have heard of Loki and talked to one of their devs a long time ago. Haven't heard of Haven or Fortknockster

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have heard of OpenBazaar

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is what it is

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Mobile version

[10-Aug-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm about to install it

[10-Aug-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They recently added Zcash, a few months ago. If they are open to supporting other coins, I am open to helping add Hush

[10-Aug-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'll email them, if that's okay

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi sure, you are our Outreach Coordinator ðŸ˜ƒ

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, FortKnockster gives me immediate red flags

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> When I learned to write long research papers, the first thing I had to do was source the subject. Find everything available on the topic. That's all I'm doing here

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's not open source

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No github

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's does me as well

[10-Aug-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the BCT  ANN is abandoned
