[05-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I need help to figure out what I need to do. I have my seed and my Private_keys for my Hush but I never converted it over to HUSH3 and I am using an agama wallet from like Mar 2018. What are my first steps to even know if my balance is still mine?

[05-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

How to Generate new address quickly?
Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)

Alternative method to generate new address
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

How to send funds to the new address?
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2. You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

Where to send funds?
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

[05-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> So go to the first link check Assets fro KMD, however mine is HUSH so click the convert link and convert my Hush to Hush3? Is there a way to check my HUSH balances by address or do I need to convert all 40?

[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Thank you.

[05-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> There are various options available, see pinned items in this channel

[05-Jun-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I was able to go to https://wallet.myhush.org/ enter my seed and create new private Key dump and now I have a private Keys and address text file. I understood my risk on using this method. I was also able  to verify my balance. What should I do from here?

[05-Jun-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <wd40> @Flash now You can download full node desktop wallet generate new addr/privkey and then transfer your founds from current to new one

[05-Jun-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> the full node is the one in Github? Its CLI wallet?

[06-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash I am not sure exactly what you are doing. You need to move all funds that touched agama to a new address not controlled or touched by agama. The web wallet is the easiest and is a good temp solution

[06-Jun-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> see pinned posts, too

[06-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't lightly recommend web wallets, but the web wallet is considered safer than Agama currently, by a long shot

[06-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> @dukeleto I used the web wallet to create new addresses and just asked what else I should do. Guide said web wallet was not best solution for large holding gs

[06-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> true, but Agama is trying to steal your money, so that is worse 😃

[06-Jun-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash you need to send funds from Agama to your new web wallet address starting with R...

[06-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the web wallet gives you a bunch of addresses by default, I think 10 or 20 ?

[06-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> My agama is from Feb 2018, I had not logged into it since can't remember. Is it still current

[06-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which version?

[06-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your old agama might not be able to connect to current servers, unfortunately

[06-Jun-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Trying to load up now. Looks like v0.2.0.27c

[06-Jun-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not going to work

[06-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> did you use it in lite mode or full mode?

[06-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> So by setting up my new private keys with the new R addresses I am still at risk

[06-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You need to move funds out of agama or you are still at risk

[06-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I want to say lite mode

[06-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, lite mode is most common

[06-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, you want to use Verus Agama I believe

[06-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Okay, I can download and start the move

[06-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash look at our pinned posts, download the newest Verus agama, and send all funds to that new address from Verus agama (there are also 2 other agama versions that would work, but Verus agama seems to be the most used)

[06-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your seed phrase from regular Agama will work in Verus Agama, but the whole point is to send all funds out of that address

[06-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Most used means better chance at support😀

[06-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so make a new wallet + seed phrase, write down the address, then log out, use your OLD seed phrase, and then send a transaction with ALL FUNDS to your new address. There is a little "all" button you can click to make it easy

[06-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Do I need to save the .dat file from old agama wallet?

[06-Jun-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and make sure to backup your new seed phrase on paper

[06-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash never delete a wallet.dat, just in case. Back them up, maybe give them more useful names, like old_agama_wallet.dat

[06-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Always have backups. Just need to find the .dat file

[06-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good luck, sorry for the pain. Hackers gonna hack, I guess. We are learning a lot from this experience

[06-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this will make GUI wallets in our ecosystem more secure, this incident. Many things will change because of this

[06-Jun-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Various other cryptocoins have contacted me, concerned for their own wallets. And they very much have reason to be concerned

[06-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> So if I used the https://wallet.myhush.org/  and created my Hush3 addresses and they showed a balance then I can guess I have not been hacked yet but should proceed immediately with your instructions

[06-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> Also did not find a wallet.dat file for the old Agama, Looked in AppData and found the Agama folder but no wallet.dat

[06-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lite mode wont' have a wallet.dat, sorry for the confusion

[06-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash did you ever use Agama? it's only if the funds were in agama that there is anything to do

[06-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if  you just have funds in our web wallet, and never used Agama, you are safe

[06-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> No worries just glad you had a few minutes to chat. I downloaded Agama last year to check my balances, I had to follow directions to add the Hush coin to the wallet and that was it.

[06-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everyone DO NOT USE `https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/`, it's been compromised. All your funds will be drained upon logging in 😿 . The Hush web wallet is not affected by this

[06-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh what a fun week

[06-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto Is Verus dangerous?

[06-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I just checked my addresses with the Dexstats link and it shows HUSH3 and BTCH balances that are exactly matching my records.

[06-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <yefuchen> thanks for the warning 👍

[06-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein in what way?

[06-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto  Unsafe to use and/or leave funds in?

[06-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein I don't trust Agama source code much anymore, regardless of which project has it. Currently Verus Agama is considered safe, but that could change. Full node wallets are safest, and those that don't use nodeJS are much safer

[06-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> @dukeleto is superman on this save your Hush front. So glad to see the engagement and concern

[06-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just trying to do my best to help people protect their funds

[06-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's pretty much my job, I think

[06-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The Hush web wallet works differently than the KMD web wallet

[06-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> probably a good time for a story around the fire

[06-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD web wallet talks to electrum backend servers, but HUSH web wallet talks to our insight explorer API

[06-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are actually very very different codebases

[06-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So that, at least, makes me sleep better

[06-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the HUSH web wallet does use Javascript tho, it's not immune to this kind of hack

[06-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it changes very very rarely, is one thing it's got going for it

[06-Jun-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hackers go for codebases that constantly change, because that is where you are most likely to get your malware code added

[06-Jun-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> The Agama wallet recommendation on https://myhush.org/#agama-section is a no go then right?

[06-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They show up as a helpful github contributor, with a new package that solves some bug. Or they actually solve a bug and use their own malware to "solve" it. Once a few projects use this malware, the attacker begins to plan the attack. The attack is time sensitive, because it gives up the game and the attacker will probably have to get their code into a new project all over again. Attackers try very hard and use a lot of energy to not get caught, because getting caught is their biggest source of work. It makes them find a whole new project to inject their malware

[06-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash fuck, yeah we should change that

[06-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Flash> I can create a new wallet on the Webwallet and transfer all my funds from old to new as well right?

[06-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Flash yes

[06-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
