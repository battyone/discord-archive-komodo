[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nice üòÉ

[12-Aug-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã good job üëç

[12-Aug-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yeah, integrating XMR will be very very hard

[12-Aug-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH will be integrated first, almost for sure üòÉ

[12-Aug-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They're working on it

[12-Aug-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But it sounds like a difficult task

[12-Aug-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Or just tedious

[12-Aug-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that `pinhead26` doesn't seem to know much about zec/shielded stuff, the complexity is not for the same reasons as multisig

[12-Aug-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> difficult and tedious, for XMR

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when OB added ZEC, there was only Sprout

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which was slow as shite, and not even an option

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they probably never looked at Sapling

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Duke, you know how some XMR people are?

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> how are they?

[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Can't see past XMR

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Same for many BTC or ZEC people

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I know what you mean

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I like Monero

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I like ZCash

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like Zcash Protocol üòÉ

[12-Aug-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I tend to favor the one that had all the research

[12-Aug-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Not the one that relies on a software that has been routinely had it's nodes reversed....

[12-Aug-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> However, I know it's much more than Tor

[12-Aug-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Pirate uses TOR, right?

[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No

[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Tor is an option to any coin derived from BTC or ZEC

[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not special

[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every Bitcoin fork inherits it for free

[12-Aug-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any coin that advertises Tor support is desperate to say something about their coin. And using TAILS is better than any Tor support for an app

[12-Aug-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some GUI wallets support Tor better than others. SilentDragon inherited Tor support from zecwallet

[12-Aug-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hmm I didn't know that

[12-Aug-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[12-Aug-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Interesting

[12-Aug-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> One of the main reasons I like HUSH over others is, I read a lot, I know history... And HushLists are more important than some might think

[12-Aug-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> With maintaining privacy, It's key ...

[12-Aug-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's unique, valuable & not widely available.

[12-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Most people still haven't heard about it

[12-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I imagine many people who own ZEC on Coinbase wont' hear about it and will get market sold for GBP

[12-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the summer, people are on vacation. Many people bought a bunch of rando coins, they all went down 90%, and they haven't logged into Coinbase in over a year.

[12-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know people like this

[12-Aug-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Yes, I expect the price to half, $25.
I got 25% at $25, 50% at $20 and 25% @ $15.

[12-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If BTC goes on a bull run, it's not going to be pretty for ZEC

[12-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It feels like HUSH has already bottomed, and we bounced off of what miners were willing to sell at. We are slooooowly climbing up again. ZEC/BTC chart truly is in free-fall

[12-Aug-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are nowhere close to the bottom of what ZEC miners are willing to sell at

[12-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I just want to buy $1000 dip, sell $1500. I care less how it plays out. ZEC overprice when it touch $200.
Hush will keep $0.03(10-20% max variance), only miners selling at the moment which I am slowly buying(300 hush daily). But I still feel that $0.1 year end target is on the table for hush, 1.4btc the order book is clean($0.25). I myself not buying since 0.1  btc increases the price by 2x.

[12-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I have my bot scan < $0.03 x 1000+ and then my bot moves and eats it at 300 hush per day.

[12-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM whoa! you are advanced, fine sir

[12-Aug-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Aug-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The best and most profitable time to mine a coin is when hashrate is low and nobody else believes in it

[12-Aug-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can accumulate massive amounts in those times

[12-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Matthias> That‚Äôs like 9,000 per month, not bad at all! I plan on adding some more to my stash soon.

[12-Aug-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
