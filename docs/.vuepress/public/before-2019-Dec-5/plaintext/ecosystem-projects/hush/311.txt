[dscrd-hush] <denio> SDL send your funds with the next Block. Its different then SD. We have no Mempool for SDL, so it needs 1 mined Block to see the transaction

[04-Dec-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sometimes it takes some times to find a block...

[04-Dec-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> did you receive your funds?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz it's more of a social thing. Having these symbolic ID's, which are stored in various DB's and then given out to others to pay, encourages address re-use, similar-looking phishing scams and then provides another "selector" for metadata correlation

[04-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, even vanity addresses have the phishing issue

[04-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Using addresses as few times as possible is best to protect your metadata

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> watching the video now, it's very interesting

[04-Dec-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am literally taking notes watching this YT video and I suggest any others that want to have more privacy in their lives, do the same

[04-Dec-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I know most of it, but she is explaining it all in a very nice way and also I am learning some new stuff. Erinn used to make the Debian packages for Tor, for many years. She knows her shit

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Enjoy, and I highly recommend watching the above video for people that have high privacy needs. Hush is tech that fits in as one piece of a large system, that Erinn explains. And you system is tuned to your threat model, assets and threats.

One of the best ways to currently backdoor an entire cryptocoin is via malicious packages of dynamic languages which are downloaded during the build process. Bitcoin, Zcash, Monero and every fork of those coins use Python in their build + test system. It's only a matter of...

Supply chain attacks against cryptocoin wallets are perhaps the most efficiently monetizable exploit chains that exist, since there is almost unlimited upside for a small investment in time/money/risk.

Only coins with extensive opsec and infosec industry experience will s...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for being an awesome pool and upgrading software on a timely manner üôÇ

someone huge number of HUSH put on KMD at AtomicDEX a couple of weeks ago there were about 2000 thousand coins and now there are about 500 left who sells so many coins at such a low price? Either Hush will die completely or he has nowhere else to fall below, and so the capitalization is extremely low, I think it's some kind of miner selling an electricity bill

[04-Dec-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What you think, is purely speculation..

[04-Dec-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What's your interest? Surely there is a reason

[04-Dec-19 09:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
2000 HUSH is not that much

[04-Dec-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Morning folks

[04-Dec-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> 2K hush isn't a lot nowadays. But could be miners, or people who just bought even for a lower price and taking profit.

[04-Dec-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Who cares, i would care if someone dumped 500.000 hush. That's a problem
