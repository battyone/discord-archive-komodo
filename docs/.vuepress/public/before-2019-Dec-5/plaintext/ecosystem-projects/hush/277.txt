[05-Nov-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> 814 sats now

[05-Nov-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yeah im so jealous of the people that snatched this up at 200 sats

[05-Nov-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> yeah, the best i ever got was around 400 i think

[05-Nov-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> if we go any higher, we'll break through to top 1000 coins on Coinmarketcap, which is just ridiculous in my opinion Hush is way more valuable than that in my eyes

[05-Nov-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> also don't take that as financial advice üòõ

[05-Nov-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> With private messaging on multiple devices, should be a Top 100 coin.

[05-Nov-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> lots of coins in the top 100 which don't have any real use case

[05-Nov-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> any use case is better than none in my opinion

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> At first I was just going to remove VerusHash, but that was too easy, and now I am removing every single verus-specific line of code from our codebase

[05-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This will greatly reduce our "attack surface", since VRSC consisted of thousands of lines of code we have to deal with but never actually runs. It's compiled tho, and that causes so much headache

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If people would just stop using Facebook, they would go out of business. But I see no sign of that happening. People WANT to be surveilled, it seems

[05-Nov-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is for those people that prefer to not have every facet of their lives monetized by pure evil

I developed a website to compare $BTC with any stock traded in USA. It's pretty simple, type an investment you would make and compare the performance of $BTC against the selected stock. I plan to add more functions to interact with my LN Node. Here it is:

[dscrd-hush] <denio> Nice to know for the past but since this is a social sience Modell (I know we  Humanities scientists wants you to believe it's math) it has no meaningfulness for the future

[05-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FtrSaroth> Good morning all! üôÇ

[05-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> It's like saying. Oh the sun is shining we need tommorow no umbrella

[05-Nov-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Nassim Taleb :The black swan... Good lecture to Understand it's most the time nonsense to make future models of such data

[05-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio yes, the past is no recipe for the future. I agree with you *solidly*, in the abstract

[05-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio also, I know many many people that *believe*, in their deepest hearts, that because the US stock market has averaged 8% net profit, year-over-year, for the last 100 years, that it will do roughly the same in the next 100 years

[05-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio sites like the above are very valuable for showing that thinking to be wrong. We can't use it in the future, but we can compare the past up until now. And the USD is failing in all directions

[05-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every commodity, every thing an average person needs to live, keeps going up in USD

[05-Nov-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means each of those things is rising in value, against USD

[05-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Thats true. The currencies "problem" is a very special one...but its not one btc or others will solve

[05-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats a society/political problem in my opinion

[05-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I agree that technology cannot solve all or even most societal problems

[05-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> People need to want to do the right thing, and sometimes that means mega-wealthy people+organizations not getting their profits

[05-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And that reminds me of the saying "It's hard to teach a man something when it's his job to not understand it"

[05-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> this is a nice metapher

[05-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but dont get me wrong...i also believe its a good idea to put some money in crypto

[05-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but if people hope btc will rule the world in terms of currencies...i guess they dont have understand what is "power" and who has this "power"

[05-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> for the moment

[05-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe someday people gets smarter

[05-Nov-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sometimes i get the feeling money makes slaves of us...but then i wake up in my sweet first world home :shush:

[05-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio i don't think BTC solves all the problems of the world. but i do think it's better money that all fiat money printed by any government

[05-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> depending on people's local fiat, protecting against inflation is more/less important

[05-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but the better will not allways win.

[05-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if I lived in Venezuela, I would not keep anything in fiat

[05-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> for sure not

[05-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Paper money isn't real money

[05-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's an abstraction

[05-Nov-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Precious metals and real estate are "real money" but not very liquid and hard to divide

[05-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio I have watched Bitcoin rise from a few pennies to where it is now, so I guess I have a very poor view of USD and fiat in general üôÇ

[05-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 50,000% increase in value or whatever it is, tends to make you a believer

[05-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> the technologie behing btc solved this problems i am totaly with you

[05-Nov-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> they will use it as money in the future i am pretty sure

[05-Nov-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> we have many press articel here in the past months about that topic from very serious financiell press

[05-Nov-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but they will not use btc

[05-Nov-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, the surveillance features of BTC protocol is a dream of all governments

[05-Nov-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes

[05-Nov-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats why i am here

[05-Nov-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> there will be still a market for it

[05-Nov-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> LN has some interesting privacy ramifications, but BTC itself has very very little privacy, if any

[05-Nov-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I try to give credit to all the CoinJoin research that is still happening, i try to follow it

[05-Nov-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But James and I know too well, that defaults matter, and if most of your chain is shedding metadata in all directions, that is a hopeless situation

[05-Nov-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats why your work is very important @dukeleto it will be much more needed then we know today to have a little "privacy" in the future

[05-Nov-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I consider all the Mimblewimble coins, Zcoin Lelantus stuff, Pirate and Hush to be the bleeding edge of the non-Monero privacy world. It's important that everybody branch out and study things in different ways

[05-Nov-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's better in a deep sense of basic research: covering all the nooks and crannies that one team would miss

[05-Nov-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but also: it makes surveillance harder, to have things spread out in many networks that work in different ways

[05-Nov-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can't make things any easier for all these blockchain analysis companies, it's much too easy already

[05-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> did blockchain analysis companies tell everybody official what they are doing exactly? Do we know what they can? I am not so educated here

[05-Nov-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> or did we not know how they operate

[05-Nov-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio it's public knowledge, you just have to look

[05-Nov-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
