[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I was actually treated poorly because I brought this CVE to Pirate, before others. They did not want to hear it!

@dukeleto @ebfull @tweet_stamp Not sure why you‚Äôd call me a turncoat when I was legitimately trying to give you an opportunity to shine.
Seems like this ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been used in a real world case.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> poor Fishyguts should stick to non-code talk

[03-Oct-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, no more early CVE notifications for free!!!! Free Work From Duke Is Now Over.

[03-Oct-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> @dukeleto stop with the lies and twists.. i asked for confirmations and tests to be carried out
too bad you were the only one that had access to this information to break standard security procedures
all this trash talk coming from you is unbecoming

[03-Oct-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> i'm sorry that following procedures and acting responsibly instead of emotionally is "treating you poorly"

[03-Oct-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> your personal attacks and false claims that we asked you to do free work is also unbecoming

[03-Oct-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> if i recall correctly whatever work you did was rewarded and paid for in full, be it original or not

[03-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> while we were busting our heads testing and developing a PoC you were busy "raising awareness" (antagonizing) on social media

[03-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch you are on the wrong discord to give commands, buddy

[03-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You fucked up.

[03-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Didn't protect your users and tried to shot the messenger who told you early, before the world

[03-Oct-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch how is that PoC I was helping you with?

[03-Oct-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That you begged for help with?

[03-Oct-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Is it going well?

[03-Oct-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "following procedures and acting responsibly"

[03-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> oh, he must be one of those "responsible disclosure" crazy people

[03-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Gosh, glad I told Pirate to remove me from their website

[03-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> you were helping me? begged you? don't make post your posts

[03-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lulz

[03-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch let's post our private chats with each other

[03-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Like the one where I ask how long you worked in the military and US government?

[03-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @mrlynch don't play these games in Hush Discord.

[03-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am happy to tell the world I am 80% sure you work for the US Government

[03-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Go ahead and prove me wrong.

[03-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> lol

[03-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> you're delusional buddy

[03-Oct-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> you give twisted meanings to words to suit your fantasies

[03-Oct-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> good luck

[03-Oct-19 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <mrlynch> have a good life and keep shouting the loudest.. i'm sure it will work out just fine

[03-Oct-19 10:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
oh, i missed that `"responsible disclosure" crazy people` yes, it's crazy to actually protect your users by not announcing potential malicious parties of a bug before you fix and test

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good morning from üá∫üá∏

[03-Oct-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> But i thought fishy was the fed plant ü§î.  Holy shit what if they both are feds? Who's the fed in here anyway?

[03-Oct-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> But if the govt is paying people to work on kmd ecosystem projects, I support the initiative. glad to see my hard earned taxpayer dollars at work.

[03-Oct-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Taxes on my house just got adjusted to over $10,000 annually, it's the only logical reason for the increase ü§∑üèº

[03-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Berg Go work for a government and you will get your taxes back.

[03-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> pay just $833/mo and you too can rent land from the govt!

[03-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Sell a house and you'll be tax free!

[03-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> I'm up to about 7k/yr now on my place. I feel u @Berg

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I don't even have trash pickup üò¢

[03-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No idea where my money goes lol

[03-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> mortgage and taxes on my house cost more than what I could charge for rent.

[03-Oct-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> You're paying more for house taxes than I earn in a whole year. At least once I am glad i leave in the middle of nowhere.

[03-Oct-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> well the schools are good here and the job market is competitive. but I'm starting to have some real moments of reflection on my financial situation.

[03-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I rent my place and still net a profit luckily üôÇ

[03-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I basically just live rent and mortgage free

[03-Oct-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> So really my tenants pay my taxes, but I still complain üôÇ

[03-Oct-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> I tried having tenants once at another place, never again. closest I get to that now is an occasional airbnb guest when I'm out of town. its much more profitable and way less hassle.

```On October 16, 2018, Commissioner Brian Quintenz of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission explained his belief that smart contract developers can be held liable for aiding and abetting CFTC rule violations if it was reasonably foreseeable that U.S. persons could use the smart contract they created to violate CFTC rules. As is typical, the Commissioner spoke for himself, but it seems likely that his views reflect the CFTC‚Äôs philosophy.```

To identify where culpability might lie, Commissioner Quintenz identified the parties he believes to be essential to the functioning of the smart contract blockchain ecosystem:

the core developers of the blockchain software;
the miners that validate transactions;
the developers of the smart contract applications; and
users of the smart contracts.
