[24-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is very good for you to know, for your financial sovereignty

[24-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> compiling the full node yourself is much safer than using binaries, which are mostly meant as a convenience

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once you have a `hushd` compiled, go to the main SD directory, and run those `ln -s` commands to make symlinks

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I guess I could even make SD look in those places and not even need the symlinks, but they are needed for now

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so this script will work on macOS? ```# Instal new hush3 node from scratch
# Use this method if you get weird compile issues with an existing repo!
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib \
      autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget \
      bsdmainutils automake curl unzip
# Instead of Git, a release can be used as well: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/releases/tag/v3.0.0
git clone https://github.com/MyHush/hush3
cd hush3
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
./src/hushd```

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `brew` can install deps if you need

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you will need to use `build-mac.sh`

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh hold up, i will give you a script to run

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ty!

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh how many cores does your compute that will compile this have?

[24-Jul-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> probably 4 or 6, it's not a big deal

[24-Jul-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> umm 2

[24-Jul-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> its a craptop

[24-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto

[24-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ðŸ˜…

[24-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, ye must be patient in this build. It might take a few tries, and it could take like an hour or more

[24-Jul-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just as a warning. How much RAM?

[24-Jul-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you need at least 4GB RAM to build hush, komodo or zcash

[24-Jul-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> 8GB

[24-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good good

[24-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 2GB would be no bueno

[24-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am 100% confident about that code, except the homebrew command, which I haven't tested myself

[24-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you might have some of those deps already

[24-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok ill give it a spin

[24-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but building Hush/KMD/ZEC on a mac .... it's a fucking hail mary while juggling flaming chainsaws

[24-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh expect some fun weird errors but we can make it build ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jul-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> radix42 has also been working on recent mac binaries, so future pour souls won't have to go thru all this. And some people will just never ever ever compile software, it's beyond their means. We want to give them financial and communications privacy, too

[24-Jul-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> chmod 644 right?

[24-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But never forget, compiling your own full node and wallet software makes you much more financially independent than people who must trust binaries

[24-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> one sec, will update it

[24-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `chmod 755 build-hush-mac.sh; ./build-hush-mac.sh`

[24-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh that should get it going

[24-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it tries to do the homebrew command, hopefully that works

[24-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> getting the dependencies installed correctly is harder than getting it compiled correctly

[24-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> OK

[24-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> she's off and running

[24-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok it finished

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lolwut

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh if it finished something is wrong ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my "SUCCESS" message might not be correct

[24-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh can you past the output to a github gist?

[24-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some dependency or the homebrew command probably failed

[24-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we could try commenting out the `brew` command and running it, might get further and tell us a specific dependency that is missing. Compiling things and making binaries ain't ever easy. It's very messy.

[24-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And Zcash source code was never designed to run on anything but Linux, it always needs lots of work to update the latest Zcash stuff to work on Windows and Mac

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so there is constant fixing and changing on the win/mac side of things

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok so what do i do now?

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> show me the output somehow

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ``output to a github gist`` ?

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pastebin?

[24-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> github gist is just a pastebin for coding nerds

[24-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Put the output of the script onto https://pastebin.com/ or similar, or paste here if it's very short

[24-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is how I gave you the script above

[24-Jul-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `./build-hush-mac.sh &> output.txt` and paste all of output.txt to somewhere publicly accessible ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jul-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it could be 5 lines out output, or 5000, I have no idea

[24-Jul-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> it failed here:

[24-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmm

[24-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> C compiler not working?

[24-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, at least you have git installed

[24-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, the `brew install gcc@6` is important

[24-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> does that work? just by itself?

[24-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i need to see the output with the `brew` command not commented out, as well. Sorry I didn't specify

[24-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we want to see why the dependencies are not being installed. The above is expected if you didn't `brew install gcc@6`

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ```Warning: gcc@6 6.5.0_2 is already installed and up-to-date

[24-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok

[24-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `brew tap discoteq/discoteq; brew install flock autoconf autogen automake gcc@6 binutils protobuf coreutils wget`

[24-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> does that command work successfully ? The first `tap` might give an error if it's already `tapped` but we want to make sure every single part of `brew install flock autoconf autogen automake gcc@6 binutils protobuf coreutils wget` works

[24-Jul-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Everyone, welcome to the joy of compiling binaries!!!

[24-Jul-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> running ```./build-hush-mac.sh &> output.txt```

[24-Jul-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ok it stopped again

[24-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, let's see the output

[24-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it seems that you got all the dependencies, that is very good!

[24-Jul-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and make sure to try it in a newly created terminal, because sometimes some .bashrc changes need to take effect

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> there u go, 2 output logs

[24-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh this is where we could maybe route around this damage, and you could use an official KMD mac binary

[24-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i recently made that work

[24-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so what should i do?

[24-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no easy thing for you to do. radix42 is still working on recent mac binaries, there are no recent mac KMD binaries that I can find

[24-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am putting out some feelers to the magic cryptocoin build system Elder Gods

[24-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is why nobody wants to make binaries, it's a lot of work and annoying and never works perfectly on all systems. Very few people specialize in it and are amazingly good at it, like radix42. And this is why it's important to have binaries for users, it really helps them.
