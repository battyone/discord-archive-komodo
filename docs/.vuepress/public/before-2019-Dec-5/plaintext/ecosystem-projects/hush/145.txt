[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Hello community! How are you? I have not been here for a long time. Will we wait for POS BTCH?)

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hi

[07-Jul-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We need a way to grow the commjnity

[07-Jul-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Not everyone has asics

[07-Jul-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cpu miners would be good

[07-Jul-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And staking would be good for btch

[07-Jul-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If we could do something with cryptoconditons

[07-Jul-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Would be good

[07-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> it would also be good to differentiate btch and hush with different featuresets going forward

[07-Jul-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> perhaps hush should focus towards a medical/ compliance aspect where data is secure and confidential and can be sent to multiple recipienets

[07-Jul-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> maybe btch can focus towards some other aspect

[07-Jul-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> maybe btch isnt about messaging

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Welcome demintiger 👋

[08-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @Marketing   I think you should create a scavenger hunt type of game where the clues are given via private messaging.  And you win a big prize at the end

[08-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not a bad idea

[08-Jul-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody has had problems syncing the Hush network, please try again!
I fixed an issue with our seed node, that helps new nodes find connections/blocks
If you had issues, just try again. If they persist, please let us know!!!

[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @dukeleto sent @heguli97 **50.00 HUSH** (≈ $3.00).

[08-Jul-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for pointing out we had connection issues and helping me debug

[08-Jul-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mucho appreciated

[08-Jul-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Going forward, we will have more than 1 custom addnode, 3 or 5 would be nice, and Hush will have custom DNS nodes too

[08-Jul-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Thanks! 🤓 :hush_white:

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Good evening friends :hush_white: 🇻🇪

[08-Jul-19 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Howdy, can anyone tell me the inflation rate of HUSH?

[08-Jul-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Eldero  It's currently 12.5 Hush about every 2 and a half minutes so around 7200 Hush a day or 2.6 million Hush a year until the halving happens in about 560 days or so. Also current supply is 6.7 million Hush.

[08-Jul-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> @heguli97  Thank you... So roughly how many years would it take until the 21,000,000 cap is reached?

[08-Jul-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm not sure since i'm pretty sure hush has a similar halving curve to bitcoin so it could be 100 years. Someone more knowledgeable can correct me if i'm wrong

[08-Jul-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eldero i can answer that

[08-Jul-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's described in our recent whitepaper a bit as well

[08-Jul-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> I must have missed that part. I literally read through it 2 hours ago.

[08-Jul-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Great, thanks.

[08-Jul-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Eldero in about 30 years, 21M coins will be reached

[08-Jul-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then after that, miners will only receive transaction fees

[08-Jul-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is how it works currently

[08-Jul-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at block 5422111 block subsidy goes to 0

[08-Jul-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> So you intend to maintain mining.

[08-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't have firm plans for 30 years out, transaction fees might be large enough to sustain miners, or maybe something will change

[08-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have yet to hit our first halving

[08-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Of course. Very good.

[08-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is a very good time to mine Hush, it's the best time, before any halvings

[08-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It will never be this profitable to mine Hush ever again, once block subsidies half a few times

[08-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How did you hear about us eldero?

[08-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has an extremely fair halving schedule, like Zcash and Bitcoin (it's basically the same)

[08-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 4 years to mine before a halving, that is pretty awesome

[08-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> I wish I had a rig. But I shall buy HUSH instead once I can figure out what BTC is going to do next.

[08-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Sounds good.

[08-Jul-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> @AkiraX Through my own search scrolling through coin market cap. I've had HUSH on my list nearly 2 years. Shame about the Cryptopia event.

[08-Jul-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm always interested on what other people see hush and how it got their attention

[08-Jul-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> But HUSH has the potential to return to it's highs in time I believe.

[08-Jul-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> It looks like a quality privacy coin with a good team who continues to work.

[08-Jul-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> So yeah, I'll be getting some.

[08-Jul-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> Looking forward to seeing future developments.

[08-Jul-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com) How many of those physical hush are still needed to be sold in order to send to manufacturing?

[08-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eldero> @AkiraX Thank you... I generally only follow small cap coin. BTC and QTUM are the only large caps I have an interest in at the moment... What about you?

[09-Jul-19 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm just a miner.  I'm not too technical.
