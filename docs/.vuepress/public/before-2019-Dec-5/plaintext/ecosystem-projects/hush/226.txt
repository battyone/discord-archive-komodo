[dscrd-hush] <Hember> @denio , I have never uset Github to opload a .ts file from it to open in Qt Linguist. How do I save the file?

[17-Sep-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you need a free Github account, first

[17-Sep-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> I went used a guide to create a github account, created a readme, a branch and a pull request and merged. Still I can't spot a "save to your computer" anywhere.

[17-Sep-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> I have an account now.

[17-Sep-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "cloning" is saving locally

[17-Sep-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `git clone ...`

[17-Sep-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Ok

[17-Sep-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you can use Github Desktop

[17-Sep-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> It seems there isnt a cloning option for me to save SilentDragon/res/zec_qt_wallet_template.ts. But I would neet to open it in QT linguist, am I right?

[17-Sep-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Hmm, it seems that I haven't got the authentication to clone the template.ts

[17-Sep-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> So if someone could give Hantulio the power of cloning, I could start translating it tomorrow morning. Now it is 1:10 am here so I need to give my eyes a rest.

[17-Sep-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Never mind. It's working. ðŸ™‚

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe one day atomicdex will be in those stats

[17-Sep-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it feels like privacy coins being delisted from some exchanges has given the whole sector a boost

[17-Sep-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hember> Had to take a look at the file. Finnish grammar differs from English quite a lot. I think I need to download the App and play with it for quite a while to understand which endings and forms I will be using. But that'll be tomorrow. ->

[17-Sep-19 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh I have been informed that the AtomicDEX info on our website is now out of date, would you like to update it and add some screenshots?

[18-Sep-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Indeed, HUSH is available since yesterday on AtomicDEX.  An update of our website is necessary.  I'm taking care of it.

[18-Sep-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> awesome

[18-Sep-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Just notice a critical flaw in AtomicDEX. :shush:

[18-Sep-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not exactly

[18-Sep-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> komodo ecosystem coins use dpowconfs, so they wait for notarizations. other coins can indeed be double spent if enough resources are used, but the economic cost to double spend a single swap makes it a non-economic attack. just dont swap 100 BTC without setting it to wait for enough BTC confirmations

[18-Sep-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> anyway, this is why we say dont swap large amounts during the beta

[18-Sep-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c its unconfirmed, but the kmd I got was confirmed before the above

[18-Sep-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> artem.pikulinToday at 03:49
Also worth to add that only spending transactions are left unconfirmed, in more details:
1. Maker sends payment, taker waits for this payment to be confirmed so double spending is prevented here.
2. Taker then sends his payment, maker waits until this payment is confirmed before attempt to spend it.
3. Only then maker is spending taker's payment revealing the secret and taker spends maker's payment.
@ITM Only the spending stages are left unconfirmed in this case, the inputs being spent on this stage are hash-timelocked so other side won't be able to spend the transaction until timelock conditions are met (few hours).

#Hush welcome to the #AtomicDex from the @KomodoPlatform.

A successful atomic swap of $KMD / $HUSH.

It's really easy and an important step for mass adoption.

[18-Sep-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @ITM any luck in deanonymizing PIRATE?

[18-Sep-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I was able to chain the z-tx1 to z-txn - 1.
no amounts ðŸ˜¦

[18-Sep-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so I can tell if z-tx2 came from z-tx1, and z-tx1 depends on miner block n

[18-Sep-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> All I got was:
Let say z-address transaction 1 you received 100 ARRR
now z-address transaction 2 you received another 50 ARRR
Now you spend it. z-address transaction 3.
Now I doing reverse proof. Don't submit tx1 and tx3 fails the proofing. Don't submit tx2 and tx3 fails the proofing.
So Now I can say for sure say tx3 depends on tx1 and tx2

[18-Sep-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> but I will not know tx3 amount and who tx3 belongs to

[18-Sep-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So I am now building meta data(A lot of meta data)

[18-Sep-19 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so using digital price, graviex and tradeogre.

[18-Sep-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So far I got to know who transfered from Tradeogre to digitalprice, digitalprice to Tradeogre , but graviex people are not withdrawing as much ðŸ˜¦

[18-Sep-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so my transaction are still unspent

[18-Sep-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> as long as the transaction are unspent, the privacy is intact.

[18-Sep-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c

[18-Sep-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> sometimes Tx are multiple spends, which is harder to trace. So my theory is that sending multiple z-address that are not the same is harder to reverse or understand

[18-Sep-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So far PIRATE winning ðŸ˜› , Hush is easy to decode.

[18-Sep-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> When I get time, I want to setup a mini project to do meta leaking. So Let say you your wallet is syncing still(you spend z-address tx1 10 ARRR earlier)
Now when the user attempts to spend some coins(Balance is 90), the daemon is stupid and will attempt to use tx1 again. Now I have 2 distinct proofs.
Silent Dragon now handles it perfect (Thanks to Duke). Most nodes will reject the transactions, my node will say hmm double spend and 2 different hash(transaction id's)

[18-Sep-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so now I got 2 different proofs to work with that attempts to create distinct results and valid.
Like X + Y = 3, now no one will now what X and what's Y.
Now comes the second proof. 2X + Y = 4. 
Now I can set the huge equation to be equal and solve for sapling params. Leaking huge amount of information about the address and other transaction related to that proof. 
Well its a theory I am working towards. So if a small leak like that, I can then finally determine the address and the amounts ðŸ™‚

[18-Sep-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> but it does not break or deanonymize PIRATE, only foolish people that leak meta data or attempts a double spend by mistake.

[18-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> the equation of sn-snarks are huges and completely maths. So I am getting there and understanding the maths. Learning curve.

[18-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @ca333 ITM made the first way to extract information out of ztransactions, even z->z !

[18-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> even making a dependency graph seems to be a breakthrough and any optional zaddr chain will very quickly have amounts and dependency graph deanonymized

[18-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> its related to notes that duke pointed out. which help greatly.

[18-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c I am working towards presentation of nodes in 3d. Learning Data virtualization using python. Fun things.

[18-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> for atomic swaps with zaddr, we will need to allow z->t (p2sh atomic swap) and t -> z, so the amounts of that final -> z will be known. it seems from that half public address a z -> z to another address is needed. but is that even enough. what will be needed to break all linkage if we start with the atomic swap t -> z

[18-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Cannot wait, more data to play with.

[18-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So t-Address to z-address, one will only know the transaction(Actually note proof but easier to refer it to transaction id)

[18-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> z-address to z-address using reverse proofing

[18-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think if we have the following, it will be hard to get much useful info:
zt is the destination t -> z address, z0, z1, z2, ... are other zaddr
so if funds in zt -> z0 during intervals and z0 -> z1 or z2 in intervals and then z1 and z2 send back to z0 in intervals, this looping back i think will confuse your tracking, especially if the amounts being sent from z0/z1/z2 are randomly selected

[18-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> z-address to t-address will then leak everything

[18-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> yes, it will mess it up

[18-Sep-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so more transactions goes through, the harder it gets

[18-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> since reverse proofing will require more combinations and swapping of tx to generate a invalid vs valid proof.

[18-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so funds would need to be sent to zt, and only atomic swap from zt. then post process the zt funds to z0/z1/z2 with loops

[18-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so by doing it random will mess up my tracking completely

[18-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @mrlynch some super important privacy implications

[18-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> basically JUMBLR logic applied to the zt funds will be needed

[18-Sep-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> since if transaction goes to 10million, it will take years to reverse and lot of computation resources

[18-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> will not be feasible at all

[18-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, so if we have z0, z1, .. z99 and at each step it sends a random amount to a random address

[18-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this will create loops and the random amounts will rapidly make any estimate of the value in a proof very fuzzy

[18-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and before atomic swapping z0/z99 -> zt

[18-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not sure if that is enough, i guess having a new zt per atomic swap would be best, but not sure that is practical

[18-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> end of the day, its all about computation resource cost

[18-Sep-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> 8!  vs 20! is huge

[18-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, and if a user node is creating a new zaddr per swap, very soon their node will bog down.  i think just treating zt as a taddr and then jumbling it up afterward with z0/z99 will make it cost prohibitive.

[18-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> currently people are using and spending there z-address slowly, so the steps are easy and about max 9! at the moment. Like 400 000 hush proofs. Which on a couple gpu its quick.
Using random will just move it to 10! so more proof to reverse

[18-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but we do need to make a distinction between atomic swap derived zaddr and pure zaddr without such contamination

[18-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> with 100 addresses that are randomly sending random amounts to random addresses, isnt it approaching 100! ?

[18-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> no,

[18-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so 100 random sending per block, if all comes from distinct previous address and just 1, it will be the same

[18-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> only by increasing the outputs causes issues

[18-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> z_sendmany of 100
