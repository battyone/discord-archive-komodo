[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe atomicdex will solve that sometime

[26-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But that means we need to provide an incentive for people to use AtomicDex

[26-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Atomicdex is still in very early stages.

[26-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It works, too.
I tweeted a swap

[26-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think it would do us good to get volume on KMD/HUSH

[26-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I know it works. But we need to provide more options then just point at AtomicDEX

[26-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Look at Pirate. Altsbit, ARRR/KMD does 2 BTC daily

[26-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bc of miners

[26-Nov-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Expanding our availability is important

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think the only CEXs worth paying for, are KuCoin, Bittrex and Binance

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> All of the rest are mediocre.

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But cost 3 btc

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> If you have a product but you can buy it only at a 2 stores in the world. You're not going to be succesful

[26-Nov-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I agree. Exchange listings are the biggest scam ever

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If you have it at ten stores, but not at a good price, then nobody will buy it either

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I hate exchanges for that reason

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Me too

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Price is not something we can provide. It simple supply and demand.

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Maybe as a team, we can start using atomicdex

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> No, I meant arbitrage

[26-Nov-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I mean the spread

[26-Nov-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> no, you are right @Captain more liquidty would be nice. But lets be honest...pay marketmaker isnt a good way...pay useless exchanges too

[26-Nov-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Can we say as a team, that we will try to use AtomicDex, and get some volume on there, at least?

[26-Nov-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> as "half team member" i say: i wont sell my hush ðŸ˜‰

[26-Nov-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Okay :)

[26-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I am not official part of the Hush team:shush:

[26-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Anyhow, who's managing the exchange listings?

[26-Nov-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> i guess its @Berg

[26-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Captain But do you consider yourself part of the team?

[26-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I contribute as much as I can. And I have said it years ago. Always in to help

[26-Nov-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You are to me. You do a lot. Official or not official, you kick ass in my book

[26-Nov-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Haha thanks dude!

[26-Nov-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You're say matters

[26-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm glad we have Duke as our guy.

[26-Nov-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He has the real world experience that most devs lack.

[26-Nov-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Not to take away from them, either.

[26-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Captain What exchanges are basically free?

[26-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Bittrex haha

[26-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> But don't think they wil llist us

[26-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And if you want to increase liquidity, why not go around and find the hush mining pools, and ask them what they do with their Hush?

[26-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bittrex?

[26-Nov-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We are better than most on there, but they do things differnt.

[26-Nov-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They say free listings based on the projects merits, or whatever. But I don't really buy that.

[26-Nov-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They list a lot of shitcoins

[26-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Miners should be selling  right. Or they are hodlong

[26-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> We can try at bittrex

[26-Nov-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They're selling. Miners don't hold.

[26-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Exactly

[26-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> So most volume we see at exchanges now are simply miners who are selling hushies

[26-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> TradeSatoshi? Crex24? Altsbit? TradeOgre?

[26-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Folgory?:p

[26-Nov-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Kek

[26-Nov-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Check them out, see what they say.

[26-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Kekcoin?

[26-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think another factor is letting people know again that Hush is back, it's better, and nothing to do with any of the major issues before

[26-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's easy to see with the amount of work going on around here

[26-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> True, but some people simply don't look at that.
A lot of people don't want to buy on small exchanges. With liquidity of 100K.

[26-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Or don't buy coins who dumped 300x from ATH

[26-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Including me, but I do with HUSH

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So nobody buys crypto period?

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> A lot of reasons

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Every coin is down 98% ATH

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Most

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Not 30.000 % :p

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Waltoncoin

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Nexus

[26-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Anyhow, we are not the majority of people who buycoins from small exchanges

[26-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Some people dont even look further then top 100 on  CMC.

[26-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> So we need more users or more use cases

[26-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Both i guess

[26-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Okay. So think about it.

[26-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What could the use cases be?

[26-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> In terms of?

[26-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> In terms of, are there any other uses outside of trading, zaddrs, the memo field and HushList? New ones we could find

[26-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's already a lot.

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I wanted to try to see if any gambling communities would use Hush.

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked PornHub, if they would use Hush

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked Tor

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked QubesOS

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Lol seriously Pornhub?ðŸ˜‚

[26-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked Mullvad

[26-Nov-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Do they accept crypto?

[26-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They quit using PayPal a few weeks ago

[26-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Big deal

[26-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked Haven, private marketplace

[26-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Those are some examples of the things I've tried the last few weeeks

[26-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> On my own initiative

[26-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Why should a huge company making millions concider a cryptocoin with a market cap of 500K? I really like hour effort. But it is not realistic.

[26-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It only takes one place to say yes

[26-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It took 5 minutes to ask.

[26-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Privatoshi Wow, thanks for this information.  I did not know you'd been so active behind the scenes.

[26-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @gilardh Yessir. I do all of that. And then I try to find little pieces of tech, that we can integrate or that Duke would find interesting ... I did a lot of blockchain analysis research, too

[26-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Privatoshi You are right.  You must try.

[26-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> What is 5 minutes

[26-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I shit longer every day then 5 minutes haha

[26-Nov-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> There are a lot of private or invite only gambling communities. Why wouldn't they use a ZCash protocol crypto?

[26-Nov-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I honestly don't know. I remember applying for a enlisting once. They asked a tremendous amount of money. Because it was difficult to add usðŸ˜‚

[26-Nov-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They're like miners. Eventually someone has to cash out, not some, but all. And get more.
