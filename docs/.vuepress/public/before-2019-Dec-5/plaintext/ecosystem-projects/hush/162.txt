@ZeroCurrencies Have you heard of the Sapling Woodchipper? https://t.co/dFUzeWYTUE
Allowing free transactions on $ZER means you are happy to allow an attacker fill all blockspace for zero financial cost.
$HUSH, $ARRR and all $KMD smart chains are protected from this attack...

These amazing #superlite wallets are coming quickly to $HUSH, which also has smart contracts enabled that #nSPV can interact with. It's really exciting to see something drastically better than Electrum evolve in a matter of weeks.
Time to throw Electrum away, very soon. ht...

[26-Jul-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> that must be a peculiar feeling, knowing how to bring a half billion marketcap crypto protocol to its knees. is kmd vulnerable to this attack?

[26-Jul-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No, and KMD does not have zaddrs anymore, that feature became PIRATE

[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD and Hush have transactions with a max size of 200KB and you must make many to fill a block

[26-Jul-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Ultimately, what ZER marketing doesn't realize, is that zero fee transactions are a nice-to-have when blocks are empty. They are also an attack vector. And when blocks are full, they don't work. Fees make blockchains go, it's incentive for a miner to include your transaction in a block

[26-Jul-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners decide which transaction fees to accept, not the coin devs, and not the people sending the transactions. Only the miners

[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They have full control of that aspect of the network

[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Right now, in the ZEC network, if you use fee=0, you will be censored by 90% of mining pools

[26-Jul-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Your transaction might work, but most likely it will expire. Zcash invented the whole expiring bullshit to basically solve this problem, it seems

[26-Jul-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @actionslacks I hope that rant explained a bit

[26-Jul-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And to be more clear, it's SOLO miners and POOL OPERATORS that decide

[26-Jul-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most people are pool miners, they don't decide anything

[26-Jul-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So the deciders are a small group

[26-Jul-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, "peculiar feeling" is a pretty good assesment

@CryptoForge_cc @PirateChain @ZeroCurrencies the same core problem exists with allowing fee=0 transactions to fill a block. An optimization of the woodchipper is to use a mixture of fee=0 transactions to lessen the cost of the attack. You are lowering the cost of the attac...
