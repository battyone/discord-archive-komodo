[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I will be working on Hush for a while. We now have sustainable funding via a 10% Founders Reward

[17-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> I know the awesome work u are putting in

@kennyog @florian_tramer @danboneh I am wondering why you cited me in a timeline in a first draft of a paper, then deleted history in the final draft. I always described that reading $ZEC commits caused me to independently discover the issue and gave y'all full credit
Twitter

[17-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> But what about a user friendly wallet

[17-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz looks like I went outside the academia-secret-handshake

[17-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> U want ur work to be recognised then u need to do something about it

[17-Nov-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Biz why would somebody delete a timeline and reference to first independent discovery, from the final version of a paper?

[17-Nov-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Doesn't that seem a bit like censorship of reality? Also, I think ECC asked them to do it, because Zcash Company dislikes me

[17-Nov-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so I don't think it's an accident

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Finality no idea what you are talking about to be honest

[17-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i like your positivity

[17-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Finality i think the current wallets SilentDragon, SilentDragonLite and SilentDragonAndroid are as user friendly as any other coins' wallets if not better

[17-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> I support what finality says

[17-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we literally just talked about this in  #developers a few hours ago

[17-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's in progress, like everything üôÇ

[17-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the more you can jump in and help, the better

[17-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> whatever skills you have, we can probably put them to use

[17-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Well i put it in short. U guys are doing great job. But if u want mass adaption.u need user friendly wallets

[17-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is literally what i spend every waking moment on

[17-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is why people respect me, I guess. I am radically honest about every coin, from Bitcoin to Zcash to Komodo to Hush

[17-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I say things that anger people all the time

[17-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because I think truth is very powerful

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no person signs my paycheck, so no person controls my mouth

[17-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and I anger BTC core devs, ZEC core devs, and now even the researchers that found the new CVEs in ZEC+XMR

[17-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all of them have dayjobs and ultimately people they must not piss off

[17-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763

All privacy coins are held together with duct tape + paperclips, in particular all $XMR and $ZEC forks. Epic work by @florian_tramer , @kennyog + @danboneh rocked our industry https://t.co/8pMVrNNnAo

[17-Nov-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Imagine, a draft of a paper shows a timeline of events, and it quotes you and says you were the first to publicly say anything

[17-Nov-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then, the final paper comes out, and the timeline is gone and so is the mention of first public discovery

[17-Nov-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> doesn't that seem shady?

[17-Nov-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is why i wanted to very directly ask this question, even if it's never answered, that is a response itself: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1196104824510652417

[17-Nov-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some ECC devs didn't like what I said on Twitter and blocked me and so I know there is good motivation for them to delete me from the paper, Zcash doesn't want to see my name or acknowledge my discovery

[17-Nov-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So, if this gets deleted from the history books, tell your children/etc

[17-Nov-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can easily do that on Hush mainnet

[17-Nov-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, when I implement 200KB file upload, you can upload small-res pics directly to the Hush chain, which are good for insurance purposes

[17-Nov-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
