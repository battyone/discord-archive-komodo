[dscrd-hush] <Demintiger aka woody woodpecker> Any starwars fans here?

[31-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal any transactions after block 500,000 on the old Hush chain are not reflected on the new Hush chain

[31-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the SWING wallet is discontinued at this point, unless somebody wants to step in and maintain it

[31-Oct-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal the error about about wrong user/pass is because you did not shut down Hush before moving your datadir, and so, it doesn't know the correct user/pass to tell hushd to stop

[31-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally, while you are syncing any Bitcoin-derived wallet, you will only see transactions and balances at the point of the chain you have synced. So be patient and wait until 100% sync before looking at balances

[31-Oct-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> I am confused, but the 38k was sent a few months ago, so it had to be on the new chain, right?

[31-Oct-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Demintiger aka woody woodpecker> @dukeleto can you DM me the link for the wallet that excepts hush? I think I need to scroll alot to find it

[31-Oct-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @pal Please stop spamming #general  
with wallet issues when we have #wallet-support .. you posted the same 3 messages in both channels.

[31-Oct-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> Sorry. I deleted. I lost lots of money and I expect Hush to moon of course I am nervous

Just over 1/3rd of all $HUSH that will ever come into existence has already been mined!
Current circulating supply is ~7.2M of 21M and ~113K HUSH is currently in shielded addresses, i.e. ~1.6%.
Our very first halving happens in about 450 days.
Real facts for real investors.

I now have access to about 3,000 unique emails from the BitMEX leak.

- from what I can tell, there is more than 30,000 unique emails in total
- 67% emails (from my sample size) use gmail, 7% hotmail, 4% yahoo, 3% protonmail

[01-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> agreed, it's not pleasant and nobody deserves to have their account hacked. Also, if the fact of just your email being leaked allows somebody to log into an exchange because you made other dumb mistakes ....

[01-Nov-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is cryptocoins and people without good opsec will always have their coins stolen from them

[01-Nov-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Use a unique secure password for each exchange, created by a PW manager, and even making a unique email per exchange is very good idea

[01-Nov-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When mtgox was hacked and the entire user+password db was put online, a friend told me they found my email address in there. This can and will happen to just about everybody

[01-Nov-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You must have a unique + strong password or there is no point

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> yes, i haven't been diligent with my login credential in the past and 2-factor has saved my ass more than once, but i've fixed that now üò¨

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Tupakito we call that a Sad Trombone

[01-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Don't Do That

[01-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can make the password to your PW manager a file, or a sentence from a book, etc...

[01-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Something you can't forget or can go find somewhere else/etc

[01-Nov-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Tupakito so you could make the pw a specific JPG picture on your HD. Anywhere you can get that picture, you can unlock your pw manager

[01-Nov-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There are many PW managers. I do not like the ones that integrate with browsers. They are less secure.

[01-Nov-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Tupakito> hm yeah I see good idea

[01-Nov-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763

BREAKING: Argentina's Central Bank just restricted the purchasing of bitcoin with credit, debit and prepaid cards as of today.

This comes less than a week since the same bank restricted dollar purchases by citizens to just 200 USD per month.
