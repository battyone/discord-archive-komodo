[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How can I fell?

[13-Jul-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What batch it is

[13-Jul-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Are you able to choose any frequency between 500 and 750 ? If yes => batch 1 firmware

[13-Jul-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let me see where I can do that

[13-Jul-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 8MB upload file limit to discord, grrrr

[13-Jul-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Frequency is set to balance

[13-Jul-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> No other option

[13-Jul-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I factory reset it when I got it

[13-Jul-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `I factory reset it when I got it`
when you remove the overclock, there's no overclock

[13-Jul-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Right

[13-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I guess let me Google it

[13-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You don't have a batch 1 HW and so you will only be able to OC it a bit, one of the hashboards most likely runs hot

[13-Jul-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> 650M should be the general stable for overclockable FW - This will give ~15k

[13-Jul-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> v1 - `Antminer-Z9-Mini-201805262047-500M.tar`

[13-Jul-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> There is this on Antminer;
`https://service.bitmain.com/support/download?product=Antminer%20Z9%20mini`

[13-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you keep things cold, you can run things hotter

[13-Jul-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> yeah the chiptemps will climb fast on OC

[13-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i dunno if i should OC

[13-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> set fan to 100% if you OC

[13-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its 100F right now where i am

[13-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> and its sitting in the garage

[13-Jul-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> welcome to the fun of mining

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> if the garage has airflow, 650M with fans on high it should be fine

[13-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> the room for my asics gets humid mid-summer / fans on auto / temps go mid 70 at most

[13-Jul-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> (but is tiled room with airflow)

[13-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> 201805262047 was finally pulled from bm servers üò≠

[13-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> whats the risk if i flash v1 firmware on v2 z9?

[13-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> none

[13-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> the flashing method is automated

[13-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> yeah i didnt see that version of the firmware

[13-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> the only issue is some chips will not OC and you'll have to turn it down

[13-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> B1 was selected and better chips
B2+ was pull a chip from the bin and slap it in

[13-Jul-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> so in firefox

[13-Jul-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Jul-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> I have v1 firmware if you need - untouched !

[13-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> the z9 is out of warranty per the bitmain site

[13-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> does that mean its v1?

[13-Jul-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no

[13-Jul-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its risky

[13-Jul-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com

[13-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't recommend running anything but Bitmain firmware

[13-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> other miners can opine if they think differently, I always use batch1 firmware

[13-Jul-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> max upload is 8mb will put it on dropbox

[13-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hahah. I've been trading my 1070s for z9

[13-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Now I look at 1070 is more profitable because of energy efficiency

[13-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But I guess I can't mine hush with it

[13-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can mine any equihash (200,9) coin with GPUs, it's just not financially sound. Most likely you will lose money via electric bills

[13-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if you have free electricity or want to avoid exchanges at any cost, sure, mine with a GPU

[13-Jul-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would be better to use your GPU to mine a coin that doesn't have asics, and then buy Hush with the proceeds, most likely

[13-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes.  And zergpool is great for that

[13-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I set the coin to hush and mine a GPU minable coin

[13-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So I'm thinking my 1080ti pulls more hush then z9 mini via zergpool

[13-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Atleast in this scenario with hush prices depressedp

[13-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> It will change if prices go up

[13-Jul-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Rub My Purple Monkey Balls> Good afternoon everyone

[13-Jul-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> welcome

[13-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Cool upload file feature, does it support every kind of file or is it limited currently to text files for example?

[13-Jul-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HushList protocol doesn't care what kind of file it is. SilentDragon will need to learn some stuff to render a text file versus an image versus opening an external program for an arbitrary file, stuff like that

[13-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any arbitrary data, any file extension. Hush is about freedom of communication

[13-Jul-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Supporting larger and larger files is more work, not just linearly, but new things need to be written to support files being larger than 1 memo or 1 transaction or 1 block, those are the big cut-offs. So those are the milestones of support

[13-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Files that fit in 1 memo, 1 transaction, 1 block, and then I will assess if files larger than 1 block should be supported

[13-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> These sizes work out to being about: 512 bytes, 200KB and 4MB

[13-Jul-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So first will come support for files up to 512 bytes, then files up to 200KB (both sizes will cost just one transaction fee by default, but miners could very well process these transactions slower if additional fees are not given). Files up to 4MB will incur multiple transaction fees, because they require multiple transactions to store. So a 4MB file will cost about 20X the fees as a 200KB file, because a 200KB file can be stored in 1 transaction, while a 4MB file requires many more transactions to store the data

[13-Jul-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Miners are probably excited about File Upload feature, because it means the more people want to store files in Hush, the more transaction fees Hush miners will make. It creates a reason to make many Hush transactions, which makes Hush miners happy

[13-Jul-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Rub My Purple Monkey Balls> @dukeleto  I changed name but I been here a week or 2 now

[13-Jul-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> great work @dukeleto

[13-Jul-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ok great, that's just what i wanted to know, a 200KB transaction already can handle a decent size text file and 4MB for a larger PDFs or images for example

[13-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hi

[13-Jul-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Are we the only coin efficient enough to do this?

[14-Jul-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX i don't understand the question

[14-Jul-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i assume other coins are too slow to be able to support these file uploads in the blockchain?  im not technical.

[14-Jul-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> something that makes us unique
