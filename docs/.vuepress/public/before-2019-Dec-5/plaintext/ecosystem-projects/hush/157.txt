[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there is a build in rate limiter to the protocol

[23-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you are right to infer that paying for nSPV service is not appropriate. Every full node should try to, but lower resource nodes could choose not to

[23-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My intention is that all Hush nodes will be full nSPV nodes and that must be turned off or changed

[23-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i can add an option to disable nSPV fullnode services

[23-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> for now the load is so small it didnt seem worth doing

[23-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> let us calculate

[23-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> to login, it is local, not network

[23-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> get a listunspent, will return a kb for most addresses.

[23-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> getinfo is 2kb

[23-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> time to process less than a millisecond

[23-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the biggest time is to calculate a spend transaction, but most of that is client side

[23-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there would be 20kb of headers, 4kb of notarization tx to validate

[23-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> for a single utxo spend, it is total of less than 64kb of network usage

[23-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> spread across 100+ nodes, we are talking about <1kb of bandwidth per tx per node, which is less than what it takes to relay the actual tx and blockspace it uses

[23-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> designate a single nSPV fullnode as a seed node, connect up dozens of nSPV clients and have them do their worst. see if you can even notice the load

[23-Jul-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Amazing that such an important new feature can take almost no resources!

[23-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it is amazing since it takes almost no data to prove a 10 block segment of the blockchain actually happened

[23-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the moment i realized that the entire blockchain wasnt needed to prove a single utxo, that was the "eureka!" moment for nSPV

[23-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cool

[23-Jul-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> just wanted to give u guys a heads up. been working my brain off for this HUSH review. the Duke has helped all along the way. intention is to publish on Friday.

[23-Jul-19 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> suit up bois

[23-Jul-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I have seen a sneak preview, it is the most in depth HUSH article I have ever read, I'm excited to see the final product. If anyone is truly interested in this project, this article is a must read.

[23-Jul-19 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> !tip @gigamesh 50 HUSH just from me personally ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> ðŸ’° @Berg sent @gigamesh **50.00 HUSH** (â‰ˆ $1.65).

[23-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> TY sir

[23-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm sure the full team will have much more from the dev fund ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Jul-19 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i appreciate that. and yes, i do need to eat...

[23-Jul-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but my decision to write an article about Hush

[23-Jul-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> had nothing to do with food

[23-Jul-19 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> this is unequivocally the most undervalued crypto

[23-Jul-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the blood, sweat, and tears that have poured into Hush shall soon be rewarded with proper attention

[23-Jul-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i am at your service ðŸ™‡

[23-Jul-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ```**Future**
Hush is as deeply committed to privacy, if not more, than any other blockchain project to date. The project is mature and continually improving, has a fair mining emission (the same as Bitcoin) and an absolutely tenacious Lead Dev in Duke Leto
Tensions with Zcash devs over governance, the Sprout inflation bug 'hush-up', the lack of reaction to Sapling Woodchipper, and opinions on scaling and security  ("Nobody wants to admit that Zcash is broke as shit") will likely abate now Zcash has turned in its new direction. Komodo will continue to improve on the codebase, and Hush right by its side with jl777 serving as adviser.
SilentDragon is developing at pace and introducing new features and improving performance, and the addition of  smart contracts and dApps will add tremendous value to Hush and its bleeding-edge privacy tools. Still under most radars (CMC Rank 1021), the story of Hush is both startling and inspiring.```

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hola

[24-Jul-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Just wondering. How Bitcoin Asics are doing

[24-Jul-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Has the algorithm ever changed over the years for them?

[24-Jul-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Has asics just constantly gotten more powerful over the years?

[24-Jul-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Are they still developing new Asics to mine Bitcoin?

[24-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitcoin started with double SHA256 and has never changed

[24-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, new ASICs to mine BTC and every other coin are constantly coming out: https://www.asicminervalue.com/

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> restart didnt help and cant seem to find ``hushd`` to start manually

[24-Jul-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto ?

[24-Jul-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> so i managed to compile on macOS (there were a couple more steps required not mentioned in tutorial)

[24-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> after getting the error message above i also tried deleting HUSH3.conf and restarting

[24-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> still same issue

[24-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> im now looking for the "embedded hushd" to launch manually - cant find it tho

[24-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> For my part, I deleted the old file HUSH3.conf and it worked.

[24-Jul-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @gilardh can you see where your ``hushd`` file is? restarts and conf deletion not helping

[24-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @gigameshOn windows, the hushd (Daemon) application is in the same folder as SilentDragon.

[24-Jul-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i have to dl hushd seperately?

[24-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ?

[24-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @gigamesh no (in any case for Windows users)

[24-Jul-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh wow, you compiled on mac?!?!

[24-Jul-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> extra bonus points

[24-Jul-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i know exactly what is up

[24-Jul-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh either you can start hushd manually, or even better is to make some symlinks so SD can find hushd. This problem is happening because you compiled yourself, so there is an extra step to tell SD where hushd lives

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```
Emulating the embedded node
In binary releases, SilentDragon will use node binaries in the current directory to sync a node from scratch. It does not attempt to download them, it bundles them. To simulate this from a developer setup, you can symlink these four files in your Git repo:

    ln -s ../hush3/src/hushd
    ln -s ../hush3/src/hush-cli
    ln -s ../hush3/src/komodod
    ln -s ../hush3/src/komodo-cli
The above assumes silentdragon and hush3 git repos are in the same directory. File names on Windows will need to be tweaked.
```

[24-Jul-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's documented in README but could be made easier

[24-Jul-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> what directory do i need to be in @dukeleto when issuing those ln commands?

[24-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> issues those symlink commands from SD folder, still not working

[24-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> am not seeing ``/hush3/src`` directories anywhere

[24-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh do you have a `hushd` binary for mac?

[24-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i dont think so

[24-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> no hush3 folder

[24-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the above assumes you are in the root directory of SilentDragon and that you have a `hush3` source code directory in `.` with a compiled `hushd`

[24-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so you have compiled SD for mac, but not hush

[24-Jul-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hush is simpler, I would say ðŸ˜ƒ
