[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i thought the nullifiers are a hash of the data so without the unencrypted data you wouldnt be able to reverse any nullifier back to the original proof

[13-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think you are correct @jl777c , but there are bits of metadata that can be woven together from different sources, some which are heuristics

[13-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> yes, this just shows that if you need privacy, you need a 100% zaddr chain and NEVER leak your real zaddr

[13-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> or a txid that is involving your main zaddr

[13-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c so many of us have broken that rule, even just for documentation/marketing purposes, or in "real life". I always knew my paranoia was well-founded, I just needed to find the reason

[13-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just have a "hot" zaddr for such things and always z->z into the main zaddr to break any links

[13-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c HushList protocol was always designed with this in mind

[13-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since 1.5yrs ago, my paranoia saves me

[13-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You never tell anybody your main zaddr for HushList, you give each new person an "introducer zaddr"

[13-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So you can't do these linkage attacks

[13-Aug-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, stopp the presses

Never in 3,000 years of recorded history have we ever seen negative interest rates.

This next Bitcoin bull run should be interesting. https://t.co/16g2ENLvwB

[13-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And to give credit where it's due, radix42 thought up "introducer zaddrs", I just ran with the concept

[13-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we just got it working a few mins ago

[13-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> #dev-nspv in KMD discord for more details

[13-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nic

[13-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Do we need to do anye like thng

[13-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Anything

[13-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> that actually awesome, means mobile version of hush is possible.

[13-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And different from arrr which. Can't support nspv

[13-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> libnspv is 100% C, has only libevent and libsodium as external dependencies

[13-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> shouldnt be hard for someone to port this to mobile

[13-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the html is actually all static html, no javascript

[13-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the C code is dynamically generating all the html based on current internal state

[13-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so the html template files can be tweaked however you want, $VARIABLE in the html are replaced with the dynamic data

[13-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> libnspv is fully aware of dPoW and marks txid that are notarized, it can even claim KMD rewards properly

[13-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think it has a bit too much details for the non-tech users, but they can just ignore it and it is there for the advanced users

[13-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this is for taddr only, it has no ideas about zaddr. maybe it will have some display problems for txid with zaddr in it

[13-Aug-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> very young still, the gui was put together over the weekend

[13-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c i am extremely impressed with your progress with nspv, even by jl777 standards, you went from nothing to 90% done in a matter of days, it seems

[13-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it has been about a month since i first got the idea for nSPV

[13-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> first i hacked the komodo to have nSPV=1 mode

[13-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then added the nspv client to libbtc

[13-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then satinder did all the html, i just did the $variable replace and a bit of page control flow

[13-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> also, borrowed heavily from iguana, so the api processing and html server took a few hours instead of a few weeks just for that

[13-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> as i said originally nSPV is very simple in what it has to do, so it allows a simple solution to be coded quickly. also blackjok3r helped with peer handling and making sure they are on the notarized chain

[13-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but yes, even by my standards, this went from concept to GUI in record time as i took upon the gui part myself. i wanted something easy to use that is basically as secure as using cli without any layer of code added on top and certainly no javascript and most definitely no node.js

We now have a $KMD Antara Superlite wallet for $HUSH !
This means that extremely low-resource devices like a watch or embedded computer and just about anything, can act as a wallet, with full protection of #DPoW.
Pure HTML GUI that talks to other full nodes, no Javascript!...

[13-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How do I use it

[13-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Basically, you run a program on your computer, then go to http://localhost:XXXX in your browser and you have a GUI wallet

[13-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and you don't need to download the blockchain

[13-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only a tiny part of it

[13-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just got it working today, documentation is still incoming ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There will be binaries to download

[13-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then you use your browser

[13-Aug-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Would it be possible to have the encrypted message breakdown over a certain period of time?  Maybe even set by the sender?

[13-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq great question and even better username

[13-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> ðŸ˜‰

[13-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For deep reasons, the answer is No. The number 1 reason is: taking a screenshot

[13-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What do you mean by break down over time?

[13-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And receiver gets plaintext, who can copy it to a text file or paste into an email

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They mean "disappearing messages"

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> self-destructing information

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> or encrypt it there?

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe cryptoconditions?

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq it's highly encouraged to encrypt your memo field, for any vaguely sensitive data

[13-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which means the person receiving needs additional info to decrypt, but still doesn't self-destruct it

[13-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> nice. just to make that user friendly is the hard part haha

[13-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The memo field is already encrypted, but that is just on the blockchain. When it hits your receivers wallet, they can do what they want with the plaintext

[13-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So it's like asking "Can I make an disappearing PGP-signed email?" and the reason, for deep reasons, is "No"

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> got it.   Just trying to brainstorm the easiest way for common users to achieve that within the wallet

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq what say the Fish Speakers?

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> #metoo?

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> lol

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @siaynoq also, SilentDragon will support additional encryption of memo fields

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> NICE

[13-Aug-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such as "encrypt the memo field with this password"

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then the receiver needs the password to decrypt

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it also means, you need a secure way to send that password to them

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> PERFECT.

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So it solves some problems while making others

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> I like that meaning described as "giving honor to those that speak with sincerity"

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can also use memo fields to send passwords to future memo fields :exploding_ping:

[13-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> super sweetness.

[13-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Such as "I will send you half the password to zadd1 and half to zaddr2 and let's hope nobody has backdoored both different wallets that store those addresses!"

[13-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and various other complex schemes

[13-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Exactly, HUSH could be a business standard in sensitive information xfer.

[13-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would be surprised if some 3 letter agencies were not actively researching HUSH and every related chain

[13-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For use in their own nefarious purposes, and also to study via OSINT

[13-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Well, it is decentralized lol

[13-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Without the US Navy, Tor would not exist. Thanks Uncle Sam!

[13-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Yeah, the deep stuff that goes on is pretty nuts

[13-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I respect my elders and also, trust is earned not given, in my world.

[13-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DARPA is funding zk-snarks research, so it's pretty much a fact

[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> yikes.

[13-Aug-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It would be crazy of them to fund all this zk-snark research without studying what currently exists, i.e. "prior art"

[13-Aug-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Of course they are

[13-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <siaynoq> Probably to find/make some kind of back door BS. lol

[13-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Well, not exactly. They want their own

[13-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
