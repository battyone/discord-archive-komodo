[27-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It could/would generate a new address

[27-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Make sure everything is on 1 line with 1 space between each word

[27-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> is on line sure..

[27-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> this is it...i dont get it...and im tired of trying...hope cryptopia return someday the coins back to everyone

[27-Jun-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> And also to make sure there aren't any extra spaces or `:` signs for example

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Roxin.  Everyone is here to help you

[27-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I recommend you try it on a separate computer

[27-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> he said he had

[27-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> " is the same, i try with 2 different computers + 1 laptop"

[27-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> This is why crypto is not for everyone

[27-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I'm still trying to figure out how stake labs

[27-Jun-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> you can try it on every computer in the known universe, but if you copy/paste wrong it's still going to come out wrong

[27-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bar_F1sh_Rel> Labs staking requires the scripts or really good knowledge of the cli.

[27-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> good afternoon friends HUSH community

[27-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> thanks @heguli97 ü§ô

[27-Jun-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> @Bar_F1sh_Rel tnks for that totally random tidbit üëçüèΩ

[27-Jun-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And Linux knowledge

[27-Jun-19 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `And Linux knowledge`
or simply following basic instructions that alright wrote a year before LABS was even a coin :troll:

[27-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thanks.  I'll look for them

[27-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> should be pinned in the labs channel, if not search for pos64staker

[27-Jun-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> is it worth it to stake labs? I haven't looked much into it but i do have a raspberry pi 3 B that's unused...

[27-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I believe so, but I'm biased

[27-Jun-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Might have to investigate it a bit more, any other good sources than the kmd channel?

[27-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> members of the kmd community üòõ

[27-Jun-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> it's kinda hard to find external sources for a new thing that most people don't understand

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @AkiraX its not that the problem...i made much transactions....and in 2 yrs i didnt have problems (except cryptopia which was hacked) but now idk what happend...this is it..

[28-Jun-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> is there any chance that hush to be listed on binance or bittrex in near future ?

[28-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> did you try your seed on the web wallet?

[28-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i guess it doesnt work the same

[28-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @AkiraX i tried it..and doesnt work

[28-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> There's only one way to confirm

[28-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You're going to have to let someone else try your seed

[28-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If your seed is wrong

[28-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You lost the money any way

[28-Jun-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because no one else knows it

[28-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Imagine losing 1k hush those days when hush was $20 to $25..

[28-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Usually i wld say its safer to always send 1 coin first to try out

[28-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Before u send all

[28-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> The other day i test send 1 .. nep5 tokens to some wallet

[28-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Before i send the rest ..3k tokens over

[28-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Then when i open the wallet, the next day it shows $0 ... i was shocked.. so but thankfully when i close the apps and reopen it show back that amount..

[28-Jun-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Now to open the wallet .. i just need to use biometric.. ie my fingerprint

[28-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> If u have any nep 5 tokens like neo etc u can try use O3 wallet.. quite reliable (until its hacked) üòÄ

[28-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> When was hush $20

[28-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Long time ago.. in early 2018..

[28-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I remember after announced of the bitcoin hush airdrop

[28-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> It suddenly shot up

[28-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> But that only last like few day

[28-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> was 27 i think

[28-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> so now i lost almost 4000 hush

[28-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> 1100 cryptopia...2900 with verus wallet..

[28-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> and. hush can be 100 usd at least..

[28-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> The good news is you can buy it back for pennies

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> The bad news is that it might stay pennies for a while

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> yes...but anyway...4000 hush even now are like 400 euro..smth like that..

[28-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> 4000 hush would be a couple years worth of 1-rig mining back in the day

[28-Jun-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i try to take a couple hundred euro each month and gamble them away on lowcaps

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> i have one rig..i mined that 1000 in almost 3 months..rest of them i buy..

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> one great thing about hush is the low supply

[28-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> and relatively low inflation

[28-Jun-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but anyway..i think it can be 100 usd

[28-Jun-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> at least..

[28-Jun-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> with all good project and just some exchanges..

[28-Jun-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i was buying some other lowcap until i realized that the monthly inflation exceeds what i can buy

meaning my coins will devalue quicker than i can scoop up a portion of % supply

[28-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> the ideal scenario is being whale-y enough you can gobble away at the sell-side of order books for long enough to impact the price (by restricting the supply)

[28-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> can be done even if you're holding 2-3%

[28-Jun-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> it was 27 ..good amount if we think it was only on tradesatoshi and cryptopia at that moment

[28-Jun-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> Many coins won't ever return to their ATH because their supply increased significantly since the last bull

[28-Jun-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> this is not the case for hush, I believe

[28-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I wonder if excluding all the lost coin in cryptopia etc how much the supply wld be..
Those days in jan 2018 also is when privacy coins bullrun...

[28-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @Roxin i think yr hush coin might not be lost since its still showing on the block explorer.. it just that ur pass word/phase/seed
