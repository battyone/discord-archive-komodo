[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why have all these expenses?

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is in a much more financially stable place than Zcash, to be honest

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have very few bills

[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Twitter has less than 1000 employees worldwide

[10-Aug-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know how many employees Zcash Company has, I should state. But too many expenses

[10-Aug-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Too many

[10-Aug-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Where does all this money go

[10-Aug-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> wtf

[10-Aug-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And he won't pay a programmer to fix a wallet

[10-Aug-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he takes his salary completely in ZEC, but expenses are in fiat

[10-Aug-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Shame in him

[10-Aug-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash is really in for trouble if ZEC goes down to $25

[10-Aug-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they will literally run out of money before even the new founders reward could help them

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It's like they don't care

[10-Aug-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think Verus will dip below 250 sats

[10-Aug-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Lol bc it has more sellers than it does buyers

[10-Aug-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The order book below 1700, was never strong.

[10-Aug-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Below 1000, it is near nothing

[10-Aug-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The entire buy side is 1.88 btc

[10-Aug-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @dukeleto I made contact with Haven/OpenBazaar CEO, Samuel Patterson.. Let you know when I hear something back

[10-Aug-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @AkiraX timelocked coins, you say?

[10-Aug-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Yes.  I was an early miner for verus

[10-Aug-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Early on the emissions was 384

[10-Aug-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But they were time locked for 2 years

[10-Aug-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763

Here is the COO of @ElectricCoinCo saying that shielded Zcash addresses are "impervious" to dusting attacks.

This is 100% false.

Sad that people like this don't realize speaking about $ZEC removes all doubt of their stupidity. https://t.co/kcRtxULJcX

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Some idiot defended XMR and I proved him wrong. Since then he stop speaking to me üòÉ

[10-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> The attack was used many times on XMR. Never was able to perform the attack on zk-SNARKs.

[10-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If somebody knows your zaddr, it's trivial to dust attack, just like a taddr

[10-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Dust attacks against zaddrs are actually financially cheaper, but take more CPU + RAM

[10-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When I see corporate heads talking about very technical things they know nothing about, it really irks me.

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sapling Woodchipper is a type of dusting attack

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To say Zcash is "impervious", I could not let that fly

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Still, to this day, nothing has been done about the Sapling Woodchipper

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> one of the most efficient dust attacks every discovered in history, I would say

[10-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> jl777 made some good points in KMD #dev-general regarding this

[10-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I was talking about Denial-of-Service dust/spam attacks, but most people seem to be using the term to mean only de-anonymization attacks, which Zcash/Hush/etc are not vulnerable to

To clarify, there are de-anonymizing dust/spam attacks and those purely for Denial-of-Service. I was speaking of the DoS kind, which all coins inheriting $BTC protocol are vulnerable to.
No $ZEC protocol coin is vulnerable to de-anon dusting. 
My bad for using imprecise la...

[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Don't know if it's just false news/rumor from another Discord server. But has anyone heard about Tradesatoshi ceasing trade in the US, or for its US users?
