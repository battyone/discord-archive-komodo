Hi there!

[27-Nov-19 12:17 PM] Captain#4064
So it is possible to get ledger support for Hush?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Full disclosure: I don't think Ledgers are a good idea, or safe, and I don't see the point in ever getting one

[27-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you have one, and want to make it work with Hush, please donate your time and energy to make it work. It's a lot of work and to me, that won't use it, completely worthless

Breaking the Ledger Security Model
In this post, I’m going to discuss a vulnerability I discovered in Ledger hardware wallets. The vulnerability arose due to Ledger’s use of a custom architecture to work around many of the limitations of their Secure Element.
