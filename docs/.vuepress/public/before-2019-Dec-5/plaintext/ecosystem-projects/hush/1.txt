It's great exposure for Hush from KMD Discord members, as they have much greater reach than us.

And then smashed that buy button every time it lost another $0.50

_doesn't have that much faith to buy at $2.50_

dPoW increases its value, for sure

[27-Jun-18 04:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dukeleto I'm assuming it would apply to the Hush architecture?   Is this good for the project you think?

dPoW adds a lot of value, plus Next Generation wallet is coming along.

Is there any news on KMD Notarization for Hush?

[17-Jul-18 11:50 AM] Audo#5667
@Berg or someone from Hushteam. Could you provide your Hush's Discords bot token to @noashh for chat integration? You can get more info from him.

[17-Jul-18 01:23 PM] Berg#2666
I'll reach out, thanks üòÉ

We're participating in a voting contest for SonoXchange! 
Hush at 6th place with 320 votes currently! Great job so far guys, remember you can vote once per day! We should look at getting BTCH added to this, since each user can vote for up to 3 coins per 24 hours. If you haven't voted yet, make sure to follow the link and do so! Only takes about five seconds. https://sonox.io/ Contest ends August 25th, so make sure to keep coming back and voting! Top 3 coins get a currency infusion from the exchange, top 15 automatically get added.

Notarizing to Btc?

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Berg#2666
We should definitely be able to pour some solid votes into this one as well:
https://kastle.pro/en/project/vote
Requires registration, but is a two second sign up with no confirmation email or anything, and then you can vote once daily.
We're already super close to the top, so lets get some people involved!

[08-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Elmis#0347
What happened at sonox.io? Hush lost support and fell from first to fourth place.
When does the voting end and how many on the list will be listed?

[08-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Berg#2666
Voting is through August 25th, top 15 coins get listed, so we're still pretty safe

[08-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Berg#2666
BTCP gained over 8,000 votes in a single day without a tweet or a call to action or anything, we believe someone is fraudulently voting through a proxy server.

[08-Aug-18 05:50 PM] Berg#2666
Regardless, we're pretty safe in terms of being listed, and the SonoX team will do their due diligence on voter fraud and likely push them down at the end of the voting period.

[08-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Elmis#0347
Thanks for the information, I'll continue to vote until the 25th.

[08-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Berg#2666
