[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All coins with Sapling zaddrs are compatible with hushlist, and I believe they have zaddrs enabled on their chain

[15-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pretty sure we need to make a Debian package of SD, then add some TAILS bits to it, then submit to TAILS

[15-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> imagine telling people "Just install Tails, then install SilentDragon, and you are golden"

[15-Aug-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> like HushList without taddr features?

[15-Aug-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Z address?

[16-Aug-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> or can i send to taddr on ZEC

[16-Aug-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes

[16-Aug-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> never had any ZEC....

[16-Aug-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> but it would a rly nice PR to send a Message to mostly all Zaddr on Zcash for 4$ üòÇ

[16-Aug-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and to make it less" spammy" the msg could containt the information about the bug that allows sending cheap msg to ZEC network with some credential that it was fixed in other ZEC forks üôÇ

[16-Aug-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> probably sth like 1. scrap taddr from ZEC explorer 2. make script to run wallt in a loop and send those msg / for someone who know how to run cli with scripts

[16-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i advise against this

[16-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> no blockchain is immune from spam attacks

[16-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> best to not be starting any sort of spam war, doesnt help anybody

[16-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ok, aggree on that

[16-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> James is right for deep reasons, as usual

[16-Aug-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> ü§î

[16-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio it's easy, but it's also starting a war

[16-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio what happens when somebody uses it against Hush? Or all zcash coins, because maybe some Monero people want to see every single Zcash coin go extinct or have a hard time

[16-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only a few dollars a day to DoS every single Zcash protocol coin, let's say under $10. Every single one

[16-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> To be clear :I dont want to start a war with any blockchain project. But to be also clear: A Blockchain Project that is so vulnerable to such ‚Äûeasy‚Äú attacs (effect=no working Blockchain?!) should not exist!

[16-Aug-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Espacially when they are worth Millionen $

[16-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Or what would be the effect of such an attac? maybe i just dont understand it

[16-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> all blockchains can be spam attacked for a fraction of their marketcap

[16-Aug-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Rly? üò≥

[16-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes

[16-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> And none of them think its a problem maybe in the future? Or are their just no solutions against this problem?

[16-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio go spam attack Bitcoin

[16-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> completely feasible, just expensive

[16-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The only defense is cost

[16-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Bitcoin evolved to charge by blockspace, instead of transactions

[16-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e. the cost to make a transaction on bitcoin is based on "satoshis per byte"

[16-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash forked before that, and has a fixed value. And that gives rise to the sapling woodchipper, when coupled with zaddrs

[16-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio every coin knows it's a problem, at least the ones with devs

[16-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio in theory, your nice neighbor down the street could throw a rock thru your window, right? But do you have your windows boarded up with wood/metal gates?

[16-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You expect that it's pretty rare that it will happen, and so you have less security. That is what Zcash is doing

[16-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Sure if i have high value windows

[16-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Exactly.
