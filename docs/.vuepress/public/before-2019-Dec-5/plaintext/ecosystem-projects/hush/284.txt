This is interesting ‚Äì¬†this is the first HSM that I've seen that advertising support for Bitcoin's secp256k1. Most every true HSM only support NIST's ECDSA secp256r1 which our community does not trust. I'll have to study datasheet to see if this is truly doing k1 signing...

[dscrd-hush] <FTL_Ian> @dukeleto , I don't see a link that's easy to retrieve for my offer on AtomicDEX

[12-Nov-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FTL_Ian> I think I was the only active one when I placed it last night

[12-Nov-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FTL_Ian i believe offers can be public or private, not sure of the default

[12-Nov-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FTL_Ian there should be a way to copy a link for the offer. or you could just tell people the X HUSH for Y BTC swap offer here, so they can decide if they are interested

[12-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe we should have a dedicated #atomicdex channel, but nobody has asked yet

[12-Nov-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FTL_Ian> There is one on the komodo discord

[12-Nov-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is good to know. hard to keep track of the channels on KMD discord üòÖ

[12-Nov-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> more wallet options are always good, especially if they can offer some significant advantage. not sure that one does, or not

[12-Nov-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c hardware support for secp256k1, which supposedly is not supported in any hw wallet directly yet

[12-Nov-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> still, if it's not open source hardware, we are trusting some binary blob of code somewhere

[12-Nov-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> unless it has a built in internet connection or radio, it seems it wont be able to broadcast anything, but that requires knowing the details of the hardware built around the chip

[12-Nov-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> imagine when we can have open source hardware to do zkSNARK operations, gosh

[12-Nov-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in other news, the 3D files for printing a dragon head yourself will be open sourced on our github, /cc @iceyballz

[12-Nov-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> STL files for printing your own 3D DragonHead

[12-Nov-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c even if that HSM doesn't have direct internet, it could be backdoored such that an app installed on the same machine could use a side-channel to leak private key data/etc. I think we must have open source hardware or we just can't trust it

[12-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX thanks so much for running our explorers and always fixing bugs and adding cool new features!

[12-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FTL_Ian you should be able to withdraw your hush to your SD/SDL wallet, let us know if you see issues. Sometimes the tipbot is overworked and it will timeout, but waiting a bit usually will see it work again

[12-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @tip.cc you can do eeeet

[12-Nov-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763

One click.

We don't need to run a full node on everything and for every app.  We need an easy, and interoperable way to "pair" wallets with a node.

As a matter of fact, not even everyone should be bothered, ex one well maintained and reliable node for a family is more than enough.

Probably partially due to me being new to Android
