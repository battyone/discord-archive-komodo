[06-May-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> today I installed a new Agama wallet 0.3.5-beta. And i try add HUSH in Native mode - and when i press "Activate coin" = nothin goin on.. It start with only lite mode ?

[06-May-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <jaystone777> What's the new algorithm? Is it still the original zcash algorithm? I used to mine hush back in the day when GPU mining was still profitable. Once everything went ASIC I just bought a few X3's and built some merge-mining pools. I'm a full time miner/broker so mining hobbyist coins with obscure algorithms isn't a consideration for me. I have a family to feed. Hehehehehe. So anyway, I've considering buying some Zmasters with the objective of building a merge-mining pool for KOMODO+HUSH. But I just need to know if hush is still on the original zcash algorithm.

[07-May-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> @jaystone777 you are a Full Time Miner and dont read whitepapers? Start to read it! And yes its still Zcash

[07-May-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jaystone777> Ever since I graduated college I absolutely refuse to read technical documents unless absolutely necessary and often the white paper isn't kept up to date and doesn't reflect the current algorithm. That coupled with the fact that so many coins are forking off into obscurity and sealing their doom I figured it was easier to just ask. Thanks for answering my question.

[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> >  I absolutely refuse to read technical documents
