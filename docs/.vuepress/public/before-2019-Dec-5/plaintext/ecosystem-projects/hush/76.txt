[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And most people simply don't know you can mine Hush with all the same Zcash asics that are everywhere now

[26-Apr-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This all adds up to being able to mine Hush, as a small-time miner, without a lot of competition.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nice!

[26-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> does solo pool hush3 exist?

[26-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool weren't you threatening to make a solo hush pool ?

[26-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Heno1974 some pools have talked about it, i don't think anybody has done Sapling payouts or Solo on the new mainnet, yet

[26-Apr-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I will provide a bounty to the first Hush solo pool, let's call it 500 HUSH

[26-Apr-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @dukeleto yes, but because of how I want it and the fact that someone wanted 100 block confirms, I had to get a bunch of HUSH 1st and will likely begin working on it in the next few days

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool i just left things the same, I am open to making a -ac_cbmaturity option and using it in a future Hush update, but it needs to be tested first. I couldn't add anymore madness before launch

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Heno1974 just sent you 5 HUSH for being an active community member and reminding me we need new windows binaries: https://explorer.myhush.org/tx/3006675da47458145baa7793c93b906f5890acaa6f905a13a1778357a9b46745

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Heno1974 it's ok, everybody does their part. Thanks for bringing the windows binary issue to me. Various other people probably hit that and gave up and didn't ask for help

[26-Apr-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763

You need to connect a miner first before you can adjust settings.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://acpool.me is mining the wrong chain and their contact form doesn't work

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I tried my best.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bcmonster.com pool looks to have about 4 z9 mini's on the old Hush chain, and the rest is a few GPU and CPU's. Very little hashrate left on the old chain, in pools anyway

[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> I messaged ACPool through their Discord channel about mining the wrong Hush chain. Directed them back here if they need to get in contact.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pixelised thanks, you are a pretty swell internet person üíï

[28-Apr-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hopefully all/most exchanges have been notified and got the message. If they choose to keep mining the old chain, I can't stop them

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash would turn off their nodes forcibly after 16 weeks, but radix42 + I changed that to many years in the future in the Hush, because it always caused problems, and seemed against Satoshi's Vision, I guess

[28-Apr-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so those old Hush nodes will run for many years if given the chance. It provides us a research + development playground to study Sprout attacks as well, and 51% attacks as it does not have DPoW anymore

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 52 weeks past block 800,000, is when those old hush nodes will run. That is around 3-4 years I think, too tired to do the actual math

[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> You might see a Hush Classic down the track.

[28-Apr-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Because there's less competition, those miners are getting more old Hush coins...

[28-Apr-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Going by the mining stats for miners from those pools.

[28-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> without exchanges, development or security updates?
