[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sending funds to the Hush web wallet is another option. Less secure than a full node, but better than leaving it in Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> thanks 

i will download hushMate

[05-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SilentDragon is currently only an option for bleeding edge people that want to compile it, we don't have recent binaries yet

[05-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is an option for some people. Web wallet is simplest thing for people

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto this is the message I get

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To get funds out of agama, web wallet might be fastest. Then setup your full node and send funds to a more secure place. I consider the web wallet more secure than Agama right now

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto so hushMate is your option or silentdragon ?

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin hushmate for now

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein so you can't even open the mobile app?

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> ok..i will move on hush web wallet..and after on hushmate

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto correct

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein i think #community-support on KMD discord is the best, i never ran into that

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> is this fastest way or i can move directly on hushmate ?

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> https://discord.gg/sFFdXe

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> #community-support is for help with Agama stuff

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin fastest thing is to send funds out of Agama to Hush web wallet, that is very fast

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Then you can get HushMate working, and send funds there

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> instead of waiting until HushMate works

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There is an attacker actively draining funds

[05-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You are working against the clock

[05-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Wish I could tell you something different, but that is the truth

[05-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Oh Sh*t, i still haven't moved my :btch_logo: to safety

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @Duke  thanks duke, I’ll ask them, but this looks really bad

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> @dukeleto where i can find my adress

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> on webwallet

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> feels like when we switched chains but with no time

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> i send it to txbit

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Does this affect BTCH?

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin the web wallet should show you a bunch of wallets by default

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> from agama now they dissaper..appear transaction confirmed..0 hush on agama ...but not appear yet on txbit

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic this affects any coin that was used with Agama wallet, BTC, KMD, HUSH, anything

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not HUSH-specific

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any coin used in Agama is vulnerable

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but from agama now after i send they dissaper..so is ok ?  @dukeleto

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> I think I have BTCH in agama. Is there another wallet for BTCH?

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin you need to send funds to a new address that is not from agama

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> My HUSH aren’t in agama luckily

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> yes ..i send them to txbit exchange..

[05-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic command-line wallet is one option

[05-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> after i send them
.they dissapear from agama ..and i received message from txbit that i received hush..but arent on txbit yet..is ok ?  @dukeleto

[05-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin will take a bit to confirm

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FYI Graviex confirms in a few minutes, sometimes txbit takes a long time because they use 25 confirms

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Graviex is 5 confirms

[05-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> but if they dissaper from agama..is ok no ? if i already send them from agama..or they are really send when they are confirmed ?

[05-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic another trick is to create a Hush address outside of agama, and then send all your BTCH to that. You own that private key, and will be able to import it into a wallet whenever that gets figured out

[05-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> now more stolen coins to hit the market:Facepalm2:

[05-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin no comprendo

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh do you think you could revive the BTCH web wallet? There is a nice bounty for you if so 😃

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> so..from agama wallet i send them to txbit..after i send them they dissaper..i receive msg from txbit that i receive  amount of hush ..but no appear on txbit yet ...  @dukeleto

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH needs to live again, seems like a good time as any

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin look at your balances and you will see a "confirming" transaction or something

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not until 25 confirms will you see the balance in your exchange account, it's "confirming"

[05-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> my balance from agama or from txbit ?

[05-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin maybe screenshots would help. I don't quite understand

[05-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> What’s happening why move funds

[05-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Till when do we have

[05-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> there being stolen

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> agama is compromised

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Shitt

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Move them where online walllet?

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoJesus move funds or donate to hacker

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Does that mean other coins on agama such as kmd are being stolen

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 1 million KMD was stolen

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> all coins

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is not HUSH specific

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is Agama-specific

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoJesus make a new secure seed phrase here, grab an address, and all funds out of agama: https://wallet.myhush.org/ Then work on getting a more secure local full node wallet. But don't wait to move funds, move them now

[05-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't like to tell people to use the web wallet for large amounts, but this is different. The web wallet is more secure than Agama right now. An attacker is actively draining funds. KMD pre-drained many funds, but the attacker is still draining others.

[05-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD saved almost 100 BTC from being stolen by doing this, and 8M KMD

[05-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Papa D> Is there a need to worry about non agama wallets? Mainly our personal hush wallets?

[05-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> This why people dont trust this 💩 as a whole. The community needs to do a better job of Policing its self or the real ones will step in eventually...

[05-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto Thank you for your help brother, I am able to access funds using versus. Do you recommend I use some other wallet and transfer our anyway? If so, what is your preferences.

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Papa D full node wallets are not affected. This is an issue with GUI wallets that use nodeJS

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein anything that works sounds good to me 👍

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> My guess is that various other coins will be attacked like this, or already have

[05-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto  do you know how I can access btch on this verus thing?  Any particular full node wallet you recommend (sorry if that’s a rookie question)?

[05-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein i haven't ever used verus agama wallet, but it should support all coins that KMD agama supported. If you click on "Add Coin" you should be able to find BTCH?

[05-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Hammerstein https://github.com/hushmate/HUSHmate-swing-wallet/releases and https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon , tho SilentDragon is more bleeding edge and you need to compile that yourself

[05-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are working on binaries

[05-Jun-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> @dukeleto yep man, my bad, sorry.  I’ll use the Hushmate one then given whats happened here.  Versus is showing both my full hush and btch funds

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Agama connection error trying to switch to another server but nothing is happening

[05-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Server unreachable

[05-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> How am I supposed to send my coins

[05-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoJesus be patient and keep trying. Servers are overloaded

[05-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> servers probably see 1/1000th this amount of requests on a normal day

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CryptoJesus try using different coins

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> different coin servers are more or less overloaded

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you have 10 assets, try moving others if one server is overloaded

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> NINJA spv seems potentially down

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
