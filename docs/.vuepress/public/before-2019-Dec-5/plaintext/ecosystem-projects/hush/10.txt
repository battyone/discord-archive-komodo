[dscrd-hush] <hewwo> All I'm saying is that you shilled scams while knowing they were scams and it's badly undermining anything you can say about a project now. Deal with it. Also I don't think you're rich, people who're staying here are the ones who missed all the trains or the ones who're legitimately contributing. Seeing that you were on FIX and others, I'm not sure you're contributing to anything. And to be clear, I never got burned because of your advices, I never followed these, but I found it pretty bold that you still dare to hang around after all your unethical "marketing" during the bullrun. But hey, I guess the moon isn't here yet. I'm not salty about you helping scammers, I'm disapointed to see you still alive. And amused to be able to say you're still stuck here üòâ

[18-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hewwo> At least, as I said, now you're on a legit one.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those are my answers, there were some good ones

[18-Sep-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @FireMartZ since we have merged all that we want from ZEC  1.0.15, we can either choose to call the next release 1.0.14 or 1.0.15 or 2.0 or anything you want, you can decide! You are the decider

[18-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> adding dpow is a big change, and a hard fork, maybe Hush 2.0 makes more sense. This isn't the 1.x days anymore

[18-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the code is done, next is to test it with a small amount of notaries and if it works, then have all notaries run it

[18-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they can run off of dev branch, and if any last minute fixes are needed, we can merge those and then make a release which exchanges/etc can upgrade to

[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> Didn't look for a while here, any cool new stuff going on with Hush?

[20-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <MrMoyolo> Read something about a fork. Do I have to update my wallet?

[20-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Welcome back :D, there will be a fork coming in the very near future(code is done), we'll be incorporating features from 1.0.14 and 1.0.15 releases of zcash, and the biggest update is the implementation dPoW(delayed Proof of Work) which will protect Hush from any 51%/double spend attacks in the future(needs a fork). it's quite exciting.

[20-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we already have zcash 1.0.14 and the non-sapling stuff from 1.0.15 in our Hush `dev` branch, fyi. And `dpow` is merged into dev and I am working with KMD notary nodes to get Hush deployed to prod

[20-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> every notary node needs to install hush, sync it, import their keys, get funds, split up the funds into special amounts and a few other things, so it takes a bit of time

[20-Sep-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @MOCHO 17 if you want to tell your followers why we aren't a shitcoin, you can mention that we are in the process of implementing double spend protection for exchanges (just about nobody has this, not even ZEC) and this is our cross-platform GUI wallet: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng

[20-Sep-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's funny that I see people on twitter saying we are so tiny, because of our marketcap is 500K. I think we were around 5-10M marketcap during the height of bull run, marketcap is just an easily gamed statistic

[20-Sep-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Sep-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> have been*

[21-Sep-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> Can anybody explain why this is?

[21-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Karel Crypto take a look at #hush-github channel

[21-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> iirc most commits are done on the dev branch.

[21-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Karel Crypto yeah, commits go to `dev` branch, we only merge to master on a new release, we haven't pushed a release since 1.0.13

[21-Sep-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> still on rank 176, which is nice

[21-Sep-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> could be a nice marketing mechanism if you were ranked even higher

[21-Sep-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> mcap rank is 963, so a top 100 in commits would be a very strong sign

[21-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> love it how komodo is on the top of that list.

[21-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Karel Crypto once we merge dev to master, that ranking will change a lot.

[21-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> Yes, i can imagine

[21-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Karel Crypto> So might be a good idea üòâ

[21-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yep. it's part of a normal process, we merge it when there is a release. It will happen. Those stats are easily gamed, so concentrating on them too much is not valuable

[21-Sep-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Trading on Cryptopia has paused, it seems there was a 51%/double spend attack last night. So yeah, gonna be an interesting few days. KMD notary nodes are working on pushing Hush into prod (it's very close, we found some new code that needed to be written for Iguana to create Hush UTXOs. If that doesn't make sense, then just don't worry about it üòÉ )

[21-Sep-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even if every KMD notary node was running the latest dpow code, it would have taken time to notify Cryptopia and gotten them to care about updating. Oh, the timing of things.

[21-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If anybody has a human contact at Cryptopia, plz let me know

[21-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> yeah, what are to chances üòÖ, we get attacked just as dPoW is about to be online.

[21-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Do we know if it caused any harm?

[21-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> wow, ripple just passed ethereum in marketcap, what a crazy day

[21-Sep-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> is anyone else watching Ripple go thermonuclear?

[21-Sep-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Yeah, lets just hope others will follow, i couldn't stand ripple reaching No. 1 üòÇ

[21-Sep-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most likely somebody lost a bunch of money, probably Cryptopia

[21-Sep-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a double spend means the attacker is attacking the exchange

[21-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the exchange loses some HUSH or BTC in the process

[21-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea how much right now, it was reported in #developers, people looking at logs

[21-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it shows up as the blockchain doing a very large reorganization or "re-org", which normally should not happen

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD notaries are working on stuff: https://github.com/DeckerSU/SuperNET/commit/3ccea559584e4067cd40963e03bfaa72d6982d98

First approach to make iguana work with 2 bytes prefix coins, like...
Main additions:

+ bitcoin_address_ex
+ bitcoin_addr2rmd160_ex

These functions with support taddr param. For example, for HUSH prefix is
{ 0x1C, 0xB8 }, where is taddr = 0x1C and addrtype = 0xB8.

[21-Sep-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> currently testing that out, which should allow Hush to work properly on KMD notary nodes

[21-Sep-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> notary nodes must split up their money into specific sizes (0.0001 utxos), which are used in notarization transactions

[21-Sep-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has some differences that were not compatible, which are being fixed. It also makes KMD compatible with many other ZEC forks, which is good. It's not something only Hush has

[21-Sep-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Sep-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If we have permission for this I could spin out a copy modded for Hush

[21-Sep-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I like the graphics, I am not so keen on "unkillable" box

[21-Sep-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush doesn't have PoS, that doesn't apply. But the graphic is purely about dpow notarization blocks

[21-Sep-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i will offer a bounty to make a similar graphic to Hush. We need to explain DPoW on Hush in a single image, especially after this double spend attack

[21-Sep-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush benefits from dpow even more than Verus

[21-Sep-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because Hush has a slower 2.5 minute block time, only 4 Hush blocks fit inside a BTC block, which means selfish miners can only keep their own secretly-mined chain up to 4 blocks ahead, instead of an unlimited amount currently

[21-Sep-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Verus has 1 min block time, so 10 Verus blocks happen for every 1 BTC block

[21-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We should reach out through the KMD team that sets up graphic bounties

[21-Sep-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I know they get a pretty solid response with options to choose from when they post requests

[21-Sep-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i can see that in the future, they will highligh Hush more
