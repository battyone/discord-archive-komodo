[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the truthful TLDR

[24-Jun-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The reality is the price of Hush currently is dominated by mining cost

[24-Jun-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and a few whales grabbing it up

[24-Jun-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> @dukeleto. Many thanks, Leto.  Ivexbeen watching Hush for a while now.  Also watching ARRR and ZER.  Trying to determine whether to invest in all three or just one.  HUSH looks good to me.  Just trying   to see a reason for it to rise again

[24-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Me too! ðŸ˜…

Sneak preview of Silent Dragon with the latest $HUSH logo!
This shows our debug screen that gives various details about the backend "hushd" daemon. Users can send a screenshot to Discord to help debug issues and it is also very useful for developers, miners and pool ops

[24-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are working hard on this new GUI wallet, SilentDragon

[24-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which also has communication/chat abilities, via shielded (encrypted) memo

[24-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is focused on communications, where most other coins are focused on financial transactions. We like both

[24-Jun-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I work on and support ARRR, it's a sister coin to Hush

[24-Jun-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we both share a lot of code

[24-Jun-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZER devs seem pretty cool, but I don't know a lot about their recent work

[24-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If people value privacy more in the future, Hush is a store-of-privacy

[24-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is how it will have value. If people don't value privacy, it won't have value

[24-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Same goes for ARRR

[24-Jun-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, this is not financial advice, just ramblings from Duke

[24-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> ARRR is a good coin, but expensive at the moment. HUSH will very likely rise again, as it is expected the messenger could be widely used. Also wallet with by default shielded addresses should accelerate using of z-addr. As far sa I know ZER is still GPU mined, but has ZEC vulnerability. Infinite supply of coins can be secretly generated.

[24-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> @dukeleto With Libra launching next year we need all the privacy coins we can get....

[24-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @anglersec yes, Libra is good marketing for Hush + Pirate

[24-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate is at an ATH right now, I think

[24-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> up almost 900% in the last 6 months

[24-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so yes, Hush is cheaper to buy that Pirate right now, but Pirate is still more profitable to mine currently

[24-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> both are mineable by the same ASICs

[24-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> ARRR was for a long time at 600-700 sats. After halving should 1000 sats be enough.

[24-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and remember folks, profitability of mining is determined by when you SELL, not the value WHEN YOU MINED ðŸ˜¸

[24-Jun-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> @dukeleto  @halo kitty rules thank you both for taking the time to share your thoughts on the matter.  Much appreciated

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I wonder if zergpool can pay in hush if I mine pirate

[24-Jun-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX in theory it's possible. It may be that some coins are limited to only being mined and some can be used to do payouts, I am not sure. Do some research and report back!

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Innosilicon A9++'s will be delivered in the next month and my guess is that we will see all Equihash (200,9) coins see rising network hashrates. Where that nethash will go, to which coins, is the interesting question ðŸ˜º

[24-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Where can I order

[24-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good morning ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX people have been waiting for them for months

[24-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can't buy them, or if you do, you will pay a lot and wait a long time

[24-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am hearing reports of people being told by Inno that there are more delays or to be refunded

[24-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's always a risk to buy a mining rig that doesn't ship immediately

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Is there any easy to access WIF to WIF converter anywhere except on verus agama?

[24-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 i don't know of any other GUI for it, we have a gh issue to be able to import old-style keys directly into SD: https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragon/issues/16

[24-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's definitely something that I would like to add to SilentDragon

[24-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> are you wanting to convert an old Hush v2 WIF to the new style ?

[24-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I could write a Python script for it, but that doesn't help most people

[24-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm just thinking of a simple way for people to do it, at moment the option for most people is to download verus agama, not very intuitive if they want to use hushmate for example.  @dukeleto

[24-Jun-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 i agree with you that it's a really non-optimal solution currently. The other way is to use an old wallet.dat with -zawpwallettxes, but that is also not super user-friendly

[24-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we need GUI support for this stuff, but GUI code takes a lot of time. At least for me, I am still learning a lot about QT5, which SilentDragon uses. Talking to the backend hushd is very easy for me, but rendering a button or window a certain way, oh boy

[24-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> hey is it possible to fork verge?

[24-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Moeen possible to fork anything

[24-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> lol

[24-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> can you give me some information?

[24-Jun-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> if I fork for example verge

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> after that what are the requirements

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 ideally, all wallets should be able to use an old wallet.dat, start with -zapwallettxes, but it's not user friendly, what "should happen"

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what should happen is all funds are swept out of that old wallet.dat, to a new wallet.dat

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not good to use an old wallet.dat from hush v2 on the new v3 chain, indefinitely

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> -zapwallettxes is a hack all the way from BTC. BTC core people wrote that so they could claim funds on fork coins easily

[24-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you use old wallets, I have found, weird stuff happens. So you really must sweep funds out of it. That makes the whole process a little annoying to automate, for people and computers

[24-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Moeen i am not sure what your programming background is and I am not sure forking Verge talk is appropriate for this channel. I am also having a hard time thinking of where else you can go. #developers channel or #dev-general in KMD discord perhaps. The more important question is: Why do you want to fork Verge?

[24-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't actually know much about Verge, take anything I say with appropriate bags of salt

[24-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> anyway how much does it cost?  @dukeleto

[24-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> @dukeleto??

[24-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Moeen i am not sure what "it" refers to

[24-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> fork a coin and a block chain @dukeleto

[24-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> @dukeleto approximately

[24-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No idea. Monetary cost is the least of the problem

[24-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> tell me

[24-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> for the least one

[24-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> minimum

[24-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> might as well ask "How much does it cost to start a business?"

[24-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's a nonsense question with no answer

[24-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Finding people with the skills to do it is problem #1, not monetary costs

[24-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cost of the human skills to operate it is 100X or more of physical cost of servers/etc

[24-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Moeen> ok thanks
