[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Anyone can create a faucet there right? Or should it be a team member?

[31-May-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Not sure

[31-May-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> Just check Anyone can create

[31-May-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'll see if i can create one

[31-May-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> i wonder what would be a decent amount for the payout, maybe 0.05 hush?

[31-May-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 good evening and thanks for the graviex faucet!

[01-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> no problem looks like it's going fast, it has been redeemed 144 times already

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @cipi 50 hush for being awesome

[01-Jun-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> :money_mouth: @dukeleto sent @cipi **50.00 HUSH** (≈ $3.07).

[01-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This tip bot sure makes it easy to spend Hush and reward people that do awesome stuff. It makes it feel like even more like a currency, a medium of exchange

Just received my first shielded Sapling $HUSH mining payout from https://t.co/3FwIRlRAxq . Neither my address nor the amount of the payout are visible via block explorer: https://t.co/Vd949jsX19

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @webworker01 - MinerPond.com 5 hush for having a pool with zaddr payouts

[01-Jun-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> 💰 @dukeleto sent @webworker01 **5.00 HUSH** (≈ $0.30).

[01-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <webworker01 - MinerPond.com> @dukeleto thank you

[01-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <webworker01 - MinerPond.com> "change to pool" is the pool fee

[01-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <webworker01 - MinerPond.com> it's not taken from the coinbase

[01-Jun-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> Just curious can you still asure the emmission?

[01-Jun-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> Meaning the coinsupply can be calculated?

[01-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <yefuchen> Thank you !!! @dukeleto ☺

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> morning friends

[01-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good morning all!

[01-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Another good day of having over $1,000 in 24 hour volume. The community is all over Twitter about us right now, a ton of tweets about the project in the past few days! ❤️ Make sure to use $HUSH in your posts so we can see them as well 😁

[01-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Someone also added us to a twitter list (didn’t know those existed) where all KMD Ecosystem coin tweets get added. Should be good publicity 😁

[01-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Baby steps! 👶 🍼

[01-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX not sure what you mean, we do have a `coinsupply` RPC now, since migrating to an asset chain

[01-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @webworker01 - MinerPond.com thanks for clarifying. I wanted to clarify for people that the amount down there was not related to the mining payout amount. Most people see Greek when they see a block explorer 😃

[01-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> What I wanted to ask if how do you verify the full block reward was claimed for the mining?

[01-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX are you asking how to verify that a pool is not "skimming" some of the block reward, and not paying it all out to miners? That is a good question

[01-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Happy weekend friends

[01-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> ah never mind I thought the block is mined directly to a zs address. I should read properly 😦

[01-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX there is a future upgrade to zec for mining coinbase UTXOs directly to zaddrs

[01-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is super interesting, they plan to do that in their next network upgrade

[01-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> and they will still be able to validate/calculate the supply ?

[01-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX ZEC implements a "turnstyle" to check for sprout badness, i am not sure exactly how they will validate supply. That is one of the hard questions, is my guess

[01-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX my guess is that Pirate will want shielded coinbase, so KMD will probably merge that stuff in when it exists, and Hush will upgrade to it

[01-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's probably a mandatory update/hardfork to enable shielded coinbase, ZEC plans to enable it with their next "Blossom" upgrade

[01-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it might even require the transaction format to change

[01-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> specially for PIRATE that would be very interesting as these are currently ( other than notarizations ) the only visible transactions with useful data.

[01-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX yes, it's very strategic for Pirate, it would remove all transactions that are not notarizations, which is a huge reduction in metadata leakage and linkability analysis

[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> What do you guys think about zaddex?

[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Considering something to mine when I get my asic

[01-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X seems like a good idea. Also, LABS just became mineable yesterday or so

[01-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's nice to have options, and with a z9m, you can mine HUSH, KMD, ZEXO (they changed their ticker to that from ZEX), LABS or any other KMD asset chain and a bunch of other coins, like ZEN and friends

[01-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and don't forget ARRR. So many options!

[01-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Redfox labs?

[01-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Are there any considerations?  I've never ran an asic

[01-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <webworker01 - MinerPond.com> then switch to hush or arrr 😄

[02-Jun-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> GPU mining won't be very effective on an ASIC coin

[02-Jun-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @halo kitty rules i guess somebody is trying to buy up BTCH ahead of any news, the BTCH orderbook looks a lot more active than it's been lately

[02-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No, orderbook has only 2 active buyers. 1 of them is me. We are just bumping each other for 1 satoshi. Right now these orders are at 158 and 159 sats.
