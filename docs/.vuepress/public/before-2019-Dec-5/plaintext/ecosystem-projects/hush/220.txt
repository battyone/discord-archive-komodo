[dscrd-hush] <Berg> DigitalPrice? They delisted HUSH out of nowhere without warning

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hush has gotten unlucky w/exchanges

[10-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I bought hush on cryptopia

[10-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I liked the Bitcoin Hush fork

[10-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Graviex seems to be a good fit, they've been very responsive to updates and seem to have great security

[10-Sep-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do they KYC

[10-Sep-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I was thinking about the other pairings, bc they are largely mined coins daily, and that could stabilize the price, instead of swings...

[10-Sep-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> we were considering Crypto-Bridge, but then the whole fiasco with ARRR happened

[10-Sep-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Miners will use those pairings to move in and out

[10-Sep-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ARRR-KMD gets over 1btc daily vol

[10-Sep-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's CMC volume requirement...not that we care...

[10-Sep-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I think I'll just stick to atomicdex

[10-Sep-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> DP is messed up

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That upsets me

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We haven't been added to AtomicDex yet, have we?

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I know it was planned, but

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Oh shit

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Berg Version 2 is adding Hush

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> AtomicDex

[10-Sep-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hopefully released soon 🙂

[10-Sep-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> When does that release?

[10-Sep-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> might be a little while considering public beta just released. But at least its baking in the oven!

[10-Sep-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If DP just realized that they could've had a decent exchange ...... complaining about low vol when if they would've just stayed the course, it might've worked out

[10-Sep-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Screw em

[10-Sep-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> AtomicDex is coming

[10-Sep-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763

@ElectricCoinCo @ebfull @str4d @feministPLT is it possible to use this new (very cool) discovery on the current Zcash mainnet (via some future Network Upgrade) or does it require an entirely new mainnet which does not contain any old transaction types?

@dukeleto @ElectricCoinCo @ebfull @str4d Well, last time I said this I got wilfully misinterpreted by a lot of people, but honestly, I don't think it matters very much whether you spin up a new chain and transfer the note/UTXO set, or find a more incremental way to transit...

@feministPLT @ElectricCoinCo @ebfull @str4d well, I tend to agree with you @feministPLT, the new Hush mainnet did a "UTXO airdrop" so we could go pure Sapling. In my personal opinion, it would be worth it for Zcash to do the same to enable Halo and get rid of all pre-sync ...
Twitter

[10-Sep-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Zcash will need to do what Hush did for our new mainnet, to use Halo

[10-Sep-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> since Hush is pure-sapling, Halo doesn't really do a lot for us

[10-Sep-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Halo is very big for Zcash, tho

[10-Sep-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate might want to upgrade their chain to Halo one day tho, that might be better than trying to hack together a solution similar to Hush

[10-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not sure Hush really needs Halo

[10-Sep-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 i think @Berg has Delta or was trying it out

[10-Sep-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <pal> In my experience a good community member does not need to be very tech savy, but needs some basic common sense and a decent personality, ie, no fud when price drops, willing to contribute..... good exchanges need volume, and you need people to achieve volume, so it is necessary to attract the bigger audience into the community, the drawback is that discussion may not be as sophisticated

[10-Sep-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <pal> exchanges in these days need volume, so they list for free coins with most votes, I will pass these opportunites to the community
