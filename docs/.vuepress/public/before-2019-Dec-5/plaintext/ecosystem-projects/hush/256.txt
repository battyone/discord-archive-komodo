[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I had to write custom Hush code to dump info to even figure that out

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that patch helped to give the data of which xtn kerplodes

[14-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then i finally realized what was causing it, and reported to James/KMD folks

[14-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> To make it even more interesting, only nodes where *were not online at the time of the problematic block* coredump!!!!

[14-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All nodes which saw the xtn in their mempool, i.e. were online, did not coredump

[14-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Only nodes which have to "sync thru" that block coredump

[14-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is why it singled out GUI wallet users so much, because they are most likely to start/stop their node often

[14-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I had a suspicion that online nodes didn't experience the problem since all pools, explorers, exchanges and some community members didn't report any issues

[14-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I am happy that the pb was identified

Looking forward to integrating OnionShare with $HUSH
The encrypted memo field is the perfect medium for Alice to share a .onion URL with Bob while minimizing the number of potential 3rd parties that could be spying on Alice+Bob. https://t.co/h7G4Oluy6D

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't fully understand how ZecWalletLite works, to be honest

[14-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> very simple to use for a cli

[14-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can port all that to Hush, if we want

[14-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> would probably be not too hard, a good task for a tenacious learner 🙂

[14-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i could mentor somebody on it, but it's not something i have time to focus on

[14-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe i should make time, lol

[14-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> originally, zec lite wallets were not going to support memos, and they were basically dead to me

[14-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> aditya has come up with something, that i need to fully understand

[14-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if it's appropriate for Hush, then it looks like we want that stuff

[14-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> thats nice for big Blockchains like zec or for smartphone Apps etc

[14-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, it's SPV (not nspv) for zaddrs

[14-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in theory, we could have a wallet for Hush that does nSPV (superlite) for taddrs and zecwallet-lite-style for lite zaddrs

[14-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many things are possible

[14-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's nice to have options 🙂

[14-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i guess SilentDragonAndroid could learn how to do this stuff, and either pair to a full-node OR be a lite-wallet for zaddrs. If only I could self.clone()

[14-Oct-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Viewingkey already implemented in zec?

[14-Oct-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Oct-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the PR is almost 1 year old

[14-Oct-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> It will be really interesting to learn why they didn't implement it in the first place.

[14-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very deep reasonable reasons

[14-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: it gives up privacy, to ask a 3rd party server for *just* the xtns or blocks that you have xtns in

[14-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with taddrs, there is no privacy

[14-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but using an electrum-like server, with zaddrs, is different

[14-Oct-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so zecwalletlite has done something new and interesting

[14-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so asking a server for the memo data from xtns 34544,45454,45456263, that is no good. you have to ask for large %'s of the chain

[14-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to disguise what data you care about

[14-Oct-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's deep reasons, not that Zcash was being unreasonable

[14-Oct-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> Ok, interesting but how does that relate to users running a full node and wanting to use viewingkey? It was in the specs and so far not implemented in zec? If there is nothing wrong with the implementation of the viewingkey (used in KMD for example), why doesn't zec just include it (or their version of course) in their code?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda fyi the PR i linked is an updated version of 3060. it's all about importing/exporting them, in a format that zcash likes and is "official". KMD/Hush just want something that works and so we just merged it and mess with it
