[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> damn..i dont understand...after ledger nano ..not windows wallet is the safer ?

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, well at least your HUSH is covered in case everything goes FUBAR

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> how agama wallet can be hacked if it is windows wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Woah thank buddy@dukeleto

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Agama uses nodeJS

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and nodeJS has thousands of modules that agama needs to run

[05-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> one of those "dependencies" was poisoned

[05-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that it recorded information like seed phrases and private keys, allowing the attacker to sweep out funds

[05-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is the very high level idea of what happened

[05-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> I used lite

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Where do i get a secret phrase for the online wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good question

[05-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> random words are good

[05-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you could use https://dogeseed.com/ or choose every 5th word on pages of your favorite book, just make sure it's random

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Does hush web take btch

[05-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> What do i do with btch?

[05-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chewy> Any advice appreciated.  This is only a sanity check question, but just making sure I prioritize my time where it needs to go first.  If I only used the old v2 HUSH full node windows wallet, and have not claimed my HUSH v3 coins on the KMD Asset chain yet there should be zero problems correct?  They were never used on AGAMA in any way.

[05-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chewy> By old version 2 one, I mean the one that looked almost like the radix zec version one.

[05-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chewy> Think it was the one she stopped supporting, but it looked very similar to the HUSH wallet.

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Chewy Yes, only if u used AGAMA then u need to move funds out asap to a new wallet.

[05-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chewy> Thank you.

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Chewy as long as u have wallet.dat and your private key. you should be fine.

[05-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Guys i know ive asked alot of questions but agama aint working and i have three assets including Hush and Bitcoin Hush. What do i do if the wallet is not connecting? Just wait? Or is there something we can do

[05-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Cheers

[05-Jun-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

How to Generate new address quickly?
Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)

Alternative method to generate new address
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

How to send funds to the new address?
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2. You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

Where to send funds?
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You can use the Veruscoin Agama to connect

[05-Jun-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Using your old seed / WIF

[05-Jun-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was just able to connect and send my funds out of Agama v 0.3.6 beta

[05-Jun-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It was having issues retrieving fees for sending, but eventually worked

[05-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the servers are overloaded, but keep trying

[05-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ALSO, it is an option: You can send funds to the Hush tip bot as a temp solution. Not recommended for large amounts

[05-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg thanks for than awesome summary above

[05-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Brilliant thank you

[05-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Do i need to download testflight to get veruscoin wallet

[05-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> If you have BTCH from the airdrop, an option is to send them temporarily to https://www.coinexchange.io

[05-Jun-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It is a much safer solution than keeping them in agama

[05-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Agama doesnt work tho

[05-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Are there server probelms due to traffic?

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> anyone has a link to the analyses of Agama issue? Exactly how it was detected etc .

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Also why is hush not on the latest agama update

[05-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It is, i just used it this morning to move my Hush off Agama 0.3.6b

[05-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> I have agama 0.2.34 and 0.5.6

[05-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Its on 0.2.34 and not on 0.5.6

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Is that the veruscoin agama, the 0.5.6?

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Yeah

[05-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Cant find the normal one

[05-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> No link for the lastest agama

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> In earlier versions of the komodo agama you needed to activate experimental setting to see Hush, maybe it's the same case in the verus agama?

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Dont think so will try not

[05-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> But is there a way to download the v0.3.6 since its not on github

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> the agama wallet 0.3.6 by komodo is the version which is affected by the vulnerability

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> So if im using an older version that means im safe?

[05-Jun-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Why is bitcoin hush website and discord not available

[05-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It's moved address new one is https://bitcoinhush.github.io/

[05-Jun-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Thanks

[05-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> BTCH offers no benefits? Why was it even created in the first place. All I know I sold out hush before BTCH snapshot.

[05-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I reentered hush after 2months and both the price of BTCH and Hush was 80% down. lol

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH was a way to experiment with KMD asset chains, and also try something that hadn't been done before, to my knowledge: airdrop 4 different chains onto a new chain. It was always billed as experimental. It had some things before Hush (like DPoW), but now is behind Hush in terms of technology. It's due for a revival soon, and most likely it will be 50% PoS and 50% PoW. Right now it's just a token that is not mineable. It was not even possible to create mineable asset chains when BTCH was created. Those were dark times @ITM

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH will always stay 100% PoW and BTCH will be our playground to try out 50/50 stuff, essentially

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> if i never moved my BTCH, can i just import my private key somewhere safe?

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If we believe the world needs more cryptocoins, not less, than having 2 coins is better than 1, I think

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic i have heard that Verus Agama works with BTCH, if you want to use that. A CLI full node is safer for larger amounts

[05-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't want to be alarmist, but what happened to Komodo Agama could happen to Verus Agama. It's the same codebase

[05-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> yeah i just dont have time for that for the next few days.  running around with limited access

[05-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Verus Agama is considered safe and works with BTCH currently. Long-term, I must tell people that Verus Agama is the same codebase as KMD Agama, which I believe is being deprecated over all this

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic we are working on a BTCH web wallet too, but definitely move all funds out now to Verus Agama, that is safer than leaving it

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The attacker went after KMD first, it seems

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e., for every seed phrase, the attacker looked for funds on KMD chain first, not others

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I haven't heard a report of stolen HUSH or BTCH or anything else yet

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just KMD was stolen, as far as I know

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> yeah i guess im just a  little confused about where im moving my BTCH "from" since they just sit on the original key

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> i guess that key is no longer safe so i need to access the coins and move them to a new key?

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[05-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> move all funds that ever touched agama, unfortunately

[05-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the safest and best way. Agama is deprecated, discontinued/etc

[05-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> it seems an exchange is safer than an agama codebase RN...

[05-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> when i open Agama it doesnt seem to sync / show my BTCH balance

[05-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> which version of Agama are you using @Cryptographic

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> 0.3.5

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> v.0.3.6 is what you need

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> i also have a copy of v 0.2.43

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> No problem. The servers were really overloaded earlier but i think they're ok now. All people I know have been able to move their funds out
