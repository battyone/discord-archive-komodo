[dscrd-hush] <1112> Please no marketing. let me buy more HUSH first. nom nom nom

[16-Oct-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> lol

[16-Oct-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Kek
It is a great price right now

[16-Oct-19 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> HushList is big, for me

[16-Oct-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> great price for buying or selling ? I bought 20$ worth few months ago (I bought coins of some kmd projects)

[16-Oct-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And Duke, he seems to be one step ahead of most

[16-Oct-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> For buying

[16-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> you can't distinguish an ATL than a local low before it reaches a new high. I mean that price can always be divided by 2

[16-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I bought some KMD when it was at 9500 sat and when it was at 8500 sat. I didn't sell so I didn't accept the loss but I bought local lows and not ATL

[16-Oct-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> buying ATL is difficult

[16-Oct-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I had the chance when some traders called bottom when BTC was at 3000€ and it went up but I didn't took it

[16-Oct-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Buying ATL is near impossible to measure

[16-Oct-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> But, when you use Bitcoin and Ethereum, as tools to find an ATL, it becomes easier

[16-Oct-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I can tell you the low for Ethereum will be around 0.015 btc, or $90-100

[16-Oct-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> If it goes lower, it is on a steep steep dive.

[16-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I hope that bitcoin will go back to 3k

[16-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> By that standard, I can use Ethereum for  market sentiment

[16-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Bitcoin probably will not see 3k, maybe 4.4k

[16-Oct-19 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> why don't you use the altcoins indexes (on trading view or other tools) ?

[16-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Indexes?

[16-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> it is an average of altcoins based on marketcap I think

[16-Oct-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I've read CMC prices daily,  everyday for the last 5 years..

[16-Oct-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I know most coins history off the top of my head

[16-Oct-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Oct-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> if BTCUSD is stable but ETHUSD bubbles, you can buy it and profit

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> There's the best market indicator

[16-Oct-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> because if money begins to flow in shits such as Tron or Iota, you know that it is a sign that an altseason may not be far (usually, doge and ltc pumps before others)

[16-Oct-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> We agree on doge

[16-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> you can follow Beetcoin on twitter

[16-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <keysersoze> Beetcoin haven't heard that name in years.

[16-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I know him in real life

[16-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I had some (few) universtity courses before crypto with him and I saw him on meetups since I join cryptoworld

[16-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <keysersoze> @phm87 I followed him on Twitter years ago guy seemed to know his stuff for sure

[16-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> yes

[16-Oct-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> finally, after years of papers, he launched his investment fund

[16-Oct-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I just chart myself and make profitable trades. Its not difficult.  Just takes some patience

[16-Oct-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> he really tried to open it in Belgium his country but it was not possible so he opened it in Luxembourg but he works for his cryptofund from belgium

[16-Oct-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I was able to make some good trades, I gained few %

[16-Oct-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> but I missed some huge pumps and I lose some money because of bad decisions under emotion

[16-Oct-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I don't trade under emotion.
I set the trade up and walk away

[16-Oct-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> I mean that I finished a trade, I made profit I was happy (emotion), then I began a new trade in the current short timeframe (bad decision)

[16-Oct-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <keysersoze> @phm87 when I first started charting in 2012 I ran across him man that brings back memories I was gambling back then be 10-15 BTC one day and loose it all in a week lol I have to learn the hard way.

[16-Oct-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> loosing 10 BTC is a lot today ... maybe it was not that bad in 2012

[16-Oct-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> @dukeleto your Hush community is good and kind, I will stay here. World is tiny

[16-Oct-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> @keysersoze 7 years of charting, you must be good

[16-Oct-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <keysersoze> @Crypto99 i learned to trade longer time frames and not let my emotions effect the trade. As far as being good. Well that's a relative term. I can consistently grow my stack of cryptos and not loose money.

[16-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <keysersoze> @Crypto99 I keep it simple support and resistance levels and Andrews pitchfork theory.

[16-Oct-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <phm87> charting is not everything : money management to avoid to put too much on any trade is important, calculation of stop loss and take profit is involved (but stop loss can be dangerous on cryptos sometimes)

It's troubling that some of our highest profile shitposters think that you can use Bitcoin mainnet in a way that "keeps details private, at least mostly". Metadata leakage analysis using graph theory works exceptionally well against CoinJoin/Whirlpool/etc, much easier than...

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I applaud the idea of ETH mixers, as a technology. It's just I am just too jaded by knowledge of why these things are destined to fail, due to no fault of the coders.

[17-Oct-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since ETH has no UTXOs, only balances, I am not really an expert on metadata leakage there. It's an interesting project to learn about, thanks @Crypto99

[dscrd-hush] <1112> I tried to build the Linux version of Silent Dragon but after trying 3 distros i just can't get all networking working and all the prerequisite packages installed. I know there's a lot of other work, but i hope the stuck block issue on Windows wallets can get a fix.
