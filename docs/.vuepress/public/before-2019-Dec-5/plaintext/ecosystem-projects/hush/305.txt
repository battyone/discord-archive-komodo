[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Privatoshi The Discord application must compress the images.  Did you click on 'View original'?

[30-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm unsure.

[30-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Either way, it was good to be done with that.

[30-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Next time it will be preferable to send
 pictures by email.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> If you want but that should not be necessary.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> let us know if you have questions

[30-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @BigLez do you have time to look at the Dragon icon?

[30-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And some tablet sized screenshots?

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> sure

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> also does your app support iOS 6/Android 4.3?

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I use linux so Im jut curious

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm not sure if it supports Android 4.3

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I can send you the apk

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I need to take the programmer pill, I demand more blackberry os apps

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And you can try to install it

[30-Nov-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> no stress I'll just peep the linux one

[30-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> SilentDragonLite is nice

[30-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> SDA is Android-only for the time-being, until we get an iOS dev

[30-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Does it support 4.3 Android?

[30-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea why it wouldn't

[30-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have no idea about 4.3

[30-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or what it changes

[30-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> usually new android versions support most/all apps from previous version, but too much shit changes and i can't keep track of it all

[30-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We need a SilentDragon icon and tablet screenshots. Let me get the requirements.

[30-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @BigLez glad to hear you use Linux, you will fit in nicely around here üôÇ

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "checkm8" is the name

[30-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it exploits a bug in the bootrom of most older iOS hardware

[30-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so it's permanent and unpatchable

[30-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> is it untethered

[30-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> if its not untethered I will back hand you digitally

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> pretty sure untethered but that lingo is not familiar to me

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> also my new car is a stick

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am not a jailbreaker by trade

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> its epic, this is way more fun to drive than my old automatic

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> every car should be stick üòõ

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I barely know how to drive stick. my dad is teaching me

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I will never buy a automatic car!

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Yeah stick is best. 
Jailbreak that iPhone & run SDLite

[30-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> well it's still has a boardcomputer so it is electric üòõ

[30-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Driving a stick is just a balance between your left and your right food

[30-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> it was a bit rough at first when i first moved though, because I kept going into the left lane

[30-Nov-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Well I am in Australia right now and I still have to get used of everyone driving on the left xD

[30-Nov-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> couple of weeks ago I was crossing the street and looking to the right and just walked. A car had to go full on the brakes because I didn't look on the right and had my headphones on haha

[30-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I mean I didn't look on the left

[30-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
