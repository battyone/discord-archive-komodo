[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i would pay a bounty

[10-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Okay NP

[10-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @pal I would like to see us get listed on TradeOgre, they have ignored all comms from Hush in the past. If you know a guy, make it happen üòÉ

[10-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> most other exchanges I heard mentioned don't interest me much, maybe crex24. I feel like we were on that exchange, they added us for free but maybe delisted us for low volume? Can't remember

[10-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> A thing or two, might be altered here and there...
U know how privacy apps and time work.. Sometimes they make decisions that require them to be taken off and a new one out in their place

[10-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi yeah, i am looking for high level advice with a few specific pointers, versus babyfeeding. The docs can assume a knowledgeable reader, just unfamiliar with that particular niche

[10-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> everything has changed since I last look at this stuff in maybe 2009

[10-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> ok.. Hardened, not offensive, correct?

[10-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cyanogen was a thing

[10-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> TBH it hasn't changed much

[10-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Cyanogen got bought by Google

[10-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi offensive intrigues me, but pentesting/hacking/redteam is not the focus. Blue team is actually the goal

[10-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you were Blue team, what android would you use?

[10-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Milo> @Berg sent you a DM üôÇ

[10-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> modify a bunch of settings

[10-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi dump it into a github gist and you are mostly there üôÇ

[10-Sep-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Haha

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi did Cyanogen become Copperhead ?

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or is that a diff codebase?

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Cyanogen went into Google

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good lort

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> into the G-hole, we say

[10-Sep-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so many people I knew, friends, colleagues. Once you get hired by Google, most go "into the G-hole", never to be heard from again

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's rare to keep interacting with the filthy non-Googler masses

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It says it has moved away from Cyanogen code altogether

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> good

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Haha

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Ones I like to use remove GAPPS

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because cyanogen was paperclip and duct tape, on it's best day

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That's what the big deal is

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> GAPPS

[10-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It wraps around everything

[10-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> U can't be private with GAPPS

[10-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> U have to disable the Play Store

[10-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Use FDroid

[10-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> U can network into TOR on fdroid to download repos

[10-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Cyanogen was okay Duke

[10-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Good for a community project

[10-Sep-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, i mostly kid

[10-Sep-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i hear many people speak of the evils

[10-Sep-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's constantly sending metadata to those G servers

[10-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I mean, what do we expect

[10-Sep-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm just glad facebook didn't get into phone software OS

[10-Sep-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They missed it

[10-Sep-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi you can easily fork that gist and update it in a browser, and if you dont' have a github account they take about 3.6 seconds to make

[10-Sep-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> This is what you'll see ..
And these are custom ROMS..
But usually there is a clean rom..
Or there is a debloating script.

[10-Sep-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> If I can keep my os, get rid of gapps, and debloat any bs completely, I'll do that.

[10-Sep-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But Linage OS & Copperhead OS do make it easier.

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Since we will emphasize security, we have to go with one of those two.

[10-Sep-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Bc I cant tear down a custom rom and ensure its 100%
