[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Good morning gents

[05-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hola

[05-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we surpassed 100,000 blocks on the HUSH v3 mainnet!

[05-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> 🎉

[05-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> time sure does fly on the blockchain

[05-Oct-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio I appreciate you seeing through all the garbage people are saying

[05-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh `arent the updates mandatory ` where do you make this stuff up?

[05-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC did force nodes to update, and I have not heard one person say they will do that for Pirate or KMD

[05-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so everybody will be vulnerable for a long time

[05-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i would rather answer you in public, about why I an displeased with Pirate, but mostly MrLynch

[05-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He didn't see the important of this, fought me on it, wasted so much time, and wasted others time trying to tell them I didn't know what I was saying. Fast forward a few days, and a Stanford paper comes out vindicating me 100%. But Pirate had already ostracized me, I wanted nothing to do with a team lead by somebody as inept at MrLynch

[05-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Which is why I asked them to remove me from their website as a contributor, and left their Discord

[05-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh do not ask me these questions in private anymore, i am sick of it

[05-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally, he fought me on the ITM attack stuff, wasting time to the point of me questioning his actual motives and why he has the power and position he does, given that he can't seem to do any C++ full node coding worth a damn. In any case, everyone is free to run their own ship and my ship is Hush

[05-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I realized doing free work, and being treated like garbage while trying to teach people the error of their ways, well, it doesn't pay well enough

[05-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is why I will not contribute directly to Pirate any longer, even tho I have thousands of lines of code I could send

[05-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate people never respected Hush, anyway, didn't realize we are older

[05-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have more history

[05-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and the procotol HushList, originates here

[05-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this tip bot is lazy

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Lol

[05-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Duke.  I think we are all cominity members.  And any coin gladly takes free contributions including hush

[05-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But thank you for repriorizing

[05-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Reprioritizing

[05-Oct-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We respect the work you do

[05-Oct-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX i appreciate that

[05-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am focused on actually protecting Hush for the long term

[05-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash just put a bandaid out

[05-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They know nobody uses their zaddrs, anyway

[05-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Didn't even care enough to put out binaries yet

[05-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> For Hush and  Pirate, this is actually a much bigger deal

[05-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD is doing a lot of testing, they have merged the entire 2.0.7-3 release into KMD and will release that soon, that is good

[05-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It won't be mandatory tho, and some (many) users will stay vulnerable until the next hardfork in December

[05-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so, we could rush to do a meh job that almost nobody will update to anyway, or we can spend a little time making things more secure for the long term before we get locked into our next mandatory update

[05-Oct-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So I choose to think long-term

[05-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am going to protect Hush against this IP-leak and the ITM attack as best I can, so that it's there before the next hardfork. I am developing this in a private repo and will release it when appropriate

[05-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know of any Pirate-specific development outside of KMD porting of ZEC code, I guess you can go to their discord if you want to know about that stuff

[05-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am blissfully unaware of their issues/problems now, and it's great

[05-Oct-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just found this paper: https://lelantus.io/lelantus.pdf

[05-Oct-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM you would probably like that ^

[05-Oct-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lelantus is a new protocol

[05-Oct-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> by Zcoin and now being used by BEAM and other coins it seems

[05-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM BEAM/GRIN/MW require an active malicious node to record history, their transaction graph is on their p2p network, but not recorded on the blockchain. This means ZEC+XMR coins are just easier to analyze, than MW coins, but a motivated attacker can still extract the transaction graph

[05-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lelantus-MW is to fix that

[05-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Because the tx graph is not easily accessible, it actually means only evil people that record the entire internet have access to it, average people don't and cannot go back in time to record the p2p network

[05-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so evil people have the data to do ITM-style attacks, but average people won't have sufficient data

[05-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Only the worst evil people can reduce your privacy" unfortunately doesn't make me sleep better at night

[05-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why Lelantus-MW is some interesting stuff
