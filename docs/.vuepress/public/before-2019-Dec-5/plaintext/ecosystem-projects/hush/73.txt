[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> the daemon crash only happens if you use the swing wallet. normal z tx using pure CLI doesn't crash.
i used my locally compiled bins in Ubuntu to get this crash data

[21-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> and used the HUSHmate Swing wallet by @TheTrunk

[21-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> so, just to confirm i used Linux

[21-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> Yes it is not related to OS - tested on all platforms

[21-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `364            return this->chainPower.nHeight;`

[21-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> i ran the daemon on a separate window using `gdb` and started the HUSHmate jar file standalone

[21-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SHossain very useful debug info, i am not sure that `chainPower` should be used, and i don't think this is hush-specific bug

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SHossain if you tried to do all of this in the same GUI with a diff asset chain, it would happen in KMD core

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> yes, we assumed that üòÉ

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> i notified jl777 as well

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> chainPower is a verus thing

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's being used when it shouldn't be

[21-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is causing this massive failure

[21-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `this->chainPower` is undefined, so trying to look for the `nHeight` entry inside of it, blows up

[21-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> chainPower is only when there is mixed PoS/PoW, iirc

[21-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I have not reviewed all these changes that came from VRSC into KMD

[21-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SHossain this may also be a bug in VRSC itself, or just in how it was merged to KMD

[21-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SHossain the core issue is that `GetHeight` assumes `this->chainPower` always has been set, and that is not the case here

[21-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> I'll ping Miketout as well in this case

[21-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @SHossain @TheTrunk try using this commit and see if the segfault goes away: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/commit/4b8ae2623231e15b7a997faa12b448b5f0e328a3

[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> @dukeleto @jl777c  @TheTrunk the crash is now gone and swing wallet working fine with sending z tx
however, there are stdout prints like this

[21-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> these printouts stop after the tx is confirmed

[21-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> confirmed, these printouts happen after sending a tx and until it is confirmed

[21-Apr-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also made this to improve things upstream, too

[21-Apr-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> of course the null block hash doesn't exist! It was an overzealous warning, which is actually something that can happen normally. Unconfirmed transactions do not have a height, because they have not been included in a block yet

[21-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> @TheTrunk what does the Close button uses? `pkill -15` or `kill -9`?

[21-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> ?

[21-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> or, does it uses `./komodo-cli -ac_name=HUSH3 stop`

[21-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> No I am using 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=HUSH3 stop
```

[21-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <SHossain> when you close the Swing app, it closes the daemon as well. even if the daemon was started externally.

[21-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TheTrunk> yes

[21-Apr-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability Zelcore is talking to the old Hush chain, and is not a supported wallet, mostly because it's closed source

[21-Apr-19 04:47 PM] addaeus#4492
I am trying to use the the Lite wallet. Can I use my t1 WIF seed to see my new R HUSH3 coins? Can some point me in the right direction so I can read how to get my t1 coins off of the old wallet to the Lite wallet. Thanks

[21-Apr-19 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@addaeus the coins from the old chain are already on the new chain, there's nothing for you to do
if you want to see the R address before Agama is updated, you can use this page:

[21-Apr-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> old HUSH WIFs are not the same as new HUSHv3 WIFs, but there is an agama tool in the "Tools" menu called Wif-to-Wif that can convert between them, fyi

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> What do you mean , vague ?

[21-Apr-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I click on the "Get address" button and nothing happens. This is not a vague statement - it is facts.

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ```If you use the current Agama and you have your t address WIF

'Get WIF'
and the output is your WIF for the new chain```

[21-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if you select HUSH as the wif to wif coin the output will be empty because 1=1

[21-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability with your new WIF, you could import that into the CLI wallet, if you really wanted to learn a bit

[21-Apr-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think i saw you using the binaries already, iirc

[21-Apr-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `hush-cli importprivkey SUPER_SEKRET_PRIVKEY`

[21-Apr-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that's it, and then you can use `hush-cli getwalletinfo` to see your updated balance with that private key added to your wallet

[21-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> using CLI wallets might not be as fun, but when things break and go really wrong in a GUI wallet, knowing how the insides work is extremely valuable to anybody, not only developers
