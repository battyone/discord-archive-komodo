We are in discussions with @Cryptopia_NZ about updating to the upcoming $HUSH release and re-opening the wallets. We do not have a timeframe estimation on completion, but we are working towards a new release, $HUSH 2.0.1.  

@TradeSatoshi markets are up to date and trading!

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX nice work, looks like you made a lot of progress!

[29-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> my guess, is that some icons might not load because nobody has ever run this under windows and some file paths might use / instead of \ or something like that

[29-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX there is very old code, that i didn't write, to auto-download hush and sync it, but it needs work. I don't use/rely on it, i always start my own hushd and then open hush-ng to connect to it

[29-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh i think we have about 10+ languages for hush-ng, but only English + French are currently in the github repo, where can the other files be found? I would like to commit them to the hush-ng repo, even if they aren't fully working/enabled, so they don't get lost

[29-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh i just found https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/pull/61 but it has some merge conflicts, but they look small. Maybe we can work together to get it merged?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM your analysis seems reasonable, but maybe  you can explain more about ` I still recommend we link the proof to a coin as stellar/ripple instead of KMD. `

[29-Dec-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto This is regards to 51% attacks. dPoW vs Ledger. As soon as a block is confirm it creates on a ledger(close to dapp). So instead of POS/POW or POW/DApp or POW/dPOW. Transaction fee is fix so by building it at this point for 1B blocks will cost extremely low(380 years). 12000 XLM/ 10000 XRP. Just my 2 cent. Just dPow I feel is still vulnerable in a way and tied down to a protocol.

[29-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so we still have the good mining aspect and fairness in block creation. Just 51% and double spend will be a thing of the pass. Nice part it can be changed at software level and no hard/soft fork required.

[29-Dec-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> KMD Notarization, as long as a pool as 33% of the power, any protocol can cause chain splitting. Having 51% power is peanuts if 33% of the pool is split chain. Atm most coins sacrificing longer confirmation times on exchanges. I can say 1000 confirm its difficulty to attack since too costly, is cheaper to attack bitcoin. We saw hash rates of 80PH/s(Sha256 combine), now we at below 40PH. Yes its costly. But compromising 2 pools for 1 hour it free, no cost to the attacker beside hacking those pools. So dPOW in my 2 cent opinion is not a solution just a hack around.

[29-Dec-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> a pool can have 99% hashrate, still the notarization cannot be overcome

[29-Dec-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> you are making invalid assumptions

[29-Dec-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c am not, its also on KMD and dPOW paper. It the current best solution but does not solve issue.
Taking from https://gist.github.com/leto/f88a56f751361f32e5ae503078bbc0d4
`Why is this the best solution to prevent attack on Hush?
KMD's notarization service is the best currently known open source way to prevent double spends on exchanges and makes life hard for 51% attackers. It does not prevent a large miner from launching a 51% attack, but it prevents the attacker from accomplishing their final goals of stealing funds and also makes life harder for evil/selfish miners.`

[29-Dec-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c but my argument was not dPow will not work, its just an opinion why I feel stellar/ripple could be a better fit. I could be wrong. the first chain splitting was done by me on FTC(2013) network after a argument about why chaining with BTC is useless. Can google 'ismailtm ftc'. All I did was chain split, mine with my asic(no double spend), the difficulty went from 10x more then ltc. I left and miners left. Some idiot went to then 51% attacked coin and put blame on me lol.  Problem is you don't need 51% hash power to cause an attack. Lets say I have 10% hash rate, My luck for 50 blocks is all 1%. The network will see me as having 990%+ hashrate. Now if the user is evil, it could use the luck bump to his advantage but that 1 in 10^50 odd of that happening.

[29-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> certainly large hashrate miners can cause mischief, but the focus is to prevent double spend. that removes the financial gain and it cant become a profitable business to be attacking chains

[29-Dec-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto  that may be true regarding the paths. That is why I’m looking for the files themselves.  Once I know they are in the right location.  Correcting paths is a non issue. Are the icons in the GitHub?

[29-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> If not.  We can create them.

[29-Dec-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c I agree. I was just thinking more scalibility. If price is 10x more then KMD, the hashrate will be 10x more. Then we in the inverse situation and KMD Notarization is useless. Then we back into version 3 and exchange block for another year. If I implemented hush as a payment method, I will have been screwed. I had a demo last month, imagine telling the investor sorry I cannot show you real time since exchanges are offline, they will canned the project. We went with ripple, stellar and digibytes and they minds was blown away. Touch at packing meter, touch for electricity and a touch for any store. All cases, it beat visa and money reflected instantly in the merchant account. No waiting 30 days, fees of 0.5%(5x cheaper) and best part is the customer authenticated(trust). In South Africa we have credit card skimming(NFC and chip) and using cryptocurrencies just proved to be a valid business case.

[29-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM I don't agree. Even if somehow the hashrate of Hush became larger than KMD, it's KMD that is the bridge to send that data to BTC, which will almost certainly always have a higher hashrate

[29-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so even in that case, KMD dpow provides a valuable service, to give us BTC hashrate security

[29-Dec-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX you need to open the web inspector and you can see all kinds of warnings and errors

[29-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto hehe, I know that KMD will be enough for 51% attack. I not denying it, I also mention we took measurement in place to prevent this happening again. I really really happy we did so. But I still felt if we went directly to stellar/ripple as the underlying it will have been unique and better. Since we are using Notary nodes which stellar/ripple has way better architecture around that.
Currently I feel that if we greater then KMD hashrate, we will have to read notary data directly from BTC to be safe. Notary is like a ledger and KMD/BTC fees is much more then stellar/ripple.
if we went and build on top of Stellar+ripple hybrid they will have to attack both entities.(Bank and stellar). 
`I will have done it differently. 
Make it POS like ethereum is doing, have stellar as validator and ripple as the underlying audit(cannot be validator since not decentralize). So no power consumption and way more decentralize. Each POS node pays the stellar+ripple fees or go through a provider as submission when submitting block. This the price of block will always be of value`
But anyways we are secured with dPOW and I am happy with solution.

[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I’m sure folks have asked this question, but I haven’t accessed my agama wallet in months, how do I access my Hush (the wallet I am using is indicating multiple errors)

[30-Dec-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Do I delete the current version of agama and download another?

[30-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Hammerstein Hi, It is preferred that you download and use the newest version of agama wallet from https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ . If you want to delete your older version, just go in to the AgamaApp installation folder and run the uninstall agama

[30-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> And when I try to open the new one it is stuck on verifying agama

[30-Dec-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Is this common?

[30-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> where is the verifying agama message appearing? is it during installation? you could try restarting your computer

[30-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> I just tried mobile app and it worked fine, appreciate your help.  (I guess there is an issue with the desktop wallet)

[30-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> cool, You can always ask the guys over at Komodo discord about problems with the agama wallet, since they are the ones develop it. 👍 https://discordapp.com/invite/kS3vx9J

[30-Dec-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I do have the latest version of agama wallet, and it's been working great 😃

[30-Dec-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the problem with stellar/ripple is that it can be edited

[30-Dec-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I though hushng would have some kind of integration with btch

[30-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it will in the future but it has to be coded, the plan is to get hush-ng up and running first and then do integration for btch after that, at least that's what i've heard

[30-Dec-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I would say we are far from that.   We need to have btch work with hush list

[30-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We need to bring some value to btch for btch 2.0

[30-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX it's possible that we have a little "slider" in Hush-NG GUI, where you can switch between HUSH + BTCH, but hush-ng codebase is not setup to be multi-coin, like Agama. We aren't trying to compete with Agama having lots of coins. But we could have something where you have either HUSH or BTCH as your "active coin". Requires more backend coding and more frontend coding, but it's possible

[30-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you won't be able to see HUSH and BTCH stuff at the same time, the GUI is not really set up for that. But maybe that is fine for people

[30-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the alternative is having an entirely new codebase and binary/etc for HUSH and BTCH, and that is a lot of maintenance burden

[30-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That would be a cool feature, being able to switch between the two with only a few clicks.

[30-Dec-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto   I understand it’s a lot of work.   We probably need the community to step up here.

[30-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I think my goal is to engage the community to test the work that you guys put out

[30-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let’s get the product into our hands and improve on it or give feedback

[30-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX let's make github issues for every bug you are seeing, that is blocking us from making an "alpha" windows binary release

[30-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the goal is to have some kind of binary, which we can provide checksums for, we don't need to have it be an official .msi at first

[30-Dec-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Sounds good

[30-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I agree.
