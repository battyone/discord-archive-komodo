QU√â?  lol

[01-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Zooko has been drinking something

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> #sad

[01-Sep-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i.e., Zooko tweeting that extremely poorly written ZIP out is pretty sad

[01-Sep-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ZEC is now <$45, how many months of funding do they have left to pay him to be CEO? I am sure some desperate meetings at ECC are happening

[01-Sep-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I'm sure he excludes his salary, as an option, to take off the books

[01-Sep-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> He probably makes what, $90k, right now, a month?

[01-Sep-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Just give me that one time, and I'll be set for a while... I'm sure he flies to Africa or wherever the hell he goes, and does whatever he does with all of this damn money he makes .. I bet he is struggling for cash lol

[01-Sep-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Otherwise any other sensible CEO of a crypto, ex cypherpunk, would've taken a pay cut

[01-Sep-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <FlyingDutchman> can you also explain to me how arrr stacks up against hush

[01-Sep-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ? @FlyingDutchman#5213 Hush and ARRR have both their usecase! Hush for private communication (e.g Hushlist), ARRR for private cash.

[01-Sep-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Thats the cooles think for me. KMD ecosystem projects complete each other

[01-Sep-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> btw. will it be possible in the future to send Messages (just an example)  from Hush->ARRR or other KMD Chains? Everytime when i think about KMD i must think of a big network...maybe one of the biggest in the future of crypto? Can we use it this way?

[01-Sep-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @denio not at the moment. iirc HushList protocol messages cannot traverse different chains altho i wonder if this will not change soon @dukeleto ?

[01-Sep-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Privatoshi Zooko is paid just over 2000 ZEC per month

[01-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio it's possible to send the same memo to the same address on multiple networks, but communicating across networks, well that is like having LTC and BTC talk to each other

[01-Sep-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> So its impossible? Maybe we can cheat with a multi kmd asset wallet with embeded memo field...üòÇ

[01-Sep-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Like agama just with zs and memo support ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[01-Sep-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio exactly what are you asking is impossible?  Sending memos from one chain to another, is like asking if you can send an LTC transaction on BTC network

[01-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSH has smart contract stuff enabled, we can do interesting cross-chain stuff with that with other KMD asset chains

[01-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But ARRR does not have smart contracts, and smart contracts only work with taddrs, currently

[01-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Yes exactly this...i thought it may be possible for kmd chains

[01-Sep-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And so smart contracts and memo fields do not talk to each other. They could in the future, but they don't currently

Just over 1/3rd of all $HUSH that will ever come into existence has already been mined!
Current circulating supply is ~7.2M of 21M and ~113K HUSH is currently in shielded addresses, i.e. ~1.6%.
Our very first halving happens in about 450 days.

[01-Sep-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @FtrSaroth It will connect the Android application to the desktop application SilentDragon using a QR code.
I have not found the QR Code yet, I guess it should be in a future version of the SilentDragon desktop. Do not forget that this is the first beta version of SilentDragonAndroid. It is necessary to align all the wheels so that everything is functional.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh correct, only the latest Git version of SilentDragon desktop has the GUI menu which gives you the QR code to connect the android app. Additionally, some more backend stuff needs to be done to enable most people to get it work (since most people don't have a public ip and port), i.e. the Wormhole Service
