[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> all you say is hello üòÉ

[16-Jun-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> No friend what happens is that English is not my language and it is difficult for me to maintain a conversation since I waste a lot of time looking for and using the translator @AkiraX

[17-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX send the `!withdraw` command to the tip bot and it will help you

[17-Jun-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> @RunningMantheCoin I know, but it's different then official joining the core team. Anyhow, I really love it how things are going right now.

[17-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> I am surprise how new privacy coins like grin & beam with its "minblewimble" protocol can perform so well

[17-Jun-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Better than traditional household names like zec/xmr

[17-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> And their inflation is also high

[17-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> They say zec inflation is high ..

[17-Jun-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @jl777c i always wonder how jl777 looked like.. cant find a single photo of jl777, which seems fully anonymous ..üòÄ

[17-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> With all the work that jl777 has done, he shld be speaking at some developer conference

[17-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> As duke says..best buy some unknown/yet to be famous coins with potential than btc .. it may give the best returns once the altcoin season is back..

[17-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i plan to give a joint presentation with satoshi

[17-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we have the same photo

[17-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Satoshi isn't alive anymore, At least that was the myth.

[17-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Yes but imagine if he is still alive.. perhaps he can solve a lot of todays problem in crypto..

[17-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Hacker is a menace to society, he cld have created a  "kill switch"

[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> how can i send my hush to a wallet ? or how this works ?

[17-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Roxin please DM the bot `help` and it will help you

[17-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you send `!withdraw 4 hush` to the bot, TLDR

[17-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it will ask for your address, and then send it

[17-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or you can see how other people use the bot in #tipbot_general

[17-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 when a brand new coin comes out and is mineable, there is always huge hype, which dies down. It's pretty normal.

[17-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Good afternoon friends the HUSH community

[17-Jun-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Hello! üòä Good afternoon!

[17-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @kh4567 unless he has access to a quantam computer, I dont think there is any "killswitch" in Bitcoin

[17-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> And since I can say with 99.9999% confidence that nobody has built a quantam computing machine, we should be safe for the forseeable future

[17-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We fixed some important/deep bugs in SD today, see the blood on the walls in #developers

[17-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We are testing out the feature where SD downloads hush and everything for you, and basically does all the magic. This is a necessity to support most GUI users

[17-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we fixed some good/crazy bugs today, because of @FireMartZ

[17-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @unko i sent 500 to the tipbot a while ago

[17-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> @dukeleto thank you friend

[17-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> confirmations on deposits have been slow lately

[17-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Could it be due to notaries possibly?

[17-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't think the tip bot uses notarizations, it uses a fixed number of confs

[17-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush dpow lag is 2 right now, very healthy

[17-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The tipbot has some deposit issues, it might just be overloaded with too many people. It supports hundreds of discord servers

[17-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Ah ok, I thought confirmations stay at 0 until notarized?

[17-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I agree, its likely just overloaded with users

[17-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at 1 until notarized, pretty much

[17-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the hush network has notarizations happening regularly, the tip bot is just not doing it's thing it seems

[17-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> No sir
