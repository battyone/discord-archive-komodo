[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> for reasons not wholly unrelated, soon to be ex

mining on a remote rig and chasing shitcoins for a straight year was one thing, but seems like reviving a crestfallen lowcap was the straw that broke the camel's back

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> If my wife were going to leave me over "a rig", I'd have been divorced long ago

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> My wife's Mustang sits out in the weather, because the 2-car garage is full of miners; however, she can't complain because they are what paid for the car üôÇ

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i think i need dpow-themed street wear

[30-May-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> Is 1 hush to 10,000 memos a fixed rate or a calculation of some current variable network expense?

[30-May-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> A fixed rate for something like that is really bad

[30-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiveBuddha 0.0001 is the default transaction fee, so 10,000 "normal" transaction fees = 1 HUSH

[30-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if/when the Hush network gets busier, fees will inevitably increase, but that likely won't happen for a while

[30-May-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash itself has mostly empty blocks, and it has smaller blocks than Hush

[30-May-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so 10K memos per Hush is just a convenient rough estimate. it's possible to pay 0 fee still on the Hush network, but I wouldn't bet your private future communications on that. You can also pay a tiny tiny fee and maybe make 1M memos from 1 HUSH, but that is up for miners to decide

[30-May-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @JiveBuddha i agree, fixed rates are bad

[30-May-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Good news! Tradesatoshi updated there wallets!!!! I see they remove the notes. Not sure. Duke can you confirm?

[30-May-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I see there update there whole policy for coins. Wallet updates will now cost BTC and swap will also cost BTC. Some coins had delisting status(Now back online) and base on those channels they were warn any future swaps or updates will now cost money.
