[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Fb why

[21-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> only 10 mil USD to get a masternode

[21-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Jordan Belfort> Lol

[21-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It'll pair nicely with my DASHternode

[21-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Libra is an exciting project. It is a first-mover in terms of centralized Global currency for corporations. Some are salty about its origins but proejcts like this were bound to pop up. A few years ago, corporations issuing their own cryptocurrency was a laughable thought- now it is reality. For all those that have been in the space before Libra- it is a sign that the herd is indeed coming

[21-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> It very much legitimizes the idea of peer to peer digital cash for those that havent looked into Bitcoin yet- or understand what it is. Younger generations growing up with projects like Libra make it infinitely more likely that they will buy Bitcoin. "Oh theres cryptocurrencies that arent centralized & dont take advantage of my data? Maybe ill try that"

Facebook Credits
Facebook Credits was a virtual currency that enabled people to purchase items in games and non-gaming applications on the Facebook Platform. One U.S. dollar was the equivalent of 10 Facebook Credits. Facebook Credits were available in 15 currencies including U.S. dollars, pou...

[21-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It was a bit ahead of it's time then

[21-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @dukeleto they have likely learned form their mistakes- which makes Libra even more likely to succeed (at least in the short term)

[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> applecoin

[21-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> msftcoin

[21-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ibmcoin

[21-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> they will all happen

[21-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but all of them regulated

[21-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we will have a hybrid (tribrid?) fiat + corpcoin + crypto world

[21-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and due to tech the <-> between the corpcoins will be much much easier than with fiat

[21-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @jl777c not to mention all the countries/nations that will create their own coins. Canadacoin, Mexicocoin, Russiacoin etc. etc.

[21-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> all regulated. All centralized.

[21-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I like the ring of Mexicoin

[21-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> much cheaper than paper and all can be tracked!

[21-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> this then creates a large demand for privacy

[21-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> TL:DR Then Hush takes over the world

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @RunningMantheCoin the seas are big and wide for many privacy-focused coins like HUSH, Pirate and even our distant Monero-like cousins üòâ

[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> morning friends HUSH community very nice weekend for us

[21-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> FB will run the biggest botnet and the public wont care...just like their privacy...don't use it, lose it... üòÇ

[21-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Most likely, FBcoin is good for our entire industry, because it teaches average people what cryptocoins are, and why fiat money is pretty much worthless

[21-Jun-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but there will be a lot of evil marketing, people will have to learn for themselves
