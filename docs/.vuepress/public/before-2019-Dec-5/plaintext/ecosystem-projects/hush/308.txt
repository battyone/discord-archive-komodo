New China cryptography law

No foreign company may encrypt data so that it cannot be read by the govt.

Officials can, under the law, share seized info with state owned enterprises. This means SOEs will be able to use that info against foreign competitors.

If you invested 10 000 BTC into ZEC at the open of the 2nd trading day (God forbid) you'd be left with less than two today.
