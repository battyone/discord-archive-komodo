[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Pirates is in the initial phase, where getting listed on more exchanges, CMC, news all this will drive interest and price. Hush got this behind. No more exciting CEX expected, ... would need a lot of effort on many fronts to change this.

[12-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If at least 20 people from this group will talk about HUSH on Twitter once a week, and encourage miners to sell their HUSH and traders to buy HUSH on Digitalprice or Cratex, also talking about the advantages of the coin, I think the situation will be move

[12-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Now anyone can buy more than 1000 HUSH at a price of 0.00001111 on Digitalprice. Great price in my opinion

[12-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I'm pesimistic. Supported marketing of Pirates, where there is a group of 500-1000, when it was needed I had support max of 30 people. <10%. If there is 20 here you can count 2 to tweet and it will matter if they are VIPs or sth.

[12-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Also why someone new would buy Hush? People buying only if there is growth perspective (product is new - exciting - got strong marketing push, new big exchanges coming).

[12-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Chances are in adoption of private messenger + getting someone popular like Kim Dot Com or  J.Assange - massive players in privacy, who can generate interest. Could become ambassadors.

[12-Nov-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Having good dev like Duke is a plus for project tech, but for commercial success (and this we consider now in the talk) some different things may be needed.

[12-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As we can see, the situation now is what it is, what you are saying will happen in the future. We, as members of the community, should not wait until that day comes, but do something now

Just ported getsnapshot RPC from $KMD to $HUSH, which relies on Bitcore. Very few coins have Bitcore, not even $ZEC. It can dynamically generate a richlist at any block height in less than 15 seconds! This allows for amazing things, more details soon: https://t.co/9WKNGOli...

[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> Not sure what is profitable

[13-Nov-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm still mining the one coin that i've found to be profitable with a GPU, there might be others but this one is on an algorithm which doesn't destroy hardware. Nearly 5 usd in 24h with 2 gtx 1080ti and 10 1060 3gb's

[13-Nov-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Personally i've just been spinning up nodes and staking, those seem to bring an ok profit as well eg. more than the server cost etc.

[13-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Whats coin?) Can you write a personal message)

[13-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I think when the 2 exchanges are back online(tradesatoshi and cryptopia) the price will recovery to $0.25+. 
Currently lot of investment was into masternodes and all fail horrible, I cashout and put lot into mining hush.  Got lot Hush frozen on cryptopia.  Currently have 2000 hush stuck and over 760 hush mined.

[13-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I am waiting for 3 Dev nodes and going to use it to mine Hush. I believe the price will jump $0.5 when all issues are resolve and if we getting listed on 1 big exchange and 2 other exchanges the coin will stable at $1

[13-Nov-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Here's to Hush going to the moon then! üòÉ

Do we know when HUSH Coin will be back trading on Cryptopia ?

[13-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> A lot of coins suspended trading on Cryptopia. It seems the exchange has great difficulties and not coins

[13-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Broseph#3279
Thanks. Is the HUSH team in contact with crptopia?

[13-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Yes we are- there just seems to be large gaps of times between their responses--> but we do have an open medium of communication with them

[13-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Broseph#3279
Great! i cant wait for this coin to be back online trading again.

[13-Nov-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are trying to work out something with Cryptopia. They responded to us recently after sending no response for a while. So that is better than them completely ignoring us

[14-Nov-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
