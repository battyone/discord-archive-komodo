[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Hi folks, I was away on holiday and hadnâ€™t been following what is going on.  When the initial KMD back happens I had logged into the newer version of agama suggested here and everything was fine, I just checked and my balances are all zero and no transaction history, am I screwed....

[05-Jul-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No transaction history means you have the wrong address or something

[05-Jul-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you had funds swept by KMD team then KMD discord #community-support can help you

[05-Jul-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: you fill out a form and they should refund any stolen funds

[05-Jul-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hammerstein> Thanks Duke, wrong address lol...

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> My friend had his Bitcoin swept, Agama showed no history. We used a block explorer and saw that the funds had been moved, filled out the claim and he had received his funds the next day. Extremely fast service by KMD on straightening things out ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> 808 is another coin. Nothing to do with Hush.

[06-Jul-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> okay, hmm, wondering if bad advertisement or just not very smart :thonking:

[07-Jul-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX good idea, since @RunningMantheCoin and @Berg and using SD + learning about it, they may have input

[07-Jul-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I can look at how to remove Barterdex.  The simplest thing would be to replace it with another subject.

[07-Jul-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> AtomicDEX is the new versino of BarterDEX

[07-Jul-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so we basically can replace bdex stuff with atomicdex stuff
