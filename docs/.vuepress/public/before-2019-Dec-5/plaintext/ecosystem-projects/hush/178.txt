[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Someone is going to have to buy a bit up the wall and impact the price if they want to accumulate

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Not that many until you get to 800 sats

[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It should've never fallen below 1K sats imho

[05-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Anything sub 1K is more than a steal

[05-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> and I doubt sellers will continue to come down to 400 sat levels

[05-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> shaking out the weak

[05-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Spend .15 btc and you will be in top 100 hush richlist

[05-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> A good amount of buy orders around the 400 sat mark in graviex though. Price not likely to fall any more

[05-Aug-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I can say now if $0.03 hush price, it will not last more then 12 hours since it be eaten, even if a user dumps all the hush supply @$0.03, it be eaten nor matter what amount so $0.03 we will never see again :)
Our volumes are extremely good(Hush volume, we doing more then 10k hush volume on average the past 7 days).

[05-Aug-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> BTW.  The coin itself makes a nice silent dragon logo

[05-Aug-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> @AkiraX I should make another site called physicalcryptopogs.com and have it redirect to my store lol

[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> Thanks! Yea, they look sick in person, it's hard to show the detail in pictures, you can't see the sandblast effect in the background on the front

[06-Aug-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Very exciting to see a physical Hush coin with SilentDragon logo

[06-Aug-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Aug-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> i honestly think this is the best looking non-pure silver coin i've done

[06-Aug-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Because they haven't mined them since the conversion

[06-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã that that data in that file is obscured transaction id's, he did that to obscure the txids, but not the address. The address never shows up on the blockchain or an explorer, which is even sneakier

[06-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I remember he had a script to do something with timelocked addresses

[06-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Aug-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763

@VerusCoin has a backdoored $BTC protocol that allows a special address to spend the funds of other addresses in certain circumstances. It's extremely sneaky and the address that can steal funds from other addresses never appears on an explorer!!! https://...

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ``This happened... Due to an error on the infrastructure side, all of the wallets that we mined to from funds we spent personally, the majority of what we mined, are gone. Really, truly, gone. One member of our team took it so hard that we started to worry about him, but before you get concerned, he‚Äôs ok. We considered what options we had to deal with this. Generally, we wanted this chain to be fair, pure, and to have absolute integrity. Everyone can make mistakes, and we will have updates as we improve, but we believed a fair coin could be launched thoughtfully, giving everyone equal opportunity, and in a way that could support its development through its growth in value over time.

If we do not have a way to recover our coins, we do not know how to sustain the realization of the Verus vision. Most of the coins we mined, we had planned to put towards future development. So, we have come up with a plan that we believe respects the fairness we intended in this launch, and enables us to move forward. We know how to recognize our lost transactions. We will make an update that will allow us to spend those and only those specific transactions to our development wallet, and we will roll out that update, move our transactions back into addresses that we control, preserve all other earnings and transactions, not modify the total supply, not change anything else, and put ourselves back in a position to carry the project forward. We will not touch any transactions that were not ours, meaning we spent our fiat funds to get by mining or staking along with you. We will not change the supply. We will not roll back and put your hard earned mining rewards at risk. We will identify and recover our transactions, no more. We have already done a post mortem, and I can assure you that an error like this will never happen again.``
