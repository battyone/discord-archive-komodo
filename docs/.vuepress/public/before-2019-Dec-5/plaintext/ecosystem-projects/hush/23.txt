[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we can spread things out a long time, or concentrate more mining rewards in the early times. One way benefits early miners more, the other helps later miners

[23-Nov-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I'm not fan of short-term solutions. High block rewards are path to (hyper)inflation and even  hybrid POW/POS mechanism can't prevent that. Cheap coins have ruined HUSH's market and they can ruin BTCH's too. Benefiting early miners may accelerate immediate trading, but it's long-term devestating. It's probably better way, a sustainable one, to go with lower block reward and longer halving periods. At some stage inflation shouldn't be higher as few % annualy.

[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> Hey guys what do I do to turn on the old experimental features in agama?

[23-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> I can't find hush on the list of coins?

[23-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> Is it no longer supported?

[23-Nov-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> Been away a long time so I don't know what's going on

[23-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> Tried enabling advanced features, got nothing

[23-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <chinmaydshah> Got it. Had to restart a couple of time

[23-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> Maybe the big blocks should be for staking initially and not mining

[23-Nov-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> Is that possible so the initial holders don‚Äôt get screwed

[23-Nov-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto , I think it‚Äôs necessary in the early stages to make a big reward for attracting miners and replenishing the community, which each month will be halved reaching 12 coins, then every few years the block decreases

[23-Nov-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As chinmaydshah correctly said earlier, it is necessary to reduce the number of coins later to prevent high inflation. But in the beginning there should be generous blocks. It will be a certain bait, as the fisherman attracts fish)

[23-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> You wouldn‚Äôt necessarily need to attract miners.  Attracting stakers would raise the price as people would want to buy to stake.  If each coin worth more.  It is just as valuable to mine less coins that are worth more.

[23-Nov-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RemoteConTroll> And that would attract miners should coins be worth more

[23-Nov-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Impossible attracting stackers not to attract miners when 50/50 POS POW

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Very good Duke!

[23-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not really "bugs", but "integration issues", which are very common with such a huge merge

[23-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> just need to turn the lights on in each room and scare the bugs into hiding

[23-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these automated tests help KMD, BTCH and every asset chain in the ecosystem

[23-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in the future, it can help prevent regressions and point out issues very fast

[23-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Is it possible that Verushash can embed an algorithm in any other Komodo asset chains?

[23-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any new KMD asset chain can choose VerusHash OR Equihash, where before it was only Equihash

[23-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, the code is more general, and allows for others to add different PoW algorithm options

[23-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> before, things were very hardcoded to Equihash and even trying to choose another algo was very hard, even at compile time

[23-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal does that answer your question?

[23-Nov-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes

[23-Nov-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> currently this is only available on the most bleeding edge branch of KMD, so it's not *quite* ready for average users. I would say its in "alpha testing"

[23-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the way things go is James merges the latest/newest code in FSM branch, then occasionally that is merged to `jl777` branch and then `dev` branch and finally one day it reaches `master`

[23-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once these features trickle down to the `dev` branch, they are pretty stable

[23-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a great time to get involved, to help with testing and stuff, if people like that

[23-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> best thing to do in a bear market is learn, mine, tinker, and avoid thinking about prices üòÉ

[23-Nov-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> You going to make changes to the Verushash algorithm for BTCH? So giving it a feature and some uniqe?

[23-Nov-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal i was not planning on it. It will be exactly compatible with VRSC mining, i.e. the same exact mining pool and pooled miner software will work

[23-Nov-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> people will be able to switch between BTCH and VRSC mining seemlessly

[23-Nov-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Now the price does not bother me, for me it is important to collect more portfolio)

[23-Nov-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with what is going on in VRSC, BTCH is probably going to get a lot of miners from that community

[23-Nov-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> and stackers)

[23-Nov-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> At present, POS is the best option

[23-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto  if Zcash implements Blossom, will Hush inherit the hybrid algorithm?

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Hi, It is possible to export a TXT file containing the public key and the private key from wallet.hush.org. Is this file intended to be used by an application? If YES, I do not touch it. If NO, I would like to simplify it so that a human being can read it more easily.üòè

[23-Nov-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nothing happens by default. Currently we are still on Sprout, and will upgrade to Sapling

[23-Nov-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Blossom is still just a few ideas on Github, they are still in the idea gathering stage

[23-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh i don't know of any programs that parse it, but some might. what kind of changes do you have in mind?

[23-Nov-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal so we don't inherit by default, but we could if we want it. It takes work to upgrade, a pretty large amount

[23-Nov-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is why it's amazing that all KMD asset chains get Sapling, for free, because jl777 is a coding wizard

[23-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I absolutely do not doubt it)

[23-Nov-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the amount of work to do it, for each external coin ... it's a huge amount. BTCH will have Sapling before Hush, that is fore sure

[23-Nov-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so, BTCH will have Sapling before most Zcash forks as well, without even having a dedicated developer team

[23-Nov-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> And not having a large amount of money

[dscrd-hush] <Zeyu> Hey guys I‚Äôm Zeyu, an early crypto investor from China. so I‚Äôm pretty new to HUSH, can someone briefly answer my questions? 1. Why did it stop trading and when can I trade it? 2. What is BTCH? 3. I watched a YouTube video about hush and it seemed like there used to be a lot of ppl involved but now there‚Äôs only 3 ppl on the website so what happened? Much appreciated!

[25-Nov-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal very nice, i will take a look soon

[25-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal it's nice, something like this is needed to compare things. You can assume there will always be 1440  blocks per day (1 minute blocks) because with mining, there will always be a transaction every minute (somebody will want to get the block reward and get a mining coinbase transaction)

[25-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zeyu HUSH and BTCH are "sister coins", both developed by the same community. There have been many mining attacks against exchanges, which have paused trading.

[25-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Welcome @Zeyu  üòÉ . I know of 3 exchanges that are actively trading hush( Digitalprice.io , createx.io and coinroom.com )

[25-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> though there isn't much volume on them

[25-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> And as Duke said, of the two major exchanges we have, Cryptopia has paused trading pending a wallet update and Tradesatoshi has paused wallets as well.

[25-Nov-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zeyu> okay thanks @dukeleto  and @heguli97  I‚Äôll keep doing my due diligence on HUSH then, I liked idea and I saw a great develop history on github so I def want to look more, but question to @dukeleto, what‚Äôs the purpose of developing BTCH if there‚Äôs nothing wrong with HUSH and it already had this level of previous commitments? If BTCH is a complete different thing then is it gonna affect the developing effort on HUSH?

[25-Nov-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we get this question so much

[25-Nov-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anybody else want to answer? I just get bored of it

[25-Nov-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so boring to answer the same questions over and over and over

[25-Nov-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zeyu> yea I will screenshot my question and the answer from whomever and next time I see someone ask the same question I‚Äôll send the screenshot for ya lol

[25-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's been asked 1000 times

[25-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it shows a lack of understanding of open source development, *and* how cryptocoins are made

[25-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zeyu BTCH is a KMD asset chain, which means it's feature complete and has a large dev team, headed by jl777 (who is also a co-founder of BTCH)

[25-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH will have Zcash Sapling in a few days/weeks. BTCH has "no dedicated devs" and yet more dev resources than HUSH, since KMD is a larger community

[25-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Zeyu I have code in almost every Zcash fork, I work on many things. And I work on many open source projects outside  of cryptocoins. Your question is a "false duality", assuming there can only be "A or B" when that is false

[25-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Duke works on whatever he wants, because nobody pays Duke to do anything

[25-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you want Duke to work on something specific, make it rain. Otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the entertainment

[25-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Sometimes I fix a bug in KMD, which also goes to ZEC, which I also fix in HUSH

[25-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hence, your question is nonsensical

[25-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and to clarify, when you fix a bug in KMD, it gets fixed in every asset chain (BTCH is one), there are something like 50 now: http://notarystats.com/

[25-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
