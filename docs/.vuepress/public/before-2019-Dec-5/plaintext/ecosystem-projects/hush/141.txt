[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @AkiraX just gpu's

[28-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> how are you going to mine labs then/

[28-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> with gpus?

[28-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> It can be staked too right?

[28-Jun-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Also I'm just experimenting what i could do with my r-pi 3 B+

[28-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> _is both mining and staking LABS_

[28-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I guess you can buy it too

[28-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Mine other stuff

[28-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> With your GPU

[28-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> for the right price, I'll sell you more than you want üôÉ

[28-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I've only got 5k UTXOs

[28-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> mostly blockreward, I forget how much in the manual splits

[28-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> My 300 means nothing

[28-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And 100000 hush too probably

[28-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Nice.  Kmd going up

[28-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `My 300 means nothing`
nah, you cannot go by my balance as a comparison
I was in way early and much of what I have is "grandfathered" in from early testing

[28-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I've been intentionally trying to keep my UTXO count low-ish in order to lower domination

[28-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Maybe you can airdrop some people. :rolf:

[28-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> follow the guide of The Wise Discordtip
@Roxin 
1. !withdraw
2. Enter your Address when prompted
3. Enter the amount when prompted
4. Lastly confirm by typing 'yes' or 'no'

[28-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I really think the send all button should be taken off send memo screen o. Silent dragon

[28-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I was going to mine then with gpus.  Then some people said I shouldn't

[29-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> Oh, you mean LUMBER
I'm not sure of the inherent value in that mess (massive premine that may or may not be burned at will, easy to dominate hash with an FPGA, and a very specific use-case that revolves around a specific segment of a specific industry being involved with little platform dev to that end)
ü§∑üèΩ

[29-Jun-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> good afternoon

[30-Jun-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Hi

[30-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Lumbi> @AkiraX Don't mind ComputerGernie, as he is known to troll. FPGA can mine any coin, so that's not much of an objection. LUMBER is 50% Proof-of-Stake so no chance of a 51 attack. 300,000 LUMBER has been burned from the pre-mine with more to come. Total circulation is  2,000,000 which is really low with a 21,000,000 max. Most coins don't even come close to those metrics. As for use case, it is true that the emphasis is on solving problems for the forest products industry, but the tech can also be applied to trading, insurance and other financial products that are industry related. Add to that energy efficiency, GPU utilization and a strong brand name, you can see why it gets H8.

[30-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Lumbi CG can be very useful. Correct or not, he just shared his opinion.  Obviously he is not into LUMBER. @AkiraX I've took a look at their discord. You already have a conversation with Lumbi and informations are available. @Lumbi Thank you for an explonation, but let it finish there for HUSH discord.

[30-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `as he is known to troll. `
Or he has valid points.

[30-Jun-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com Lumbi is LUMBER admin. He came to protect his coin as AkiraX wrote he is into HUSH and BTCH. Nothing wrong I guess, but let it finish there.

[30-Jun-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> @halo kitty rules I'm well aware who's who in our ecosystem
Just as well as I'm aware that that entire paragraph is, at best, a misrepresentation

[30-Jun-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> *like the bit where he leaves out that he, personally, holds ~50% of that "Total circulation"

[30-Jun-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> Morning  friends

[30-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> @halo kitty rules Also, since you're neither the person that randomly asked for my personal opinion nor the one who personally attacked me, you don't get to decide when I "finish"

[30-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I'm opposed to cross air-drops even if/when they financially benefit me

[30-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> You got my vote. I'm also not a fan of airdrops. Since the airdrops have finished, there are no new users. It's not about the quantity, it is about the quality. But I'm covering the team's back. They saw the airdrops attract wrong kind of people and they stopped.

[30-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> The ability to separate people and things is important and an ability that an increasing number of people seem to lack these days

[30-Jun-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Quality content helps with a separation. On KMD are only intelligent people, because it offers quality. As said, since the airdrops have stopped, the number of passengers has significantly decreased.

[30-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But I guess it is the same with all small-cap coins. Gold diggers are searching for a Àùnew BitcoinÀù.

[30-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> BTC is a commodity and when an external LN became seen as "part of bitcoin" it stopped being Bitcoin and became something else (that "something else" being precisely not what the the only person that gets to define "Bitcoin" defined it as)
