[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> There must be some way to stop the hackers

[06-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the sawly started by making actually useful fixes, over time he made half a dozen PR, all which were fine and actually usefu;

[06-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> then when his module was included in the automated build process, he injected the agama specific exploot

[06-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and waited

[06-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> let me know if you have a way to prevent such attacks

[06-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Two Factor Authentication (2FA), adds an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.

[06-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Before funds are send in agama..

[06-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Perhaps agama can have this feature and 2FA check with google authenticator  @jl777c

[06-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> remote execution

[06-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i.e. execute the exploiter remotely

[06-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> firing squad sounds nice

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> a centralized wallet provider would be needed and then KYC to spend your own funds

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> oh, dont forget much larger fees as such a provider is considered a money transmitter by USSA

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and would need to spend millions in licenses

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> I want my pkey from agama but it gives the keys to hush and not hush3

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Whats the difference anyway

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> I cant access the funds

[06-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> To transfer to native or web wallet

[06-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> only thing i can think of at the moment would be forcing prospective maintainers to escrow

[06-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> or dox themselves

[06-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> For those who want additional  security.. they may want or enable that.. even with higher  fees..

[06-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> what if I use BTCH and HUSH in lite mode in Agama 0.3.6b? Does it affect only native coins?

[06-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Dochteur, move your funds ASAP.

[06-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> ok thx for help but what about BTCH there? Is there any other wallet option?

[06-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Whatever new address you have control over, you can send btch from your Agama wallet to the new address. But I could be wrong, maybe wait for someone more experienced from the Hush team to answer that question.

[06-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> it is bound to my HUSH WIF so could they be send to the same adress?

[06-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> if I sent it from Agama in lite mode, can I send a little at first to test it and then the whole amount? Will it generate new adress for all unspent coins or something?

[06-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> both, btch and hush3 are working in 0.3.6b lite mode

[06-Jun-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> @Dochteur lite mode uses only one address, change addresses only occur in native-mode

[06-Jun-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Do not generate a new address/seed with Agama 0.3.x - your funds will be at risk

[06-Jun-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> Use Verus-agama

[06-Jun-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> HUSH is not in Verus agama I imported hush wallet to Hushmate and trasfer it to a newly generated wallet but after first test transaction now I want to move it and get bad-txns oversize error

[06-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> I need to do it as fast as possible to make it safe and dont know what to do

[06-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> yes, verus-agama does not have all the asset-chains, all you need is the new address, check your balance using hush3 explorer

[06-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <penguin> if you are referring to hush and not hush3 then you will need to follow the import-guide for claiming onto the new chain

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mornin'

[06-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Good morning everyone üòÉ

[06-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> g'day m8

[06-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoRot> @Dochteur I was having the same issues with the bad-txns oversize, it was a mining wallet with over 4000 transactions , i ended up moving my coins in groups on 900, when id try over 1000 it would give me that error

[06-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> glad the agama was just a post of the seed key, was more worried of it reading internal files. 
From now ,all application are in sandboxes.

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `oversize` is the wallet's "polite" way of saying "I can't shove 10 pounds of stuff in a 5lb. sack"

[06-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> So if someone is able to sweep iur keys and take our funds.   What's stopping someone from doing this in a closed source wallet?

[06-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nothing

[06-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roxin> so there is no safe wallet ?

[06-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> HushMate is the go-to for us, the web-wallet at https://wallet.myhush.org is still a safer move if you're holding in Agama.

[06-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We have a brand new more secure wallet being developed currently. It's a working product but no binaries have been finalized yet so it has to be built from the source.

[06-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ËµñÁ∫¢ÂÖâ> I feel like you need a PhD to be able to confidently use cryptocurrency

[06-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It's a new industry, user and developer integrity will strengthen as people learn what does and doesn't work.

[06-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I myself didn't even know that Agama wasn't a safe option, I'm not a developer, merely a spokesperson

[06-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I had to write my own scripts to tell my modem how to connect to my particular ISP in the late 90's, PPP scripts for those that are old

[06-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this was a huge barrier to entry for people using an ISP vs AOL back then

[06-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only because I was a Linux sysadmin was it "easy" for me

[06-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> now that barrier doesn't exist anymore, it's completely gone

[06-Jun-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ËµñÁ∫¢ÂÖâ I think we are still in the very early stages of cryptocoins, where people have to do low-level things to do simple things

[06-Jun-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it will not be like this forever

[06-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Good perspective, I hope your right.

[06-Jun-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The people who invest, and more importantly, learn how to safely manage funds, before things become trivially easy, will benefit most

Once you hit positive ROI, why would you care? Buy it, earn, recycle the aluminum, and call it a day (just like any other piece of work equipment).

[07-Jun-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> May take quite some time to roi

[07-Jun-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I never roi my gpus

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `I never roi my gpus`
The key is to be on the front edge of equipment; I've never *not* hit 2x positive ROI

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> exactly

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> how do i know if im in the front or not?

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> z9 mini is at the end?

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> so i went with a9

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> then i see a9++

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> then there is a10

[07-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> and a10++

[07-Jun-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `how do i know if im in the front or not?`
if it's new, more efficient, and every donkey out there doesn't have one, then buy 3

[07-Jun-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> but what if im the donkey?

[07-Jun-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ask your fair-godmother to turn you into a thoroughbred?

[07-Jun-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> With the recent malware in Agama, all that boo hoo with (closed source) Zelcore not supporting Hush2 > Hush3 is a lesson in hindsight. Dukeleto was wise to say no to closed source. If it's closed, you can't trust it with your crypto funds.
