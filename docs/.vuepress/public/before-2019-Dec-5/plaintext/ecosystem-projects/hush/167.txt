[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I encourage everybody here to send a small tip @gigamesh's way for the amazing new article that was written. `zs18jwgjjp9au86qkv84wntk4ct4vesms4xmvkzxlljheg2k3sncg75jlfyualxw55x60wmukgmyfn` or via tipbot. We can now point so many people to this great article.

[28-Jul-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh FYI, for your benefit, maybe add a HUSH transparent address, which will open up more people being able to donate to you

[28-Jul-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That way, they can donate from a wallet that doesn't support zaddrs, or directly from an exchange

[28-Jul-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No privacy, but at least you get a donation!

[28-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Aeetes> May i note that using Silentdragon installing it and using it, is kind of technical. Will there be a more user friendly version in the near future or a version on mobile?

[28-Jul-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @Aeetes Yes, there will be. It still in beta and maybe within 2 months they be a stable SD version.

[28-Jul-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
