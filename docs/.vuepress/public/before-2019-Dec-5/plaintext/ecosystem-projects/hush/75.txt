[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability maybe you are seeing something in the GUI? take a screenshot. As long as it has 1+ confirmations, it should be spendable

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe our web wallet has something about 20 confs, not sure. If it does, it needs to learn about notarization/dpow stuff

[dscrd-hush] <newvulcan> I've got HUSH3 working on my test mining pool now. Thanks for the help - it ended up being a combination of setting disablecb in the coins file, using @blackjok3r knomp repo and using the right HUSH3 daemon repo - or put another way - I couldn't have got it more wrong unless trying to install it on Windows !!

[dscrd-hush] <DREverett> @dukeleto - that's been a problem for a while- they do it b/c of low exchange traffic. As an example I use AwesomeMiner to manage my rigs- HUSH has not been chosen/available for a long time due to lack of info. Here's what I see- I know it's not something you have any control over but thought it may help explain things.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're in touch with them about reactivating HUSH.
Being a small alt-coin, we're low priority, and at the mercy of their schedule...
They intend to keep us listed and reactivate our trading, as things currently stand.
We can't provide a timeline, but note that it's entirely on Cryptopia to come through with this update, we provide support to them, but they work at their own pace and have their own priorities.
Much larger coins are still down on their site, they are making great progress, but we'll see when they get to us.
