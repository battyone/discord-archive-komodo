[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> ASIC, always the same history...

[28-May-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> The Altcoinbuzz article should have been written five months ago. TS has been on the way out for some time. They can keep my infinitely small fraction of one cent worth of crypto coins.

[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Judging by the volume, i think tradesatoshi is dead

[29-May-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Anyone shld not move yr coins there

[29-May-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> To be safe .. as funds are not safu there

[29-May-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Like binance safu üòÄ

[29-May-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Safu?

[29-May-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its what cz use

[29-May-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Safu instead of safe

[29-May-19 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Secure asset funds for users (safu) üòÄ

[29-May-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Its an insurance which binance created to reimburse funds thats stolen

[29-May-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> @Akira X u use binance ?

[29-May-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> i dont keep funds there

[29-May-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @kh4567, I've been saying not to use TS for a while. The article previously mentioned has some truth to it with TS blocking people on Discord and Twitter. They blocked me for simply asking legit questions about their coin delistings while wallets were in maintenance. If they suddenly delist a coin that has its wallet in maintenance, kiss your coins goodbye.

[29-May-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> I hope I'm not too late in the Asic gsme

[29-May-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> Looks like they are rolling out 130k sol hashers

[29-May-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> TS latest volume is only 15 btc.. i think its already dead ..

[29-May-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> <zhou> welcome, you can talk to @Berg about exchanges

[29-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @kh4567 TS has only trading, no deposit/withdraw. Funds are held captive

[29-May-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Akira X inno A9 is a good  decision, will be profitable much longer than a z9m

[29-May-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Well satoshi once considered a kill switch

[29-May-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> ‚ÄúImagine someone stole something from you.¬† You can‚Äôt get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it?¬† Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it‚Äôll be useless to them, although you still lose it too?¬† If they give it back, you can re-activate it,‚Äù Satoshi said.

[29-May-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> But he didnt manage to implement that before he suddenly disappear üòÄ

[29-May-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @TonyL 5 hush for being awesome

[29-May-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> üí∞ @dukeleto sent @TonyL **5.00 HUSH** (‚âà $0.35).

[29-May-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <TonyL> Thank you! üòÉ

[29-May-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Are there a lot of hush held ransom or gone due to cryptopia and tradesatoshi? Any estimates? So the supply of hush is lower which makes everybody's else coin worth a bit more üòÄ

[29-May-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Altilly is looking pretty sad since launching :(

This is a CMC tracked exchange, so if we can support some level of volume it'll do wonders for our exposure.
Place some buys and sells :)

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Hello everybody. What about mining difficulty 3849425.819 Or 38M ?

[29-May-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> If i check "miningpoolstats"  i see 38M bat when i check "explorer.hush" i see 38T

[29-May-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> "M"or "T" ?

[29-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability 
the answer is:
[network]"difficulty": 30021251.38357379
and the current block diff is
`63020.7613685`

[29-May-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !mining hush

[29-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool we got a bot now :troll:

[29-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> blockdiff seems a diff format or something

[29-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> damn units

[29-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yeah, but the bot doesn't do actual block diff üòõ

[29-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> blockdiff = diff1/target

[29-May-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability "difficulty" often has different units across different coins, you cannot compare diff from one coin to another, fyi

[29-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been talking to whattomine.com (they are friendly on their discord) and they are working on getting us active again

[29-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> their thing is basically we have to have an exchange on CMC to be shown on whattomine.com

[29-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> luckily, Graviex is now on CMC!

[29-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so they are working on doing their backend changes and whatnot

[29-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hopefully Hush starts to show up by default (it's there, but inactive) on whattomine.com

[29-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Anddd if we get Altilly to actually support some volumeeee üòâ

[29-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability https://explorer.myhush.org/charts/difficulty might be helpful for you

[29-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They're also CMC supported

[29-May-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg cool, i didn't know that

[29-May-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-May-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-May-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> That airdrop went faster than expected

[29-May-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Sorry for putting the dumb timer at 1 hour everyone üòÉ

[29-May-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even these tiny bits of Hush, they can help you send many private memos in the future. I consider Hush a store-of-privacy. Each 1 HUSH is able to send 10,000 short private memos, and if you want to send larger amounts of data or store larger things, that costs more HUSH. That is the real case for "Why should I buy/hold/mine Hush?". If you think privacy is going away in society, and that it will be worth more, to YOU or others in the future, it's probably a good idea to have a bit of HUSH. And ARRR and a few other coins, too

[29-May-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> additionally, this is not financial advice. I just work here.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Pepin the Healer You'd need a lot of money to buy 10K Hush üòÉ 
Might be able to get around 5K at a decent price though, just looking at the order books

[29-May-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and Barterlly

[29-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you want to buy or sell larger amounts of Hush right now http://barterlly.io/ is the best way

[29-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> very true

[29-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> actually there's a few bigger swaps on Barterlly for Hush right now

[29-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I think one was 5 or 10K

[29-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if people make public Barterlly offers, it's ok to post them in here, within reason. Don't anger the spam gods

[29-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i see people posting their barterlly offers in KMD #talk-trading discord, it's pretty nice

[29-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg will you be investing in :carlos: 2.0 ?

[29-May-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, I need some cool graphics for our new GUI wallet, SilentDragon

[29-May-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
