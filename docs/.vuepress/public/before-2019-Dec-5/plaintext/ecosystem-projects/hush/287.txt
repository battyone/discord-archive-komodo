[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> btw do you understand how this really works? the last line on github says "PS: Zecwallet-Lite is NOT an official wallet, and is not affiliated with the Electric Coin Company in any way."

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is our port of zecwallet-lite to Hush, done by @denio . I would say "yes", I understand how it really works, I guess üëº

[16-Nov-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Lul

[16-Nov-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã the reason for that line about ECC is because Zcash Foundation paid for that wallet, not the official company

[16-Nov-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Foundation paid about 1100 ZEC ($80,000 ish USD at the time) to have zecwallet-lite developed

[16-Nov-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and Hush was the first other coin to adopt this tech, and so now we have it too

With over 300 networks disrupted, #Iran's internet shutdown is one of the most complex we've ever tracked. Simply switching it off took ~24 hours ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

National connectivity now hovers at 5% with a few pockets of connectivity remaining to the outside world.

[17-Nov-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Something simple

[17-Nov-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Need something more user friendly

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> giving up all privacy is very user-friendly

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such as using Verus

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> U dont get me

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Finality if you have specific requests, we are happy to hear them

[17-Nov-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> Not. Giving up on privavy

[17-Nov-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Verus is not focused on privacy nor do I consider it a privacy coin

[17-Nov-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So comparing Hush against Verus makes no sense

[17-Nov-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Privacy is our first concern, then convenience and ease-of-use. We have made massive strides in just the last few weeks

[17-Nov-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Finality> But can the team make up a friendly app which supports privacy yet be user friendly?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I work on Hush for the privacy tech, not because of the financials

[17-Nov-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
