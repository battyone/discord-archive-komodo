I recently got hold of a presentation given to special agents in the IRS Criminal Investigation division that discussed investigating taxpayers who hold crypto.

I went through all of the 181 horribly formatted slides (attached for reference haha) and here's what I learned...

[dscrd-hush] <Draeth (PhysicalCryptoCoins.com)> The infographics are horrible, I suggest reading the tweet chain to see what's going on. This is why privacy coins like Hush and Pirate are extremely important

We just removed the need to download another large Sprout-related file. Now only 50MB of setup files are needed where $ZEC + all other coins require 1.6GB to be downloaded before ever syncing!

[10-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Besides emission rates what are the other differences between HUSH and, for example, ARRR? I see TOR integration and a messaging feature

[10-Jul-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we could use a bulleted list of similarities/differences

[10-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Hush has smart contracts and Pirate does not, Pirate enforces shielded transactions where Hush does not. Those are probably the 2 largest differences, many smaller ones exist. Pirate and Hush are more alike then they are different

[10-Jul-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto smart contracts Komodo style (CC) or Ethereum style (SC)? (hope ive got my abbreviations correct)

[10-Jul-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh KMD-style cryptoconditions, Hush has a few of them enabled

[10-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate's increased privacy comes at the cost of smart contracts, altho they are working hard to allow some interop between zaddrs and smart contracts

[10-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And it makes sense, they are specialized as the best privacy, they are not specialized for smart contracts, which often require reduced privacy. zaddr smart contracts are not totally impossible, but they are not trivial, either

[10-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @dukeleto I look at Pirate and it allows public address(base on explorer), am I wrong? If it does then Pirate is no different to Hush, if all users of Hush move they coin to z-address the privacy will be exactly the same? I'm I missing something.

[10-Jul-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> The only public addresses on PIRATE are in coinbase and NNs

[10-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM Pirate only supports taddrs in a very limited way, only newly mined coins and notary nodes (to allow DPoW). No arbitrary t -> t xtns are allowed

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Cruz X (10) Type !withdraw or !withdraw HUSH and tipbot will DM you.

[11-Jul-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> I mean, I type balances & I have multiple coins..
will those convert to HUSH? @halo kitty rules

[11-Jul-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> No, I don't think that is an option.

[11-Jul-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> That would be cool

[11-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Cruz X (10) No, it would not be. Tipbot is not mentioned for cashing out shitcoins from other channels. It would require infinite supply of HUSH for that kind of swap.

[11-Jul-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cruz X (10)> ZEC is a shitcoin?

[11-Jul-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Halo.  Are you a fan of hush?

[11-Jul-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> doesnt the HUSH messaging feature distinguish it from ARRR?

[11-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Between Verus and ARRR (and prob lots of other projects), how can Hush find its place? Im asking cuz i was thinking of writing about HUSH. Seems like a solid project and @dukeleto  a good lead. To make a strong narrative it'd b great to have a unique selling point for Hush, a hook. Does it have one?

[11-Jul-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Duke is a great lead

[11-Jul-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> The. Focus for hush is privacy messaging. It's efficient and private.  And the hushlist protocol is one of the nicest features

[11-Jul-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Since Duke is a big proponent of being open source.  It allows for us to not be unique

[11-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> But since Duke is such a great dev.  We are always on the cutting edge of technology

[11-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Hush only takes 50MB of downloaded files to start syncing a full node, Pirate and all other zec coins require 1.6GB, very strategic for mobile/embedded

[11-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Hush is focused on messaging via HushList protocol, no other coin is that I know

[11-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i suggest you download SilentDragon and do Help -> Send Duke Feedback to send me a shielded memo of your feedback üòÉ

[11-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> @dukeleto  I thought you allowed for all zec coins to use protocol

[11-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX you seem confused

[11-Jul-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh VRSC is not a privacy-focused coin. You must keep all funds in transparent addresses to stake, that is the opposite of privacy

[11-Jul-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so that is the last I will speak of VRSC

[11-Jul-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you are trying to create an either/or fallacy, when in reality, I work on KMD code which powers both HUSH and Pirate and Verus and many other coins
