[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> I think HUSH is dead and they are delisting.üò´

[22-Sep-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @Art0077 It's not true

[22-Sep-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> @gilardh just joking

[22-Sep-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JMVB> not true

[22-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we had a miner attack and Cryptopia paused, we are in communication with Cryptopia

[22-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> KMD notary nodes are getting close to Hush working 100% in production, still shaking out some bugz

[22-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JMVB> @dukeleto  check DM

[22-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's in Cryptopia's best interest to keep coins and not delist them, so they can make trading fees. They saw selfish mining attacks, and paused trading to be safe. We are not sure yet which exchanges have gotten hit with a double spend, because confirmation requirements were too low

[22-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> #hush-github is getting a lot of ‚ô•

[22-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> What happend with the price? Is cryptopia stopping the trading of hush?

[22-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> Wow price when down  $0.113374 USD (-53.73%)  ????

[22-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> I sync my wallet already 1 day and its at 55% is that normal ??

[22-Sep-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Art0077  it can take a while to download the blockchain.

[22-Sep-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> One day is a long time though.

[22-Sep-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I haven't had mine take more than 6 hours.

[22-Sep-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> On first startup

[22-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Holy #hush-github commits Batman!

[23-Sep-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @Art0077 , 24 hour price drop was because of a price spike  (pump and dump) at Coinroom on the 22nd 0700 AEST, Hush/PLN pairing. Look at the 1 day chart or weekly chart.

[23-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it wasn't quite a pump and dump, it's that the exchange has very little liquidity. We lost maybe 90% of our trading volume with Cryptopia paused

[23-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that means small buy/sells in the orderbook move the price a lot

[23-Sep-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> somebody bought a large chunk of the orderbook, so price was inflated for a bit until people adjusted their orders, some people sold at a nice price for a few minutes

[23-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but i wouldn't quite call it a pump and dump üòÉ People will definitely be trying to game this liquidity issue, tho. Expect our price to be very volatile until cryptopia is unpaused

[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some people will try to arbitrage from HUSH/BTC , HUSH/USD and HUSH/PLN, which now have big spreads

[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Interestingly, Cryptopia will still think for a long time about  the return of trading?

[23-Sep-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are waiting for KMD dpow in the next release.

[23-Sep-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> many wheels are turning, KMD notary nodes are working out the last few bugs with Hush

[23-Sep-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> once all notary nodes are running Hush in production, that is when end users and exchanges can upgrade

[23-Sep-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> As I understand it is necessary to have patience, it is necessary to wait a little?

[23-Sep-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> until NN's are running, sending data to KMD + BTC, the newest release doesn't have the data it needs, to protect against attacks

[23-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I think that protecting dpow will allow HUSH to declare itself as a reliable coin, it is appreciated

[23-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very few coins have this right now, other than KMD and KMD asset chains

[23-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only CHIPS and GAME have this, as external coins. Hush is the 3rd, and first ZEC fork (CHIPS and GAME are BTC 0.15 forks)

[23-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am also helping a few other coins add KMD dpow, which is why I started writing https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md

[23-Sep-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTCH already has this protection as a KMD asset chain, to clarify

[23-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto And is there something similar to other projects?

[23-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not that I know of

[23-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Notary node operators are doing lots of work behind the scenes to enable Hush!! 9 of 64 nodes have the latest code, so we need 4 more nodes to make our first notarization transaction :hush_white: :hush_puppy: :komodo:

[24-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There will be a new release of Hush soon, once it come outs, everybody must upgrade to it. It's a necessary update.

[24-Sep-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Correct me if I'm wrong, but BTCH being a runtime fork of KMD means it should already have BTC notarization.

[24-Sep-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But I'm not supeerrrr well versed in BTCH, so don't take my words for granted.

[24-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> arbitrage, I meant

[24-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> yes, looks like i will have to take volume into account when beeing marketmaker... so only post bids/asks when volume on cmc is higher then 10000$ or something like that

[24-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cryptopia trading is paused

[24-Sep-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @cipi yes, marketmakers may want to be conservative sometimes, based in volume. Or use an average price over the last day

[24-Sep-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some kind of average pricing, instead of real-time

[24-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if volume is very low, take price average

[24-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> i can only take what cmc tells me... it is already not very easy to update 200 prices because of network limitations... if i start to do complicate calculations every time i update prices it will not work any more...

[24-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @cipi it's not an easy problem, i agree

[24-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @cipi if you want to just set your minimum sell price of Hush to $1, it would not hurt my feelings üòÉ

[24-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> @passcombo.com yes, have 2 marketmaker nodes running with all the coins... i have set the buy-margin to 20-30% some moments ago and will start to remove some of the coins... it is not really feasible to do marketmaker for so many coins

[24-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> yo ualso use apis to cex'es ? which ones ?

[24-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> i use the prices from CMC, because they are aggregated, from many different exchanges

[24-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> it is too dangerous to use single exchanges as a price source... could work well if the volume is high... will surely work for BTC, LTC and the bigger coins, but not for all the small ones

[24-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> ah ok I though you are doing arbitrage CEX vs DEX prices

[24-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> but you only trade on DEX, but use CMC as referrence

[24-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com> I heard low volumes on DEX, how much volume you get in BTC monthly ?

[24-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <cipi> oh, i see... no, not yet... i wanted to start writing a script to do that, but then i realized that it will not work with BTC, because the CEXes charge a lot for withdrawals... would only work if i would be able to set the min. trade amount to something like 1000$... i will try to do it for all other coins, no BTC...
