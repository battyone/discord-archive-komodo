[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> unfortunately I cannot prove anything myself. no screenshots, no nothing. only know exactly how many I bought because I put it on my blockfolio, and the price I bought in at

[15-May-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> and I bet there's more of us like that

[15-May-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Andreas> yeah... me too... I only have a notepad where I kept a record ... but it doesn't prove anything üòÑ

Zcash forced the recipients of their own Founders Reward to get 25% less (or else what?) so that the company could stay solvent. With a burn rate of $880K/month, it's no wonder that "The company is currently operating at a deficit" $ZEC transparency report

[dscrd-hush] <ITM> I used to transfer in and out of Cryptopia, I made peace with it and written it off. At January Prices its was $350 to rebuy the hush ($0.035) I lost at cryptopia. üòÉ  I did do lot trades that tripple my coin and value is now 7x.

[15-May-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> cryptomiso is not counting correctly

[15-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> seems like they only look at the old hush git repo master branch

[15-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and even still, with that not being touched since August, we are still #224 out of #768 coins

[15-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if they actually ranked us correctly

[15-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have no doubt we would be top #100 and probably top #50

[15-May-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> let me say that again

[15-May-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Ignoring all work on Hush since last August, it still ranks higher than 2/3rds of all coins on CryptoMiso!"

[15-May-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is kind of amazing

[15-May-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> They seem to take support requests over on twitter, we should contact them too about changing to the correct repo

[15-May-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they should be looking at our entire github organization

[15-May-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or if they must only look at certain repos: hush3, SilentDragon, myhush.github.io, myhushwallet

[15-May-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that would capture most development

[15-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Other coins don't have their repos accurate either, for example Komodo's is pointing at jl777/SuperNET

[15-May-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that repo is much older, they probably did that a long time ago

[15-May-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe they only support 1 repo per coin? that is weird

[15-May-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @dukeleto .Cryptopia was founded by Hexx, with Hexindustries company. It seems that a couple of years ago investors left the founders Rob /Adam ... And they named a new CEO, from there, everything very bad

[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool Bought 3 days before closing with intention to stake....

[15-May-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Luffy 
1) you can't stake KMD
2) I'm not seeing the connection to Agama

[15-May-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> OHHHHHHHH!

[15-May-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> ????

[15-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ignore me, I read the "safu" comment as "snafu" and was on the wrong train of thought

[15-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> read somewhere that you received interest if you saved KMD

[15-May-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> You earn a reward for *using* KMD

[15-May-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> you can send to yourself once a month and earn ~5.1% APR
but it's not similar to staking

[15-May-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> ok, i know

[15-May-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's kind of close, but yes, KMD's interest mechanism is unique

[15-May-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not exactly staking
