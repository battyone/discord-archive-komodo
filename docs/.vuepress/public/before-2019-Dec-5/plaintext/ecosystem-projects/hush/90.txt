[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that quote seemed appropriate

[17-May-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool I just predict it will increase. I know its unreliable and stupid way. Its just a feel and not a measure.

[17-May-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> 4sure

[17-May-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c We can make investor vote also, 50% miners 50% holders, they vote once every day until 10000 blocks.

[17-May-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `I just predict it will increase. `
Me too, that's why I'm "OK" with mining at a "loss" because I know that if nothing else inflation will bring it up after years

[17-May-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> why do all this complex stuff, if a 50/50 solution is a halfway decent solution?

[17-May-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> it will but not %300

[17-May-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c It's way more fun.

[17-May-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `but not %300`?

[17-May-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if you mean price, 300% is pittance imo

[17-May-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> the diff

[17-May-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ahhh

[17-May-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> that would depend on how bored some folks got 😛

[17-May-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> true

[17-May-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> I just dont see it...

[17-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Hi to all

[17-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Could we keep some of the money for the 71,000 coin lost due to Sprout being stuck in the old HSH v2? Could this be used to reimburse those who claim it later (holder)? I throw the idea, it may not be good.

[17-May-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Hi @Luffy

[17-May-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> people are still mining it lol

[17-May-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Mining in old chain?

[17-May-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> maybe botnet...

[17-May-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _would be more for @gilardh's suggestion than any other active suggestion thus far_

[17-May-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> 71000 reserved to cover sprout claims is a very good idea

[17-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so 71000 we keep for sprout, 160000 we burn(premine burn) and the rest we distribute?

[17-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> For information, i have no HUSH on cryptopia or HUSH blocked in the old chain (with shielded addresses 'zc')

[17-May-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> seems a sane division

[17-May-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> of course the details of the distribution needs to be defined

[17-May-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but maybe first reach a general consensus that this threeway allocation makes sense first?

[17-May-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> If this is possible especially concerning the claims of 'zc' and cryptopia.

[17-May-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I find it a shame to burn pieces but it's one of the easiest parts to achieve. Premine burn or send bounties to help the coin, that's the question.

[17-May-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> sprout claims can be verified as long as the old chain is kept around

[17-May-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> burning the premine, i think is a unique act by any project

[17-May-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> would be newsworthy

[17-May-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @jl777c distribution will need to be define. But all is ideas still.community will need time to put there input and then maybe 2-3months time final decision can be made.

[17-May-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think the high level allocation of the funds should happen much faster. best way to distribute could well take 2 to 3 months

[17-May-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> or maybe we just pick a method to distribute one week with a portion, and the next week another method, ...

[17-May-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @jl777c It is possible to download the old chain (via the old wallet) and easily navigate in with an application locally or website? I think yes.

[17-May-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> just sync up to the old chain, z_importviewkey. to verify balance

[17-May-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> or even z_importkey as there is no other value to the privkey

[17-May-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Burning the pre-mine amount does feel like it sets something "right", something in the distant past that happened much before I ever thought of joining Hush.

[17-May-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think it is down to the methods of distribution

[17-May-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> 71000 reserved to cover sprout claims and burn everything else like the DEA slashing through pot crops

[17-May-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JWolf (WW Clan leader)> Burn it

[17-May-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> distribution => 
1. average distribution among claims
2. Promotions + Giveaways
3. Burn it
4. block reward - 10% extra block reward.
5. Auction the remaining to fund exchanges

[17-May-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @JWolf (WW Clan leader) I think the plan was to give it to cryptopia when the open the market to distribute among users that lost funds. I forgot what was the decision originally.

[17-May-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Those Twitter bounties(retweet, write something abt Hush) etc. were really popular right?

[17-May-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Lots of interesting ideas in the channel today, thanks to everybody that contributed

[17-May-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it's great to see so much constructive dialogue here, 

and i really like the idea of reserving 71000 for sprout claims, burning the pre-mine(160000) and then possibly sharing the rest with the community in some way.

[17-May-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, I believe we are going towards something like that. We just need to figure out some specifics

[17-May-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Little update about SilentDragon GUI wallet: it now renders the notarized height in the bottom right, along with USD price from Coingecko. Rendering BTC and EUR price is also possible, the data is there, but some work needs to be done to use it and render it

[17-May-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> nice little feature you will notice is that it renders the fiat value of the address balance and miner fee, which I find to be a nice feature

[17-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it would be possible in the future to have a user setting where you can choose which currency to translate into, BTC, USD, EUR, etc...

[17-May-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Saving cryptopia HUSH coin should be given first to cryptopia HUSH user.

[17-May-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Which brings back "how do you verify who is user without topia disclosing their books?"

[17-May-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> <https://explorer.hush.zelcore.io/address/t1dDnv8urFUdcxFuWJ7gkFrgUVnUkz5UH52>
How would you disprove my claim that 20k of what I sent was still in my topia wallet and I didn't dump it all?

[17-May-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> mind reading drones

[17-May-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Ask Cryptopia again...

[17-May-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> pretty sure the courts wont let topia release any info, police investigation and all that

[17-May-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> that was my thought

[17-May-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> best for all to just write off any topia funds

[17-May-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> very hard I understand.

[17-May-19 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not familiar with NZ law, probably similar to british

[17-May-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it seems that customer funds would not go into the general account, so eventually when all the tallies are made, they will start letting people collect their coins, but require very stringent KYC, as by 2025 the KYC will be quite extreme

[17-May-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> and these data are certainly considered confidential.

[17-May-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `2025` made me LOL at 1st and then my brain said 'that's just a few years away' 😕

[17-May-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> At least they have laws about it, others disappeared as cryptsy and never more was heard of the funds

[17-May-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Should Cryptopia give us the login associated with the balance of HUSH?

[17-May-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @gilardh Yes, The login Email Address and the balance. But only the information should be available to the dev for privacy reason. But will they give us? For them its easier and one less coin to worry about.

[17-May-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> I think it will not happen anymore login in craptopia

[17-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> Being very attentive to mail fraud, is the perfect occasion for scammers

[17-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Should Cryptopia give us the login associated with the balance of HUSH?`
I'm not sure they legally could even if it were set up that way

[17-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `But will they give us?`
The 1st question is still: **Can** they?
then comes: *Will* they?

[17-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I think the email address is more confidential than a login.

[17-May-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Is this already asked?

[17-May-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @heguli97 Exactly. Giving the coins to cryptopia will result in people getting ~30% of 1600sats per coin. 480sats. That to they will use the lowest value of the attack which $.01 per coin or less

[17-May-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> That's a fact

[17-May-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-May-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if/when they could give anyone anything, there's no reason to not assume 1:1 old:new, unless there's a coverage issue that I haven't read about

[17-May-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <unknown> is it correct that there are 3 devs here?

[17-May-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
