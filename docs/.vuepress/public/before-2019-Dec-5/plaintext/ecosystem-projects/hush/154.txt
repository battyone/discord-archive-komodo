[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Thank you

[17-Jul-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We made it to top of what to mine

[17-Jul-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Amazing

[17-Jul-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Again, with almost no trading volume , that is utterly meaningless.   That being said, I have mined a ton of hush and will continue to mine it.  I like the project.  üòÅ

[17-Jul-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Cool

[17-Jul-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> You're an asic miner?

[17-Jul-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> asic and gpu.

[17-Jul-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Beam/grin?

[17-Jul-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Nah, lately it's been BZE/XSG on the gpu side.

[17-Jul-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Being listed on the top few coins on whattomine.com again probably is helping the current sell pressure. We were not listed there on default filters for a long time

[17-Jul-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `$0.034341 USD`
There's just soooooooo much wrong with that üò¶

[17-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - MineHush.com glad you feel it

[17-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> BTC has correct from almost 14K down to 9K, so a lot of blood is expected

[17-Jul-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Also, A9++'s were delivered in the last few weeks. That is a lot of new hashrate, and some of it is pointed at Hush. And those people want to pay off those big investments

[17-Jul-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Hush is definitely undervalued at the moment.

[17-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> wow

[17-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> my 2nd z9 mini rocks

[17-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> able to do 700 mhz

[17-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> 15k sols

[17-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> and the fan speeds are much lower

[17-Jul-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `and the fan speeds are much lower`
the fan control on those things is feken retarded
unplug the RJ45 connector, watch as they shut down and the fans go to max ü§¶üèΩ

[17-Jul-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> didnt know where to order a9++ safely

[17-Jul-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> some guy was selling z11 from vietnam

[17-Jul-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> but it was scary

[17-Jul-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> on ebay

[17-Jul-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> and then some guy on fpga discord was selling me z11 for $2300 where i could pay half now and pay half later

[17-Jul-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> sounds scammy

[17-Jul-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> so i didnt pull the trigger

[17-Jul-19 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> half now and pay half later = for folks I know and know they have a vested interest in the ecosystem
ship 1st, pay later = all else but manufactures

[17-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> so you are saying i made the right choice?

[17-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> lol

[17-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> cant mine anything with them

[17-Jul-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> too expensive power

[17-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i much energy is z9 mini with 700mh pulling?  and what about 650?

[17-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i dont have them on a meter

[17-Jul-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> but they are both on 1000w desktop psu

[17-Jul-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> They do start pulling a fair bit of power once you start overclocking.

[17-Jul-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> I've never measured because I've never cared

[17-Jul-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> how do you know if you are mining at a profit then?

[17-Jul-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> I have 8 running right now in varying degrees of overclock and they pull around 2700 watts.

[17-Jul-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - MineHush.com> `how do you know if you are mining at a profit then?`
because
my income > my expenses

[17-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Personally, I eat the electricity.  Makes no sense to sell in the current market imo.

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> i actually havent sold any crypto in 2 years

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> On a hobbiest scale that is, of course.

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> but it took 15 gpus to get 15 a day.

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> hush that is

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> when i was mining

[17-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> stopped for awhile

[17-Jul-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> I was a glutton for hush before the fork when the net hash was down to 300K.  üòÉ

[17-Jul-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> 300k and Asics?

[17-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <blankmac - BasementPool> Yeah, it got really low for a bit.

[17-Jul-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX max z9m power draw is 3.75amps at 750mhz, 500mhz is 2.5amp

[17-Jul-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> not including efficiency losses of your PSU, add another 10% ish for that

[17-Jul-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> So 625 MHz is about 312 watts

[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Nice to see our discord so active today

[17-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @AkiraX if you use 220v, everything is much less amperage, which means you can run more miners

[17-Jul-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @RunningMantheCoin indeed it is

[17-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> amps is usually what limits how many miners you can run. And cooling

[17-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> My a9 came with a different psu

[17-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763

"Shitcoin" is not profanity. It is a highly technical term in monetary economics.

I sincerely thank @WarrenDavidson for introducing such an important concept to the rest of the members of the US Congress. https://t.co/0S7NVjn4AH

[dscrd-hush] <D2D> There was a problem with some of the listing disappearing and I think it was caused by a limit in the "max_input_vars" in PHP. I've raised the number much more now, so it shouldn't happen again. It only affected the listings in the wallets' section, all the other ones in the "Crypto Currencies" and the "Messaging and Chat" sections are OK. Feel free to vote again for the HUSHmate wallet if you did before.

This bodes well for Store-of-Privacy coins like $HUSH, $BLUR, $ARRR and many others. The age of people truly attaching monetary value to their privacy is just beginning. Which is good, because corporations have valued and monetized our privacy long ago. https://t.co/L9bdyU...
