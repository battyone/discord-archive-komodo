[dscrd-hush] <Berg> !airdrop 10 HUSH

[24-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> @Berg  That's a bit complicated. @dukeleto  said a couple of weeks ago that you guys will be coming up with a simpler instructions for it. Are my coins safe in the old wallet?

[24-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yes, if you have your old private key as well you can just plug it to https://wallet.myhush.org and your new balance will show

[24-May-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> Just tried it and it shows 0 coins

[24-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> Just a load of addresses with 0 confirmed and 0 unconfirmed in the columns.

[24-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Do you have your old address handy? You can plug it in at https://explorer.myhush.org and it should show your balance

[24-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Maybe you acquired the balance after the fork(block 500'000) and so they don't transfer to the new chain?

[24-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> no I have had them for ages

[24-May-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> ok

[24-May-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> I have hush swing wallet ui

[24-May-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> are you using the wallet.dat?

[24-May-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> don't understand what you mean by wallet. dat

[24-May-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ok, then you are using the private key to login?

[24-May-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> if so you need to click the gear icon and select paste private key

[24-May-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> OK, I tried it with the DAT and they have showed up on the online hush wallet.

[24-May-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CrypThor> So are my coins safe as they are?

[24-May-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @CrypThor Now that you can see them in the web wallet, if you want,  you can go to the export menu and download your private keys for easier access, and you can use those in any Hush wallet you want, just remember to keep them safe somewhere so no one can steal them üòâ

There are two flippenings you can expect to see in your lifetime:

A personal flippening when your crypto assets exceed your traditional assets

A global flippening when world crypto assets exceed world traditional assets

Which one happens first is up to you

 The liquidators are trying to determine which account holders own which digital assets, but the information they need is hosted on servers run by an Arizona company that‚Äôs terminating its agreement with Cryptopia and demanding about $2 million, the declaration states.

The liquidators are concerned that if they don‚Äôt pay the Arizona company, Cryptopia‚Äôs data could be overwritten or lost.
