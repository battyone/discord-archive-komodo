[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> it's a very easy dos to defeat btw

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Firstly, set a cron job to spam 0 fee xtns, 24/7

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> simply send *1* high fee tx per block and miners will prioritize it

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any that get thru, make the attack cheaper

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not true

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright that allows one high-fee-payer to make an xtn per block, does not stop general clogging of the network

[26-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and most GUI wallets disable custom fees

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> ok, you make a ztx that is so big it would leave no room for other txes, you pay a 0.0003 fee

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it takes 2 to fill a block

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> someone sends a "normal" tx with 0.0004 fee

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with custom patches

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> miner won't mine your's

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or just 1 to fill a block with ZEC spec

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright that "someone" sending with 0.0004 fee is nobody

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or the attacker, lulz

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Nobody is doing that. That is the attack

[26-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash does not believe in a fee market

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So they are learning via this.

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> idk man, lmk I guess

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> don't do anything malicious

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright also, my xtns will be of various sizes to fill in empty space in blocks

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> if you do it, only enough to demonstrate it works

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You brought it up, dude

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Not believing me ðŸ˜…

[26-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> yea well I am skeptical that it will work

[26-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> many coins don't have a "fee market"

[26-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> you could fill HUSH blocks very cheaply as well

[26-Aug-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> but is that a dos or is it working as intended? ðŸ˜›

[26-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright the entire point of this is to show all Zcash Protocol coins were effected and ZEC is cheapest to attack with largest marketcap

[26-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright Pirate would be trivial to attack as well

[26-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and Hush. And every ZP coin

[26-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and even tho they all mitigated, it doesn't really matter. It's crazy cheap in fiat terms

[26-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright your defense against the attack is what I am trying to show: that we need to allow custom fees in GUI wallets, and additionally, we need to help users decide which fee they want to pay

[26-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !ticker zec

[26-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> $3/day to make something worth $380,000,000 not work. Even if it's $30/day, that is way too little

[26-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright do you know of any exchange that lets you set a network txfee to decide how fast you want your withdraw?

[26-Aug-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what happens when a woodchipper is running, and every exchange out there assume 0.0001 is always fine (which they often do) ?

[26-Aug-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> might be a way for withdraws to be indefinitely "hung" or maybe even made to expire

[26-Aug-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> to research the full implications of Sapling Woodchipper, it's a full time job

[26-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash xtns expire. If the woodchipper runs enough hours to make an xtn expire, it must be re-made.

[26-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright that implication has not been fully explored

[26-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no Replace-by-fee on Zcash mainnet, either

[26-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No way to give an existing xtn a higher fee, I don't think. That was never merged from BTC

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> can spend an output of an unconfirmed tx with higher fee

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> miner will include both

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> on KMD or ZEC?

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> doesn't really matter in this case

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> on any BTC protocol coin

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that doesn't seem safe in regards to 51% attackers re-org'ing and censoring xtns

[26-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I guess that is rare?

[26-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not sure what you mean

[26-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> but yea... wouldn't really matter if moon boy's withdraws are stuck

[26-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> not exactly a user friendly thing to do

[26-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> spending an output of an unconfirmed xtn (in the mempool). What happens if that xtn is censored by a 51% miner, i.e. removed from the block?

[26-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> don't know what you mean

[26-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> selfish mining attack of removing xtns

[26-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "censoring xtns"

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> if a node doesn't see the initial tx, it won't add the next tx to mempool

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> well...

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Spending an unconfirmed xtn

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> yea idk what you mean

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> you could censor the second tx I guess?

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what exactly?

[26-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> but how is that any different?

[26-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Spending unconfirmed outputs seems dicey to me. I know it "all works out in the mempool" usually, but under a selfish mining attack, well, I wouldn't trust my life savings to one of those xtns

[26-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Spending from the mempool is magic

[26-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and sometimes doesn't work, often in ZP coins because of slight BTC/ZEC changes

[26-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> spending from mempool did not work for the Hush v3 airdrop, I might have scars

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> it didn't work because sendmany waits for 1 conf by default

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> there is an optional arg to turn that off

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup, did that

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Decker confirmed

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he didn't understand why it didn't work

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that is when I say "good enough"

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I was using Decker-written code

[26-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> raw txes ftw

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> I showed you Emman's tool that I had used about 2 dozen times

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> just saying....

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, requires raw xtns to do correctly, or i hit some dumb bug

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> that does it all in a single block :troll:

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Alright i read the source code to the tool. nothing against it, but it's not my style

[26-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I want to know I can fix any part of the tool I am using

[26-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> his has really cool features, tho

[26-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> yea is a quite well thought out

[26-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> keeps a db of what has been sent and what hasn't

[26-Aug-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> the "bug" you hit is a feature

[26-Aug-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Alright> like I said, sendmany won't try to spend unconfirmed funds unless you tell it to explicitly
