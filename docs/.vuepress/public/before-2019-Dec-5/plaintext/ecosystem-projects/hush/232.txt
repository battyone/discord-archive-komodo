[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What we can do, is make people have better opsec from now until the next update. Then we can enforce some of that opsec with code

[19-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But enforcing it all, it's massive changes

[19-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> changing wallet.dat format, even

[19-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So we can help with privacy opsec

[19-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But nothing is more valuable than understanding

[19-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh let's be positive for a moment

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> There are many simple little things that users can do

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Firstly, in HUSH: Using fucking zaddrs, lol

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I am very safe from the @ITM attack if I send with every z transaction a 1sat to a never touching address or?

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Pirate users don't have that option üòâ

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @denio that does seriously mess up the ITM attack, but you will have a hard time enforcing to your wallet.dat that it never be spent

[19-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> which is why I say, GUI wallets and wallet.dat's need to be smarter

[19-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is called "coin control"

[19-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> having control over exactly which UTXOs are spent for what

[19-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only a few very advanced BTC wallets have it (Samourai + Wasabi, others?)

[19-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no BTC core wallet exposes coin control params, it's all deeeeep internals

[19-Sep-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But the ITM attack shows, ZEC world needs coin control like yesterday

[19-Sep-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh so, the easy stuff

[19-Sep-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh Don't post zaddrs publicly, unless it's your one "public zaddr" that you keep track of manually

[19-Sep-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh do not post txid's publicy, send them via private DM/etc

[19-Sep-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh do not tell anybody that your zaddr Z1 is involved in a txid, unless they must know

[19-Sep-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Can I generate a paper wallet zaddr and use it for this? So I have not my own wallet.dat involved

[19-Sep-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh all of the above apply to ARRR+HUSH

[19-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh also: Sending to multiple zaddrs helps your privacy. Instead of making 2 different transactions, send to 2 addresses at the same time

[19-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those are the simple easy things, i would say

[19-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush has some more advice, for stuff that you can't do on Pirate

[19-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh we need this to protect Pirate+Hush users

[19-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you make it happen, Pirate+Hush people will give bounties. I will give 500 HUSH to start it off

[19-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We need these docs really bad

[19-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> here's one of the main probs. moving coin to exchanges (maybe even DEX;s) basically breaks all anon since they can be subpoenaed

[19-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> AtomicDEX cannot be subpeanaed

[19-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because there is nothing to send paperwork to

[19-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> does AtomicDEX store txid's?

[19-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> store them where?

[19-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there is no central location

[19-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> what if u user loses a tx?

[19-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and contacts support?

[19-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> do they have a reference?

[19-Sep-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> swap id is a global unique id

[19-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you can write something specific to Pirate or Hush or both, but if you do write some kind of good docs about this stuff, I will give a bounty. Do what you think is right

[19-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The design of atomicdex is such that if something fails, funds go back to the original parties

[19-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I'll do it, but it may not look good --- jump thru these extra hoops to preserve your anon is the gist of it atm

[19-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> yikes

[19-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I saw @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ 's post in ARRR discord re this same issue

[19-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> it makes perfect sense tho, whenever things are linked, a connection can eventually be made

[19-Sep-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ITM's mitigations r purely that right?

[19-Sep-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> with enough computing power any UTXO-based privacy system can eventually be cracked? Even with ARRR which is immune since outputs stay in z addrs (if i understood things right) how can any commerce system exist when merchants keep books and pay taxes and therefor keep txid's?

[19-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I don't think any Zcash privacy Coin is immune

[19-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ü§î

[19-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ARRR i think is

[19-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ARRR atomic swaps are not... yet

[19-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> (cuz z>t for swapping)

[19-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Even z-z transaction are not immune again the itm attack... Or @dukeleto

[19-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i believe they are

[19-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Ah ok... I understand from @ITM that they are not immun... But I have understand this not right maybe

[19-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the prob is when z goes to t everyting can be linked retroactively

[19-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> with the MAJOR caveat that any known txid's can blow your cover, even in ARRR. hope i got this right @dukeleto

[19-Sep-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> I understand it this way: only the amount is private. Everything else is hard to track but you can track it with the right method

[19-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> And with some user mistakes (like doublespending) It is possible to break your privacy full

[19-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ah yes, that sounds right

[19-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> tracking receiver/recipient without amount is bad enough

[19-Sep-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> For private money yes... For private messaging I don't know really

[19-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Example: you can get a punishment   in Germany when they can proof you pay terrorist or some bad actors... They don't have to know the exact amount.

[19-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> They can't do it because you communicate with someone

[19-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> As long as the content still stay secret

[19-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> ü§î

[19-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> ARRR is immune to amount attack. Since no tx address, but a lot of meta leaking can expose lot of information. 
Hushlist the messages are encrypted and secured.

[19-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> ARRR implements Z-Address mining, it be immune to guessing the amount.

[19-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM coinbase zaddrs, I have thought about that too üôÇ

[19-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> so far ARRR is the most secured coin out there

[19-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM coinbase zaddrs, at first, seem like they would hurt your attack. But I am pretty sure coinbase zaddr will not give you much problem

[19-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `i believe they are`

[19-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I know of a few coins which have "coin control" properties( Smartcash, BitcoinC, Bulwark) just to name a few.

[19-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Coinbase zaddrs have a publicly known amount because the block reward is publicly known @ITM

[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 cool, we need that stuff

[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM so coinbase zaddr does not help ARRR

[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, the fees in that block will be transparent

[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> it just makes it harder. but not solve the chain issue

[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so there won't even be some dust, to change the amount slightly

[19-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM I mean, your attack still works fine, even if people can mine directly to a zaddr

[19-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Because we still know, the block reward is X

[19-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and fees will not be included in the shielded block reward, fees are public

[19-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not defined yet, maybe we can make zcoinbase harder for the ITM attack

[19-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <scubapanda> @dukeleto For the 0/1 sats address you could just incorporate a sapling address generator in the gui wallet and run it at first run? This way that private key will never touch the wallet.dat and the 1 sats can never be merged/used by accident.

[19-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @ITM

[19-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > so far ARRR is the most secured coin out there

[19-Sep-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> is there a but?

[19-Sep-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> introduction of atomic swaps will lower the privacy level of ARRR

[19-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> agreed

[19-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh #deanon

[19-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is our new channel for Proof-of-Deanon and ITM attack talk

[19-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we might be scaring the #general people

[19-Sep-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @scubapanda you have the kernel of a very good idea there. We can use the paper wallet generator, and avoid the privkey of that addr being in the wallet.dat!

[19-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> awesome @dukeleto !

[19-Sep-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seko> @jl777c so better use no Atomic Swaps for ARRR, if it technically implemented?

[19-Sep-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Seko> Avoids public IP addresses and centralized Exchanges with KYC.

[19-Sep-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> like needing a public use zaddr for using exchanges and tx with others, you will need to do the same with atomicDEX

[19-Sep-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and then isolate those funds through additional z->z

[19-Sep-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we are working to mitigate the ITM attack
