[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It's obvious. Almost all new members in last 8 hours are bots. You can recognize them as composite of female name and 2,3 or 4 numbers.

[22-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @halo kitty rules yep, very easy to spot, I'd ban them but it's so slow doing it on mobile

[22-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Good, no need to hurry. Someone other will come by and ban them.

[22-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It's obvious that's weekend and there are less people around.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @dukeleto Spamming bots are new users. Their names are composites of female personal name and 2-4 numbers. They signed in 10 hours ago.

[22-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @evich not sure we want to require phone numbers for our discord users

[22-Jun-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> This came in one by one and not all at the same time.

[22-Jun-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @evich i don't like the privacy/metadata implications of that, unfortunately

[22-Jun-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We will make new rules for new users to try and limit this

[22-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We can add the rule where new users have to wait X minutes before saying something, but I have heard these bots just join slowly (like described above) and wait diligently until they can spam you

[22-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So that doesn't do much

[22-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> Ok.  So in a nutshell what caused Hush to drop from a high of $26 to ten cents?  Are there specific reasons?  Please dont flame.  Honestly wanting to know

[24-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @anglersec First reason is 2017 altcoin rally, combined with expectations of BTCH airdrop. Price was overhyped. Second reason is switching from GPU to ASIC mining. Newly generated coins are ÀùmintedÀù cheaper.

[24-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <anglersec> @halo kitty rules Many thanks for the explanation.  Completely understand the price overhype.  So moving to ASIC mining. How much cheaper are the coins minted.  Trying to determine realistic target price for Hush as BTC approaches ATH....

[24-Jun-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Price of GPU coins was for a long time about 1 USD. At the break of 2018/2019 were ASIC coins sold at 0.03 or 0.05 USD. Now it is about 0.10 USD. Let say fair price is 0.05-0.10 USD and miner still make some profit.

[24-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @anglersec it's a fair question, we are friendly to fair questions üòÉ

[24-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @anglersec ATH of HUSH is about 160K sat or $17.89 according to coingecko, but it depends on which exchanges and if you include intra-day or only closing price

[24-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @anglersec if you look at price of ZEC since then, it's down a similar large % . Most altcoins saw much larger downturns than BTC, which did close to -90% I believe

[24-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that explains the general market reasons

[24-Jun-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in particular, Hush saw some hard times. Developers left, exchanges closed trading, there was not much activity from lack of interest due to bear market
