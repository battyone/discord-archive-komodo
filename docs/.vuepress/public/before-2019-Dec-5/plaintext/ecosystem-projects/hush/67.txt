[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @Inevitability Try refreshing the page, worked for me

[19-Apr-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> yeees - that's working !!)))

[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> But it's not "t" address

[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Should be R

[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> T is the old chain, Safe has upgraded

[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _is skerd to use safe.trade for fear they will steal more of his coins_

[19-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I keep HUSH in ZelCore trying to send to the exchange on the "R" address - but I am told that is not the correct address)))

[19-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ZelCore does not support the new chain

[19-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You need to use your private key to transfer funds

[19-Apr-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Transfer where ?

[19-Apr-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I need change HUSH to HUSH3 address ?

[19-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yes, t address on old chain has a corresponding R address on the new chain

[19-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I can't understand how I withdraw coins

[19-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> from?

[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> ZelCore

[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I change my address and then what?

[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> afaik, zelcore only supports the old dead chain

[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> there's nothing to do on  the old chain, it's defunct and unsupported

[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> My coins are dead?))

[19-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> The old chain, you received the same amount of coins on the new chain, it's a swap.

[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Then tell me what i need to do.

[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> if you had 10 coins on the old dead chain, you now have 10 coins on the new live chain (using the same private key, just with a different public address)

[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Then tell me what i need to do.`
In order to do what?

[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> What do you want to do?

[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> He's trying to send his funds off of the old chain to SafeTrade

[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> didn't they switch over?

[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool withdraw and change

[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They did, he needs to generate the new address

[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Needs to convert from 't' to 'r'

[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I generated new address and ??

[19-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> 1) go to `https://dexstats.info/addressconverter.php?fromcoin=HUSH&tocoin=HUSH3`
2) enter your old t address
3) click "convert"
4) use that R address
5) import your old wallet.dat into the new wallet

[19-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> import in BarterDex ?

[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Or something more ?

[19-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> BarterDEX isn't a wallet

[19-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Agama !

[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> however, if you used a passphrase on BarterDEX or Agama, the new R addy will still use the same passphrase as your old t addy

[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> ok

[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> try

[19-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability latest agama has been modified to support HUSH3, we are waiting on the next release

[19-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we don't control the Agama release schedule, but are encouraging them to make one soon

[19-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> binaries for various platforms needs to be made, etc

[19-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> It's not working. Agama imports nothing

[19-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> And every time i start Agama, i need to activate HUSH....

[19-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> And yet, now my coins are dead.

[19-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Your coins are not dead unless you lost your private key..

[19-Apr-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Agama not support new hush

[19-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> 1500 years from now, any coins held by any privkey now will still be held by that privkey unless you transfer them

[19-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I don't now, how import private key to Agama

[19-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> What wallet i can use for mining HUSH now ?

[19-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> you don't need a wallet to mine, just use your R address

[19-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yep

[19-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _promises that you will not die if you mine and hold for a few days_

[19-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> best financial move I ever made was not touching certain privkeys for multiple years, 50% luck and 50% things were very different back then

[19-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> also, This Is Not Financial Advice

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I have been writing the whitepaper like a ..... whitepaperer ?

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> does anybody read these things?

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> are whitepapers still a thing?

[19-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> or is this just for me to feel good?

[19-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Since the original BTC whitepaper was 9 pages, that seems the Golden Standard, wouldn't you say @jl777c ?

`wen moon`

[19-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The new HUSH whitepaper prominently features KMD, since that is our upstream. And sure, we mention ZEC/BTC as our grandupstreams...

[19-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ``` HUSH dad? ```

[19-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but the only coin outside of that which is mentioned....

[19-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> didn't mean for this to be a cryptopuzzle

[19-Apr-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but now it is, lol

[19-Apr-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i probably should embed a cryptopuzzle in our whitepaper, eh? an actual private key

[19-Apr-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all the cool kids do that nowadays, i heard

[19-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a privkey which owns HUSH,KMD,BTCH would be a cool little cryptopuzzle to embed in the whitepaper

[19-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> htf did I miss that the 1st time I read it?
