[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Why did you say he wrote the first article since a year ago?

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> I asked, Hush is a project like any other project?

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Projects can't be one dimensional.

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That was what I was getting at.

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> when reading our comments above it is plain we are all in basic agreement on most things, arent we?

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That we want to see Hush do well

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> maybe my bad language....Hush has only focus on the Tech since 2 Years....gigamesh came up with a nice articel. I dont want to offend you....but where is the problem

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> His article was great tbh

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Those are more release notes, right?

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> and competitions , great idea @Privatoshi üëå

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> The competitions is to bring you, more users for binaries

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Duke tweeted new wallet details a few days back

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You could write the articles about them

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> That would be the most important part

[07-Aug-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> And post it on Daily Chain

[07-Aug-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Here is the plan then

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Hush already works in Tails

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Tails OS is a USB or cd plug in

[07-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> One use and turn it off

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We make sure it works

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Did we solve trusted setup?

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Market it

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> We need testers affording to Duke

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> so lets test on tails (or did you have done that) make screenshots and post that on twitter?

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Incorporated KMD ecosystem products

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> is it hard to code a "Hush Linux"?

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @denio  I have not

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But anything is possible

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> sure but we need the coder for it....duke cant make all alone

[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> There's a guy I could talk to & see if we could get on his Distro

[07-Aug-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Duke would have to okay asking him

[07-Aug-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> But it would be exclusive ...
He has no cryptocurrebcy software on it yet

[07-Aug-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
