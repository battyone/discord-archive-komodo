[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> That is horrible.

[18-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> But we should be for the LN.

[18-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> No thx

[18-Oct-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not for nor against LN. I have not yet had a chance to use it. It does not seem drastically better than most "shitcoins"

[18-Oct-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I'm just not for it bc it is using Bitcoin, which runs on a decentralized network, and it is allowing individuals to anonymously run their own nodes and make big changes that wouldn't otherwise take place on the BTC network.

[18-Oct-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Bitcoin is $7,950. 
Would you pay for a candy bar, with a ‚Ç¨1000 bill?

[18-Oct-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> I tried the HUSHmate Swing wallet for messaging. I exported my contact info and imported it, so i was messaging with myself. One thing that i can't get to work is how to copy and paste the text i receive. This is essential functionality.

[18-Oct-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> Maybe the Clipboard is disabled, for privacy concern. I actually don't know.

[19-Oct-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 SilentDragon is where all development happens, and it supports copy/paste

[19-Oct-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Ok. So Silent Dragon only sends memos and files with transactions, or is there a chat function similar to HUSHmate. I wasn't able to locate something likke that

[19-Oct-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> HUSHmate was created before SD existed

[19-Oct-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 in every shielded transaction, you can add a memo, there is a "Memo" button

[19-Oct-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and it will allow you to upload a file as well, currently limited to 512bytes, just like inputting text

[19-Oct-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but it does support choosing a file, right now

[19-Oct-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> ok. No doubt with enough development time, what's in HUSHmate would make it's way to Silent Dragon. Just not currently.

[19-Oct-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Not enough time to do everything.

[19-Oct-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there are no features in HUSHmate that don't exist in SilentDragon

[19-Oct-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but many in :SD: that don't exist in HUSHMate

[19-Oct-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it was mostly for people that were used to our old SWING wallet

[19-Oct-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I didn't write HUSHmate and can't maintain it, so we are standardizing on :SD:

[19-Oct-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it can pair android apps, and do so much. it just makes sense

[19-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> The messaging is great. A developer could probably make a front-end for that, creating something like AOL messenger which uses HUSH to send private messages. Right?

[19-Oct-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes

[19-Oct-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i am working on that for :SD:, but other developers are free to use the memo field however they choose, and build applications that use it/etc

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We have new linux binaries if people want to test

[19-Oct-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> binaries for other platforms will come

[19-Oct-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i regenerated them about 10 times already üòÖ

[19-Oct-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `sudo dpkg -i hush-etc.deb` to install

[19-Oct-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `apt-get remove hush` to uninstall

[19-Oct-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Very cool. Currently if i want to send something private i have to send a link to a note on privnote.com

I did some testing and in SD it shows the memo immediately before the block is confirmed, but i was sending between two private addresses in my wallet. And with 0 amount and 0 fee.

[19-Oct-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> You were able to send with zero fee?

[19-Oct-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <1112> Yes everything eventually got confirmed, both 0 send and 0 fee, as well as 0.0001 send with 0 fee. However, no memo was sent when i sent and received from the same private address.

[19-Oct-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 you can send a memo to yourself to the same address, definitely

[19-Oct-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and yes, you can use amount=0, fee=0 sometimes, a few times per block. If you tried to fill a block with fee=0 xtns, most of them would be ignored

[19-Oct-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @1112 additionally, the wallet of Zcash protocol coins does not keep track of *sent* memos, only received. That can be confusing. You will not see the memos of *sent* xtns in :SD:, nor in the full node of ZEC/HUSH/ARRR

[19-Oct-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a setting in :SD: to keep track of sent zxtns, the amounts/address/etc

[19-Oct-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but the memo is not stored. This is potentially good, since this senttxstore is stored plaintext on your harddrive

[19-Oct-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we stored the senttxstore encrypted, then maybe we can store memos. I don't like storing memos on disk unencrypted

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto none as yet, too soon

[20-Oct-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I think you admirably attempted to give people Graph Theory 101

[20-Oct-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, most people hate Algebra

[20-Oct-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You explained it well, especially since I didn't want to give you any help, to see how you would explain it üôÇ

[20-Oct-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it still doesn't make it easy to understand

[20-Oct-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but you did admirably

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> well if you'd like to add a paragraph explaining the attack in your own words that'd be cool, or you can do so when i cover the POC

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i think its pretty easy to grasp

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> graphs bad

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the general abstract idea, yes

[20-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the specifics of what is new with ITM and how to protect against it

[20-Oct-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's pretty technical and down in the weeds internals, for most people

[20-Oct-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I will tell you, in computer science, the class which you must learn about Graphs, is the "weeder" class

[20-Oct-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it weeds people out of computer science

[20-Oct-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is a known thing, but all the profs and students

[20-Oct-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this class is called "Discrete Mathematics"

[20-Oct-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that class almost took my soul

[20-Oct-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I specialized in continuous non-discrete math, for a reason!

[20-Oct-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but now, look at me. Hacking on stuff with no continuous math for miles! All discrete üòÖ

[20-Oct-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> well in the context of the article the dependency graphs make it all easier to understand: joining the dots

[20-Oct-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> "oh, he can make those kinds of graphs?" etc

[20-Oct-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> actually i asked ITM if he had a graph to share earlier today but he's been afk i guess

[20-Oct-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> if he gets back to me i'll add it in as the icing to the cake

[20-Oct-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> *Fig 1. A z-utco dependency graph*

[20-Oct-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto do u have one?

[20-Oct-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh we usually call them transaction graphs, but they can also be "interaction graphs"

[20-Oct-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> dependency graphs are more for code, that depends on other code, that depends on more...

[20-Oct-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but the words are roughly interchangeable. they are all graphs

[20-Oct-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you could easily make a z-utxo transaction graph of your own zaddr transactions. the "attack" is being able to figure out the transaction graph of other peoples xtns

[20-Oct-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't know exactly what you mean by "do you have one?"

[20-Oct-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a z-utxo graph is going to look like most other graphs. what makes it interesting is all the metadata tied to each graph node, internals zcash data
