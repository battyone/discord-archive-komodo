What is the cost of HUSH / USD? I mine HUSH3, and HUSH comes to my account

[21-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Think of it as cloning the contents of your home at number 2 Hush Street. You have as of 14/04/2019, now officially moved over down Hush Street to number 3 to a more flashy house. The keys you hold open both houses but no one wants the "old" contents to the house at number 2.

[21-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> All the things of "value" are now residing at 3 Hush Street.

[21-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> HUSH v2 is like a half pack of cigarettes you dropped in the swimming pool
HUSH v3 is the fresh new pack the concierge brought to you free of charge

[21-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> hush3 when will exchange ??

[21-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Ok, thanks for explain) .And i need mine to a new "R" address?

[21-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> yes

[21-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Have you gone to the convertor page to go from a t-address to an R-address @Inevitability ?

[21-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Heno1974 send it to `RJ8q5vbzEiSRNeAu39xYfawuTa9djYEsQK` and I will exchange it for 0 BTC in return

[21-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> hush3 new cli walet  nR adress

[21-Apr-19 09:41 AM] se#5393
Where and how can HUSH v3 be exchanged for USD?

[21-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool   i don't know how to send cli wallet

[21-Apr-19 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@se  send it to `RJ8q5vbzEiSRNeAu39xYfawuTa9djYEsQK` and I will exchange it for 0 USD in return

[21-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I'm just use wallet.myhush , paste there my privatekey and get my new "R" address

[21-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Heno1974 if you want to send it all to me, then you just compile it and from the src dir you do:
`./hush-cli sendtoaddress RJ8q5vbzEiSRNeAu39xYfawuTa9djYEsQK $(./hush-cli getbalance) "" "" true`

[21-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _lets you keep your $2_

[21-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Or mine old HUSH and exchange on the safe.trade

[21-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Heno1974> ü§î

[21-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> afaik, unsafe.trade has switched to the new chain

[21-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> But there is a problem. A new address is not a new wallet. If you mine to a new address, the coins will still come to the Agama wallet which does not work with new addresses and exchange is not possible.

[21-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Safe.trade was the first exchange to support HUSH v3

[21-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability don't mine old HUSH, that doesn't make any sense

[21-Apr-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability what are you trying to accomplish?

[21-Apr-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability what if I told you the the purpose of a currency wasn't just to dump it on an exchange? :thinkaboutit:

[21-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Mine and exchange to dollar

[21-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those are 2 different things

[21-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and actually, since there is no HUSH/USD pair I know of, it's 3

[21-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> at a minimum

[21-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we had a HUSH/EUR at one point, maybe

[21-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> HUSH/BTC

[21-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> Every time you mine a currency and dump it on an exchange without using it as a currency a kitten dies

[21-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> After that, TBC to USD )

[21-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> your main issue seems to be lack of a GUI wallet, to make it easy

[21-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we are so close on this dang web wallet, but sending doesn't work because of reasons

[21-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Means mining HUSH now - that doesn't make any sense?

[21-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I means HUSH/HUSH3

[21-Apr-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @Inevitability Would it help if we typed in a different language? Perhaps there's a translation issue?

[21-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> No I understand.

[21-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _doesn't think you do, but OK_

[21-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Start mining)

[21-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _started mining the new chain 7 days ago_

[21-Apr-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> cool

[21-Apr-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability many people are mining the new HUSH chain

[21-Apr-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> only people with no idea what is going on are mining the old chain

[21-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mining the old chain are worthless coins

[21-Apr-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you cannot trade them for new HUSH coins that have value

[21-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Safe.trade and Graviex, the current 2 exchanges which are open, are on HUSH3. There is no way to mine the old chain and turn that into anything of value. Those are worthless coins

[21-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We gave people months of notice, but some miners don't check for updates

[21-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some mining *pools* don't check for updates, which is really quite wasteful

[21-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We won't automatically turn off nodes like ZEC, that is not our jive. So people running full nodes can be adults and upgrade or do whatever they are doing, as described in the whitepaper. We don't force a chain on people, they can choose between the old insecure unsupported Hush v2 or the new shiny, secure Hush v3

[21-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> There is no possibility to exchange for new coins - there is no possibility yet. Waiting for updates for Agama

[21-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Cryptocoins is an active sport

[21-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability if you are willing to use the CLI, it's possible right now. But I am not sure that is best if you are not familiar with it

[21-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> I'm not familiar with it)

[21-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> But familiar with Agama )

[21-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool 3358 blocks mined on the old chain, and counting, can you imagine

[21-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> ü§¶üèΩ

[21-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> think of the kittens

[21-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool the deprecation height was set to some crazy time in the far future, and the Hush v2 network might just run until then

[21-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> like, years

[21-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> even mainnet is decentralized!!!

[21-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> an estimated `1.90 MSol/s` still on old chain; as a miner, I'm fine with that, more profits for me

[21-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yep, great for smart miners who are on the correct chain. Small miners have this advantage

[21-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> huge miners cannot deal with changes like this in short timeframes

[21-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> It amazes me when miners marry a coin and then pay 0 attention to what goes on with it

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, we are talking about ASIC miners

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what is going on, is a few pools didn't care and tons of users are still sending hash to those pools

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i hope this isn't solo miners

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because i would tisk-tisk them

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Inevitability> Do you mine old HUSH? And then what will you do with it? you just told me there's no point in it!

[21-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> even GPU miners.... If you're dedicating everything you have to something, how do you *not* follow it?

[21-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability you seem seriously confused

[21-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Do. Not. Mine. Hush v2 chain. It has no financial value.

[21-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> private keys which contains funds at block 500,000 from HUSH v2, those have value. Those same funds are waiting for you on HUSHv3, unlocked by same private key.

[21-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability he meant to say "because people are mining the wrong chain, i have less competition on correct chain"

[21-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763

as a miner, I'm happy that that much hashrate is on the wrong chain, I make more money that way
as an investor, I don't understand those people

[21-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Apr-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Inevitability you gonna need to ask their discord

[21-Apr-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is a closed source unsupported wallet
