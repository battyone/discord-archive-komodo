Encrypt senttxstore · Issue #25 · MyHush/SilentDragon
It stores a lot of metadata! Leaving it unencrypted in plaintext on disk does not seem to protect our users privacy by default.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> How do people feel about my latest comment in that issue? A "PIN" for :SD:, that you need to unlock some features or the entire wallet, potentially

[12-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> without it, it's not safe to store some metadata on disk, like past transactions

[12-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> what was appropriate and safe for some metadata in the past is no longer considered safe by yours truly, in light of ITM/Metaverse stuff

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Btw.  I had no idea people dated from Facebook

[12-Oct-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's the latest evil way for FB to vacuum all metadata about your life

[12-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I guess nobody feels too strongly about a PIN 😅

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Berg how much longer for competition entries?

[12-Oct-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @gigamesh has the stuck block been solved? We can do an extension based on when it is

[12-Oct-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "what happens when I forget my PIN?" is a real use case that needs to be thought about. basically, you can always just "start fresh", but that wipes away any encrypted metadata that you had stored with the forgotten PIN, such as sent transactions, address books, etc...

[12-Oct-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the PIN protects all the metadata that *isn't* stored in the full node, that needs to sit somewhere. If it's in plaintext on disk, that kind of really sucks

[12-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @Berg maybe re-announce the comp when new wallets are released?

[12-Oct-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Oct-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh how do you feel about making a new page, which lists all the sites that have "info" about hush, such as CMC, coinpaprika, coingecko, binance, etc...

[14-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i can give a bounty. Should just be copying an existing page and changing a few bits

[14-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i agree, too many links on one page is confusing for users

[14-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think a few pages, each with a set of links, might make more sense

[14-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "Wallets", "Explorers", "Chart/Info sites"

[14-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh plz delete the dashboard, as well. it's insanely old, not-updated and referenced our old hush chain

[14-Oct-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's not maintained

[14-Oct-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Oct-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Oct-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 yeah, Hush wasn't an ICO, so we don't really belong on icobench, and there *was* a failed ICO called HUSH. not sure what the "correct" thing is, except people using our ticker is really lame

[14-Oct-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This bug is actually in KMD master branch, it's not just Hush. It's a fascinating edge case bug

[14-Oct-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Thanks! i'm interested to know more about how it happens

[14-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It requires that zaddrs be enabled, AND z=>t xtns, which means KMD and Pirate cannot trigger the bug

[14-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Additionally, a transaction must "spend from the mempool", i.e. spend funds that came into existence in the same block, in a previous transaction
