[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> almost $1M USD per month is their burn rate, it surprised me

[16-May-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they are operating like a silicon valley startup, with massive burn rate

[16-May-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> >At the current price of approximately $60 per ZEC, the company and its employees have been receiving approximately $550k per month.

[16-May-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <hellcatz - LuckPool> That not enough?  hehe

[16-May-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that doesn't include an extra $180k a month they describe later

[16-May-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> did they publish similar report before, like when it was millions per month

[16-May-19 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> @rjanetzek Did you send them from your wallet? or you bought them in craptopia...??

[16-May-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> traded there

[16-May-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> ATM no way for that....Duke has the gems of infinity, but I think you need your keys

[16-May-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Luffy> I have the same position as you, but in KMD

[16-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> i hoped they would reopen with hush3

[16-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rjanetzek> to get them back

[16-May-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <Akira X> How much hush did you have?

[16-May-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _has "a few"_

[16-May-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> regarding the Cryptopia HUSH, was the hope that they would have migrated their wallet over to the new fork and then allowed withdrawals?

[17-May-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Cryptographic we were in talks with Cryptopia for many months, and had a plan to migrate them to Hush v3 and re-enable deposits/withdrawals/trading, we were just waiting on them, they told us we were in a long line of coins they were re-enabling. Then this liquidation news

[17-May-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763

Blockchain analysts won't like this, but I just fixed a metadata leakage issue in Zcash Protocol for @KomodoPlatform , @MyHushTeam , @PirateChain and all asset chains which support zaddrs! Not even $ZEC itself has a fix yet, we like to move fast:

[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> I'm sure that most of us around are in the favour of immutability, but I think that some poll like the following wouldn't hurt much:

It'll only point out what the community wants to do with those Topia coins.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the wp was written much before this news and now needs an update, but all the technical details are still valid

[17-May-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we were still in talks with Cryptopia to re-enable us, when I published the current wp

[17-May-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> they were on board, but said we were in a long waiting list, that they re-enable 2-3 coins per day

[17-May-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and so they have hundreds of coins, so yeah

[17-May-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Yeah, I know that you tried your best to get HUSH re-enabled at Topia. But it seems like Topia had something else in mind that opened up later lol

[17-May-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> any ideas on how to solve topia coin claims?

provided the site is never re-opened and they remain unresponsive for questions

[17-May-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> which is just what might happen

[17-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pepin the Healer we are working on something that we think benefits the community, however imperfect, and will share with the community when it's finalized

[17-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> MtGox is still trying to fully liquidate, so yes, I would expect topia to take just as long. Especially with the active police investigation

[17-May-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> in my mind, the best bet would be trying to get some form of holding data from them

but you can't confirm user identity on the platform (well, not anymore)

[17-May-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That is not viable for many reasons

[17-May-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> then again, i just might bite the bullet and buy them all over again
taking depreciation into account, whining over $150 lost gets old ðŸ˜…

[17-May-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> in any event, if it is indeed impossible to trace the majority, i think a burn would be fairer than selective airdropping

i do recall that the WP states that the remainder is intended for exchange listings

[17-May-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Pepin the Healer burning it all *is* another option versus selective airdropping, I can see why some people would want that, in terms of pure "fairness", but I am not sure the larger community agrees

[17-May-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If a bad person leaves town, leaving an empty mansion, I would rather help 10 families live in it than burn it down because that is the more "fair" option. Yes, only 10 families get to benefit, it's not fair to all the other homeless families, but it's still a "better" solution imho, which is completely subjective, I admit

[17-May-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I would like to hear from people about DiscordTip, do people use this on other discords?

[17-May-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's $400 one-time fee to setup the Hush discord with DiscordTip, and I need to know if it's worth it

[17-May-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> From what I see, many coins are using it and it has a lot of features

[17-May-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a lot of time and work to run something like that manually on our own server, so a 1 time fee sounds kind of nice. I heard people charging 0.75btc for this kind of thing in the past

[17-May-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> gopher it

i mean, i'm in the process of creating a tipbot for another coin, but it's a pivx fork with staking support so the wallet rpc apis wouldn't exactly translate 1:1

[17-May-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> offchain tipping, no registration

[17-May-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> rather basic, but would be free

[17-May-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `any ideas on how to solve topia coin claims?`
imo, the "solution" is: "Do nothing"
At what point do you "make folks whole" after their own 3rd party transactions went sour and not sacrifice immutability?

[17-May-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> uh

[17-May-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kryptonite> @dukeleto I have a multi-coin tip bot, it's quite new. We can list cheaper than DiscordTips. Let me know if interested!

[17-May-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Kryptonite sure, dm me some more info

[17-May-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kryptonite> will do

[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner...`
After you send coins to an address you don't own the keys to, they aren't your coins anymore.

[17-May-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just to be clear, Hush sidestepped this whole "immutability" argument already, or maybe "stepped in it and kept going" is a better analogy

[17-May-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We airdropped funds to a new, upgraded, more secure + faster chain. In that process, we DID NOT airdrop the Cryptopia attacker funds. By mining a new mainnet and airdropping funds to it, immutability of the original v2 chain was "preserved" *on that chain*, but we made an entire new chain and deprecated the old. This was the best option we had

[17-May-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> by many measures, it was the only option we had

[17-May-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If you think Hush v2 is better, go join the people mining it

[17-May-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This is a decentralized world

[17-May-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I have issues with that, the same as I did ETH, but I wasn't part of that convo ðŸ˜›

[17-May-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In the current situation, chain immutability issues are behind us

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `This is a decentralized world`
You kinda can't make that claim when you pick and choose who has the right to possess what, imo

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> What we are talking about now, is how to *fairly* redistribute the topia funds, knowing that we can't even get close to "perfectly fair", just "fair enough"

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool well, if this was ZEC, I would have turned off your nodes forcibly, and forced you to choose

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I didn't choose

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> By choosing v2 or v3, YOU make the choice

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `how to fairly redistribute the topia funds`
"fairly", they belong to topia

[17-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fairly, they belong to the attacker

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Topia HAS NO FUNDS. Not on v2, not on v3

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> say it with me

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> topia has nothing

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `By choosing v2 or v3, YOU make the choice`
Again, kinda only half true when v2 isn't supported by any dev(s)

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool nobody said you get supported software forever for free, nowhere does it say that

[17-May-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you get to keep the pieces when it breaks

[17-May-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> LOL

[17-May-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and read the source

[17-May-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so yes, one option is to make the original attacker whole, another is to give it all back to cryptopia so they can dump on us, or another is to spread it around the current active Hush community

[17-May-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i know which option CG doesn't like ðŸ˜…

[17-May-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> these are all hard questions, and CG is bringing up very valid points

[17-May-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't argue that.

[17-May-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But I am in the position of doing what is best for Hush, not what is best in some theoretic sense in a theoretical situation on a theoretical coin

[17-May-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> my point is that the "official" (in as much as that ever exists) chain/params/client is centralized to some extent
that becomes more true when the decision is actively made to pick and choose who gets what (even further if that choice is "forced" by devs only supporting a singular option)
