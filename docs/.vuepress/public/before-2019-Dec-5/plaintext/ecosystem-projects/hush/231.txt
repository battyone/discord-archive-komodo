[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> maybe we can setup a mining pool? create a token to incentivize participation?  Call it $B2F? üôÉ

[18-Sep-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I mean... is that crazy?

[18-Sep-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> A fork of ARRR or HUSH with some new ITMPoW that secures the chain while de-anon'ing other coins... yeah ill shut up cuz that s a mental idea but i do kinda love it (still, i wont mention it again). a new breed of crypto, the *attack* coin

[18-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> @gigamesh not really. We can create a protocol to split the analyses work and solve proofing to link between z-address(Like mesh network). But when we play catch up, the resources needed will be 1/100, maybe 100 GPU to do real time.

[18-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> you mean its not crazy?

[18-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> not crazy at all

[18-Sep-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> 100 GPU is not that much....

[18-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> issuing coins as you deanonimize other coins, it is possible to do

[18-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> will need to do cross chain and also have a way to prevent people from creating easy to deanon txid to get easy coins

[18-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> if somebody were to crate that i would support it in full as a volunteer.

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ITM = In The Middle ? üòé

[18-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the blockchain state would be the current deanon state of external chains. to mine coins, you need to advance the state

[18-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> such a mechanism would allow to pay for GPU cycles

[18-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> so a metric that indicates the anon status of a chain is needed. once that is there it is a matter of a practical implementation

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Proof-of-Deanonymization mining üëº

[18-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c this monetizes old GPU farms

[18-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh, the implications

[18-Sep-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> i love it, i love it, i love it! times like this i wish i was more eloquent. if this can actually be made it is the most devilishly subversive tech i can think of. it's an exciting and radical new class of coin (an *attack* coin?), a coin which ultimately helps privacy by testing it rigorously with unprecedented incentives.

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Proof-of-Deanonymization = genius

[18-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> might be easiest to make a CC chain, were all the premined coins are locked in a CC address. then as the external chains are provably deanonymized, coins released from the locked funds based on how much was deanonymized

[18-Sep-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let's call that token....btch. :)

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> suggestions: **BTF** or **B2F** (if @ITM digs the reference cuz it's his baby) but I almost like **ITM** more (In The Middle)

[18-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> it would need dPoW cuz it'd be attacked

[18-Sep-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> When moon for ITM?

[18-Sep-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> üê∑

[18-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ideally it should itself be the most anon of coins

[18-Sep-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> it cant be, at least not the submitted data

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> but sending the mined coins?

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the rewards

[18-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> mined coins to taddr is normal

[18-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i guess we could unlock the CC coins and send to a zaddr along with an opreturn for the submitted data

[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> the market for that data is growing every minute. You could be really selfish and make atomic dex THE market where access to said data is available via the attack coin, and virtually insure that govt will not be stepping on the mobile dex's toes.

[18-Sep-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> this ecosystem just grew some really sharp teeth. I love it.

[18-Sep-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @dukeleto maybe addresses should be always seed based and 1-time used if wallet allows? so that having some amount would allow always to send from different addr ? if wallet would make such functionality default would be nice

[18-Sep-19 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <actionslacks> the coins are like shark teeth. constantly regenerating to take the next bytes of data.

[18-Sep-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > ITM is the one that should name this

[18-Sep-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> I really hope this becomes a new coin

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let's get back to.  We need more exchanges, hodl and when moon

[19-Sep-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> That I can understand

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: always cool stuff happening

[19-Sep-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This was well-written by CG in Pirate discord, and I am pasting it here:

[19-Sep-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ```

Just a reminder: If you want your privacy to stay private then never give out your address or transaction ID (txid) publicly.
While PIRATE provides you privacy, that privacy is lost when you intentionally give away your information.
Known information is traceable.
It has been proven that the comings and goings of know addresses and txids can be traced to other known points when they are spent.
While the amounts, etc. are still private, this can lead to someone tracking your "spending frequency", "income frequency", and links to other known addresses (that you may not even be aware of).
The specifics of the proofs will be coming soon (or you can read the discussion in the HUSH discord).

Again: If you want your privacy to stay private then never give out your address or transaction ID (txid) publicly.
```

[19-Sep-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> TLDR: Do not share zaddrs or txids involving your zaddrs publicly, on social media/etc

[19-Sep-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> now people worried if they should never trade otc cause they give the other partu an z-addr üòÇ

[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> still buzzing off the idea

[19-Sep-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> which idea? ITM Coin? üòÖ

[19-Sep-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> yup

[19-Sep-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> Proof-of-Deanon (today the network miners deanon'd 1000 transactions on a different chain... LOL!)

[19-Sep-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> i like that idea too. @ITM  do it üòé  After your POC is done, ITM (or whatever name you want) Coin is coming üòÇ

[19-Sep-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> it will only publish a "proof deanon" label i guess...or will it publish all data that were deanon? ü§î

[19-Sep-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> this data sets will have a high value to very evil person on this planet...maybe not the best idea to publish deanon data üòÖ

[19-Sep-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã you should have a "public" address that you use for all interactions with others. maybe one for each and then do z -> z for your main funds

[19-Sep-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> in a way you are semi-relying on whoever you transact with to not divulge data about your transactions they are involved in

[19-Sep-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Milo> @Berg sent you a DM üôÇ

[19-Sep-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @jl777c yes, HushList has the concept of "public introducer zaddr", where you generate one new public zaddr just for introducing yourself to somebody else. The idea is that zaddr should never be used for anything else ever again, and GUI wallets need to be smarter to do that

[19-Sep-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a better middle ground is 1 public introducer per wallet, that is easier to manage

[19-Sep-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> > in a way you are semi-relying on whoever you transact with to not divulge data about your transactions they are involved in

[19-Sep-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Yes

[19-Sep-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I divulge a txid and my zaddr and say "This is my xtn with gigamesh"

[19-Sep-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> trustless no more

[19-Sep-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> That reduces the privacy of gigamesh

[19-Sep-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> So it really is like "herd immunity" of biology

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> cant even publish a tipping address üò¨

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> haha

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The more everybody has better privacy opsec, the better everyones privacy becomes

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you can publish an address, just make sure to only use it to receive

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for instance, if Z1 is your public tip address

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> DO NOT SEND FROM THAT ADDRESS

[19-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Accept donations to Z1

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then make a new zaddr no one has ever seen, send from Z1 => Z2

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> then send FROM Z2 to where-ever

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> got it

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that breaks the ITM attack a bit, makes it harder

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We need to document this stuff better

[19-Sep-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's  not intuitive to users

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh i am willing to put some modest bounty money towards you explaining this stuff in an article for both ARRR+HUSH users. It's all the same info

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> maybe Pirates can throw in some funds too

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> still tho, that is an operation that a wallet should do to prevent noobs deanoning themselves

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gigamesh you are right. It turns out, we will need to do some work to make wallet.dat's and GUI wallets smarter

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> @dukeleto that is an interesting offer üëç

[19-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In the short term, teaching users better opsec at least gives them the option to have some privacy

[19-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We won't be able to push out consensus changes to ARRR+HUSH until the next mandatory update

[19-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> All of history before that, will be studied via the @ITM method

[19-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> We can do nothing about that.

[19-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> ironically , it becomes more difficult to teach this

[19-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gigamesh> the analysis is so deep, there is almost no escape
