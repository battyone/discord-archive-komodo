[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the checklist of stuff that needs to happen

[30-Nov-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we also need a YouTube video showing off SDA

[30-Nov-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am willing to pay a bounty for that

[30-Nov-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> YT vid doesn't block us, but i think it's really nice if we have it. many more people will install the app and/or know what the heck it does

[30-Nov-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @BigLez  These screenshots will get our app listed. I hate to put you on the spot. But can you help us out with a few more?

[30-Nov-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Do you want the video with sound or typed text also good?

[30-Nov-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> no idea

[30-Nov-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> go look at what other apps use for their YT vids, i guess. no idea what is "normal"

[30-Nov-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i have never looked at a YT vid for an app before, but i assume it's common

[30-Nov-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Do we have a manual included in SD?

[30-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> or a note with information

[30-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I also have never looked on YT for apps, but I can write a how-to-use SD(L) document. Maybe nice to have it as a tab on the webpage?

[30-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Also a good post for BitcoinTalk and Reddit

[30-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> You got this

[30-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Just look around and see what others do, come back here with an idea and run it by someone that is here. I'm sure you'll come up with something good

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Captain I'll try to put together a small guide for submitting errors, to github.
It's not difficult. And it helps these guys out a ton.

[30-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> They put a lot of time into the code

[30-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is some 1984 stuff right there, but i know why they do it

[30-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so much malware in app stores

[30-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> yeah it's crazym don't know how they get allowed.. Got to admit Apple is way better in filtering malware

[30-Nov-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> I mean how the apps get approved with malware

[30-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is because apple charges more

[30-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and makes you wait longer to submit an app

[30-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because humans look at it

[30-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Captain> Ow GP isn't, I thought everything was checked lol

[30-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @Captain We just need regular screenshots. We will format them to the appropriate size. But they need to be specific.

[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> Do you have it downloaded?

[30-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @BigLez 
```If u have it download, extract it.
Then right click in the folder it was extracted in, right click, open terminal, grab the SilentDragonLite app and put it in the terminal and press enter```

[30-Nov-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> It should extract with only one file

[30-Nov-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> I will keep this in mind

[30-Nov-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> as for the bot tips, how doe that work? is my discord linked to my wallet or something/does it generate one for me?

[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> Ill test it on my mojave install

[30-Nov-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> Mavericks flies, but forget macOS

[30-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Should support 10.9 @BigLez

[30-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> also I forgot how much I hate newer releases of macOS

[30-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> it doesn't. I didn't try plist editing it either

[30-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> What does it say when you open the binary?

[30-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> damaged and can't be open, my gatekeeper is still enabled

[30-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> also it shows the cross in 10.9 meaning it doesn't support it out of box

[30-Nov-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <BigLez> not a big deal, every core 2 user is running 10.11 by now. Im one of the few

[30-Nov-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
