Protocols. are. war. 

Geoff Huston's post on @paulvixie's DNS Wars keynote at NANOG 77 is a great overview of how we got from "we  need a protocol for names, sharing a single hosts file doesn't scale"  to "redefining the boundaries of the nation-state" in ~40 years.

[dscrd-hush] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Ok I hope I don‚Äôt get flamed for this, but....  what‚Äôs the short answer of the difference between Hush and Pirate?
What I see is: Pirate- all z-addr txs, sapling and sprout in chain, dPow. Hush- pruned chain so sapling only, z-addr optional, messaging, dPow.

[05-Nov-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> And of course a lot of crossover devs.

[06-Nov-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> yes thats the Main difference. Let us not forget HushList, and the we are allready living in the future with our SilentDragonLite fully support of zaddr,memos, encryption and more https://github.com/MyHush/SilentDragonLite/releases

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it's a pre-release, mostly wanted some local discord peeps to test it. If I wanted to blast it to twitter, I could have done that üôÇ

[06-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> this information isn't needed?

[06-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mixic when i post things in discord, and not on twitter, there is a reason for that

[06-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I was asking for local testing. It's not on Google Play yet

[06-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it might not even work at all

[06-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Mixic> I deleted it. It doesn't mean you don't have to. No problem.

[06-Nov-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Mixic it's just that i don't know if it works properly yet, needs testing, so I don't want to get bug reports from 9999999 users that don't understand why it's not on Google Play

[06-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Really? Mine never snapped the QR

[06-Nov-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I had to use the manual option to connect

[06-Nov-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> hmm. i was thinking it might require some permissions to use the camera, but if you're seeing the image through it then i don't think it's that

[06-Nov-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah I allowed it to use the camera, then sat there playing with my brightness and trying to be super still for like 20 minutes

[06-Nov-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Qr scanner works for me also @Berg

[06-Nov-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> AtomicDEX worked for me, but not the connection scanner for SDA

[06-Nov-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> are you guys talking SDA connection  scanning?

[06-Nov-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Or transactions?

[dscrd-hush] <denio> True

[06-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> Which version of SD are you using?

[06-Nov-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg is the QR code reader not working on the HushDroid?
