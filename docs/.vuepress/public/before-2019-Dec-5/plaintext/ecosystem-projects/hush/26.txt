[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Berg I know you are always actively working, thanks) But Cryptopia spoiled the impression, Digitalprice began to look better

[29-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Don't thank me, thank Duke üòÉ He's the one pulling the weight that a whole team of devs should be.
I just try to keep communication between the team and users consistent and grow our reach üòÉ

[29-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Duke can replace the whole team, but even he needs help)

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Looking forward to mining btch

[30-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <kh4567> Is it cheaper , cost of electricity factored in  etc.. to mine btch and hush or cheaper to buy  direct from mkt.. is there a breakeven point in terms of cost üòÄ

[30-Nov-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> its the same

[30-Nov-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> @kh4567 , I tried mining it earlier this year when Hush was around $2.00 or more. These days I've been just keeping the money I'd spend on electricity costs and buying Hush while it's cheap.

[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> ASIC mineable?

[01-Dec-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @c0prhd Yes, Hush is ASIC mineable with Equihash miners like the z9 mini

[01-Dec-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <c0prhd> Sorry, should have been more specific, will BTCH be mineable with the Z9 mini?

[01-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Ah, BTCH will be using the Verus hash algorithm, so no. But it can be mined with CPUs as well as GPUs, the last i heard CPUs were much better at it.

[01-Dec-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> it kind of cool in my opinion üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How did you find hush by the way?

[03-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iamhydrogen> @AkiraX I've followed it for a while but never owned.  Originally a friend told me about it.

[03-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Welcome üòÉ , For me Hush is visible in agama app without changing any settings by pressing the "Activate coin" button and going through there.

[03-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iamhydrogen> @heguli97  or @AkiraX  good to be here thanks for your hospitality.  Do either of you know if the roadmap is still valid?  Is HushNG still a work in progress?  Will it be something we expect to see in 2019?

[03-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Hush-NG is definitely still a thing and coming in the future, i'm pretty confident it'll come out next year. AFAIK It's just been on the backburner a little while, while dPoW got implemented to protect the network from double spend attacks and hush 2.0.0 was released. And now the huge upgrades coming to BTCH(hush's sister coin) this month.

[03-Dec-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> Why are you confident it will be out next year? No indication, afaik, that is happening.

[03-Dec-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I mean, it's a whole years time to find bugs, make improvements etc. and to get some kind of a test version only requires packaging the software, let me refer you to this tweet: https://twitter.com/MyHushTeam/status/1065704218667950080

[03-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Currently mining Verus and looking forward to mining btch

[03-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> I heard they got 30terahash mining Verus

[03-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> How is that in comparison with other coins

[03-Dec-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> based on my calc that's around 45 000 high end gpus mining

[03-Dec-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Let‚Äôs hope btch gets some of that

[03-Dec-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> As long as it's profitable, which it will be at the beginning anyways, i will be pointing my own rigs at it.

[03-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Eddy O> @heguli97 ok. Well, hopefully we get an update on when a useable version for normal people is going to be available. A lot of good could come from it.

[03-Dec-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @heguli97 just FYI, modern CPUs are better to mine VerusHash/BTCH than GPUs. Using GPUs you already own is fine, but buying new GPUs to mine VerusHash just doesn't make much sense, unless you have zero power costs

[03-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you are thinking "oh, maybe I should buy some of these GPUs that everybody is trying to sell, to mine BTCH", don't. buy a good CPU

[03-Dec-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Vertcoin lacks DPoW, they had a *MASSIVE* double spend/re-org attack last night. For example, the largest Hush re-org ever was 45 blocks

[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Fgpa on verushash.  Will btch get the hard fork as well?

[04-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Fgpa cheaters very similar to the new ASIC miners arising on the algorithm from nowhere. I was also surprised how people with such complexity do not leave Verus mining.

[04-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal what makes FPGAs "cheaters"? It's a more efficient device to mine

[04-Dec-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto Yes, more effective, but concentrated in much narrower circles. As I know, mining for truly decentralized projects is intended for a wide range of people, because many do not have the money for large farms or the purchase of FPGAs. For them, there is a POS where each holder of a small amount of coins can be rewarded,
the same situation with the GPU, which provides for the creation of a community of a wide range of people, even for those who can afford to buy no more than one farm. If the project wants ASIC or FPGA there are no problems, their right and opinion is that they are more efficient means of mining,
but let them not be surprised by the circle of large holders and the sharp drops in the price of a coin, because the ASIC miner's task is to discourage the investment until his ASIC as L +, D3 has turned into a useless piece of iron. But if they are counting on attracting a wide mass of people, they should be POS and not Masternodes, there should be a GPU and not FPGA or ASIC.
It's my opinion

[04-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> VTC is "ASIC resistant" but due to this became less secure and 51% attacked

[04-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> having hundreds of thousands double spent, about 1% of marketcap

[04-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ultimately coin security needs to be the first priority, with all else done as long as it doesnt hurt the coin security

[04-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> 51% resistance has to take into account nicehash and the immense hashrate that can be centralized around a single renter

[04-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> pretending any algo can remain GPU only for any length of time is naive

[04-Dec-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> and believing if it is GPU only it cant be 51% attacked, even more so

[04-Dec-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Yes, but what about the recent crack of Bitcoin Private on which Asics? Asic is not a remedy for protection against 51% attack, but a problem for a developer who does not provide security.

[04-Dec-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> And the VTC is no longer ASIC Resistance, the Chinese created the ASIC for Lyra2rev more than 1-2 months ago, the VTC will have a hard fork to change the algorithm. It is the emergence of ASIC contributed to the hacking VTC

[04-Dec-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> By the way, Wikipedia reminds us that Equihash was created as an ASIC resistance algorithm.

[04-Dec-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal i didn't hear about ` recent crack of Bitcoin Private`, do you have a link?

[04-Dec-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Do you remember the man who wanted to hack EMC2 and changed his mind? He decided to hack BTCP live, I saw him do it live with Nicehash

[04-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> There is an example with Bitcoin Gold, if you remember, they were attacked by 51%, later Bitttrex announced the delisting of the coin. It was the moment when Bitcoin gold was on Equihash algorithm and ASICs worked, they changed the algorithm to Zhash, until I heard about the new attack

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> if you have money and Nicehash you don't care  -  GPU, ASIC, or FPGA

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal ok, i wasn't sure what you meant. Yes, I was watching that live, helping EMC2 with their DPoW protection üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> didn't know if another happened

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> he could have done a large re-org on BTCP, but didn't

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> has BTCP done anything since then, changed anything?

[04-Dec-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Dpow is the best decision)

[04-Dec-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> sure, but most people don't agree üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I talked with VTC devs for a while yesterday, they definitely don't agree

[04-Dec-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but also they were sour about a $100,000 double spend and the largest re-org anybody has ever heard of, on an established coin

[04-Dec-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all they could say was DPoW technically seemed sound, but they are morally against "KMD masternodes"

[04-Dec-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Why? What do they want to do? I read that Zencash found some solution to their problem 51%

[04-Dec-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and vehemently against the "holy 64" notary nodes, it's "centralized" blah blah blah

[04-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> This is a sect))

[04-Dec-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> some communities don't like it, it's not perfectly distributed. I get that. Also, leaving the coin open to 51% attacks is not viable, it can make the coin worthless. Entire marketcap is at risk.

[04-Dec-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so VTC is in crisis, coming up with some kind of hack like PINK/RVN/ZEN, that hopefully works

[04-Dec-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> How I started this topic. I just wanted to say that there are less efficient mining tools than ASIC or FPGA, but much more attracted to the general mass of new people.

[04-Dec-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Imagine you chose a coin, you like its idea, it promotes what is extracted on the ASIC resistance algorithm, and after a while ASIC appears and the developers tell you I'm sorry brother, the time has changed there are more efficient mining tools, we will not change the algorithm and discard the original ideas.
Or maybe I'm wrong and Equihash was not conceived for this?

[04-Dec-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Then a reasonable question will arise. Why did you guys not initially choose the Scrypt or SHA-256 algorithm and fool people?)

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Takoy_Nahal fighting these FPGAs is very different than ASICs

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> coin developers can brick an ASIC, make it basically worthless. You can't do that to an FPGA

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> you can "make the fpga not work on that coin until somebody changes the code"

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if a coin forks to protect itself, the next version of code, it will be sold privately, not given out publicly

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is the situation VRSC is in now, and it's very relevant to what BTCH will do

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> any coin that uses current verushash algo will be an FPGA coin

[04-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Is Verus going to defend against FPGA or won't it change anything?

[04-Dec-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Verus doesn't have a lot of good options

[04-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if it were an ASIC, they could brick it via code change (which would be controversial but still a protection)

[04-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> with FPGAs, a new bit of code can be written, to deal with "VerusHash V2". It's a "cat and mouse" game, both sides have about even abilities. Neither side can stop the other from playing

[04-Dec-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> FPGAs are not new, I heard about them in 2011 when I first started BTC mining. The best BTC miners were using custom FPGAs in 2010/2011
