[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> You can think of the memo field as the zaddr equivalent of OP_RETURN data. Memo fields are encrypted and only can be seen by recipient. OP_RETURN data is public for all to see

It can be tough making enough money as a crypto writer, and keeping a high standard of review. My reviews take days to make.

I am delighted to say I now have a patron for the next 3 months who provides a comfort zone üñãÔ∏è

[02-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Roki> You have to blow 0, for the ignition to turn on

[02-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763

The #ZcashDevfund is a corrupt bailout for a financially inept Zcash Company (ECC), whose greatest product-market fit is losing money.

[02-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Any normal investor, such as Warren Buffet, would throw you out of the room for even calling that a business

[02-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Zcash Company is like a monopoly given ownership of a large forest by the government. It just sells all the trees, until there are no more trees. And then goes out of business. That is a great analogy of the Zcash Company business model

How in the world can the #ZashDevFund help Zcash scale to 10 Billion people when it can't deal with one single person running a Sapling Woodchipper?
 ~$4/day to make the $ZEC network completely unusable.
