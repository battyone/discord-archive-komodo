@evankaloudis I've never personally marketed grin as a privacy coin. It certainly will be someday soon, but I always make it a point to shutdown outlandish privacy claims. Currently it just has private amounts. Unlinkability improvements are definitely in progress though.

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> gosh

[18-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the important question is if the GRIN marketing peoples marketed GRIN as a privacy coin

[18-Nov-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> GRIN ends up in the privacy spectrum, just above DASH

[18-Nov-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> the better than nothing and personal level privacy, ie. neighbors and spouses likely wont be able to deanon the grin

[18-Nov-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but it is clear GRIN has been marketed as a privacy coin from day 1. definitely a disingenuous situation

So $GRIN devs don't think it's a privacy coin, but then why is it listed next to and categorized as a privacy coin everywhere?

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "we fucked up"

[18-Nov-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> anyway, Hush has lots less competition now. The entire GRIN/BEAM/MW was just decimated. We knew it theoretically, but now all the marketing people have shiny graphics to look at

[18-Nov-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> zero knowledge proofs are still the best math to base privacy systems upon, imho

[18-Nov-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and that is why Hush + Pirate are based on zaddrs. Nothing else out there seems to be better tech to build on

[dscrd-hush] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> there are diff context of privacy in crypto 1. using privacy as hype excuse - that can work for any project - just marketing using labels and words to sell  the product which maybe privacy related, but not really private 2. real privacy focused products - those initially understood by few (e.g. freedom fighters, journalists in authoritarian countries ...) , however the few may include venture funds and rich people, who may like to hide their investments and amounts, and this group imo will be a game changer for private crypto
