[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> What happened to the lottery

[30-Aug-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> Was there a winner announced

[30-Aug-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> @CryptoJesus looks like winner will be drawn today #lottery

[dscrd-hush] <KamikatzeLP> Silentdragon was working yesterday, but now the program says it would start all the time. Maybe someone has an idea what it could be?

[30-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KamikatzeLP> *sry, hushd is starting up, not silentdragon

[30-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> no matter, needed a bit more time to start this time 😅

[30-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mornin'

[30-Aug-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> somebody must love me, they are trying to mailbomb me with malware like its' the early 90's 😅

[30-Aug-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DunkinG you are not crazy, you are running into a bug

[30-Aug-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DunkinG how did you close SilentDragon and which OS are you on?

[30-Aug-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> I just exited it yesterday and closed hushd, I'm on win 10

[30-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> it just took longer than yesterday to startup, but its all ok

[30-Aug-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> *i just closed silentdragon over the "file" tab and then clicked "exit", and then closed the hushd cmd

[30-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DunkinG ahh, i think i see

[30-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this is a windows bugs, doesn't seem to happen on other systems

[30-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and clicking "exit" on the hushd cmd corrupts things, and then it has to redo everything when it restarts again. It's not your fault

[30-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i think you should see a `hush-cli` file in the same dir

[30-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Yes, i See it

[30-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if possible running `./hush-cli stop` should "cleanly" exit on Windows. This either already is fixed in git, or needs to be fixed, not sure. /cc @FireMartZ

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "control C" i.e. "hey program stop right now" is not doing the right thing on Windows

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and corrupts files and that is why hushd takes so long to restart

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> But I cant type anything in the cmd

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, open a new window

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Oh ok

[30-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> a new command window, `cd` to same dir

[30-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `./hush-cli stop` should tell you a message it's stopping the server

[30-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hmmm, we could have a GUI button for this

[30-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @DunkinG 25 hush

[30-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> 💸 @dukeleto sent @DunkinG **25.00 HUSH** (≈ $0.98).

[30-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> reporting bugs is good!

[30-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I knew about this bug, but seeing so many people hit it makes me realize it's importance

[30-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Ok, thank you 😅

[30-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I don't use windoze, so it's not something I can really fix. I rely on bug reports and patches from devs that use windows

[30-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @iceyballz also reported this error, we need new windows binaries out...

[30-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Always need new binaries 😅

[30-Aug-19 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Or you could implement an exit option in the bat file, so its waiting for an input like "exit" or something?? Just an idea 😅

[30-Aug-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DunkinG patches welcome! I don't have windows, so I can't write or test .bat files 🙂

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> there might be a hush-cli.bat or maybe needs to be one

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I guess the `hush-cli` file won't run on windoze. This is why I avoid windoze 🙂

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Ok, i will try

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i really need a Windoze whisperer

[30-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bounties are available, bla bla bla

[30-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <denio> You will have a few 😉 All my students use windows...i guess 🤔🙄

[30-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not even sure it happens on all windows

[30-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> might only be some versions of windows, so if we can figure that out, that would be good

[30-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> making binaries is so much work, y'all

[30-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and if you can imagine, code is constantly pouring in. It's hard to pick a point and say "yes, do a huge amount of work and ignore everything after this commit". But it's necessary!

[30-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <iceyballz> It’s an issue with stale or pre existing config files

[30-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> I cant close it cleanly because i cant execute a bash file in cmd, or am i wrong??

[30-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @DunkinG needs to be a .bat

[30-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i feel like we had a hush-cli.bat somewhere

[30-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but it's not in git, maybe only in one of the binary releases

[30-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <DunkinG> Oh, ok, thats what you mean

[30-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yeah, we need a hush-cli.bat

[30-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it existed somewhere

[30-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our next release will fix many of these bugs!!!

[30-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> And hopefully introduce fewer, less noticeable bugs

[30-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Fun fact, the son of the producer for the Princess Bride currently rents from me :shush:

[30-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Merged PR to Bitcoin!!! Congrats @dukeleto  that’s so cool

[30-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Someone just bought nearly 30K HUSH on Graviex 😮

[30-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg lolwut

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !ticker hush

[30-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> True facts

[30-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, that sure is nice

[30-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @eclipse see, our price is up 70% in 24hr, it's a bit volatile here 😉

[30-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> "what is the price of hush" is an idea in the mind of the beholder

[30-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mostly the price we see on charts is "the price miners who have way too much hush, are willing to sell at"

[30-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is our lower bound

[30-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> When people realize the *utility* of Hush, what you can use it for! Then we might see some price action.

[30-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> We're still down 99.8% from ATH 😅

[30-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> No doubt that miners will sell our current price into oblivion, because I am sure this puts us as #1 on whattomine

[30-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yep

[30-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Hush is 50% more profitable than NiceHash right now

[30-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> lulz

[30-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> bring me your poor miners, your high hashrates, your ragged, your elderly miners

[30-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> come to Hush

[30-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we sky rocketed from ~1300 to ~700 by marketcap in a few hours, that is some funny stuff

[30-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i wonder what our lowest ranking in the marketcap index was, has Hush ever broken the top 500 ?

[30-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I would imagine so

[30-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> $41M ain't no joke

[30-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I am not interested to be a Top 10 or 20 coin, but I think Hush has better tech than most, and deserves to be a top 50 coin, along with Pirate and KMD. So that is my job, I guess

[30-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> where would $41M mcap put us now?

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> morning

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> wow

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg that puts us at #92 with BEAM right now, lulz

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we had the same mcap as back then

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> 93rd currently

[30-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yup

[30-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is interesting, the Hush marketcap broke into the Top 100 for a few days!

[30-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I didn't even know that. And we don't know that stats for back then, but there were way fewer coins back then, so it's safe to assume that we were in the top 100 back then

[30-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> those were fast times

[30-Aug-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> We can grow the community if we can get some cpu miners interested in btch

[30-Aug-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And if there was some way integrate functionality of btch and hush in some wau
