[29-Oct-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> I had told him about OpenVPN last night. And he got locked out of one of his routers. I told him to look up the default passwords or reset it, and reconnect to the network.

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> What operating system are you running?  @AkiraX

[29-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You need to find your Default Gateway. 
Itll be something like 192.168.1.0

[29-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You use that in the address bar, in your browser and click enter.

[29-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> And your Router Interface will appear.

[29-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> You must re-enter any previous connections that you had, and set a new password.

[dscrd-hush] <Crypto99> They're big Privacy Advocates. They run Tor Nodes & offer a free VPN. They also sell annual wireless hotspot data subscriptions,  at a discount. They used to own and operate something like a small portion, of a wireless provider. And they fought in the courts, to keep it, 6 years after the owner was gagged by the FBI.

@coincodecap @MyHushTeam the changelog and link is incorrect. You took an old link to the v3.2.1.-alpha tag and called it v3.2.1, which is very different. There was also a v3.2.1-beta tag. Both are marked "Pre-release" on Github, which you should ignore
