[dscrdpioneers] <Audo> Sometimes I don't understand Twitter. Turns out that's not a tweet but "reply" and thus not visible on the main twitter page (https://twitter.com/KomodoPioneers)

[11-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <Audo> I guess that is because the tweet starts with @redfoxlabs_io ü§î

Thanks for all the voters once again.

Soon we will be running two notary nodes and it seems like the bull market is starting. If it is then we will have some funding in place to do something. If someone got ideas feel free to message us here or in PM.

[18-Jul-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <Audo> not sure, I think it would be second priority versus other meetups that are specifically about rebrand. Better to make the rebrand meetup first at least :)
