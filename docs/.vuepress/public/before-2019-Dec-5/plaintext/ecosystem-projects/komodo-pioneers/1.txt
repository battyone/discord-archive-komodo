[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> have a look at html5 games on github.  plenty there.  html5 games are easy to work with - html5 game engines: https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines  phaser is good.

you use any of those game engines in a google search and " tutorial" or " sample" and there'll be plenty of stuff that has been started that can be modded no probs.

then if you want to go a bit more hardcore, there's unity3d.com and unreal engine.

[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> so pick your genre, top down shooter, 1st person, 3rd person, platformer, infinite runner etc.  there's also a marketplace on unity3d for out-of-the-box simple games.  depending what the goal is - have a look at the unity assetstore https://assetstore.unity.com/categories/templates

[15-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> ```prices for the service start at ‚Ç¨9,900 and will include everything from basic introductory lessons on blockchain technology to assessments of the proposed use case and the building of a prototype by day five.

From there, clients can choose to fork out more cash to have the product further developed or walk away with the work as it stands.```

@Audo, just got referred to you from #support. Could you give any pointers/tips if I wanted to run komodo-cli/barterdex-cli from a Raspberry Pi?

[25-Jul-18 06:14 PM] jorian#4555
you should ask @barv for that. i think he tried exactly the same

[25-Jul-18 06:49 PM] barv#0867
You should restart every 4 hours or so

[25-Jul-18 07:03 PM] JvdP#8992
Thanks for the swift response! So from the look of it, it should run exactly as advertised on Raspbian. With the exception that I should probably set a cronjob or something to restart it every 4 hours. That sounds like a fun afternoon to me. Let's dig up a proper micro-SD card and give this a whirl.

[25-Jul-18 07:05 PM] JvdP#8992
Btw, @barv, this blockbar thing... 070 is The Hague, right? Is it still alive?

that's a monthly merge with Blockbar

[25-Jul-18 07:11 PM] JvdP#8992
If I wanted a GUI, I'd probably go with a Ubuntu VM or sth indeed. Raspberries are great for non-GUI stuff if you ask me. The thing I worried a bit about is the ARM architecture. But I guess I'm just gonna give it a spin.

how does somebody earn crypto when they are a liquidit provider? is it fees?

[02-Aug-18 04:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
With Spread - difference between bid and ask. 
Additionaly you jist trade with a higher margin on your bob and instantly copy/ liquidate on a cex the delta is your profit.

[dscrdpioneers] <Audo> It's an association of Komodo community members. We run one notary node and use part of its revenue to host meetups/events.

Yep. Actually BarterDEX but kind of the same procedure. If you run a full node, be sure to attach a harddrive though. bacause of the many read/writes

As far as I know BarterDEX does not require setting up Komodo. We want to set up Komodo with Marmara Stakebox project. @radix42 was very helpful. She gave the right hardware to setup. Before buying the hardware suggested by @radix42,  our team decided to give a last chance to docker.
