@jl777c Are these trading pairs live, or has the exchange not officially launched?

[26-Jul-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
its live, just need traders

[26-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Berg#2666
Awesome

[26-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Berg#2666
I also just applied to a few tracking apps to have BTCH listed

[26-Jul-18 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
awesome üëç

[26-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Berg#2666
I've applied once more to have BTCH added to the SonoX listing contest https://goo.gl/forms/LdaXcTvUydkmU8qE2

Can we link this with the hush discord btch channel? Its a pain checking the Komodo group and the hush group. The hush btch channel seems busier. What do you guys say?

[01-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Berg#2666
I've attempted to get bot access to have the channels linked, haven't been followed up with

[01-Aug-18 07:35 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@noashh or @Audo should be able to help I think

[01-Aug-18 07:38 PM] Berg#2666
Sorry for the misunderstanding, this is on our end, not KMD's üòÉ

[01-Aug-18 07:38 PM] Berg#2666
noashh has already reached out to me, but unfortunately I can't get him information he needs until given permissions.

[01-Aug-18 08:28 PM] nobby#8396
Ok so we have 2 channels and it‚Äôs staying that way? Just so I know.

[01-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Berg#2666
Until sorted out, yes

[10-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Francis#7833
Where can we store btch now? Still just agama?

[10-Aug-18 08:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
Agama, Paperwallet

[10-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Francis#7833
The btch agama servers never connect for me

[10-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Francis#7833
0.2.41 beta

[10-Aug-18 08:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
I just did a trx on agama 0.2.41 beta with BTCH and it worked fine

[10-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Berg#2666
Yeah I just synced mine up fine ü§∑ üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
noone wants to buy a few btch against btc or kmd ? at the price of the market, of course (a bit lower is possible ;-))

This goes for anyone really, if you're selling BTCH I'll take it.

[10-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Francis#7833
The servers don't even connect for me

[10-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Francis#7833
Been this way for ages

[10-Aug-18 04:53 PM] SHossain#0007
use this ip `37.9.62.186` as seednode to connect

I am interested to hear from the community about what they think of this: BTCH does a hard-fork to a larger supply (to be determined) so that it can enable mining as well as cryptoconditions, and whatever else good stuff is available now in asset chains

[10-Aug-18 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
So, one theoretical scenario is BTCH forks to double it's supply (Satoshi's double vision) to 42M coins, and we make all the remaining 21M mineable via equihash. At the same time, we enable cryptoconditions so that BTCH can do all this cool smart contract stuff that James has been working on

[10-Aug-18 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
Doubling our supply does "dilute" current HODLers position, but if making BTCH minable + CC can more than double the price, it seems worth it. And since our price is so low right now, I could easily see this BTCH revival doing much more than a 2X.

[10-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
if BTCH had mining pools and all the culture/community that comes with mining, it probably would give us way better liquidity

[10-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
because miners will always want to sell, and traders will always want to speculate

[10-Aug-18 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am sure some people will not like the above ideas, but I think doing nothing is worse. It would be cool to mine BTCH on a z9

[10-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Berg#2666
BTCH needs a revival, and I am 100% on board for this first step being taken. We'll have to peddle it around the community for further ideas, but this seems like the best way to get the ball rolling.

[10-Aug-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I will support anything the community will want to do

[10-Aug-18 06:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think a mineable BTCH is a great idea

[10-Aug-18 06:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that the downside risk is very small, and the upside is potentially very large

[10-Aug-18 06:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it seems we need to decide on specifics, like a new supply, and what the schedule for halving/etc will be

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
the cryptoconditions part is easy, we just use `ac_cc=1` when creating the chain.

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
make it ac_cc=2

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think the biggest decision is how to change our supply

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, i wasn't sure what that did actually

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
then it can be an oracle for cross chain usage

[10-Aug-18 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds great

[10-Aug-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ie. if BTCH store BTC Headers (see what i did) all the other chains can use that to verify BTC transactions

[10-Aug-18 06:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
awesome

[10-Aug-18 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Doubling our supply and making all the new supply mineable seems to be one of the simpler possibilities, i am not sure about how the mining schedule should work tho

[10-Aug-18 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTCH was before AC's had mining and i haven't looked at all the mining options currently available when creating an AC

[10-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Francis#7833
Nice just bought loads more btch today aswell

[10-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Francis#7833
But not fussed really

[10-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Francis#7833
Needs marketing an exchanges too

[10-Aug-18 08:45 PM] Berg#2666
I've been handed off the BTCH Twitter handle and plan on developing a marketing strategy to re-educate the public about Komodo upgrade inheritance and whatnot.

[10-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Berg#2666
Paired with the potential/planned developments I believe we'll gain some traction, but I agree that for the coin to gain traction it needs a half decent exchange to fall back on.

[10-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Francis#7833
I think btch has alot of potential

[10-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Berg#2666
A lottttt

[10-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Francis#7833
Kmd needs marketing too let alone btch

[10-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Francis#7833
Heavy that I bought 50k btch today tho üòÇ

[10-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Berg#2666
Want to sell me some?

[10-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Francis#7833
No lol

[10-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Berg#2666
How'd you even amass that much?

[10-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Francis#7833
Someone put a sell order of 50k on at $0.04

[10-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Francis#7833
So I bought it

You want to 2x some of that BTCH investment? üòè

Any time I try to buy BTCH I get stone walled.

[10-Aug-18 08:50 PM] Francis#7833
I'm buying more

[10-Aug-18 08:51 PM] Berg#2666
You can always buy more with the $1,000 I give you....

[10-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
I propose an initial supply of 2.1M, total supply stays 21M

[10-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
take a decimal place off of everyone's balance

[11-Aug-18 01:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright we can play all kinds of games like that, but makes the process more complex/edge cases/etc. With those numbers, you are allowing 90% to be mined, that is current HODLers being diluted to 10% of what they had

[11-Aug-18 01:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
and what about addresses with 1-9 satoshis?

[11-Aug-18 01:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are a hell of a lot of them, lol

[11-Aug-18 01:13 AM] Alright#0419
you won't attract many new miners if their mining efforts are dwarfed by the premine

[11-Aug-18 01:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is good feedback, i think we want to find a happy middle ground between people who currently hold BTCH and future miners

[11-Aug-18 01:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright if it's profitable as hell for them to mine BTCH on their z9's, does that really matter?

[11-Aug-18 01:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
a lot of BTCH is locked up in addresses from lost/deleted/gone BTC, there is actually a lot of BTCH that will never be used because of that

[11-Aug-18 01:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
there isn't some big pre-mine, there is none actually

[11-Aug-18 01:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
the currently supply of BTCH is, in theory, 21M, but taking into account all lost BTC, it is more like 15M most likely

[11-Aug-18 01:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
"accessible supply" or whatever

[11-Aug-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
if the purpose is to attract miners, I think you should make the current supply much less than the overall supply

[11-Aug-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
50% is a lot, just saying

[11-Aug-18 01:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
I wonder what current HODLers think of that

[11-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
You've heard from at least 1 üòõ

[11-Aug-18 01:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
if some BTCH HODLer knows they own 1% of BTCH supply and then we do this 90/10 as you suggest, they now own 0.1% of BTCH supply
