investors call that dilution and usually it scares them

[11-Aug-18 01:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you are purely a future miner, then that doesn't worry you

[11-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
I'm thinking as it as a miner

[11-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
"Will i actually want to mine this?"

[11-Aug-18 01:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, BTCH will easily fit into any znomp mining pool, there won't be technical issues to add it, like Verus

[11-Aug-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
yea, it's straight forward

[11-Aug-18 01:20 AM] Alright#0419
works like any other coin

[11-Aug-18 01:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think miners would always like more options

[11-Aug-18 01:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
and BTCH will be another option for z9's, and they can switch their miners to it if they want to specmine or when the price/difficulty is attractive to them

[11-Aug-18 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
make it POS? kind of appeases HODLers

[11-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
Another reason to make it POS is that it will likely detract from HUSH and KMD's hash rate

[11-Aug-18 01:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am not against it, it just sounds like a lot of work üòÉ

[11-Aug-18 01:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
and every new zcash fork that comes out, in theory, detracts from Hush/KMD hashrate. But we have asics flooding the market, so hashrates are increasing anyway

[11-Aug-18 01:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
mining BTCH will open a lot of doors, but long-term, what could bring a lot of inherent value to BTCH, is cryptoconditions

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
if BTCH can do CC/smart contract stuff and talk to other KMD asset chains, well that is really freaking cool. That is unique to BTCH, Hush can't do that stuff (but maybe one day)

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
the idea from jl is fucking cool

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
if I understand it correctly at least

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
which one? -ac_cc=2 ?

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
essentially taking momom of BTC and storing it on BTCH

[11-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
so other assetchains can check BTCH to see if a transaction happened on BTC

[11-Aug-18 01:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh that sounds nice

[11-Aug-18 01:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
i saw him say something like that but I didn't fully grasp it

[11-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
Yea me either üòÇ

[11-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
that's how I took it though

[11-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
ü§∑

[11-Aug-18 01:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
i really like it, it sounds like it gives BTCH a reason to live, a unique purpose that sets it aside. And it's a resource to other AC's, and we keep getting more

[11-Aug-18 01:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we changed supply to 147M, then current supply would be 1/7th of total, which leaves about 86% to be mined. Just a datapoint, i think bringing a few different options to the community and seeing how the feel is going to happen soon, maybe some kind of vote

[11-Aug-18 01:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we don't have to change the satoshi amounts of any address, that makes the whole process a lot easier

[11-Aug-18 02:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There needs to be a more immediate "need" for the coin for it to get some traction.   I like the MoMoM btc headers idea but how long til there is a enough cross chain contracts that would utilize it .  Needs a renaming too.

[11-Aug-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be 100% PoS coin, but then no miners

[11-Aug-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
BTCH is a decent name for a chain with BTC headers

abusedsmily BTCH 

[11-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Francis#7833
Don't you think supply should be doubled at max? I have 200k btch an would be pretty annoyed that this would be reduced 10*

[11-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Francis#7833
I'm an investor not a miner

[11-Aug-18 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Francis that was my initial gut reaction as well, minimize dilution. Miners and current HODLers don't quite have the same incentives for how the supply change will work

[11-Aug-18 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Francis also, you have more than the BTCH dev fund, nicely done üòÉ

[11-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Francis#7833
From what you guys have been saying it does sound like a good idea and could be worth it in the long run. Just as you say I think minimise dilution. Atleast if the supply is doubled soon, the prices would remain cheap so purchasing more wouldn't be a crazy expense

[11-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Francis#7833
Also üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm just going to keep buying more tbh. I have faith

[11-Aug-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Francis that means a lot, thanks for believing in us

[11-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
@Francis if it were POS, you'd likely be the single largest staker, getting the majority of blocks

[11-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Francis#7833
True that but that's also kinda harsh on everyone else no? I really don't mind just as long as my holdings aren't diluted by more than half really

[11-Aug-18 06:40 PM] Francis#7833
@Alright

[11-Aug-18 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
it's only harsh to people that don't bother to stake

[11-Aug-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
if it's 100% POS, you'll statistically continue to hold the same % of the supply if you stake the coins you have

[12-Aug-18 01:31 AM] AkiraX#8269
Been holding the whole time.

[12-Aug-18 01:32 AM] AkiraX#8269
Been buying. But not lately as I've been accumulating kmd

[12-Aug-18 01:32 AM] AkiraX#8269
I don't think I will have enough for the chainzilla air drop though

[12-Aug-18 03:53 AM] AkiraX#8269
No money.  :)

[12-Aug-18 04:42 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think @Alright is right I‚Äôm thinking we need a high % of PoW blocks to come, so that miners will be interested. And clearly James‚Äôs headers idea is brilliant as well. I think your idea of 147mil coins @dukeleto sounds nice. Or something around that range. Some good halving points count be used as well to keep the PoW alive for years to come, like BTC.

[12-Aug-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a 50% PoS and 50% PoW chain? that would allow the people will active stakes to maintain their percentage of total supply, while also allowing new miners to also achieve large positions

{Reactions}
üôè üëç 

[12-Aug-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the ultimate coin supply would be secondary with a 50/50 chain

[12-Aug-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
can also be 60/40 or 40/60, etc

[12-Aug-18 10:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
That sounds like the best option

[13-Aug-18 05:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not sure exactly how we would do 50% PoS/PoW, but it sounds interesting. Verus has certainly done a lot of work in the area that could be built upon

[13-Aug-18 05:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
has any coin forked from 100% PoW to 50% PoS/PoW? It would be interesting to see how the went about it

[13-Aug-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=50 <- 50% PoS

[13-Aug-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=60 <- 60% PoS

[13-Aug-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty easy to set the PoS/PoW percentage

[13-Aug-18 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has -ac_staked option before verus, which uses a totally difrerent method of balancing. we have tested 90%, 100%, 50%, 10% and a few other -ac_staked percentages and unless there is another attack vector found, we should be good at any percentage.

[13-Aug-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
I think using the -ac_* options quite a large percentage of all the other coin emissions can be replicated,plus a lot of new ones

[13-Aug-18 01:45 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@dukeleto we're about to start a new PoS/PoW chain for testing in Chips #pos64test channel

[13-Aug-18 02:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@xRobeSx thanks, i forgot about the -ac_stake options already in KMD

Oops that was an accident somehow. Sorry

[17-Aug-18 11:39 AM] paia#7713
It would be great, to do something with BTCH. Even trying new things may brings unexpected (and hopefully positive) results.

[17-Aug-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we have plans for BTCH hardfork to activate CC and enable mining, maybe 50/50 PoW/PoS

[17-Aug-18 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
equihash or verushash? As this is a devcoin it would be exciting to see another algorythm

[17-Aug-18 11:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
But not sure if it's possible as komodod would need to support two algos?

[17-Aug-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on when the hardfork, mike will be porting verushash into komodo assetchains later this year

[17-Aug-18 11:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
nice

[18-Aug-18 09:12 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just an idea - but it would be nice to be able to build an "assetchain" -cli direct from the source (btch-cli).
Using the command switches from the komodo-cli makes integration into existing add-ons (like wallets) an extra step most don't want to take.
Same is true of the daemon - having to create a scrip or remember startup switches is tedious - it must be possible to add these to the build script - a Bounty opportunity?

[18-Aug-18 11:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bar_F1sh_Rel cd src/; ./fiat/btch help

[18-Aug-18 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
all assetchains have a ./fiat/ac wrapper

[18-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@dukeleto - yeah - but that is still just a script call to komodo-cli with wildcards accepted.
What is needed is a native btch-cli - as the wrapped script breaks calls in GUI's like swing.

[18-Aug-18 01:51 PM] pbca26#5430
i think verus already done something similar in verusd and verus-cli
but it will only work on mac/linux and those are also just a few shell scripts

[18-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bar_F1sh_Rel `as the wrapped script breaks calls in GUI's like swing` sounds like a bug in the GUI

[18-Aug-18 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
verus-cli is just a wrapper around komodo-cli

[19-Aug-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
I came up with an MGW CC contract and plan to use BTCH to be the chain where the BTC token is issued. with the built in DEX for onchain assets against BTCH, it can create a good solution for speedy trading. it is a single chain atomic swap DEX
the redeem will be a transfer of the BTC assets back to real BTC, which will rely on user specified notaries
eventually can make it so the BTCH BTC token can be transferred to other CC enabled chains, but that would likely be next year

We're being thrown off by "BitHash" I believe, same ticker symbol, likely confused for duplicate BTCH's.. We must establish dominance.

I added a -ac_ccactivate=height param to test branch of komodod. that means the community can decide when to activate the CC functionality. now all nodes would need to update, including exchanges, explorers, etc. as it is a dynamic hardforking

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal raise transaction fees. Some (semi-centralized) currencies work that way. IOTA and Waves are examples. Other way would probably be to burn unclaimed coins. How many of them have been claimed already? 10% of total supply? Set a time limit of 6 or 12 months and than burn unclaimed. From that point on you can probably continue with POW. Otherwise BTCH airdrop make no sense. Also, current name of coin is Bitcoin Hush. Bitcoin-Hush. Bitcoin. We all know what is maximum supply for BTC. ZEC (BTC's fork) and HUSH (ZEC's fork) remain with 21 mio. It's part of identity and it should be part of promotion and marketing.

[01-Sep-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I'm not a developer, maybe your idea is sound. But it's still fork Komodo, and KMD is already 100 million, but its value in the bear market is not low

[01-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I'm also not a developer. BTCH is not KMD fork, it is KMD asset chain. With total suppy of BTCH market capitalization would be 1-3 million, with circulating supply it is some 100k $. Tell BTC whales (centralized exchanges) you will burn their shitcoin and some will claim it and do something with it. That is a way to increase market volume and price and it no longer is shitcoin. And even if 25 or 50 % of BTCH would be claimed it will still leave significant room for POW. Also you should know that 5-6 million of already mined BTC is lost in space, so nobady will claim those forks.

[02-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @halo kitty rules Yes you are right< my mistake, asset chain. I think we will know about it soon

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BitexBay rep just reached out to me.
Offered a BTC pair listing at 0.15 BTC
https://www.bitexbay.com/
^ I usually don't go for this kind of stuff, but BitexBay is not a bad exchange, and that listing price is extremely attractive.
As long as we can vet the legitimacy, which he gave me an official email to reach out to, I don't see why BTCH/HUSH wouldn't be interested. I believe our listing donations could cover a decent amount of a single pair.
