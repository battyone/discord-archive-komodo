[01-Aug-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hot Albo> What is the main use case for btch,  is it basically the same as HUSH I.e. private messages with anon value transfer? Does BTCH do anything unique?

[01-Aug-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hot Albo> Also, is PoS still planned for BTCH?

[02-Aug-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> POS still planned but it's on the back burner as Duke focuses on hush

[02-Aug-19 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hot Albo> Ok, sounds like better to just buy HUSH, thanks!

[04-Aug-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <allegiant> Is there any exchange where I can buy BTCH & transfer to wallet?

[dscrd-hush] <allegiant> I have few thousands of BTCH that airdroped 2 yrs ago. R those still valid? I have private keys

[04-Aug-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes, they are valid. You can do watever you want with them. Buy, sell, send...

[04-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <allegiant> @halo kitty rules thanks

[13-Aug-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Can you believe there were 200000 blocks mined already? https://btch.explorer.dexstats.info/blocks  I don't know who has done that, but you can use it as a ÀùproofÀù someone is using the coin.

[13-Aug-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @jl777c In the past 2 weeks there were created thousands of new addresses, likely 10000+ of them and still counting. The pattern is the same, all addresses are almost empty (0.0001 BTCH inside). Is there any logic to that or is someone just doing experiments?

[13-Aug-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> its called mining

[13-Aug-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> On 10000 new addresses?

[13-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> a new address for each block

[13-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> look at BTC

[13-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> each block gets a new address (usually) and gets the block reward plus txfees

[13-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> same as BTCH

[13-Aug-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It is not a very suitable way to collect the rewards üòÑ . Anyway, usually the miners were collecting their fees on addresses with hundreds and thousand of coins inside. Maybe someone is mining just for fun...

[31-Aug-19 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> So is BTCH actually mineable?

[31-Aug-19 08:44 PM] SHossain#0007
on-demand mining. block reward is 0.0001 BTCH

[27-Sep-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Oct-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Trading on Coinexchange will finish soon. Are we able to extract and store all the trading info from the charts? Should we ask the exchange for that data? Because these informations include entire registered BTCH trading history. Alltogether we are speaking about few thousands of trades. It  would be a shame if these details would be lost. End of trading here doesn't mean the end of coin. I'll likely make a series of print-screens of BTCH/BTC charts, but I guess there must exist more precised technique...

[15-Oct-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> storing data is good

[15-Oct-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we hope to be on a new exchange soon
