[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Would you like a button to empty an address to send an another address by deducting the fee?
Example you have 20 BTCH on A to send to B.
You clicked on a button that sent 19.9999 to B and set 0.0001 fee automatically?

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But I basically don't know anything about programming. If it can be done easilly, I can give you 500 BTCH for that shortcut. But it is not a must-have, it is more like a premium ðŸ˜„ .

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Sorry, I still do not understand. ðŸ˜Ÿ

[03-Nov-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes you do, what you wrote above is what I mean. but I am just not good at expresion in english ðŸ˜„ .

[03-Nov-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I don't speak English very well either. It's not my native language. So I understood correctly. I would look at that yes.

[03-Nov-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> As said previously, if it can be done briefly, I can give you 500 BTCH. If not, leave it as it is.

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> anyway prospect of tipbot for  btch?

[10-Nov-19 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It costs money to implement it, once the coin is a true living thing I don't see why we wouldn't explore the possibility
