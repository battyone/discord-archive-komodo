[29-Nov-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> People will love utrums freeze featureðŸ˜œ

[29-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Freeze and time lock are negative words ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> As mentioned by you @Jimm B. We are going with HOLD instead of HODL

[29-Nov-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> HOLD represents positivity and confidence ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Nov-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> But, in case you still want to go with RightBTC, please fill a support token with them. You should be able to trade OOT on their website.

[29-Nov-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> Prices Not the same

[29-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <NatuMyers> Hi all, just joining the chat. I was invited by one of the support staff

[29-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <NatuMyers> I was told you're looking for volunteers (I help investors perform due diligence on projects)

[30-Nov-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Hi @NatuMyers welcome

[30-Nov-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Hi @obattal try at coinexchange

[30-Nov-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> There are no restrictions at RightBTC

[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> https://www.ccn.com/secs-next-move-social-media-influencers-who-promoted-crypto-icos/

This should help Utrum. With fewer promoters for people to follow they will need some place to go to get their information.

SEC's Next Move: Social Media Influencers Who Promoted Crypto ICOs
The SEC is actively cracking down on crypto initial coin offering (ICO) projects and a top official said earlier this year that dozens of cases are pending.

[03-Dec-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> True, Utrum must become a synonym of "asking the experts".

[03-Dec-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> And those experts come from the community.

[03-Dec-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC is going after celebs , not analysts though

[03-Dec-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC wants them to declare their earnings when they promoted

[03-Dec-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> I think that's where they are starting because they are an easy target. They may be working their way down.

[03-Dec-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Anyway the celeb promotions are scammy ðŸ˜ƒ

[03-Dec-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> whoever pays more, they endorse them

[03-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Another interesting bit on that same article:
```Coinbase has been cautious in ensuring that a digital asset is not recognized as a security by the SEC because in a hypothetical case that an asset listed by an exchange is declared a security by the U.S. government, the exchange could be prosecuted for illicitly distributing unregistered securities.```
If Coinbase is listing ZEC that could bode well for KMD. Just as Bitcoin influences alts, Komodo can influence its asset chains.

[03-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Sure it does

[03-Dec-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC is not clear with any laws. It's all bits and pieces and no one has clarity

[03-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Utrum being a Cayman Foundation, SEC laws are applicable for US projects specifically. We are safe there

[03-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Coinbase might not list KMD though as there is no registered entity behind it

[03-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Sri#6686
Yes, that happens when you have an organization behind that project that is willing to take it to courts ðŸ˜ƒ

[03-Dec-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> They are working on a foundation I think though

[03-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> That would be great news if they do it. Because of the SEC and DOJ, every crypto needs some kind of legal setup

[03-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Yeah, it's based in Vietnam, last i heard.

[03-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Interesting choice of Jurisdiction, Malta would be great

[03-Dec-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Sounds like the foundation home based in Vietnam is related to RedFOX labs and Ben Fairbank.

[03-Dec-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Very much possible

[04-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <obattal> cause really i have to much customers in my VIP groupe they just ask ... ?

[04-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @obattal not for the moment, perhaps in the future?

[dscrdutrum] <obattal> and i like it So much

[04-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> Why you don't Add your Token for payment Some games?

[04-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> We're putting a lot of love on this project, it will give fruits, believe me.

[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Games are not part of the target market, i guess. But, who knows, that's up to the Utrum foundation to decide.

[04-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> Yeah

[04-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <obattal> ANd This 100 Millions You can find 10 m use Crypto Currency ðŸ˜‰

[04-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> So this is marketing and You can Hit your Target prices So fast ðŸ˜„

[04-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @obattal we would need first a relation between gaming and crypto reviews. Maybe gamefying parts of the platform? Hehe, i don't know. Everything is possible.

[04-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> @Emman - DevOps  That's True ðŸ˜„ hope So
