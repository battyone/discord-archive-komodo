Please be advised, we will NEVER ask you to deposit your assets into the open like this! Please check the email for spelling errors and if it smells like a scam, it is a scam! If there are issues, an individual from our team will contact you directly, not through a mass email send like this! Please be aware!

[15-Apr-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> alpha website done, ready for publication, not a working product?

[15-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> @10 do you realise that to have a product, you first need to make that product? sounds crazy, right?
on a more serious note. many projects begin with just a whitepaper and after ICO start actually making things. this might not be an ideal (classic model for new companies requires to have a product and/or customers first, before receiving funding), but nevertheless it is part of our new reality that there is a lag between making an investment and seeing (some) results

[15-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <10> @crumb It sounds crazy to invest tons of money in something that isn't created, see it delayed & the price drop what, 98%.. and almost a year later, no project

[15-Apr-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> i took part in ICO, i knew it is extremely risky

[15-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> investing *tons* of money into these kinds of projects is not a wise decision. risk management is important.

[15-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @10 Are you new to crowd funding and ICO investment. Seems like it. I would like to know, does utrum only lost its value or other projects too,because of bear.

[15-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @crumb in traditional modal, projects raise money from vc and then build product. Then launch. In crowd funding model, vc are replaced by common people.

[15-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Risk is always the same for both vc and common investors

[15-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It's high risk, high reward

[15-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But it's unfortunate that bear killed the value and momentum of many projects

[15-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I agree, there is delay as we have to layoff staff to save money and keep project alive

[15-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Still waiting for a small deposit of OOT. Something went wrong. Four days and still not fixed. I hate all centralized exchanges.

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> oh, @Duck Tape they are working on the daemon, it's on maintenance right now.

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Duck Tape Seems they are following binance with confirmations. These people should understand all KMD asset chains are secured by Delayed Proof of Work but they dont

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> @Duck Tape maintenance extended to tomorrow, they just confirmed to me.

[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Price are too low at coinexchange.  I also wanted to trade it against KMD.

[16-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
