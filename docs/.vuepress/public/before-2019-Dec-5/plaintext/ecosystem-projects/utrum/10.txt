[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Cryptocurrency is one of the highest risk markets in which to invest‚Ä¶and arguably the most accessible to anyone. With the increasing difficulty for investors to adequately distinguish between the good and the bad in crypto investing, many well-meaning investors have lost everything in their attempts at supporting the growth of this technology.

Utrum believes that by developing an Artificial Intelligence backed, a community-driven platform which rewards users for their help in reviewing, rating, analyzing and predicting crypto projects, assets, and teams, these problems can be solved. Through the use of blockchain, Utrum is creating an ecosystem of supportive and educational guidance for investors of all caliber, as well as a marketplace for projects and providers to showcase to a targeted investment-rich community. Utrum will also implement community-voted moderators whose job it is to help regulate and manage the ecosystem according to community governance.

[05-Aug-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Utrum  is poised and passionate about developing a powerful community platform for crypto projects, developers, analysts, newbies, and investors to gain access to quality information and reviews.

[24-Aug-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Mr.Cryptodude> Just an advice, is it possible to import trading view charts. It will allow Utrum users to analyze charts much better than on CM and wont have to tab out to trading view all the time.

[24-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can you consider doing 3d/7d predictions?

[07-Sep-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I don't see 7d prediction on most alts, as realistic.

[07-Sep-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> To include a altcoin chart on 7D prediction, would prove futile. You're better off including a btc chart

[07-Sep-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Top 10 CMC use 7D

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Privatoshi for now, it's 7 days for all coins. We will revisit this after few months

[07-Sep-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Let's say this prediction above ends up being a successful one. And he has 44% Rating. How is that a good thing?

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri

[07-Sep-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Users rating others predictions, 7 days in advanced, seems highly difficth he to me. Most guys can't find basic support & basic ruesistance, on a chart.

[07-Sep-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There are only 2 ways to do it.  What community thinks of it and what is the reality

[07-Sep-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So we are addressing both here using URS and Success Rate

[07-Sep-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It is true not many can't read charts, but once we have a stronger community, this issue will be resolved

[07-Sep-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> URS is based on community verdict and Success rate is the result of prediction
