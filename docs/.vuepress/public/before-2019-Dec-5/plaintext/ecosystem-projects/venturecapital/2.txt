I leave all such things to some dedicated person üòÑ

[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
We need to find potential alpha and beta testers outside our ecosystem

[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I am also busy with my other work and dev stuff üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Entities that have a ton of customers

[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Because we are looking for growth

[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Fab√ò#8941
And KPI

[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
right, I guess you can have a word with @hyperDEX

[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Could we commit to figure it this part in the next 48h everyone? üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
he's already making good progress with such community projects, and I'm very sure he'll also be very glad to have some financial support for this good cause üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
It is our job to do so

[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Tierno#3327
Thanks for the new nspv feature @jl777c that‚Äôs a great addition to the ecosystem. Would love to see it in motion and as @Fab√ò said, I‚Äôd love to help with the go to market strategy and other  minor but important tasks (financial analysis, reporting etc)

[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@jl777c is busy an egg pop up now we need to take care of it

[30-Jun-19 03:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also @Bitcoin Benny from RedFox üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Yep we work closely with him as you may saw üòâ

[30-Jun-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
we just need a dedicated SPV wallet dev and i can make sure he understands what needs to be done

[30-Jun-19 03:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
sorry, I don't recognise your username and benny together. might have either mixed up or something or didn't know. I just know you from this channel as VC üòõ

[30-Jun-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe one for the core and another for the GUI side

[30-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Fab√ò#8941
K

[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once core is there, I'm very sure there'll be many GUI side projects pop up

[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I myself want to use this core for a project if it's there

[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
true. the core should be able to be used by many different gui

[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Fab√ò#8941
```sorry, I don't recognise your username and benny together. might have either mixed up or something or didn't know. I just know you from this channel as VC :stuck_out_tongue:``` benny and I worked on a JV Zaddex.io

[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to my opinion the core must be the utmost priority

[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we also help on redfox

[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fab√ò thanks for clearing mate. Glad to know! üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Fab√ò#8941

@Fab√ò   Any idea of the legal  requirements for asset backed coins

[02-Jul-19 09:27 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Hello @polycryptoblog old friend how are you doing, it is been a long time

[02-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Fab√ò#8941
asset back loans depend on which countries

[02-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we worked on it, so we have few ideas üòâ

@Fab√ò    Yes it has been awhile,  been just grinding away.  I believe I have found a way to create a asset backed stablecoin that doesn‚Äôt require much legally.  I believe it can help a lot of the areas we need to improve in,  I wrote a little bit about it in the jl777 channel.  I‚Äôll copypaste it over here.

[06-Jul-19 04:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
‚ÄúI have in mind using these tokens to represent warehouse receipts used to claim stored goods, specifically standardized commodities but it can and will be expanded to other goods as well.  If these tokens can be atomic swapped with coins like I described above ,  this can effectively solve liquidity issue with Atomicdex, as well as other benefits , in the form many additional chains added to the ecosystem to accommodate other interests ( a different chain with its own tokens for each country or city or warehouse location for instance ) .  Beyond stablecoins(warehouse receipts ),  many chains ( fees to Komodo ),  liquidity ( more things for KMD to trade against )  it provides the ecosystem with a form of ‚Äúgood‚Äù money ( Gresham law reference )  which can siphon from even other coins and their liquidity.‚Äù

[06-Jul-19 05:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I would like to discuss this with you and @ca333 @noashh#2802  @Bitcoin Benny  @jl777c and others.  I believe this could be a unicorn project.  However it is well beyond the scope of just one person,  there are some things technologically that need done ( and need done regardless of this project ) ,  on the business/legal end and physical end as well,  let alone if the parties involved wish to do a fundraising offering.   From my deep delve into the UCC and federal and state regulations over the last few days ,  it does not appear there are any legal quagmires like other types of stablecoins .  Being not a currency itself but rather a document of title and is not a security  as it is not an investment contract ( passes Howey) ,  it‚Äôs not algorithmically based as it is backed by collateral .  I am seeking out legal counsel on this .

[06-Jul-19 11:48 AM] Lumbi#8378
we'd be willing to work with @polycryptoblog along these lines and incorporate into the LUMBER brand, but there isn't much point in discussing if the budget is pegged too low as well as a good understanding of regulatory/legal risk and the costs of maintaining a legal team.

Another venture I'd be willing to be a part of is "Project Marine Iguana"; i.e  establish a self-sustaining cryptomining farm using windpower on the island of Malta. The mined crypto could be distributed to coin hodlers and/or fiat reserves could be built up by reselling the electricity locally while building longterm strategic relationships in the region.

[06-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@polycryptoblog this is an interesting blurb

[06-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Would like to discuss this in more depth

[06-Jul-19 02:46 PM] yorklab#7270
@Lumbi Perhaps not exactly what you are talking about, but for large scale miners in the US this seems like the place to do it. I think they can handle up to 78,000 rigs.

@yorklab there are some similarities. it is amazing how efficient some of these generators have become. how cool would it be to have a virtual 'shareholders' meeting every 30 days to decide what alts to mine and putting it to a vote; or how much excess electricity was sold off for fiat dividends, etc. üòÉ

@Lumbi  Your coin nobody needs it ( IMHO ). Nobody mine it. Explorer has been down for several days. There are no buy orders on the exchange. There are some real achievements you can publish ?

[07-Jul-19 10:01 AM] SadykovT#2123
@Deleted User  I'll fix it. But I will still think so until I see some results.

[08-Jul-19 07:37 AM] Lumbi#8378
@SadykovT a new pool should be coming online around the 15th of july. https://lmbr.mcmpool.eu/ is operational. network activity can be tracked here https://explorer2.lumberscout.io/. Digital Price isn't the most active exchange, but there has been some activity https://digitalprice.io/order?url=lumber-btc . All in all perhaps not much compared to BTC, but where was BTC in 2009? üòâ   @Deleted User  we are in the process of re-writing the app to use cryptoconditions. The original app used centralized servers that were too costly to maintain for the time being.

Hej ! I been thinking about an idea, and as VC would be users, I post it here for feedback

Especially in early phases of projects, there is sometime a bit of a chicken and egg problem when it comes to funding. That is where ‚ÄúConditional Automatic Funding‚Äù (CAF) could kick in. Investors put some money on the table and verifiable objectives are set. The project automatically gets the money if it delivers, otherwise investors automatically get their money back.

Investors derisk their investment while scooping project earlier. The project boosts its credibility, feel secure and focus on what‚Äôs matter: delivering. It could be used for ‚Äúclassic‚Äù startup funding (e.g. with SAFE) or for crypto projects.

Seems to me (a non tech guy) a MVP based on Komodo, would be relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to develop, possibly with a centralized oracle at first (like EY or PWC).

This would also get early stage projects and investors to connect with the Komodo ecosystem: that could make a lot of sense on a marketing perspective.

[18-Oct-19 10:15 AM] Sully#3164
Funny, this is one of the reasons I am here. @skitout. 

I have an Automated Donation Engine, (ADE) that does what you were speaking about, and has a governance model.

[18-Oct-19 03:03 PM] skitout#8659
@Sully Interesting ! Where can we find more info about Automated Donation Engine ?

[19-Oct-19 10:11 AM] Sully#3164
Will be published this week. Finalizing website. Also publishing WP for the decentralized application that will be utilizing it.

[19-Oct-19 01:54 PM] skitout#8659
cool ! let me know when it will be out üôÇ

[08-Nov-19 02:35 AM] Sully#3164
@skitout. If you feel like checking it out, the ADE whitepaper is published to a placeholder website. There is also a WP for the project we are developing the ADE for, (CoolADE). Please go to fractaldynamics.io to see them.

[09-Nov-19 05:52 PM] skitout#8659
@Sully thx ! will check it !
