It working now?

[22-Oct-18 05:35 PM] jorian#4555

[22-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Llama#1330
There was a mining problem

[22-Oct-18 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
maybe my spurr of blocks caused a crash in all mining pools :trollface:

[22-Oct-18 05:36 PM] forkwitch#6080
@Llama @blubbi updating the pool currently. Gonna notify you when back online pool.

[22-Oct-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm thinking that the mempool was cleared, in reality, but not cleared in the "mind of" the daemons

[22-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Llama#1330
Thx @forkwitch

[22-Oct-18 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
chain is starting to move along now

[22-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Decker#3767
i'm modified a pool to include in block only 5 txes (4 txes + 1 coinbase) from mempool, to get short hex block to analyse. example of produced block:
https://gist.github.com/DeckerSU/aa80df1719c0eac0ee5d5e9fc256a1ea
pool software counts that daemon accept this block, but in real - this block don't appears on network. when i tried to submit this block manually again - daemon returns "duplicate-invalid" ... that means that block already known to daemon and it's invalid.

seems, if we understand why daemon count this block as invalid - problem will be solved.

wherever the 700 txes came from they are not being rebroadcast,
has anyone checked to make sure that all are actually unconfirmed?

@jorian

[22-Oct-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's possible that 1 or more tx in the "clogged" mempool were already processed and the blocks were invalid because they contained a virtual ds buy trying to add it in a new block

[22-Oct-18 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
check for each txid in `getrawmempool` on house node whether it's confirmed already?

[22-Oct-18 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, because I rebooted my node and no longer have them (since they are not being rebraodcast) a few of the ones I scrolled back and picked at random have been confirmed and some haven't

the addnode in the parameters up above is the one sending the transactions

you can get 2k coins at 50% chance 😄

[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so somehow a truncated tx got into the mempool and then rejected

what I still don't get is why daemon rejects, but nothing is printed in debug.log

@jl777c @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i think reason is in other ... need little more time to finish my investigation ...

[22-Oct-18 06:05 PM] c2k#4915
u guys think we should hold off on mining for now?

you figured out what to filter out?

[22-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Decker#3767
seems i fugured out why we can't mine a block earlier ... need little bit more time ... and if bug confirmed - i will disclosure it ... i think that is pool software bug, not daemon.

[22-Oct-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that was my feeling too, just have no idea what it could be

[22-Oct-18 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that was my initial thought, but if so it has to be deep in old code based on my solo getting same issue

[22-Oct-18 06:15 PM] forkwitch#6080
If you only leave coinbase transation in it it will mine it. But why not with transaction.

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] Decker#3767
@jl777c seems all nomp based software affected ... if mempool have more than 0x7F (127) txes - every mined block will fail, bcz seems it have incorrect `varint` encoding. when chain is stalled earlier - we have more than 170 txes in mempool. but to be sure at 100% - i'll need to write some additional code and try to reproduce it.

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is horrible bug!

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and why 127 and not 255

[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
wrong on many levels

[22-Oct-18 06:17 PM] Decker#3767
need additional tests ... want to be sure that it's varint encoding related ...

[22-Oct-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
then a short term fix is to limit to 100 tx per block?

[22-Oct-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Decker if that's so then it has to be a 127 limit **and** something else; I used this solo before with over 10k txes in mempool

[22-Oct-18 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
I feel like I've stratum mined blocks with >127 txs in them on other chains

[22-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Decker#3767
Still investigating ... i assume that for 2500 txes in mempool, for example, all will be ok ... because 2500 in hex is a 2 bytes - 0x9C4 (C409) ... but if txes count is in 128..255 - it will fail.

[22-Oct-18 06:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hmm

[22-Oct-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
they used a signed byte instead of unsigned byte, that would do that

[22-Oct-18 06:22 PM] Decker#3767
```        if (this.txCount <= 0x7f){
            var varInt = new Buffer(txCount, 'hex');
        }
        else if (this.txCount <= 0x7fff){
            var varInt = new Buffer.concat([Buffer('FD', 'hex'), new Buffer(txCount, 'hex')]);
        }
```

This part seems problem.

[22-Oct-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be <= 0xff

[22-Oct-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
<=

[22-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Decker#3767
For 2 bytes txcount - should be FDxxyy ... and in case of 176 txes in mempool we have FDB0 instead of FDB000 ...

[22-Oct-18 06:25 PM] Decker#3767
Remember, chain stuck at moment when we have 176 txes in mempool ...

[22-Oct-18 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so all nomps have this bug?

[22-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
seems amazing they never found it

[22-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATE never had so many tx in a block to hit this

[22-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has notary mining

[22-Oct-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So is this related to the `return Object.values(result)[2].root;` in merkleTree.js @Decker
