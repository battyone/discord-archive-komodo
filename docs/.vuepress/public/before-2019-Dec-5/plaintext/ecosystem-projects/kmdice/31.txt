[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Anyone can

[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But that is for pretty much any blockchain that comes up,  the differentiator will have to be outside of the tech

[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So the question is can staked catch up 😉

[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] ph03nix#3115
feken open source

[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
catch up to what ?

[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have already deplayed too long, and decided to launch the main chain without its cluster before 100 new AC launch and there is no hash power left 🤣

[23-Oct-18 08:35 AM] ph03nix#3115
let's bring it back to the old school

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] ph03nix#3115

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked amkes it so that we dont need a deiffrent coin for every contract.

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Way better

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one coin... unlimited blockchains

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and contracts

[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the value created is MUCH higher as it isnt diluted with new coins eing created every day/week/minute whatever

[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Incentive for participating in the consensus?

[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mining reward is 50 PoS 50PoW

[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on main chain... the rest are probably mined by notaries or chain creator ( a percentage of STAKED BR will go to notaries)

[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so hash rate will be concentrated on 1 chain, but all chains are protected

[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
details to sort out still

[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we cant delay too long

[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before someon beats us to it

[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So how are the unlimited chains,  are they just cluster clones or is it a childchain model

[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hundreds and hundreds of man hours into staked prokect already

[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM

[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cluster

[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if there is a limit to the number of chains a cluster can use ... but 10 so far has worked ok

[23-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can also launch the chain, not in the fungible cluster and just burn staked to launch it

[23-Oct-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
locking the staked into that chain forever

[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every chain in a MoMoM cluster cna have totally diffrent params ... even notarisation frequency

[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are seperate in every way, they just share coins.

[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] ph03nix#3115
your contributions are priceless 👍

[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just figuring out how to actually USE what james has created

{Reactions}
🆒 

[23-Oct-18 08:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So like how PAX was,  you burn some coin,  receive proportional amount of other coin on the other chain.

[23-Oct-18 08:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Burn protocol they called it

[23-Oct-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
most of the ideas are Alrights tbh ... I just ahve to figure out how to make it work.

[23-Oct-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, you burn coins, then they are created on the other chain.... atm there has been a 2-7% chance that the import TX is invalid ad the coins are lost ... thats unacceptable.

[23-Oct-18 08:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Is it though 😉

[23-Oct-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we need to fix it so it works 100% of the time ... until then we cant have the actual staked chain, have any chains i its cluster

[23-Oct-18 08:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Financially speaking

[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if a user transfered his/her coins in small amounts over a 24H period 5% is acceptabe

[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but you know there will always be that noob who does all of them at once ...

[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then FUDs forever

[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hehe ok I concede it needs to be fixed

[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems a better idea to just identify why it doesnt work and fix it .. like I did with the notarisations on notary nodes.

[23-Oct-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can take a long fucking time ... but its worth it for adoptiona nd use ..

[23-Oct-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will know in 2 days time, if I have identified a way to make the burn procol work... it seems that by simply slowing it down a lot, it becomes much more realiable.

[23-Oct-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anwyay stealing this channel here ... lol

[23-Oct-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Thank you @forkwitch

[23-Oct-18 11:16 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
so 1Msol give around 15000 KMDICE in 24 h...

[23-Oct-18 11:17 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
or not

[23-Oct-18 11:18 AM] forkwitch#6080
25 KMDICE * 1440 blocks = 36,000 KMDICE per 24h for all network.

[23-Oct-18 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1Msol will give you what 1Msol gives you

[23-Oct-18 11:19 AM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Ideal logic )) If you have 1 MSol - you have 1 MSol ))

[23-Oct-18 11:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
With 10% you maybe make 3,600 KMDICE if you are 100% lucky with your share.

[23-Oct-18 11:21 AM] forkwitch#6080
Yes right, this is why i say 10% absolute measure , not Sol relative measure.

[23-Oct-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Decker my point was that blanket statements are bad and net sols fluctuate and some moron might decide to add 40M and change the answer

[23-Oct-18 11:23 AM] forkwitch#6080
Some do not understand that they waste the hashes. Less hashes will have about same blocks for them. I saw one can save 20 to  50% costs.

[23-Oct-18 11:23 AM] forkwitch#6080
Waste of $ and pollution.

[23-Oct-18 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a bit too much hash on this chain, it will take a few weeks to settle

@forkwitch exactly, there's a delicate balance to increasing your share of the network vs self-defeating addition to where you're only increasing teh diff against yourself

[23-Oct-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but

[23-Oct-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has been known to be self defeating just to make a point_

[23-Oct-18 11:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why they do it then? I can not understand.

[23-Oct-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why they do it then? `
Because most people's education of all things mining is less than 10% of what mining is, means, and entails
