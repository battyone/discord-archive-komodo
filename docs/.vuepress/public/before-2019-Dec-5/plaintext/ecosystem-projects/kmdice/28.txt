hi what is the current price to buy?

[22-Oct-18 09:53 PM] jorian#4555
0.9

[22-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
meaning if you wanted to trade 1 KMD, you need a utxo of at least 1.0001 and >1/777 KMD utxo

[22-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
can be something like 10x the size you want to trade

[22-Oct-18 09:53 PM] jorian#4555
@Flexatron was this you? ```2958 uuid.8f45b262a6e2901e3e843ef7aee761d7 M.0 g.0 f.0      request KMDICE/KMD   198.64844549 ->  19.86482453 ( 0.09999990) | RT.2 0 n0
```? buying at 0.1?

[22-Oct-18 09:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
yes

[22-Oct-18 09:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
think so

[22-Oct-18 09:54 PM] And1_89#6578
0.9 kmd?

[22-Oct-18 09:54 PM] And1_89#6578

[22-Oct-18 09:55 PM] jorian#4555

[22-Oct-18 10:00 PM] Flexatron#8809
pain in the *Ss

[22-Oct-18 10:00 PM] jorian#4555
no you're not pricing it right

[22-Oct-18 10:00 PM] jorian#4555
if the lowest ask is 0.9, how can you buy at 0.15?

[22-Oct-18 10:00 PM] jorian#4555
(je kunt zien dat je een gierige nederlander bent haha)

[22-Oct-18 10:01 PM] Flexatron#8809

[22-Oct-18 10:01 PM] jorian#4555
barterdex is different from the usual exchange

[22-Oct-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright alice

[22-Oct-18 10:02 PM] SHossain#0007

Dicing is more effective than mining ))

Can't imagine ... who points 20 MSol/s to KMDICE ...

[22-Oct-18 11:09 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't have that much hash

[22-Oct-18 11:09 PM] SHossain#0007
only 4 x z9 minis who are not getting anything

[22-Oct-18 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
2 more adding up from tomorrow

[22-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Decker#3767
I'm just comparing the profits. For example, during investigating pools bug i spent some BTC on hashrate and as a result have some KMDICE. But i have much more from using dice. That's what i mean.

[22-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Decker#3767

My KMDICE GUI template ... hope i will have time to finish it.
