[23-Oct-18 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[23-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hope it still works

[23-Oct-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r @geforce209ad are the pools back now?

[23-Oct-18 02:20 AM] manfromafar (poolofd32th.club)#2786
ah yeah

[23-Oct-18 02:20 AM] manfromafar (poolofd32th.club)#2786

😂

[23-Oct-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I updated and reatrted mine

[23-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Bakes#0367
I get a heap of rejected when on the forkwitch pool

[23-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Bakes#0367
Blackjok3r's seems to work the best for me

[23-Oct-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as I know it should be working fine now ...

[23-Oct-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not please ping me

[23-Oct-18 03:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
What is your pool address @blackjok3r

[23-Oct-18 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wlc     1.43 Sol/s` :shexy:

[23-Oct-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
anything inder 50 diff has a single core on it

[23-Oct-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it used to just mine to a non imported address ...

[23-Oct-18 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I probably need to do something about that pool at some point LOL

[23-Oct-18 04:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think a fork happened,  @forkwitch  pool and @blackjok3r  pool showing way different stats

[23-Oct-18 04:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Block 7427 on @blackjok3r  and 8091 on @forkwitch

[23-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My pool is on a notary node

[23-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
investigating now

[23-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well not on an actaly notary node

[23-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the same server

[23-Oct-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if my pool is forked ... then my notary is awell

[23-Oct-18 04:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think forkwitchs is on the fork it's nailing every block in its chain

[23-Oct-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its mine

[23-Oct-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my notary has no blocks  for like 10H or something

[23-Oct-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resyncing both see what happens 🤷

[23-Oct-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
resynced both nodes and they went to the longer chain

[23-Oct-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess my old Knomp must have mined an invalid block and the chain stopped.

[23-Oct-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still had 13 connections, so there is a fork out there for sure

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah ok

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the longer chain is being notarised so its all ok I think ... just feel sorry for the ppl with hash on my pool lol

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will switch back to forkwitch pool then,  knew 2msol network hash was too good to be true lol

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
12H with no blocks maybe more

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be fixed now

[23-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its all updated and on right chain

[23-Oct-18 04:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Oh ok won't switch then

[23-Oct-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i'll keep an eye on it

[23-Oct-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if something wrong ill let you kow

[23-Oct-18 04:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just have the mini on it now,  will throw some nicehash

[23-Oct-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my pool just got a block 😄 Its working @polycryptoblog

[23-Oct-18 05:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Nice

[23-Oct-18 05:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Had a nice string there for a sec

[23-Oct-18 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yea it turns out the update I merged in earlier needed npm install... it was an update to a nodejs module for equihash

[23-Oct-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pool should be solid ... someon put 60 k sol on MGNX 😂

[23-Oct-18 05:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's the proof of stake masternodes one ?

[23-Oct-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I should probably remove all those small AC, as someone can easily just drrive by on them with high hash rate and they will stall... 🤔

[23-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pool config script has an ignore, but itwas 4am whne I set pool up and just let it all all of them

[23-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MGNX is 90% PoS and they ahve a second coin with masternodes

[23-Oct-18 06:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seems like an attack vector, high hashrate stalling that is

[23-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
has been that way for a long time...

[23-Oct-18 06:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because of the ondemand?

[23-Oct-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using a PoS percentage basically stops it being possible,... even a 10% PoS will force the diff higher than ZEC if someone hash attacks it

[23-Oct-18 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also did some work on staked, where I made a chain, that enforces ondemand as a consensus rule pretty much, although if someone spent he time, they cna still make a stratum that works with them.

[23-Oct-18 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make the coinbase all weird... and stratum just fails on it ... so can only mine with KMD daemons built in ondemand miner

[23-Oct-18 06:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
How often does your pool update info,  just keeping an eye on it with a decent amount of hash just seeing if getting expected blocks

[23-Oct-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... ive never used the website part of it before tbh...

[23-Oct-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems to be finding quite regular bloocks with 7MSol on it lol.

[23-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Flexatron#8809
*waiting for his coins to mature*

[23-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Flexatron#8809
*so he can play already*

[23-Oct-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can create a dice table on any AC with CC enabled if you just want to play 😕

{Reactions}
realpirate 💯 

[23-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Flexatron#8809
how do you play without coins?

[23-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Flexatron#8809
oh any

[23-Oct-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... if you can use CLI, create a new chain with billions of coins to play against your self... the maximum supply an AC cna have as premine is over 77 billion I tested it.

[23-Oct-18 07:31 AM] Flexatron#8809
cool

[23-Oct-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just make sure to use -ac_cc=2

[23-Oct-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so dice is enabled...

[23-Oct-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
playing with real coins seems a lot more real than dicing test coins

[23-Oct-18 07:40 AM] Flexatron#8809
yup

[23-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he said hedidnt want to wait... I was just saying he didnt have to

[23-Oct-18 07:46 AM] gt#2812
are there any write ups on how to play?

[23-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Flexatron#8809
bitcointalk thread has some

[23-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Flexatron#8809
you have to use dicebet

[23-Oct-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
when GUI?

[23-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Flexatron#8809

[23-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Flexatron#8809
a nice GUI will shoot this to the stars in a far away galaxy

[23-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Flexatron#8809
there's a seller for 0.5 KMD

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] gt#2812
you have to define pubkey to use CC?

{Reactions}
👍 

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do validateaddress

[23-Oct-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then restart with -pubkey=

[23-Oct-18 08:11 AM] gt#2812
do you have to restart? or should one

[23-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you have to restart the daemon, you cant change pubkey in runtime

[23-Oct-18 08:11 AM] gt#2812
noted, thanks!

[23-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although being able to do that seems like a goo dthing to add... possible @jl777c

[23-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

Yes we are in early planning to finally launch staked.. nSeriously considering having a dedicated dice chain there 😄

[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just coz we can
