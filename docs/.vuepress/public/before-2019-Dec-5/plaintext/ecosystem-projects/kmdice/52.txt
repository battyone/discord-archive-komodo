`I can't test what I want to test without ripping apart the network`
it doesn't work now, so what's the downside?

[28-Oct-18 12:11 AM] Alright#0419
every node stuck?

[28-Oct-18 12:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Kmdicetest - yes

[28-Oct-18 12:12 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`every node stuck?`
I'd bet a nickle that joker can do that 游땥

[28-Oct-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the main chain should have alwasys been that :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont want to be a broken record on this, but I did warn you guys this was broken

[28-Oct-18 12:13 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Git er done - i wouldnt bet a nickle against that theory

[28-Oct-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  just do it

[28-Oct-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
who cares... we need to work it out

[28-Oct-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it affects dice CC it might affect others that use mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright if "every" node gets stuck and it ends up making a better chain (especially when people have paid for coins they can't use **now**) I can't see a harm to that (but rather that it would be a positive value for those that hold the coin now and in the future)

Get the faucet running - im thirsty

[28-Oct-18 12:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and even if you fix "the underlying problem", that still doesn't change the fact that if, out of the world's population, a mere 22 people place a bet between the same 2 blocks, 1 of them will get a fail

[28-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
could change up the mechanism for deciding which to use

[28-Oct-18 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
base it on segid of the pubkey you have set maybe

[28-Oct-18 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
so only 1/64 nodes would pick the same entropy utxo if they bet at the same time

[28-Oct-18 12:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can do what ever you want to try and reduce collisions, but as I discovered with igauan on notary nodes, unless you can stop the same utxo being chosen twice at all, its not perfect solution

[28-Oct-18 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
you don't need to stop that

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
miners should stop it anyway

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think yo uunderstand...

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its using mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt care about blocks

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
I don't

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
explain?

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
what is "it"

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All its checking is if the entropy tx is spent in mempool:
`if ( myIsutxo_spentinmempool(entropytxid,0) != 0 )`

[28-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if two nodes have a diffrent mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they disagree

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
cool

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
shouldn't matter *at all*

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well it clearly does

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
because the miner will decide which one gets into a block

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because when ther eis 20,000 entropy it always works

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
and the other should be ignored

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its not careing about blocks

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its only checking the mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
what

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alright#0419
it's not checking if the input is unspent?

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alright#0419
seriously? what??

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we cna add a gettransaction call ?

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright the contract runs off the mempool, not the chain

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that check fails, see if the thing was spent in the last block?

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Unless an oracle manages multiple chains and or if return = "fail" then rerun bet. -- kmdkrazy still talking out of his butt... postulating possibilities...no need to tell me im wrong....im sure I am...this year

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Going back to football

[28-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alright#0419
you're telling me that the contract is *entirely* unaware if an entropy utxo is spent/unspent?

[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] Alright#0419
I find that very very hard to believe

[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it calls listunspent (sort of thing) first,

[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then checks if its spent in mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`you're telling me that the contract is entirely unaware if an entropy utxo is spent/unspent?`
at the selection point, yes

[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( (funding= DicePlanFunds(entropyval,entropytxid,sbits,cp,dicepk,fundingtxid,entropytxs)) >= 2*bet*odds+txfee && entropyval != 0 )
    {
        if ( myIsutxo_spentinmempool(entropytxid,0) != 0 )```

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it calls the call that I used in diceinfo to get the list of entropy tx (which should be unspents)

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
going in circles here man, it shouldn't matter if two nodes try to spend the same input at the same time

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well it does

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
miner *should* decide which goes into the next block

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasuse thats what its doing

[28-Oct-18 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is NOT BTC protocol exactly anymore

[28-Oct-18 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
so we broke one of the underlying concept of how bitcoin's mempool works

[28-Oct-18 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
:L

[28-Oct-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so yes

[28-Oct-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But Im not 100% sure... im just reading the code and makig assumptions based on what we are observing

[28-Oct-18 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as I have no idea how the mepool and all that works, thats all I can do... if is doing something then it is, weather its meant to or not

[28-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
the fix shouldn't be about the better picking the right utxo

[28-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
it should be about the miner picking one

[28-Oct-18 12:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm im not sure the miner can change what utxo isin the transaction lol

[28-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
not what I'm saying

[28-Oct-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the dicestatus call does not care about what is in blocks, the problem is in the mempool, where nodes disagree

[28-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
if there are two txs spending the same input, miner picks one, puts into a block and other is entirely ignored

[28-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
it's not a dice specific problem at all

[28-Oct-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and this happens before that

[28-Oct-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
before the block is confirmed and mined

[28-Oct-18 12:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the solution is just to call `if ( myIsutxo_spentinmempool(entropytxid,0) != 0 )` this liek 100 times every second ?

[28-Oct-18 12:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`if there are two txs spending the same input, miner picks one, puts into a block and other is entirely ignored
it's not a dice specific problem at all`
and now all you need to do is go back into the wallet db of the "ignored" bettor and remove the tx their wallet has

[28-Oct-18 12:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the mempol has time to catch up ?

[28-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 ever see that error that tells you that your db is wonky?

[28-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
and you just completely ignore it and nothing bad happens?

[28-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
then you do `-zapwallet` or whatever and it's gone?

[28-Oct-18 12:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... the DB is fuckign shit as it is... and my first assumtions wehen stressing dice on STAKED was that the address index and all that was gettin mixzed up from too many txs

[28-Oct-18 12:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seems it might have acually been this

[28-Oct-18 12:39 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_rewrites GUI to include `on error: shut down, reboot with zap and try new bet`_

[28-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
not a dice specific problem

[28-Oct-18 12:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK so if its constantly spamming No Hashblock...  we nede to remove the tx from the local walelt?

[28-Oct-18 12:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems not do difficult

[28-Oct-18 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`not a dice specific problem`
it is when teh dice contract makes it one

[28-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
also >`and you just completely ignore it and nothing bad happens?`

[28-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
I ignore that error *every* single time I see it

[28-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
and I've never had anything bad happen from ignoring it

I can't help that you want to solve "the underlying problem" without even accepting wtf it *actually* is

Can you make half the code Turing and half bitcoin protocol?- there seems to be some loose ends in the code. Maybe you are beating your heads against bitcoin protocol...old code still in komodod....no need to reply
