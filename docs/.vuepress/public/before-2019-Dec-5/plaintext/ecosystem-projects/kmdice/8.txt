Because you can drain the plan, by flooding it with bets faster than it cna process, if the timeout is too low the bettor gets free coins

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe all the entropy or funding TX are locked until the timeout ?

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmmm

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If would ahve put about 3000 utxo into the fund

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not sure... but maybe

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if it was me

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
node is running

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe even 5000

[19-Oct-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and 1000 entropy

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did the faucet on STKDTROLL with 100 utxo so 100 faucet gets can happen per block

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] CrisF#3405
@siu - Chainmakers What did  you mean `its getting drained :/`

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the dice must work similar to that

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not drained, just the utxos seem to be getting locked

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems the issue ..

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] jorian#4555
```TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed
```

[19-Oct-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
snapshot and airdrop time

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
timeout 600 to omuch or amount of utxo needs ot be increased

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
🤦

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
btw seriously just wanted to play here

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] CrisF#3405
How many utxos are there?

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
7

[19-Oct-18 04:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wasnt not trying to break it at all ... we just did a very high risk bet and it broke

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hey, that is the plan, break it... it seems like it broke itself though lol

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
mine are stuck too

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jorian#4555
no we made a shitty chain 😛

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it broke itself, due to being setup incorectly

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no offence

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you didnt knwo

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we never docuemnted it

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] jorian#4555
so we're both to blame

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I had a few hundred eventually.

[19-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if I was not sleeping when you launced this, I would ahve been able to let you know

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but is it the utxo number or the timeout?

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not sure actually

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess no more sleep for me 😂

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its related...

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lol

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can have a long timeout

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have lots of utxo

[19-Oct-18 04:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cc contracts done use the wallet ... so having insanse number of utxo wont slow it down that much at all

[19-Oct-18 04:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I had trouble with less than 10, then got my script working and went sick making utxos.

[19-Oct-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```JSON='"{\"'
JSON2='\":100,\"'

for i in `seq 1 2000`; do
     address="RTVti13NP4eeeZaCCmQxc2bnPdHxCJFP9x"
     JSON+=$address
     JSON+=$JSON2
done
JSON="${JSON%???}}\""
echo $JSON```

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have to do a 3 hour drive now. :/

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then put in sendmany to fund

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in PR .. its that big ?

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how long it takes to get to the city from here ...

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only city 😂

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in 3000 KM

[19-Oct-18 04:31 PM] CrisF#3405
There was another strange thing that happened before we stopped working on dice.

[19-Oct-18 04:32 PM] CrisF#3405
I started losing every bet.

[19-Oct-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know that for sure ... dice needed to be treated with respect .. if you bet too much too quicly it would get very angry and stop working

[19-Oct-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I didnt set up the tables... and never went back to test what caused what ..

[19-Oct-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think lots of utxo and a long timeout will help but its untested theory

[19-Oct-18 04:33 PM] CrisF#3405
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator may have experienced that too.  Not sure though.

[19-Oct-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the odds did seem to get worse as time went on

[19-Oct-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that was mostly due to the timeout

[19-Oct-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was flooding bets so fast it was ending after timeout and paying me the win

[19-Oct-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is why multiple tables runnign dice finish on multiple nodes is needed

[19-Oct-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with smks TUI it could even just randomly choose one

[19-Oct-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of letting you pick

[19-Oct-18 04:35 PM] CrisF#3405
I lost 100  in a row with easy odds.

[19-Oct-18 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i will play later. now testing something very exciting 😃

[19-Oct-18 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  when you get back, I think these guys need help with snapshot and aridrop ... we will see which notary nodes can handle it

[19-Oct-18 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  you cant play

[19-Oct-18 04:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[19-Oct-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even after 20 blocks

[19-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Alright#0419
Are you doing dicestatus on the dealer node?

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will see if after timeout it comes back

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed```

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
you need to cron `dicestatus <diceplan>`

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
on the dealer node

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes wait for 600 blocks from now and see it it unlocks

[19-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Alright#0419
are you doing that?

[19-Oct-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
#chainbreakers 😂

[19-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian is your dealer node croning dicestatus?

[19-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Alright#0419
if not, all bets will time out and win

[19-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Alright#0419
*makes some bets* 😈

{Reactions}
😄 

[19-Oct-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry.. just one thing .. it appeard to break when I did a bet.. wher the pubkey I bet from was diffrent to the pubkey my deamon was running with... and it sent all change to the wrong address .. is there a utxo that I must spend to clain the win ? 
I think this might ahve something to do with it tbh.

[19-Oct-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can someone else please create a dice table on a STKDTROLL and try to replicate that @CrisF ?

[19-Oct-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really want to get back on streamer

[19-Oct-18 04:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jorian is running the dicestatus afaik

[19-Oct-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant make bets @Alright
