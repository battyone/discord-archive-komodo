@kmdkrazy dependencies are there under "Get Komodo binaries" heading following that link.

And yes, at the current state of development FSM branch is being bug fixed.
```
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout FSM
./zcutil/build.sh -j4    <---if you have 4 threads
```
Use the command in the channel description here in discord whilst bug fixing is happening, maybe the node in the docs is out of date.   This will be updated once bugs are fixed for stress testing it.
`./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 &`

got it ooops

[10-Nov-18 11:48 PM] Mylo#8306
and you don't have to build master then switch, you can switch immediately after cloning.   master is just another branch, FSM is just another branch.   It is only a naming convention that `master` is used for the main branch.
no probs

[11-Nov-18 12:06 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I do have a problem building mutiple komodod for mutiple asset chains and using the wrong one at the wrong time - STAKED vs KMDICE -- maybe should consider multiple folders? -- can I rename the folder after cloning or will that break the build?  i guess eventually they will all be master.

[11-Nov-18 12:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or I could build then rename the folder --- and date it!!!

[11-Nov-18 12:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
another folder and launch from it for coins that need that branch

[11-Nov-18 09:26 AM] CrisF#3405
@kmdkrazy  This worked for me
```copy compilied binaries from different branch into different directory and issue calls from there

Example: After compiling komodo using jl777 branch, use:

-------------------------------
cd ~
mkdir jl777
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/jl777/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/jl777/komodo-cli
cd jl777
./komodod ........
-------------------------------

After compiling komodo using dev branch, use:

-------------------------------
cd ~
mkdir dev
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/dev/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/dev/komodo-cli
cd dev
./komodod ........
-------------------------------```

[11-Nov-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That uses up a LOT of space .. it sfare better to do what the `staked` repo does and compile each branch then move the komodod and komodo-ci to somwhere else.

[11-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess that staked repo needs some work, so you can use it for all chains really.

[11-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be able to add te full git path to assetchains.json asewll so it cna clone multiple forks

[11-Nov-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  
https://github.com/StakedChain/PoS_scripts/tree/master/streamer
I think its best if you test this from mastertest branch of staked ... if its working, I will then make a PR to FSM.. Its not a simple job to merge it and I dont have time to merge it and test it all... The chain starts with the correct options on mastertest branch of StakedChain/komodo

`That uses up a LOT of space` yes, a whole 15 cents worth with each iteration

[11-Nov-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont see why you need 100 copies of all the deps, not to mention having to compile them a bunch of times, when you just dont need to

[11-Nov-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked repo is almost fool proof .. although it needs work and updating I admit .. it no longer needs the config.ini as I added setpublkey RPC to fix that problem, and Ive tested that a lot latley and its stable as.

[11-Nov-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
personally, I don't see why you'd need more than 'testing' and 'live' and avoid all the complexity, but sure...

[11-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh we need it too ... so you can have chains with diffrent CC contaracts active

[11-Nov-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise every contract would need its own comand line arg and that is just getting stupid

[11-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is too many command line args to manage already

[11-Nov-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure I follow why you wouldn't just have a hierarchy, work on the bottom and push up (same as james does for komodo)

[11-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you understand why its like that, as it already does this... but making consensus changes on a cluster of chains, and pushing ti to all of them at once... seems very dangerous ... this way we cna update one chain at a time ... and if its proven working and not ging to detroy everything, we cna then merge up. It works well as long as I dont lose track of what changes are where.

resyncing from scratch again, see if this time it works.

[11-Nov-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
updated dealer node with hashtables instead of linear search. now the CPU usage is 1% to 2% with about a 3 second spike to 25% when a new block comes in. of course under heavy load, I expect it will go up in usage. code is now feature complete, including 51% secret reveal protection.
all that is left is to find and fix load caused bugs for the dealer node

[11-Nov-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
even with dealer node offline for a while, as soon as it gets back in sync, it catches up with all the pending bets within a block
