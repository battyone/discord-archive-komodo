what part of "debugging" do you not understand @Alright

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The dealer node should be keeping entropy in a range

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the contrace can fund its own?

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
Ah was thinking that was suggested as permanent solution

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
without a cron

[27-Oct-18 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant have a permanent solution until the problem is fully understood

dealer node should run a blocknotify

[27-Oct-18 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
based on numentropytx, creating enough to get to 100 entropy tx

[27-Oct-18 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if this makes the chain run stable, then we learn what is very likely the problem

[27-Oct-18 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and then we can attempt permanent solutions, but the dealer node doing blocknotify is likely part of the permanent solution

[27-Oct-18 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
at least this is how I would go about solving this, but if you have better ideas, you can try

[27-Oct-18 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but my years of debugging complex things, I always get the broken system back to a working state

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you can flail about with the system in a nonworking state for a very long time

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
think about it

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
each test when the system is in a nonworking state tells you what?

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like testing a car without any oil

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what your looking for

[27-Oct-18 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it will have many problems

[27-Oct-18 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
fixing the flat tire still doesnt fix the car

[27-Oct-18 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so ALWAYS get a broken system back to working ASAP

[27-Oct-18 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
then each test you do will tell you if the new change breaks things or if it is still working

[27-Oct-18 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so in this case, KMDICE is broken as a stable chain

[27-Oct-18 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the first thing to do is get it stable

[27-Oct-18 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
THEN, we worry about the exact issue, as until it is stable we really are just guessing

[27-Oct-18 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
working + test -> working or not working, either way valuable info

[27-Oct-18 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not working + test -> not working or working, only if the latter is anything learned and odds of fixing a problem that you dont fully understand is like trying to win at 1000 odds

[27-Oct-18 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
KMDICE is basically a realtime system

[27-Oct-18 10:55 PM] jl777c#5810
very complex system behavior

[27-Oct-18 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
....

[27-Oct-18 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, if the fix to the consensus bug is known, then just do it

[27-Oct-18 11:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant test anything until there is more entropy

@jorian @siu - Chainmakers

[27-Oct-18 11:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 14, so can do a few bets, but not sure if thats enough to break it

[27-Oct-18 11:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
emptied it to 8 and no problem

[27-Oct-18 11:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
started a bet on 11 entropy and its just stuck on dice status loop.

[27-Oct-18 11:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no Hashblock

[27-Oct-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! so maybe the theory is incorrect!

[27-Oct-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
see

[27-Oct-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
we learned something from the unexpected

[27-Oct-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and when we dont know what is going on, the unexpected is expected

[27-Oct-18 11:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have No Hashblock print, but the txid shown is in the mempool of my node, adn so far the block isnt stuck

[27-Oct-18 11:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait yes... block happened and my node rejected it

[27-Oct-18 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
rebroadcast your transaction

@blackjok3r now your node is forked

[27-Oct-18 11:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it ran out of entropy

[27-Oct-18 11:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt stop it fast enugh

[27-Oct-18 11:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Still strange that when it had 11 it did it also though

[27-Oct-18 11:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Guys im out of my house and i think jorian too

[27-Oct-18 11:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added a `entropytxs` to diceinfo, so youc an script create entropy when it is low

[27-Oct-18 11:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Jorian is the one that can do entropy

[27-Oct-18 11:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its consistantly low

[27-Oct-18 11:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and runnig out

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
just undo the change that jl made that stopped dealer from making them automatically?

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is causing issues, where nodes spend the same entropy tx it seems... maybe even min 10 is too low ... might need to be hundreds

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
the only reason I proposed that was because I wanted dealer to have an option not to put winnings back into the plan

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well, the thing i believe is that if its constantly being spammed it just empties the utxos we send first

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter for KMDICE dealer because all winnings go back into it no matter what

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its not being spammed, the blocks are not even full

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
no spam whatsoever

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Afaik jorian left a script running that sent entropy gradually

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am doign 10 bets to get entroy txs to leves and see where it stops my node

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe the funds are spent already?

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty much if it gets to 0 it forks.

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only jorian knows

[27-Oct-18 11:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but can at other times also'

[27-Oct-18 11:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think the fork happens when multiple people bet on a empty house

[27-Oct-18 11:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Those blocks get orphaned

[27-Oct-18 11:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its pretty much that

[27-Oct-18 11:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

undo those and maybe some commits around that time, and you should never run out of UTXOs

[27-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r could you add an option to dicestatus rpc for that?

[27-Oct-18 11:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But we are adding

[27-Oct-18 11:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are doing about 100 entropy a day

[27-Oct-18 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
what size?

[27-Oct-18 11:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
One dicebet loop can empty that in a few minutes

[27-Oct-18 11:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I told jorian to do it multiple sizes

[27-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Alright#0419
if you undo those commits, it will add entropy each time the house wins

[27-Oct-18 11:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
From .001 to 1

[27-Oct-18 11:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181

dealer should have a choice not to put winnings back into the plan

[27-Oct-18 11:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you want to add true/false to dicestatus (true make more entropy, false dont) ?
