the bets got the `CCduration no hashBlock` when placed like 2-3 hrs ago and they processed and finalized like 10 minutes ago

[04-Nov-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so if there is entropy and there are no forks happening, why is it that the game has been broken?

[04-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@blackjok3r what part of the game got broken with recent code?

[04-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know whats wrong with it .. it was working fine for  days when aI tested it, until the dealer bork from overload... 
I have 1 chain in STAKED cluster that is even with FSM jl777 and its getting dead locks... maybe the dice chain is something similar

[04-Nov-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying to investigate it lol...

[04-Nov-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, cool

[04-Nov-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there seems to be no stuck txs this time

[04-Nov-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and there is no one playing it

[04-Nov-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean, its broken, no one can play 游땍

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That error is usually the dealer not doint his txs

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but why wouldnt it?

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Entropy txs available: 13071

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its just been used too mcuh... there might be a limit to haow many txs the contact  cna handle berofre bogging down

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a lot of entropy

[04-Nov-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
similar to how the wallet.dat breaks when tis liek a GB

[04-Nov-18 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but @jl777c had mentioned that since the cc addresses dont have wallet file, its should not bog down much

[04-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its still got to source the data from somewhere

[04-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its much much fastetr than wallet,.dat

[04-Nov-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but eveything has a limit

[04-Nov-18 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this will need to be studied by @jl777c

[04-Nov-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the "fix" made it worse, so the answer is obviously to remove the "fix"

[04-Nov-18 01:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what really seems to have killed the dealer was the txfee change if understand correctly

[04-Nov-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
All I know for sure is that it went from locking up blocks weren't full to wholly unplayable, not sure what part broke specifically

[04-Nov-18 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
is *vital* for that dealer to be running 24/7

If I was you I would revert to a build before jame schanged the txfee and then resync

[05-Nov-18 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if there is any chance at all, to fix it that will do it... otherwise bet the whole pot on highest odds and elt it time out, and make new tables.
