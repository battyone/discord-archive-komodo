Is this a dealer node issue

[14-Jan-19 10:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@CryptoNinjaa no, i think you are running the daemon without your -pubkey parameter

[15-Jan-19 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
@CryptoNinjaa Try to place bets to KMDICE plan instead of KMDICE2. According to the error I guess KMDICE2 don't have enough entropy UTXOs

Got a win 👌

[15-Jan-19 10:40 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That's enough gambling for one day 7 losses and 1 win 🤣 Granted i increased the odds to 5 for the last few goes

[15-Jan-19 10:40 AM] SHossain#0007
do with 2-3 odds

[15-Jan-19 10:40 AM] SHossain#0007
more chances of win...

[15-Jan-19 10:40 AM] SHossain#0007
if that is what you are after 😛

[15-Jan-19 10:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
im only using small amounts, More of a price for practising haha

[15-Jan-19 10:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Kmdice coupled with a UI like the one above will make this alot of fun

[15-Jan-19 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
there are scripts

[15-Jan-19 10:44 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I tried using deckers last night got it up and running but kmdice dealer wasnt working, the bets just stayed pending. have not tried the gui this morning yet. i will try again

@ciumete i recommend you try a dicestatus or dicefinish call

[15-Jan-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the nodes are up and running with no issue.

[15-Jan-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Tested yesterday and everything was fine.

[15-Jan-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe your bets got lost in translation after the latest update.

[15-Jan-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, something that maybe many people here are not getting is that GUIs will be able to create many different game interfaces and will be able to set house edge themselves. So in this case KMDICE works as a infrastructure blockchain for many businesses to work on top of.

[15-Jan-19 12:54 PM] ciumete#3212
i think my node is out of sync , i delete all, and resync

[15-Jan-19 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need to upgrade to latest

[15-Jan-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There have been many changes in the code I first figured out to make this chain acrtually work. It should handle far higher loads now. The mempool no longer orphans heaps of transactions.

[16-Jan-19 12:34 AM] Mylo#8306
I have a small docker image for dev portal work and single host assetchain creation.   Will make a short howto for kmdice this week for cli and the local webgui for the following

hi, i have a question, can i send kmdice just to my komodoadress?

[16-Jan-19 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, as long as you have the private key for that address, you can later import it to your kmdice wallet @groundhog

[16-Jan-19 12:59 PM] groundhog#0062
@siu - Chainmakers thx

[16-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Catalyst#8405
what is kmdice?

[16-Jan-19 05:32 PM] Catalyst#8405
i don't know much about it. but is it mineable like kmd?

[16-Jan-19 05:32 PM] Catalyst#8405
thanks 😃

@Catalyst Yes, KMDICE is minable like KMD, but it has the same mining schedule as BTC

i think @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 or @CHMEX had something like that.

[17-Jan-19 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just take any calc and swap the diff, reward, and hashrate

[17-Jan-19 12:43 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Do "KMDversion": "0.3.3b" work with KMDice or has to be aother version?

[17-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jusoaresf#3291
"protocolversion": 170007,

[17-Jan-19 01:13 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, 0.3.3b should be used

[17-Jan-19 01:19 PM] jusoaresf#3291

Transaction vin count exceeds max allowed number. The amount you are seeing now might be not precise.

Cool.  I got half way thru my kmdice pool setup today.  Nice to see blocks for it.  I’m gonna point 1ksol and hope for 3 blocks per day

[21-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Meyse#0952
small question, is it already possible to develop for mobile?

[21-Jan-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody has gotten a CC signing for SPV yet

[22-Jan-19 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian could you create a KMDICETEST chain with an identical dealer setup? I would like to do some testing on dice, but don't want to break KMDICE outright if I find something

[24-Jan-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats looks cool @Meyse !
I wonder that we even can use such client with full node on user side since there is no SPV yet. 
Agama have precompiled komodod inside and allows to start needed daemon in very user-friendly way so possible to use it like a "daemon manager" for apps

[24-Jan-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you using some code or it's only picture for now?

[24-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Meyse#0952
this is just pictures

[24-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Meyse#0952
why shouldnt this be possible when running the full blockchain?

[24-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Meyse#0952
this app will probably also function as your wallet

[24-Jan-19 04:02 PM] TonyL#3577
It's possible - why not 😃 
I just mean that realised that the most user-friendly way to make a full node is Agama

[24-Jan-19 04:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Like hub

[24-Jan-19 04:03 PM] Meyse#0952
ah you mean like a hub for all sorts of chains, running different dapps

[24-Jan-19 04:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes - this way no need to embed komodod daemon to each dAPP

[24-Jan-19 04:04 PM] Meyse#0952
i also had this idea actually, one big portal/hub to access all dapps that want to be on it or something. Sort of like a PlayStore or something

[24-Jan-19 04:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Just add chain to Agama and ask user to install Agama and sync in native mode

[24-Jan-19 04:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And in theory we may have separate chains for each game/app to keep it as lightweight as possible.
Casino can keep games chains in cluster and do a crosschain migrations when player swap - something like this.

[24-Jan-19 04:09 PM] Meyse#0952
it needs to be something different then agama though imo, functionality of agama sure, but very different

[24-Jan-19 04:11 PM] Meyse#0952
but yes, there needs to be a package for all these chains/dapps somehow. make it user friendly and easy

[24-Jan-19 04:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Watching your gif and want to play this game! 😃

[24-Jan-19 04:14 PM] Meyse#0952
thanks man, i feel you, i would play this even though i never gambled before, just cause how it would work lol

[24-Jan-19 04:15 PM] Meyse#0952
and play with these coins that are different then fiat, its just a really cool experience i think

[24-Jan-19 04:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's like a casino chips 😃 
I have some codebase for Python Kivy GUI framework + Komodo. If you have the high resolution pics you've used for this gif creation I can make a playable prototype

[24-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Meyse#0952
oh thats pretty cool, i probably need to order some things and then ill send you things!

🔥 

[24-Jan-19 04:21 PM] Meyse#0952
and what is the logic for the dice game? choose 1-6 and then win or lose (odds5) ? add 1 more dice? (odds11)?

[24-Jan-19 04:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, we may start from super easy game: 6 sides dice, player have to guess number  (odds 5)

[24-Jan-19 04:24 PM] TonyL#3577
And super gambler option guess two from two (odds 35)

[24-Jan-19 04:25 PM] TonyL#3577
And then proceed to cards

[24-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Meyse#0952
how do you mean 2 from 2?

[24-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Meyse#0952
like how would that work in practice

[24-Jan-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be two separate `dicebet` on odds 6

[24-Jan-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but it's a good question

[24-Jan-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
No, just one bet with odds 35

[24-Jan-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
And then GUI magic

[24-Jan-19 04:34 PM] TonyL#3577
I mean player have to guess number on dice1 and on dice2 and he win only if guessed right both numbers
1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36
So we can just place single dicebet with odds35

[24-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Meyse#0952
right yes got it
