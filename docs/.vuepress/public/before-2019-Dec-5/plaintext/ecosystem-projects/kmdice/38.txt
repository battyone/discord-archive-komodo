and when that is completely done, open another command prompt and type this in:

[25-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Llama#1330
`komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=KMDICE importprivkey UXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` replace `UXXX `with your privkey

[25-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Llama#1330
and it should return your KMD address.

[25-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Llama#1330
type this in to the 2nd command prompt to see info about your wallet and such: `komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=KMDICE getinfo`

[25-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yes

[25-Oct-18 01:48 AM] Flexatron#8809
The wallet of which you own the private key

[25-Oct-18 01:55 AM] Decker#3767
@hamid502 it's not yet added to Agama. But actually - you don't need Agama to mine KMDICE. You can just use any of your R-addresses from which you have privkey, or you can mine it on R-address related to your Agama's passphrase (it's same as having privkey).

`wins: 78 losses: 196 --> 3680.0`
And remind me, again, why anyone would *buy* these for 72 cents each?

[25-Oct-18 08:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
That's gambling for you.

[25-Oct-18 08:38 AM] ch6ris#5240

So if I been mining dice  to my agama kmd address and update the wallet to get the dice show up will the address I’ve been using work to get the dice to show up?

[25-Oct-18 03:09 PM] HellBlazeSRB#6211
any link on where I can see diff in real time

[25-Oct-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
real-time diff is only able to be displayed by dividing diff1 by the current block target in the blocktemplate, so probably not @HellBlazeSRB

[25-Oct-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but https://dexstats.info/kmdicehash.php is a decent summary

[25-Oct-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hamid502 if you have the privkey, then yes, you'll see it

[25-Oct-18 03:12 PM] hamid502#6386
Ok should I import keys or once everything loaded it should be good

[25-Oct-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'll have to import it

[25-Oct-18 03:13 PM] hamid502#6386
On dice  import or the Komodo?

[25-Oct-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have the key from a KMD address and you want to use it for KMDICE, then yu'll have to import it into KMDICE

[25-Oct-18 03:14 PM] hamid502#6386
Ok got it and can I keep mining with it to ?

[25-Oct-18 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ya, addresses port across almost all assetchains
