and this extra step for dice seems to prevent a 2 second realtime response

[20-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
something more involved like the CHIPS protocol might be needed

[20-Oct-18 01:32 PM] forkwitch#6080
It is interesting, in the atomic reveal process both side must agree on a special blockheight or other blockchain derived static value for a 'atomic reveal appointment'.

[20-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but unless it is a non-interactive process, seems can be stalled. until the nice simple method for this is devised to be 51% proof, it seems KMDICE wont have its full value

[20-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there is 10 million locked away that can fund a reasonable bounty for the solution

[20-Oct-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
sort of an interesting dynamic. i know there is a solution, just will be tricky to do

[20-Oct-18 02:07 PM] forkwitch#6080
You can test: https://pool.forkwitch.com please tell me if diff adjuster is good. Its dynamic now maybe i must tune it a little bit

Who be leading this syphilitic crew of swine faced scallywags?

[20-Oct-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We be looking to roll the bones on our deck and give pirates a chance to play some dice.

[20-Oct-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I.e. - can we put a KMD dice portal on our pirate.black website?

[20-Oct-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts If you build it, they will come

[20-Oct-18 03:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm... my kmdice died. .

[20-Oct-18 03:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyone else with issues?

[20-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jspook16#3059
I don't even have funds to use it

[20-Oct-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a faucet

[20-Oct-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 KMDICE proabbly illegal in us :/

[20-Oct-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Is there something that isn't?

[20-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
reading?

[20-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i know writing is regulated and easily becomes illegal

[20-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
watching TV should be legal as it is approved by the govt

[20-Oct-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
📺 is only legal if signal is obtained my "approved" methods

[20-Oct-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, even TV watching can be illegal. interesting

[20-Oct-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
how can people stand to live in such a place with everything so restricted

[20-Oct-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We go on the interwebz and vent our frustrations on random NPCs

[20-Oct-18 03:45 PM] CrisF#3405
@siu - Chainmakers, mine is working alright.

[20-Oct-18 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it might be a good idea to connect gatewaysCC as soon as it will be well tested: so people will able to deposit directly needed currency via gateway and there will be a tables for these currency tokens

[20-Oct-18 03:47 PM] TonyL#3577
You exchange KMD or BTC on KMD/BTC tokens and gamble with it - need KMDICE only for txfee

[20-Oct-18 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, but for it needed token bets support from dice2 or liquidity providing on KMDICE/BTCtoken KMDICE/KMDtoken tokenbid tokenask markets of assetCC

[20-Oct-18 03:51 PM] TonyL#3577
It would be great if new dice contract will able to do things like a show random number in range - with it we'll able to make guis for any casino game no matter is it bj, slot or craps. It'll give much more freedom than win/lose result

[20-Oct-18 03:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a for blackjack implementation: you have an array with 52 cards - run RNG it choose one from 52, pop card from array, deal to player, run RNG for  51 left, it's choose one, pop it from array deal to player and so on

[20-Oct-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes dice2 betting with tokens should be a requirement

[20-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
Can you reliably know when a notarization will happen? Could dealer just wait until it's about to happen and then reveal entropy?

[20-Oct-18 04:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Can't dealer cheat instead of player in such case?

[20-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Alright#0419
no, hash of entropy is revealed right away

[20-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Alright#0419
if it doesn't match, dealer is obviously cheating

[20-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Alright#0419
I know it might not make much sense, just throwing out ideas here, but is there some way to get notarizations themselves to reveal entropy?

[20-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
so by the time entropy is revealed, it's notarized already

[20-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be that we can just wait for notarization to payout bets

[20-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, not sure I understand

[20-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
if entropy is still revealed in a reorg-able block, won't the problem persist?

[20-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
even if the payout is after the notarization

[20-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
we need some way to make an unconfirmed tx immutable it seems, right?

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why entropy not revealed until after notarization

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so dicebet would include not the actual entropy, but hash of entropy

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, I just realized how simple that is

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
after notarized both parties must reveal or forfeit

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
just don't do dicefinish until the dicebet is notarized

[20-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
correct?

[20-Oct-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but this delays things to the notarization, which is a lot longer than 2 seconds it is now

[20-Oct-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the change that is immune to 51% (but slow) is dicebet uses hash of entropy, dicefinish needs both parties to reveal

[20-Oct-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
a whole lot of work and loses the 2 second realtime feedback, which is pretty cool and addictive

[20-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
Can we change the frequency at which the chain notarizes?

[20-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
what is it currently?

[20-Oct-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess 10, if it was reduced to 3 then it will be faster, but still nothing compared to 2 seconds

[20-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
Yea :/

[20-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
I recall someone mentioning making unconfirmed txs immutable with channels, didn't read into it much though

[20-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
could that be of use? Maybe I misunderstood that entirely though

[20-Oct-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
well the trick that works for channels is exactly the problem

[20-Oct-18 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the secret that is revealed is still valid even after reorg

[20-Oct-18 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the fundamental problem

[20-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
freq 3 would make it even harder to time the reorgs, just saying

[20-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
a lot harder, I struggled to do it at current freq

[20-Oct-18 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007

[20-Oct-18 08:20 PM] vrcninja#5651
Probably a dumb question but is kmdice supported in the agama wallet? How do I generate an address?

[20-Oct-18 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD address will work. it is not yet in Agama

[20-Oct-18 08:31 PM] vrcninja#5651
@SHossain  Thank you.

[20-Oct-18 09:31 PM] vrcninja#5651
I joined the two pools available and in over 40 blocks neither pool has hit a block. That seems strange to me. Where are the blocks going to?

[20-Oct-18 09:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Solo miners?

[20-Oct-18 09:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will check my pool soon just woke up

[20-Oct-18 09:35 PM] vrcninja#5651
Your pool is still producing 30% of the hash so mathematically it should have hit at least 1 block in the last 40 for sure.

[20-Oct-18 09:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... I know its difficulty was too low, I was meant to fix ityesterday but never got home

[20-Oct-18 09:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just fixed the diff ... increased vardiff max to 1024

[20-Oct-18 09:47 PM] vrcninja#5651
Okay, thanks.

[20-Oct-18 09:58 PM] vrcninja#5651
@blackjok3r Did you just take the pool down?

[20-Oct-18 09:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... trying to fix it

[20-Oct-18 09:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should be back up .. incresing min diff didt work, had to make extra port  for high diff

[20-Oct-18 09:59 PM] vrcninja#5651
3067 or 3069 for higher difficulty?

[20-Oct-18 09:59 PM] vrcninja#5651
I'm assuming 69

[20-Oct-18 09:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
69 is high diff

[20-Oct-18 10:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for NH

[20-Oct-18 10:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still testing it

[20-Oct-18 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK pool seems to be fixed... Also removed the 1% fee... which I didnt know was there, and isnt even paying to my address @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  I think you might have some free KMDICE in the staked pool rewards address.

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Llama#1330
so is this like a gambling dapp?

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very basic though.

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still mighty cool

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Llama#1330
just dice

[20-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Llama#1330
?

[20-Oct-18 10:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[20-Oct-18 11:03 PM] vrcninja#5651
Now the blocks are flowing.

[20-Oct-18 11:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it seemed a problem somehow with the fee .. it was making invalid blocks

[20-Oct-18 11:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once I removed that it works fine

[20-Oct-18 11:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what caused it to change as it was working yesterday just fine

[21-Oct-18 03:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi @SHossain if there is no logo it will show error on image in barterdex 
Just make a temp image with word kmdice. Anything. Just match the size of image. Check example supernet asset image.
