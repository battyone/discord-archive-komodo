it keeps just getting to 14 and staying there

Gambling can be very compulsive, Whales could lose huge amounts in hours.

[28-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ch6ris#5240
no idea, time will tell.

[28-Oct-18 11:53 AM] blubbi#0643
can someone link me the win version of dice again pls?

[28-Oct-18 11:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not sure why the entropy txs dont come back...

It should be trivial to blcokcnotify a reil script using the dicestatus call ...

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however the bet pending still exists

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not every time ...

[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems maybe I fixed the issue where it forks/gets stuck but its created a new issue

[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its so diffucult to say with low entropy txs

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but we have sent thousands of entropy txs

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why are they being spent so fast?

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
crazy betting

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`why are they being spent so fast?`
because more than 1 person is playing

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
20 bets per hour -> 1000+

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
20 bets per block

[28-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
-> 1200 per hour

[28-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what is the command to creat entropy tx's we need the blockcnotify script ASAP here really I cant test anything, definatly having poblems still

[28-Oct-18 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the fact that the mempool isn't properly being scraped and some txes have 'depends' as high as 45 isn't helping, either

[28-Oct-18 12:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jorian afaik has a script in place.

[28-Oct-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, I stopped it from forking, but mempools are stil broken

[28-Oct-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was working for me earlier because there was nonone else betting

[28-Oct-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If 2 nodes choose same entropy, which ever tx is accepted into the mempool first on a node is there, and the other one is rejected

[28-Oct-18 12:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, im running the FSM branch now

[28-Oct-18 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then the node is stuck waiting for something... that shows this message:
`CCduration no hashBlock for txid`

[28-Oct-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure FSM branch is right either... I just changed it on my repo, but it seems much the same

[28-Oct-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I definatly had some wrong code in the PR james merged earlier

[28-Oct-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now when a block is confirmed, the tx in the mempool that is invlaid should be removed right?

[28-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[28-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
checks need to be made for orphaned tx in the rpc calls

[28-Oct-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`Now when a block is confirmed, the tx in the mempool that is invlaid should be removed right?`
what happens if that tx is # 12 of a tx with 19 depends?

[28-Oct-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes thats whats happening, I added them to my script but that only triggers at one exact place

[28-Oct-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the problem can arise at others awell

[28-Oct-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no experiance with entropy txs... ar they a sendmany or all a serperate txid?

[28-Oct-18 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@forkwitch and whoever else is running pools need to set minblocksize and scrape to pool

share it around.

[28-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
until more than 8 people can play at once, I'm not sure sharing is of any point

Maybe it can choose entropy in mempool and then validate cant validate it

[28-Oct-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because of my change

[28-Oct-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
invistigating this now... it should only return confirmed entropy txs

[28-Oct-18 12:25 PM] ch6ris#5240
The GUI does nothing for me, am I doing something wrong?

[28-Oct-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its locked up again

[28-Oct-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its fine with 1 or 2 users... but add more and itbreaks... now @siu - Chainmakers  could do an Alright and make 20,000 entropy txs and it would workfor a while likely

[28-Oct-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but eventually still stop

[28-Oct-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@ch6ris there's only a tiny amount of bets that can be made at one time, and since pools aren't processing bets you just have to keep trying

[28-Oct-18 12:27 PM] ch6ris#5240
Ok following, just scrolled up a bit to catch up, thank you.

[28-Oct-18 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but the entropy txs get spent no matter what? I mean, even if the player loses, the bet doesnt become a entropy txs?

[28-Oct-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There was a way that the node made its own... but Alright amde james remove it for some reason I still dont quite understand ... but we created a solution for that where you need to run blocknotify

[28-Oct-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I will need to write the script if no one else is going to do it :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please do.

[28-Oct-18 12:30 PM] ch6ris#5240
Yes please do all the work, no questions asked, then you can demand reimbursement from the community or threaten to fork. :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 12:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im still not sure what you are referring to with blocknotify

[28-Oct-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe the pools also NEED this new verison ?

[28-Oct-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cna do it... i just dont know how to add funds

[28-Oct-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cant be that hard

[28-Oct-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getblocktemplate | jq '.transactions | length'
42`
and
`Height     Age     Transactions     Mined by     Size
15490     a few seconds ago     3         2931`
Is still going to be an issue with any real adoption even with 25000 UTXOs in the contract

[28-Oct-18 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possibly a consensus change and hard fork that I made

[28-Oct-18 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as the entropytx now needs to be confirmed before dicevalidate passes

[28-Oct-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the pool could be making blocks, with entropy that are in mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm

[28-Oct-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My first PR was wrong I think as well.. maybe its not, but there was a heap of stupid code that didnt nede to be there that maybe didnt even work

[28-Oct-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just because I was able to et against myself 300 times, doenst mean it fixed anything as no one else was betting

[28-Oct-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in order to work well, even with "fixes", there's got to be at least 40% of the hashrate in a pool that's going to actually process txes; otherwise, it's just going to pile up and the same result will just be from a different cause

[28-Oct-18 12:37 PM] jorian#4555
The node is becoming unresponsive when doing a dicestatus

[28-Oct-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Did you update it ?

[28-Oct-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found running too many dicebet scripts at once, would lcok it aswell

[28-Oct-18 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which calls dicestatus

[28-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo.git -b FSM`

[28-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe try that one one the dealer node ..

[28-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[28-Oct-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are most likely too many ppl on the old version adn the pool... also there is no entropy constnatly... I also *think* the function that returns entropy is always just selecting the first one it sees, where it probably should randomly choose one to avoid conflicts ?

[28-Oct-18 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I need somethig like my utxo selection code I used in iguana 游뱂

[28-Oct-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes random selecting would be much better

[28-Oct-18 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats a much better solutiona and would help a lot... We are astartiong a test chain on staked so we can actually test stuff, I will amke PR again when finished and give blocknotify script

[28-Oct-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
random selection of 1 out of 1 will still select 1

[28-Oct-18 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... which is why that will be the last thing I try to fix 游땏

[28-Oct-18 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
number 1 there is entropy

[28-Oct-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
number 2, 2 nodes can flood dice bet at once

[28-Oct-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
3 randomly choose entropy

[28-Oct-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`yes ... which is why that will be the last thing I try to fix :smile:
number 1 there is entropy`
both cannot be true 游땧

[28-Oct-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blocknotify scrpipt that works is number 1 priority...

[28-Oct-18 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont want to just amke it work by brute forceing entropy txs ... that doesnt help a lot

[28-Oct-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a feeling that just the change i made that makes entropy need to be confirmed, on the MINER will help a lot

[28-Oct-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
blocknotify scrpipt only help if the block contains more than 2 txes (for the 100000000000000000th time)

[28-Oct-18 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
blocknotiy just keeps entropy at X

[28-Oct-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the main thing is to make the miner mien the blocks, if it still cant, the the mempool is accepting txs that are invlaid

[28-Oct-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`the main thing is to make the miner mien the blocks`
ok, you're 1/2 way to understanding what I'm saying, at least
the main thing is to make the miner mine the blocks **with transactions in the block**

[28-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... and your are saying that min block size is forcing the mempool into the block?

[28-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or its just waiting until it has enough valid txs?

[28-Oct-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and still leaving a bunch behind?

[28-Oct-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Gavin Andresen did a lot of good things in his time but some of the code in 0.9 created problems just like this
`accept-into-block
Require that miners set -mintxfee, -minblocksize, etc; refuse to mine if they do not. WHY: decentralize decisions about fees/block sizes/etc.`
by default, a node will not pack the template unless you force it to

[28-Oct-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and that theory has never changed (even with the removal of minblocksize in current bitcoin)

[28-Oct-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
default bitcoin node will never produce a full block

[28-Oct-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... streamer and that do , and I never set any of those
