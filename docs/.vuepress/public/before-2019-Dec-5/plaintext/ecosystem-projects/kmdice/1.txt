```From my testing on DICEv1 anyone looking to improve it needs to start with the following:
1) Show if the contract has entropy TX in diceinfo 
2) Have a table end parameter on table creation, where the dice contract expires and the funds can be withdrawn by the creator
3) Figure some solution to scale, a single table can only take so many parallell bets before it just stops working. 
4) Make a GUI to make it easier for people to play
5) Some early ideas for 51% attack problem:
The 51% problem is low chance with close enough dPoW freq... we were gong to try and notarise the chain every 2 blocks as a hacky way to solve it, this could also be solved, by having a single miner, like I have done with STREAMER chain, and have all coins mined out of the faucet.
Or if you want to bet with real money, use a sister chain, where coins are mined bought and MoMoM migrate them to the DICE chain to play dice.```

richlist is always nice. even for PIRATE 😛

@TonyL @Mihailo @dukeleto we are working on getting some bounties ready for help and development of kmdice, would be nice for you guys to test CC and look to solve the basic issues

[18-Oct-18 11:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
Is this Dice CC? Are there any known issues by now?

[18-Oct-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Check pins

[18-Oct-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They are ot bugs.... problem with how the contract works all together

[18-Oct-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The MAIN issue, is ther CC_EVAl can ONLY print data to stderr

[18-Oct-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than retunr to CLI JSON

[18-Oct-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is an issue with ALL CC contracts I have used

[18-Oct-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Making useful dapps can be very hard with no/ambigious errors

[18-Oct-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it needs a withdraw

[18-Oct-18 11:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Or a house edge that can be transfered to a specific pubkey

[18-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, basically I also wanted to solve that somehow as all CC print error in komodo daemon and not returning error on RPC command. It is because if CC function is successful then it returns tx hex but if not then it must return "". As if the string is not empy it can be hex... We can see how to pass the error back so all CC can print error on RPC command.

[18-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
ability to cheat one's own entropy will accomplish the same thing as withdraw

[18-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
so to withdraw, you'd just cheat your own dice plan over and over

[18-Oct-18 11:32 AM] jorian#4555
how would you cheat your own entropy?

grind entropy tx until you get whatever level of winner you want

[18-Oct-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
shouldnt be too hard

[18-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
you guys going to hate me if I get really "lucky" and drain the dice plan?

[18-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
Alright can be the house, don't worry 😛

[18-Oct-18 12:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
since we dont have any financial gain or investment on this... you can try

[18-Oct-18 12:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and if you do, you can become the house i guess

[18-Oct-18 12:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or just redeposit the funds to the same plan :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
just looked at the max odds and max bet, I'd only have to do the reorg thing a couple times to drain the whole plan

[18-Oct-18 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
10 times 1000 coins at 1500:1

[18-Oct-18 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so 10k coins at 10.5k:1

[18-Oct-18 12:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
try

[18-Oct-18 12:07 PM] CrisF#3405

[18-Oct-18 12:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
first of all you need 1000 coins to do just one bet... which as of now is pretty hard.

[18-Oct-18 12:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah

[18-Oct-18 12:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if you break the contract you should be able to get 50% of supply

[18-Oct-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
huge marketing point 😃

attack vector is publicly known already

@jl777c is that buy offer valid if I drain the plan?

awesome, thanks

[18-Oct-18 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The game changer here imo is that when tests were done, the chains had almost infinite supply and not much hashrate

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when you have access to so much supply, i can guess its easier to break the bet

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if supply is scarce and hard to mine, it may be harder.

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just my 2 cents... but lets see what happens.

[18-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
if maxbet or maxodds was lower I'd need to do it a lot more times to drain it entirely

[18-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
need to do it 7 times to drain it with current values

[18-Oct-18 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
do it. we watch 🍿

[18-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
so maybe snapshot, airdrop to new chain and change maxodds maxbet?

[18-Oct-18 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ehmm, no! 😂

[18-Oct-18 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
no?

[18-Oct-18 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
😛

[18-Oct-18 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why would i change the values now?

[18-Oct-18 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
to make it harder to drain plan

you are assuming that ther are rules

if its going to be broken, it better be early, before this becomes something

diff doesn't mean much; at`"difficulty": 308548890.9157318` (897x KMDICE diff), one can easily rent enough hash to hit many blocks in a row (or even all but NN blocks for hrs)
