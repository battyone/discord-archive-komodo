about 100k coins have been drained. 70% of those are in this address.

[05-Nov-18 07:18 PM] Llama#1330
how are they being drained?

[05-Nov-18 07:19 PM] Decker#3767
seems this RBhtg has a good patience ))

[05-Nov-18 07:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
since the house address got corrupted by the changes in the code and the bombarding with spam txs, the fund is designed to give a player an automatic win if the house doesnt complete the bet

[05-Nov-18 07:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or the play

[05-Nov-18 07:21 PM] Llama#1330
oh

[05-Nov-18 07:21 PM] Llama#1330
how is it being fixed?

[05-Nov-18 07:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are going to do a new chain

[05-Nov-18 07:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This one will be used for laboratory purposes to see what went wrong and how it can evaded in the future.

[05-Nov-18 07:22 PM] ciumete#3212
u public the final snapshot ?

[05-Nov-18 07:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[05-Nov-18 07:23 PM] ciumete#3212
the snapshot will be for all transaction who have a minimum 1 confirmation ?

[05-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Llama#1330
I just want to be able to send my kmdice

[05-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Llama#1330

[05-Nov-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
at least all the miners seem to know about the snapshot. problem is most seem to have bailed out, stuck at 26983

[05-Nov-18 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
diff stranded

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
So uhhh

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the snapshot is as of that height

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
you guys taking my coins?

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
Don't really mind tbh, just curious what the deal is

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it was announced not to abuse the dealer node

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
Well I was the one that found it was broken

[05-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
didn't intentionally abuse it

[05-Nov-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the coins that were obtained before the announcement will be allowed

[05-Nov-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems fair

[05-Nov-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i suggested to extend it to allow miners to know about it and not waste hashrate

[05-Nov-18 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the node isn't being "abused"
it's broken and keeps randomly paying out for no apparent reason

[05-Nov-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so the timeouts after the 26401 will not be counted, but mining to 27000 will be counted

[05-Nov-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the past spamming got the node into a state where it cant process bets

[05-Nov-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
from the 1st snapshot, it seems I have ~29k that "came from nowhere" at random 5-7 tx intervals

[05-Nov-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
likely timeouts from 600 blocks prior

[05-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
my listtransactions is showing tonnes of 0 conf transactions

[05-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Alright#0419

[05-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why

[05-Nov-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
once the chain migrates to the new KMDICE, I will investigate what is going wrong with the dealer node. it seems some sort of memory overflow

[05-Nov-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
approx 60k KMDICE was obtained due to dead dealer node before the 26400, which is almost 2 days mining output

[05-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a decent bug bounty

[05-Nov-18 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
has ~half of that 60k :S

[05-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
also with the new KMDICE please dont spam it until I find and fix the cause for the dealer node issues

[05-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
normal betting should work much better with the latest version, but my guess is the overflow bug is still there

willing to give some more of these coins to a "dev fund" if we have a need

[05-Nov-18 07:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is the other address, i believe this is Alrights address

[05-Nov-18 07:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well, ok... this is the thing... new chain will have a dev fund

[05-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
ok so is the balance of that address changing?

[05-Nov-18 07:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
all above the 10million mark will be moved to chainmakers multisig address to be used for development and bounties.

[05-Nov-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems to be stuck at at the same balance

[05-Nov-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
define "spam"....
I think the *fastest* my script ever played was 1 bet every 5 secs (because it never confirms faster than that)

[05-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
chain is stuck, at current hashrate will likely take hours per block

[05-Nov-18 07:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but since there is no blocks being mined, txs are no confiming

[05-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i think snapshot the current block, we wont be seeing new blocks for a long time

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
spam would be any amount of bets that cant be processed in time

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
spam is not the right word

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Decker#3767
i can little bit boost hashrate for a few minutes, if needed ...

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Decker#3767
possible ...

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
17 blocks not really needed, close enough to 27k, isnt it?

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
"spam" -> "overload"

[05-Nov-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`spam would be any amount of bets that cant be processed in time`
well, fek, for the last week, that's anything > 1 bet per day :trollface:

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think the only 2 addresses having most of the funds after the node broke where from @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉  and @Alright i know none of them have malicious intent

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the combined activity of all the dicebet got the dealer node into a bad state

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
actually @Alright was the one who notified us and was helping us.

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] ciumete#3212
better do now the snapshot if the blockchain is stuck, no need to waste boost hashrate

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
with memory access troubles, indicative of some internal buffer overflowing

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming I can duplicate it, i will fix it tomorrow

[05-Nov-18 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
I thought it was fixed and had mentioned it to genie. Wouldn't have said anything if I realized it was still broken

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
jorian had restarted the dealer and it started working for a few minutes

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be fixed

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the thing was that genie did 0.1 bets at 1500 odds... which returned him 150 KMDICE per block for the last 24 hours or so... which is quite a lot.

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for a fresh node with the latest codefixes

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Decker#3767
i think better to do all "spamming" tests on a test chain ... we don't need to do experiments that hurts house / chain on main chain.

[05-Nov-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that the dealer node went through all the bets with different versions running

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there will be a time for a load test

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but when a small number of bets overloads, that is not yet the time to break it even more

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
without the spamming and the changes we would have not got to this, so i guess that is good in a way.

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And we actually dared people to break it

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
I will also optimize the dealer node handling so it can handle totally full blocks

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Decker#3767
we can easily launch DICETST for tests with the same params as the real chain and do any kind of tests on it ...

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is good we found these limits

[05-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Alright#0419
Joker and I have noticed that if you use *every* entropy UTXO available in a block, you always win

[05-Nov-18 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
although i think the ultimate breaking point was the changes @jl777c did heheh

[05-Nov-18 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`which returned him 150 KMDICE per block for the last 24 hours or so... which is quite a lot`
1) it wasn't "per block"
2) I told you that I have no clue where it came from, so if it's from time-outs, or whatever, take the 29k back out of the 2nd snapshot

[05-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419

[05-Nov-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the latest version should orphan bets, but clearly there are some load based issues, and running out of utxo issues

[05-Nov-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
is it that if all utxo are used up, the dealer node gets confused and doesnt see some dicebet and it times out?

[05-Nov-18 08:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What we could do is use these funds or part of them (the ones from draining the fund these last hours) and do an airdrop to KMD holders

[05-Nov-18 08:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that way we get everyone to give it a test in the new chain.

[05-Nov-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
sure

[05-Nov-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
is not many coins compared to KMD's supply though

i guess at least 0.05 or 0.10 for eachone is enough.

[05-Nov-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
110k KMDICE -> 1:1000 KMD would at least get people a taste of the KMDICE

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 im not assuming you screwed someone, that is not the point.

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so 100 KMD ends up with 0.1
