just take a bit more than 5 to 10 seconds.

[11-Nov-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
post in realtime after your dicebet

[11-Nov-18 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
raising the sleep between submitting the bet till calling status to 15 seconds is getting much better results

[11-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to handle the case of your dicebet being orphaned, being refunded, in addition to winning or losing

[11-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
only several bets are not processed, these due to various orphan type of edge cases, but they will eventually get refunded, or timeout

[11-Nov-18 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, automatically?>

[11-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind using the mempool opens up a lot more possible cases

[11-Nov-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it should handle things automatically, but could still have bugs

[11-Nov-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, but for all the bets done, i have gotten only one orphaned

[11-Nov-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are seeing a long delay?

[11-Nov-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe with a slow connection, things are slow

[11-Nov-18 01:45 PM] WayneDingo#1455

the bet still pending do go through its just that it takes a bit more time, could be connectivity issues.

how in the holy hell is it possible that **no one** has fixed the profit switching in nomp/znomp/knomp/snomp/dafuqevernomp in the entire time since it was 1st added in Apr 12, 2014

[11-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 same way as nobody fixed varint )

[11-Nov-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Decker varint was one of those "only at certain times" things that few (if any) noticed; in the history of NOMP and all its forks, the switch ports have never displayed properly and many, many, many people know it

[11-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nomp is poorly wirtten and stupid from ny expreiance with it so far :trollface:

[11-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[11-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually nomp is better than znomp in many ways 😛

[11-Nov-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
litterally makes 0 sense... I guess it was written like this for some rason, and it works...

[11-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so nobody bothered to change it

[11-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes this is znomp ... refers to the algi equihash as sha256 in places 🤷

[11-Nov-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[11-Nov-18 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Win 1 from 300 on odds 150 is ok

[11-Nov-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes with 1 min blocks 800 tx is like 8000tx for bitcoin block

[11-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and btc doesnt get that many

[11-Nov-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but as long as dealernode isnt saturated, it can handle more bets per block. my estimate is that things can get to a saturated mempool and dealer node will still be able to keep up, but the bottleneck becomes the blockchain capacity. for normal betting this is handling a lot of end users betting
