get listed on blocktivity!

[23-Oct-18 11:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think KMDICE can become one of the chains with most tx

[23-Oct-18 11:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i sent email but no answer

[23-Oct-18 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
find who on the team has a contact

[23-Oct-18 11:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[23-Oct-18 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
would be hilarious to see more KMDICE tx than on BTC

[23-Oct-18 11:59 PM] Llama#1330
lol

[24-Oct-18 12:05 AM] Llama#1330
should I be aiming for a high number of utxo's?

[24-Oct-18 12:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Try to get smaller utxos too

[24-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Llama#1330
i have like 90

[24-Oct-18 12:07 AM] c2k#4915
smaller for trading kmdice on bdex ...like what size do you think is optimal?

[24-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
why not just standardize on the trading utxo size?

[24-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
say 100 KMDICE utxo

[24-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then make 100 and 115 sized utxos for the bobs

[24-Oct-18 12:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please. Make 1 and 5 utxos too hehe

[24-Oct-18 12:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For the poor

[24-Oct-18 12:12 AM] Llama#1330

Can't wait for a GUI for KMDICE so I can spend my mining rewards on some gambling

[24-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Bakes#0367
my CLI skills are terrible at best, tried following the command line instructions in here but my basic skills are too shallow.

[24-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Bakes#0367
As soon as one is ready I have plenty of KMDICE to test with

Anyone does the bet 1 lose bet 2 lose bet 4 lose bet 8 until he wins his losses back and then starts at 1 again?:trollface: :abusedsmily:

[24-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Flexatron#8809
anyone risks high numbers to win high?

[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
Who else closes the GUI after winning "too many times" to "reset" the odds ??:trollface:

[24-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Flexatron#8809
The first dice winning strategy is the *Martingale*, which is easy to understand and learn, as this is one of the most popular strategies for dice. The first thing you need to do is to bet a single unit and stick with it until you lose. And when you lose, double your wager. Once you get a win, you go back to your original wager. Doing this heightens your chance of getting your losses back.

One more dice winning strategy that is similar to Martingale is the *D’Alembert*. The only difference is that you only increase your bet amount by x1 when you lose on a roll and decrease it by one when you win.

Another tactic that you can use in your Bitcoin dice game is the *Paroli*. In this strategy, you start with the bet of your choice. When you win on that bet, you can double your next bet until either you lose on the next bet or you are in a winning streak. When either of the two happens, you can rest your bet amount. This is less risky than Martingale and D’Alembert, since the aim of this strategy is to take advantage of the lucky streaks.

[24-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Oszy#5734
@Flexatron  I have simulated Martingale and Fibonacci over 10000 turns each multiple times, the chances that you are actually winning a little bit after 10000 turns are very slim

@And1_89 it's unfinished yet ... when first alpha will available - i will post a link ...

wait is kmdice on barterdex?

[24-Oct-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181

feature request, auto updates

[24-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah new update released 9 days ago, that's what I get for not paying attention.

[24-Oct-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
is anybody other than blackjok3r seeing their node go on a fork

[24-Oct-18 10:49 AM] ch6ris#5240
ahh fetchcoinsdb did the trick either way.

[24-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Decker#3767
@jl777c i found some of my nodes stucked tonight, also, i saw following case many times:
1. making a bet
2. CCduration no hashBlock for txid <txid> appears in komodod output (dicestatus returns "bet still pending")
3. after that it can stuck at block on which we make a bet.

[24-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
can you isolate the cause? no hashBlock for txid means it somehow does not know what block the txid is in...

[24-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it could well be related to gettransaction not working for mempool tx

[24-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what branch are you on?

[24-Oct-18 10:57 AM] Decker#3767
`dev`

[24-Oct-18 10:59 AM] Decker#3767
i'm always use the following steps:
```
rawtx=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicebet $name $fundingtxid $amount $odds | jq -r .hex)
txid=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE sendrawtransaction $rawtx)
sleep 5
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus $name $fundingtxid $txid```

and some times it runs perfect, and sometimes produce `CCduration no hashBlock for txid <txid>` after sendrawtransaction.

[24-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Decker#3767
no other changes, always same steps ... but sometimes it's ok, and sometimes after sendrawtx i get "no hashBlock for txid".

[24-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Decker#3767
except this thing, all other - seems stable.

[24-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, dev branch doesnt have the gettransaction problem, this seems some timing issue?

[24-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
we need a way to avoid this condition or some way to fix this condition

[24-Oct-18 11:04 AM] CrisF#3405

[24-Oct-18 11:11 AM] ch6ris#5240
There's a faucet?

[24-Oct-18 11:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[24-Oct-18 11:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c i had that same issue decker describes yesterday on dev branch

[24-Oct-18 11:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I thought it had to do we me trying to start a swap at the same time

[24-Oct-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is one theory, but if decker gets it without mm, it could just be some local tx activity pattern that triggers it

[24-Oct-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly this is a bad bug, needs to be isolated and fixed

[24-Oct-18 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r and I had this `bet still pending` error right from early on.  There are messages about it from Saturday 👆

[24-Oct-18 11:17 AM] ch6ris#5240
Are you talking about faucetget

[24-Oct-18 11:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[24-Oct-18 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I stopped getting it but haven't been testing for the last few days.

[24-Oct-18 11:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @ch6ris, no I get a different error there, but I didn't try with a new address.

[24-Oct-18 11:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You need a brand new address to get coins from the faucet

[24-Oct-18 11:19 AM] Oszy#5734
It needs a fresh address according to CC

y recent push to FSM might help, you can set pubkey in runtime

[24-Oct-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so start daemon, create address

Wts kmdice for kmd. Pm me :)

[24-Oct-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then set pubkey without restart

[24-Oct-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can only be done once though
