ok

[29-Oct-18 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just tested with latest block and it didnt work as expected

[29-Oct-18 12:55 PM] SHossain#0007
That was a tips from @CHMEX

[29-Oct-18 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[29-Oct-18 12:55 PM] SHossain#0007
first time with latest block number may hang (highly likely)

[29-Oct-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i have tested by increasing 100000 block at a time and it worked like a charm

after update

[29-Oct-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_gets that without the update_

[29-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
coinsupply does a complete rescan to the specified block

[29-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
how long do you expect a rescan to take?

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also am getting cosntant CCDuration fails, depsit not being on a fork.

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just about to start testing/debuggig mempool fix

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope it works, seemed far too easy tbh .. Just defined a second mempool and iterated all entries into it

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
clear

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then back again lol

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, there's plenty in the mempool to pick from 😛

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I flooded it to shit

[29-Oct-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry, but trying to fix it here

[29-Oct-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem btw is that the CC chains unload the incoming block into mempool, so the mempool has to be cearled of txs as if a conflicting one happens, then the block is invalideted by the local mempool. and tx just disapear, causing allkinds of strange behaviours.

[29-Oct-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I stopped mining when the diff went back up to almost KMD range a a block of 484 txes got orphaned for 5 🙄

[29-Oct-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... hope fully this fix works...

[29-Oct-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then pools might acutally build big blocks...

[29-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but even if you CAN force that to happen, the contract is still broken and cannot see those txs

[29-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You said this to me yourself just today... helped a lot working out the problem btw, thanks

[29-Oct-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 2 issues are only 1/2 related

[29-Oct-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there needs to be a fix for when the mempool is large, that is separate from the fact that the pool is *currently* large because @forkwitch has his daemon running in default-mode (which intentionally processes as little info as possible to create a better experience for a "normal" user that doesn't need to fill up RAM with 500 tx that aren't theirs and they don't need to know about)

[29-Oct-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, that pool needs to be fixed asap... It works btw ...

Seems to work at least... now if only I could force it to do its forking thing again ...

[29-Oct-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the dealer node is dead... nothing is getting dice finish... likely too many txs

[29-Oct-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might have crashed it ? @jorian  @siu - Chainmakers

[29-Oct-18 02:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jorian is the one that knows

[29-Oct-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its working as expected ...

[29-Oct-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Changed utxo selection back to olth method where every node chooses the first entropy. Both nodes spamming dicebet every 2 seconds.

[29-Oct-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
After block arrives 30-40 txs are orphaned and the dicebet script sees they are gone upong tryong to rebradcast, reports and sends a new transaction. So far no crashes or forks 😄

[29-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`reports and sends a new transaction.`
If the "new" tx isn't validated as a bet, then there's not point in creating it

[29-Oct-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am trying to make invalid transactions and fork myt two nodes... dont give two shits for the coins

[29-Oct-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so far its not allowing a fork... and is clearing invalid txs each block welll

[29-Oct-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Wihtout the change to entropy selection, dice contract will still brak with 3-4 player playing at once.

[29-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they all choose the same entropy for some time frame, as the list doesnt not seem to update i real time.

[29-Oct-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, but what I mean is then when you push PR, don't forget to remove any tx created that is just the user paying the house 'jus cuz' 😝

[29-Oct-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure once a block arrives any txs that were invalid will orphan and the coins return to your wallet

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[29-Oct-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The utxo selection for CC contracts is not designed for spamming the crap out of it on multiple nodes at once... I changed all of it though today to amke it easier to test. 
For entropy it wont let you send, unless the total is over 100, but thousands is even better, then it chooses randomly one of them. 
For local wallet I did same algo, but it checks if you have over 200 utxo in your wallet before applying random filter... ended up removing this though as I expect it to cause issues for peopel who dont understand utxo's ...

[29-Oct-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and its not like anyone should be sending CC transactions every second

[29-Oct-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for hours i a row 😛

[29-Oct-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and its not like anyone should be sending CC transactions every second`
You're just running bets without checking status before the next bet?

[29-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No I am using a script that sends bet, then polls status until a result or a fail....

[29-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing is getting past status atm

[29-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so to test the mempool fix im just spamming bets

[29-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the same entropy utxo on 2 nodes/wallets

[29-Oct-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
status takes more than 1 sec (which is the part that cornfuzzed me about that comment)

[29-Oct-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also found once the wallet gets to like 2000 dust utxo, sending CC txjust fails... doenst work... constant -25 errors

[29-Oct-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
status is not returnig here at all any more

[29-Oct-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not for a few hours, I think the dealer node has crashed... which wouldnt surprise me

[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`status is not returnig here at all any more`
HERE EITHER, BUT i MENAT WHEN IT IS WORKING

[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sry caps lock accident

[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lowered script status poll to 120s apart per bet tx

[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its made no diffrence

[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when dealer is working, my sleep is @ 4.5

[29-Oct-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
normanlly had it at 10s ... The entire thing is imporved about 100x since the first few days though.

[29-Oct-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when the dealer hasnt been killed by me

[29-Oct-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is why you have multiple tables, so the load is spread over multiple dealer nodes... they can only process 1 dicefinish per second

[29-Oct-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
found it in the code

[29-Oct-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It is multi threaded somwehere though, so might be faster than that not sure

[29-Oct-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure i should bother testing this much further im just killing it terribly now...

[29-Oct-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from what I read, you're pretty much at a standstill until dealer node works 😕

[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... I think I should stop loading its dicequeue with thousands of dicebet txs ..

[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the mempool fix is working just fine

[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any testing is likely to produce invalid results at this point

[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes actually testing the dice contract is pointeless

[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I have confirmed that 2 nodes cannot accept conflicting mempools now so removed hte connsensus isssue, which likely affects all CC's

[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Now its as Alright said, and the valid ones are chosen by the miner

[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
onc block arrival, all mempool is saved, cleared, block processed then mempool copies back in, rejecting all invalid txs

[29-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like a mempool sanitizer

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
here in a bit, I'm going to throw up an alpha pool and test it a bit, then folks can mine it in beta and hopefully that will help the live portion of the mempool (if your backlog fix works, even better)

[29-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Will clean up the code and submit PR to replace the hack from earlier

[29-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we can test it properly with more nodes..

Lucky someone did some Z-TX on this chain early on... the  only problem with the mempool sanitiser is z-tx checks fail so needed to add an optional boolean to AcceptToMemoryPool

[29-Oct-18 04:51 PM] idrtis#7552
what happens if I bet and lose? are the lost coins added back to the pool?

[29-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
@idrtis they're added back to the house's funds

[29-Oct-18 04:57 PM] idrtis#7552
i think it would have been better to make the dice rigged to give a chance of winning the game 50.001% or something minimally higher . Hodlers, miners would understand that in the long run they would lose in relative terms, everyone would gamble it would become a wild west shit show.

[29-Oct-18 04:58 PM] idrtis#7552
people would write bots to gamble in small amounts to make the winning edge appear. normal people would see this and rush to gamble before bot herds are able to accumulate

[29-Oct-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get 50% chance with odds of 1

[29-Oct-18 05:00 PM] idrtis#7552
i am saying game theory would be more interesting. Dont get me wrong, it is still fun.

[29-Oct-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
house having 0% edge is unique

[29-Oct-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and the highest sustainable payout

[29-Oct-18 05:02 PM] idrtis#7552
i am talking about house having negative edge. because no one has the keys or access to those funds it wouldnt matter. And it would incentivize people to gamble like crazy

[29-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
negative edge will run out at some point

[29-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would act a bit like mining, but the house having such large bankroll makes it pretty interesting

[29-Oct-18 05:04 PM] idrtis#7552
yeah. when it looks like runing out maybe direct % of block reward to house fund or make a coin swap to another blockchain game

[29-Oct-18 05:05 PM] idrtis#7552
promote craziness

[29-Oct-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
a negative edge chain would get drained and then not be viable. seems short sighted to make it a matter of time before its drained, doesnt seem a good long term setup

[29-Oct-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
like you say, bots would be all over it and will be just drained as fast as possible. as it is, it is already quite actively used
