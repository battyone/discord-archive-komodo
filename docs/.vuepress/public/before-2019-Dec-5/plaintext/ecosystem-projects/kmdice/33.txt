if its the same addr then just use the same keys when u start bdex and you will see your balance

[23-Oct-18 05:51 PM] Llama#1330

[23-Oct-18 11:28 PM] Llama#1330
otc with me lol same rate. no confusing utxos or anything.

[23-Oct-18 11:33 PM] c2k#4915
to start, i will buy 1000 at the lowest sellers price  @0.09

and i will sell 500 @0.45

thats my market

[23-Oct-18 11:38 PM] Llama#1330
how split up utxo

[23-Oct-18 11:40 PM] c2k#4915
in barterdex click exchange on the coin you want to manage your utxo's

[23-Oct-18 11:41 PM] c2k#4915
then in the par on the top left click "inventory"

[23-Oct-18 11:41 PM] c2k#4915
you should see your utxo's on the lower half of the screen

[23-Oct-18 11:41 PM] c2k#4915
if you ahve 1 utxo then you want to select "make inventory" in the center which will split your balance into the lots shown

[23-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Llama#1330
i have more than 100 utxo

[23-Oct-18 11:43 PM] Llama#1330
@c2k

[23-Oct-18 11:45 PM] c2k#4915
im not an expert on utxo's but i think you want your utxo sizes to fairly match the utxo sizes of the other side of the trade

[23-Oct-18 11:45 PM] c2k#4915
so if your selling you want your utxo sizes to be similar sizes to the buyers in bdex

[23-Oct-18 11:45 PM] c2k#4915
if you send the balance to yourself you will get 1 utxo of your size

[23-Oct-18 11:45 PM] c2k#4915
then you can re-split

[23-Oct-18 11:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i am experiencing issues when i use the same node for betting and for using marketmaker!

[23-Oct-18 11:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
please, beware, will need to -reindex chain if you use the same node for both things.... ( or at least that is what im suspecting)

[23-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Hermes#6934
