Pool node configured to relay 10kb of free transactions.

[03-Nov-18 01:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had 12 that were ratelimited, but that's a far cry from 1200

[03-Nov-18 01:48 AM] forkwitch#6080
Just for you @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 😘

[03-Nov-18 01:48 AM] forkwitch#6080
Before it was 1kb.

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] forkwitch#6080
My bet is dealer node is mess up 💩 .

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] forkwitch#6080
How many dealer nodes it is?

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ill say it again, if theat dealer node has a tx in it mempol that all other nodes see as invlaid

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_blames @blackjok3r and goes back to 📺_

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the mempools isnt going wnywhere'

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These chains, have "mempool forks"

[03-Nov-18 01:49 AM] forkwitch#6080
Which tx @blackjok3r , why dealer node does not remove from mempool this transaction?

[03-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no idea... it supposed to clear the mempool on each block then re add it again

[03-Nov-18 01:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r if the explorer sees it, then nodes should see it

[03-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe that isnt working

[03-Nov-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not if the mempools are split in half

[03-Nov-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
explorer might not have the tx that invalidates the txs.. I htink the dealer sent all those atr once

[03-Nov-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its proabably 1200 txs that depend on 1

[03-Nov-18 01:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
Dealer generated and broadcasted 1200 txs at once?

[03-Nov-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wqhen this happens I usually  have killed all node with stuck mempol to reset it

[03-Nov-18 01:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
I believe there is no thing as 'mempool fork', as it is not always identical on nodes with broadcasting.

[03-Nov-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There isnt without CC transaction

[03-Nov-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but these tx are diffrent

[03-Nov-18 01:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
Always you get relative memory pools.

[03-Nov-18 01:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`'mempool fork'` aka 'P2P'

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure what else to calle it

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] forkwitch#6080
So you think dealer node has a dirty memory pool who is a problem for dealer node.

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] forkwitch#6080
Can we look into dealer node memory pool now?

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I am theorising that its trying to send a mempool out (or has stopepd trying to send it)

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I get a node with bad connectivity and txblast it

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all nodes will segment its mempool off

[03-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they tx wont go anywhere

[03-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is repeatable behaviour ... but if you hav a few nodes close together its ok

[03-Nov-18 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's simple to figure out, what's the addnode for the dealer node? add that and if you ban it, then something's wrong

[03-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[03-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe we need to add a exception to addtomempool that just lets in all dicefinish bets

[03-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then let the miner invalidate them

[03-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might not be a great idea though, as the DICE contract runs its consensus on the mempool

[03-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and could end up with runaway invalid txs

[03-Nov-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're 1/2 on the right track, that's what I was talking about the other day with the tx "depends" being an issue with only blocking 5-10 txes

[03-Nov-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well when siu updated and restarted that node it sent 1500 tx at once

[03-Nov-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then they didnt go anywhere

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which I can prove happens on any ndoe

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you send a shit tonne of tx at once, it just wont propagate

[03-Nov-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks 99% of the issue is this:_
```computergenie@debian:~/.komodo/KMDICE$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getpeerinfo | jq '.|length'
8
computergenie@debian:~/.komodo/KMDICE$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getconnectioncount
8```

[03-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe bans need to be removed for CC chains?

[03-Nov-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so block mempool tx but dont band thenode sending them

[03-Nov-18 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
listbanned
[
]

[03-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its not that either

[03-Nov-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[03-Nov-18 02:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know what changed between then and now, but `maxconnections=380` should never yield connections limited to 8 peer limit

[03-Nov-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will only go over 8 if nodes activly connect to you

[03-Nov-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to change MAX_OUTBOUND in net.cpp

[03-Nov-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to force more

[03-Nov-18 02:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
outbound != in and out

[03-Nov-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on my KMD minign node IU forced 50 outbound to get less orphans .. doesnt really work lol

[03-Nov-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dealer node is still deaded

[03-Nov-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe the dealer, utxo selection is also bad

[03-Nov-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found that in stressing it out, that it would keep selecting the same utxos

[03-Nov-18 02:19 AM] Angel09#8202
Sell 3k kmdice. Dm me

{Reactions}
😂 😣 

[03-Nov-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I modified it so that for player its chooses randomly

[03-Nov-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe the dealer needs soethig similar

[03-Nov-18 02:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I love that random people like @Angel09 keep poping into the middle of conversations saying that it's not working at and trying to sell to the people talking about it not working

[03-Nov-18 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I said from day one, not to mine this chain

[03-Nov-18 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to spent money to secure me enough coins to est

[03-Nov-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sending dice bet is pointless

[03-Nov-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The bet tx has a fee

[03-Nov-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and has and is always confirmed just fine

[03-Nov-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the  finish tx... so we are back to where we started here, we need to make the dealer handle more threads

[03-Nov-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just using 3 or 4 tables over a few diff nodes would have worked just fine ... but oh hwell.

[03-Nov-18 02:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
i'm thinking that 'over a few diff nodes ' would help even without the extra "tables"

[03-Nov-18 02:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and who dafuq is **still** running nodes on the dead 9172 fork? 🙄

[03-Nov-18 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_says screw it all and sets MAXOUTBOUND to 800_

[03-Nov-18 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed
TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed`
any idea what that's about? or is it because I'm on dev and not fsm?

[03-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ExtractDestination is a function insode komodod that takes a ScriptPubkey (I htink) and gets the address it was sent from

[03-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think becuase we have the possibility of orphaned txs a lot of calls are now looking for tx that are not there.

[03-Nov-18 02:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all I know for sure is that following
`git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch dev --single-branch`
is a bad idea if you ever want anything other than dev (or whatever branch you pick there)
`git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"` does fix it though

[03-Nov-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would probably need FSM for this chain tbh ... doubt it would sync properly on master

[03-Nov-18 02:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well I was using dev, master is in the readme (as is 'komodoplatform')

[03-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Every reason I said not to lauunch this chain...

[03-Nov-18 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But whatever its been productive at least

[03-Nov-18 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
issues in DICE have been fixed that were not even looked at before

[03-Nov-18 02:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes we get it, you're against this being a live chain

[03-Nov-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh dont really care anymore ... just need to fix it

[03-Nov-18 02:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`meh dont really care anymore `
is belied by the fact that you say
`Every reason I said not to lauunch this chain...`
at least 3 times a day

[03-Nov-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[03-Nov-18 03:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Switched to FSM branch:
`computergenie@debian:~/.komodo/KMDICE$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getpeerinfo | jq '.|length'
28
computergenie@debian:~/.komodo/KMDICE$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo | jq '.size'
3`
OK, I'm giving up for the day on the assumption that no one is broadcasting the stuck txes and there's nothing else I can do

[03-Nov-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the problem is tha tthey are not sending in the first palce

[03-Nov-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thiught this could be an issue,

[03-Nov-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its liek less than 10ms they are removed from the mempool for, but maybe thats enough to stop them propagating

[03-Nov-18 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the dealer node was running without the latest FSM branch fixes. we know that gets things into a strange state

[03-Nov-18 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
resync the dealer node from scratch and it should work

[03-Nov-18 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no evidence for or against whether things run stable when all nodes are on the current FSM branch. for all we know it is working fine

[03-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jorian#4555
the dealer node has no transactions in mempool anymore

{Reactions}
🚀 (2) 

[03-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jorian#4555
ok, it has 2.

[03-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jorian#4555
almost 0 😄

[03-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jorian#4555
should i still resync the complete chain?

[03-Nov-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
did they all confirm or disappear?

[03-Nov-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess if all the dicefinish are completed, then maybe things are back on track?

[03-Nov-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i think with new FSM branch, dealer node should be able to keep up with 1 bet per second and fill blocks

[03-Nov-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the dealer node has no transactions in mempool anymore`
Then does the explorer need a rescan?
