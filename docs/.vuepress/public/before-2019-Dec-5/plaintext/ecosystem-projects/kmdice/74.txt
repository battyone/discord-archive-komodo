i have been trying everything possible and it seems like its not working.

[05-Nov-18 03:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
will go to sleep.

[05-Nov-18 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
of interesting note:
when my betting node has:
`CCduration no hashBlock for txid ...`
my mining node shows:
`TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed`

[05-Nov-18 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes CCduration no hashBlock means means it catn find the  transaction .. it was orphaned

[05-Nov-18 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or it means the dealer isnt sending the dice finish tx

[05-Nov-18 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the pool is on a diffrent version, that has consensus changes, the tx that you send, that dnt meet what the mining node is looking for will be automaticaly purged from the mempool.

[05-Nov-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can tell you that the FSM branch on STAKED testnet atm, is definatly having problems,... the only chain in the cluster to do so. All other branches are equal to the getTransactionFix commit .

[05-Nov-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So whatever it is, was pushed in after that.

[05-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jorian#4555
```or it means the dealer isnt sending the dice finish tx
```

[05-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jorian#4555
this happens with all bets

[05-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jorian#4555
look above for all the errors

[05-Nov-18 08:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I did a build with the commit before james introduced the change and still is broken

[05-Nov-18 08:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like the cc address of the node got corrupted with those laat changes

[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Myabe he accidently made a consensus change

[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats very easy to do it seems on CC's

[05-Nov-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I made myself a new chain to fix the Z-tx thing, after the first time I messed it up.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 AM] jorian#4555
a snapshot has been made at height 26401

[05-Nov-18 09:01 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
26401? why?

[05-Nov-18 09:01 AM] jorian#4555
dealer node is stuck, bets will default and people will automatically win

[05-Nov-18 09:01 AM] jorian#4555
that is not the idea of a functional betting game

[05-Nov-18 09:01 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
what's the balance of RBhtg7TDu5myvxfc54chL8wpLXz1uKQtnv back then?

[05-Nov-18 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
oh you mean your defaulted wins? :abusedsmily:

[05-Nov-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
feked if I know

[05-Nov-18 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
40506 KMDICE

[05-Nov-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
this is the 1st I'm hearing of such a thing even being possible

[05-Nov-18 09:02 AM] jorian#4555
yeah right

[05-Nov-18 09:04 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`40506 KMDICE`
OK, so all I'm missing with that is some of my consolidation txes

[05-Nov-18 09:04 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I looked at current wrong, thought that was like 400 blocks ago

[05-Nov-18 09:08 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_stops mining now_

[05-Nov-18 09:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i will do one last test

[05-Nov-18 09:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
will create a new dice plan in the KMDICE chain just to see if the problem is with the specific address of the dealer node

[05-Nov-18 09:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, we will do another snapshot as of present blocks

[05-Nov-18 09:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we have one snapshot of when the dealer node broke and will do now a snapshot of present state of the chain. Please everyone stop mining and allocate your coins to where you want to receive the new ones please.

Will give a bit of time until later today to get a new snapshot.

New plan works

[05-Nov-18 09:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
New plan works? Perfect seems like the problem is corrupted cc address for the original dice fund

[05-Nov-18 10:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like the changes that were done to the code broke it somehow

[05-Nov-18 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok everyone snapshot will be done at block 27000 be sure to move your funds to t addresses as soon as possible.

any dicebets that wins from timeout between now and then would not be counted

[05-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but any dicebets that already won, would count

[05-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
I think that is the plan?

[05-Nov-18 10:51 AM] ns408#8889
@siu - Chainmakers 

>we have one snapshot of when the dealer node broke and will do now a snapshot of present state of the chain. Please at-everyone stop mining and allocate your coins to where you want to receive the new ones please.

I'm not clear on the 'where you want to receive the new ones` bit

[05-Nov-18 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@ns408 that means do any consolidation and moving to t_address(es) before the next snapshot

[05-Nov-18 10:52 AM] ns408#8889
okay, thanks.

While doing a `komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE listaddressgroupings`, I'm only seeing one address so I guess we don't have to do anything.

[05-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Llama#1330
I‚Äôm getting 1;1 kmdice back?

[05-Nov-18 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You should if you didnt abuse in the last day or so

[05-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Llama#1330
so in like 8 hours is when the snapshot is?

[05-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Llama#1330
meaning im free to mine until then?

[05-Nov-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you're free to mine before during and after

[05-Nov-18 11:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, you can mine.

[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, so this is it...

this is the first snapshot.

[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we will filter addresses with drastic changes in balances from this snapshot until the next snapshot

[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Llama#1330
mine might be drastic because im mining

[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you address changed drastically we will investigate and if we see that there

[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if so, then you should have a lot of block rewards, not won bets.

[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Llama#1330
oh ok

[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Llama#1330
i have 0 won bets lol

[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is a difference between a mined block tx and a won bet.

[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and there is a finite quantity of block rewards from snapshot 1 to snapshot 2

[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But, this time there will be differences in the way we setup things.

[05-Nov-18 12:12 PM] ciumete#3212
what mean drastic changes ?!

[05-Nov-18 12:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Like if your address suddenly changes 30k coins balance in a day or 2 we will examine the trabsactions to see what happens. If we see it was because of fund drainage then we wont account for them. If they come from mining, no issue. And if they come from a transaction that has nothing to do the dice fund then everything is ok too.

[05-Nov-18 12:35 PM] blubbi#0643
so do i have switch something ur just keep on mining`?

[05-Nov-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
chain will be "paused" at 27000

[05-Nov-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
once the new chain is ready then the airdrop and start mining the new chain

[05-Nov-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes unshield before 27000

[05-Nov-18 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, everyone should move to taddr before 27k

[05-Nov-18 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks @Deleted User

[05-Nov-18 01:46 PM] ciumete#3212
so i can mine before 27000

[05-Nov-18 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes.

[05-Nov-18 03:42 PM] Llama#1330
How long after snapshot will new chain be ready?

[05-Nov-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it will take a day to do it right, get the mining pools in sync, etc

[05-Nov-18 05:38 PM] ciumete#3212
2 hours to go üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 06:00 PM] ciumete#3212
u made another snapshot at 26897 ?

[05-Nov-18 06:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no

[05-Nov-18 06:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
who did?

[05-Nov-18 06:26 PM] ciumete#3212
blockchain was freze about couple of minutes at that block, maybe it was the notarization

[05-Nov-18 06:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sometimes it takes a bit more for someone to mine the block

[05-Nov-18 06:27 PM] ciumete#3212
i see, it was 5 minutes

[05-Nov-18 06:28 PM] ciumete#3212
what habben with immature at block 27000 ?

[05-Nov-18 06:28 PM] ciumete#3212
happen

[05-Nov-18 06:54 PM] jorian#4555
@forkwitch around?

[05-Nov-18 06:58 PM] ciumete#3212
30 min to snapshot ?

[05-Nov-18 07:05 PM] Llama#1330
yea

[05-Nov-18 07:05 PM] Decker#3767
is new chain params already announced or it will be ready at 27000 block ?

[05-Nov-18 07:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will be once chain is live

[05-Nov-18 07:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
NN admins will know first

[05-Nov-18 07:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
same as when it was first done

[05-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Decker#3767
btw, checked my addresses in snapshot data above - seems all is good! thx for work!

[05-Nov-18 07:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
one new snapshot will be made now at block 27k

[05-Nov-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think the drained funds taking advantage of the house being done come from 1 or 2 addresses

[05-Nov-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RBhtg7TDu5myvxfc54chL8wpLXz1uKQtnv

[05-Nov-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this one taking most of the funds drained so far.

[05-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Llama#1330
18k transactions??

[05-Nov-18 07:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If the owner can come forward, it would be nice. If not, then we will deny snapshot to this address

[05-Nov-18 07:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... in about 24hours

[05-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Llama#1330
