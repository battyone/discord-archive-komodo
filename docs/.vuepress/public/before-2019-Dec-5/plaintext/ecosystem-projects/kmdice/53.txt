I think I know how to fix it, but it will make dice status much slower

[28-Oct-18 12:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how many times do I have to say
not a dice specific problem`
As many as it takes before you accept that joker has posted the code 15 dam'd times showing you that it is

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it might not be exactly, as that function may be used in other CCs

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its specifically that function.

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I think looping it once every second

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until it returns true might work

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or somethig to that effect

[28-Oct-18 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand the problem entirely, but I do know that if a miner sees two txs spending the same output, it just puts *one* into a block

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
and that should not stop nodes or fork the network

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has nothing to do with the miner

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its not a fork

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the node just stops

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a mempool consensus problem, as the contract is running on the  mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not confirmed blocks

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
what does that even mean

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
contract is running on the mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it means james broke BTC :trollface:

[28-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Alright#0419
contract is obviously able to get info from confirmed txs

[28-Oct-18 12:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Yeah...i can believe that...CCs break BTC

[28-Oct-18 12:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it can but I dont think in this case that will help

[28-Oct-18 12:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The fork happens when your local node decides that the contract UTXo belongs to your bet and not someone else's; therefore a block containing that UTXO spent by someone else is "invalid" to your node (because your node read the mempool and saw it non in use)

this seems difficult, my brain is stuggling now... im confusing myself.

[28-Oct-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can make it work,

[28-Oct-18 12:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically what it needs to do is somehow invalidat the mempool tx when the block is received

[28-Oct-18 12:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I told everyone not to mine it from day 1

[28-Oct-18 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so would it happen without normal txs?

[28-Oct-18 12:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
butt noo its fine when GUI

[28-Oct-18 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
You're telling me my node will *stop* if I send a tx immediately after another node sent a tx spending the same input

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmmaybe not, CC vouts are a bit more complicated

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe try it

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Alright#0419
I'm like 99% sure it wouldn't

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same here

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems it woudl reject mempool

[28-Oct-18 12:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
usually it will ignore a single "bad" input, it seems to most happen when it's the in of an out of an in

[28-Oct-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the CC contract is diffrent in this case

[28-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
one of them will

[28-Oct-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think what I said above is the solution, but not sure how easy that is to do

[28-Oct-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
somehow need to find what tx in the block invalidates it, then scan mempool, and remove that tx

[28-Oct-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then reprocess block

[28-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
guarantee you there's code already in the codebase that does that

[28-Oct-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is code in either komodod or iguana that does just about anything you ever need to do, you just need to spend hours finding it

[28-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
just not for CC txs apparently?

[28-Oct-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes seems to be the case

[28-Oct-18 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder where this code is, komodod is fucking huge

[28-Oct-18 12:53 AM] truong900#6364

easteregg?

Easteregg = A planted fixture of code for fun

{Reactions}
😆 💯 

[28-Oct-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They are when they are not using confirmed txs

[28-Oct-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems ... although

[28-Oct-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its just that its not scanning the mempool on block receiv is the issue, if that happens for normal txs

[28-Oct-18 12:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Sonetimes in old games you can find an easteregg in the funniest places or have to do 5 things to make it appear

[28-Oct-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( entropytxs < 10 ) {
            CCerror = "Your dealer is broke, find a new casino.";
            fprintf(stderr,"%s\n", CCerror.c_str() );
            return("");
        }```

This will help, but 10 might not be enough

[28-Oct-18 12:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 will happen every other block

[28-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not once @jorian  surfaces and adds blocknotify to set entropy at 100-500 or something

[28-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on block notify will work the best, as it reduces the number fro empool when bet is made

[28-Oct-18 12:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not once @jorian surfaces and adds blocknotify to set entropy at 100-500 or something`
OK, is this a test chain or a real chain?

[28-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its clearly a test chain, and will probably need to be snapshot at some point

[28-Oct-18 01:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if real than needs 2-3 more 0s on that number

{Reactions}
🙏 

[28-Oct-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really regret not finishing working on dice as I would have found these issues in my next planned test, where I was going to use 8 daemons to spam all at once

[28-Oct-18 01:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's silly to expect both the chain is live and something people want **and** only 100 people want it

[28-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes agreed ... if you cannot fill a block with dicebets its broken

[28-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe reduce block size to a few hundred kb

[28-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[28-Oct-18 01:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[28-Oct-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to me making faster smaller blocks and fucking off mempool would be a simple solution, but mempool is pretty cool when it works.

[28-Oct-18 01:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So it broke?

[28-Oct-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[28-Oct-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know whats wrong with it.

Interesting

[28-Oct-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes assuming all nodes have the same mempool is a very stupid assumption

[28-Oct-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why it is broken

[28-Oct-18 01:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`yes assuming all nodes have the same mempool is a very stupid assumption`
I'm not sure how that lesson was not learned with orderbooks in mm a year ago 😕

[28-Oct-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using streamer/balster you can send txs that just never propagate at all, but can be mined by the local node without issue

[28-Oct-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the mempool is not that reliable

[28-Oct-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
eespacially if a node floods a lot of tx at once.

[28-Oct-18 01:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think @JL777 will solve this with side chains instead of multiple asset chains. We are 1 solution away from the answer.

[28-Oct-18 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it doesn't help that the pools don't use node settings and drain the mempool either

[28-Oct-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that is defiantly not helping

[28-Oct-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we likely didnt see these issues as much on CPU mined chains

[28-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that solution I posted might work in all cases though ?

[28-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure how to return to GUI or dicebet scripts that the tx was canceleld though ?

[28-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would keep polling for dicestatus

[28-Oct-18 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure how to return to GUI or dicebet scripts that the tx was canceleld though ?`
simply add a condition "win/loose/even/null"

[28-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm maybe it would retun something liek txnotfound

[28-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then yes that

[28-Oct-18 01:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
If side chains are used, this appears to be an issue from 1985. All side chains are pegged to original chain and you can open up the mempool to infinity. Its not a matter of if...its a matter of when

[28-Oct-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```else if ( eval->GetTxUnconfirmed(tx.vin[1].prevout.hash,vinTx,hashBlock) == 0 )
                        return eval->Invalid("always should find vin.0, but didnt for wlt");```

[28-Oct-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
