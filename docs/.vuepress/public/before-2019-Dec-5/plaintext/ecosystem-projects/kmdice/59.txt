[28-Oct-18 06:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I used that exact branch and did -reindex and tis working... looks liek all it has is prints over jl777 FSM

[28-Oct-18 06:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, let me reindex, that might be the problem

[28-Oct-18 06:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
after the crash, none of my bets get confirmed

[28-Oct-18 06:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, the changes here are not consensus but seems to affect how things are stored or somehting

[28-Oct-18 06:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

it has not crashed for me anymore, but i cant seem to get a bet go through

linux on 10 = linux - all the security of linux

[28-Oct-18 09:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So you can adapt this script to be useful in windows now https://github.com/chainmakers/chainmaker/blob/master/kmdice/dicebet

[29-Oct-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181

now, that's how you make a block 游땔

[29-Oct-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you have enough hash to keep making those... I found the source of my errors yesterday, should have stopped much earlier and got some sleep, was pretty obvious after I looked at this morning 游땍

[29-Oct-18 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`do you have enough hash to keep making those..`
I do if fools quit doing rentals and jacking up the diff for no useful reason

[29-Oct-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok.. It seems easier to test on the chain wher its  easy  to reproduce  the problem

[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
than try to start a new one and then have tpo try and make the mempools clash

[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's still going to take a while for the diff to come back down, the graceful dropoff is fairly slow

[29-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The validation code if  you change it, just crahses without a reindex cant find transactions

[29-Oct-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thinks the chain is invalid... and I have a feeling the miner NEEDS this change, it was a bad idea for them to use it yestreday as it was wrong, but I think its now right

[29-Oct-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
needs to just check if the tx is confirmed AFTER its already grabbed the mempool tx

[29-Oct-18 03:17 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
actually, it's probably a big loss if you count all of the `CCduration no hashBlock for txid` txes that the contract eats up

[29-Oct-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so if that keeps spamming your discarding those ones?

[29-Oct-18 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
when you resend the tx and it gets put in a block, it never gets tested as a bet (it's just you giving the contract x coins)

[29-Oct-18 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if it pays fees, my node discards nothing

[29-Oct-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm... I find that spams a few times then the eventually process... your sayign your resendig the raw tx and its just being skipped by the contract

[29-Oct-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[29-Oct-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this fix I just added might help those a fair bit, as the entropy tx used by the bet now needs to be confirmed, so it cannot process at all unless ther eis a hashBlock

[29-Oct-18 03:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you do
`komodo-cli -ac_name=$AssetChain resendwallettransactions`
and it never has anything other than `bet still pending` when you do `discestatus`, then it will get blocked as a normal tx

[29-Oct-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks this is helpful

[29-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this might also be an issue with the dealer node getting overloaded

[29-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
