Is there any calculator for kmdice ?

[13-Dec-18 04:28 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
How can I calculate with my ksol power ?

[13-Dec-18 05:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hmm not that i know of

[13-Dec-18 05:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But hashrate seems to have gone up

[13-Dec-18 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How can I calculate with my ksol power ?`
literally the same as every other equihash coin...
```HashMultiplier="6"    #1 for sol/s, 3 for ksol/s, 6 for Msol/s
MyHashRate="1" # or whatever your amount is in relation to sol/s, ksol/s, or Msol/s
AmIalreadyHashing=false
if $AmIalreadyHashing; then
    blocksPerDay="$(echo "scale=8; (24*(1/((60/(($MyHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))/($NetworkHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))))/3600)))" | bc)"
else
    blocksPerDay="$(echo "scale=8; (24*(1/((60/(($MyHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))/(($NetworkHashRate+$MyHashRate)*(1^$HashMultiplier))))/3600)))" | bc)"
fi```

next time just point a pedestal fan at it and call it good :trollface:

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] 0x03#8822
best part is when you look at all the heatpipe/fan combos lenovo has to offer

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] 0x03#8822
they're all 98% identical

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] 0x03#8822
just to then differ in sockets or fucking details that i bet don't matter

[14-Dec-18 03:14 PM] 0x03#8822
i mean you can get a 4 pin socket anytime onto the board when a 5pin fits as well... the fans are _exactly_ the same

[14-Dec-18 03:14 PM] 0x03#8822
_hate_

[14-Dec-18 03:15 PM] 0x03#8822
also, the circumsize of the fans are identical as well. the differences are on little standoffs or other parts... this was very informative but i lost a lot of patience

[14-Dec-18 03:15 PM] 0x03#8822
and i'm now a lenovo notebook cpu fan expert i bet

[14-Dec-18 03:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@forkwitch is in charge of the other, please update.

[14-Dec-18 03:20 PM] 0x03#8822

How is the gui development going? I might have some idea for a simple roulette gui (I mean, this should be "easy" to emulate right? with the odds system

[18-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Meyse#0952
I was also wondering if its possible to create some lottery system? you apply (cost=txfee), and after x blocks it chooses who won

[18-Dec-18 09:11 PM] Meyse#0952
the funds from the lottery will come from the house edge on the roulette, all in one gui

[18-Dec-18 09:21 PM] ciumete#3212
if we talk about gambling in any type, dice, roulette, etc i think thr best way to maintain dthe equilibrum is to make posbility to bet on house !

@sg777 the whitepaper is cryptoconditions.info 
Means just a CC contract docs.
KMDICE as CC is all you need to read and understand

[27-Dec-18 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The source code files also covers things,
Can check kmdice cc code in komodo code

Thanks @siu - Chainmakers In general it's quite easy to install on Linux by this guide: https://github.com/tonymorony/DiceCC-GUI#installation 
There is no any "official" way of this framework packaging for Linux but can arrange it if will be a demand

[29-Dec-18 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@HenryChinaski You have to run a komodo daemon locally for asset chain on which you want to play
For example you can start KMDICE native mode in Agama
Then your config with RPC username, password and port will be in `%AppData%/Komodo/KMDICE/KMDICE.conf`

[29-Dec-18 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
If you run daemon locally as IP use 127.0.0.1

[29-Dec-18 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Connection details will be saved to file after successful connection so you'll not need to input it again. 
Actually daemon can be started anywhere (that's why I left IP field). For example I have one node on Ubuntu VPS and can play on any of my PCs from same "account" (actually wallet) without daemon installation/syncing. But if you run it on remote server - additional RPC whitelisting by IP needed

[29-Dec-18 04:39 AM] HenryChinaski#2919

has anyone been keeping an eye on the dice plan's funding? Just looked at it for the first time in a long while and it's down to 5.4M

[31-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Alright#0419
anyone know if it was a steady decline or was it drained quickly at some point?

[31-Dec-18 06:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
When the diceplan died some months ago due to lack of enough entropy txs, and @jl777c worked on the code to fix it, he was able to claim the 10million KMDICE UTXO that had become the issue all along. So we resubmited the first 5 million in thousands of 1000 KMDICE UTXOS and will be funding it continually up to 8 million.  Then 2 million will be airdropped to KMD holders in the coming months, when we get a official GUI.
