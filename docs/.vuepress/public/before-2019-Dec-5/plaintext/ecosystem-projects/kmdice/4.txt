yes plenty of places

[18-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still wraping my head around it, too late to start anything now...

[18-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
figured starting with a new RPC to add data is a good start.

[18-Oct-18 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if I can fill the queue ... thats most of the hard aprt done

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Mylo#8306
😄

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Mylo#8306
nice

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can already send ..

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and SAFE delete removes it from the queue

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its just adding the data to the queue

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, once deleed from the queue, free(ptr)

[18-Oct-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
to add to the queue ptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr))

[18-Oct-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
decode_hex(ptr->data,ptr->datalen,hexstr)

[18-Oct-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that encodes the hexstring in binary into data[]

[18-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
surprised you are saying this is hard

[18-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the ptrs are a bit strange as the DL funcs are actually macros

[18-Oct-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe im just not with it today, have had a few late nighs without sleep lol

With a ui that just connects to this one table, and using electrum would it be possible to play?

[18-Oct-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  jl siad he would pay you 7777 KMD to empty the cnontract

[18-Oct-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
7777000 would be a fun get

[18-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Mylo#8306
what RPC calls are you using @siu - Chainmakers just the diceCC ones?

[18-Oct-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes.

[18-Oct-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its a very simple setup

[18-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Mylo#8306
Cool - is there a TUI already?

[18-Oct-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

where's this CLI version?  looks like tony style TUI

[18-Oct-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
smks got skills man ...

[18-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Mylo#8306
i like the smorgasbord control centre

[18-Oct-18 02:31 PM] Mylo#8306
i'll get tony to build me a table, smk a casino monitoring system and stats

[18-Oct-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Tony is busy with cc stuff though

[18-Oct-18 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure smk too

[18-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
smk is busy with stakeddog

[18-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah well you might be in luck.  i have docs and stuff to write. and i need testers of dev workflow.

[18-Oct-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he put a lot of time into that .. but it got sent right down the list until a better dice contract was live

[18-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Mylo#8306
and to write some dice RPC wrapper js stuff

[18-Oct-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dice rpc is easy, dice bet, dicestatus every 1s until it give a win/loss

[18-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Mylo#8306
i can replicate it into web table, or just put it in place and he can rewrite it for web.

[18-Oct-18 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just dont let more than 10 ppl play at the same time

[18-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Mylo#8306
i know how much work it is to get pretty bash screens!

{Reactions}
😂 

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well all the first scripts were bash so it kind of just got built on top of as it worked.

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah that's the trap

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Mylo#8306
liittle bit more...little bit more...

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least alrught stopped on oracle chat and moved to python

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will be something awesome if he works it all out.

[18-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah we can re-use python in dev docs.  i really appreciate the move!

[18-Oct-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
When I get out of the C code all the streamer stuff withh be in python ... bash is staring to piss me off

[18-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Mylo#8306
be cool a team of community python devs working on GUIs if using kivy.

[18-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figure python back end is more powerful than bash, and it cna hav a gui just plonked on top by someone else.

[18-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and calling jq heaps of times on large jsons is just slow

[18-Oct-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very slow
