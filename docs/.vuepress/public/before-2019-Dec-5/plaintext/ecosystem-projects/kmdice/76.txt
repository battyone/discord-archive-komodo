i just dont want people on the new chain complaining about this episode.

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] ciumete#3212
what ahppen with they who have already kmdice in same address like kmd !?

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
they get more

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
Siu I'd rather see it in a faucet

[05-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
as 0.1 for 100 KMD is nothing

[05-Nov-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
doubt many people will bother

[05-Nov-18 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So best thing is to give it to everyone and so that they can play

`i just dont want people on the new chain complaining about this episode.`
Well, then you might want to be more accurate in what you're saying happened 游땔

[05-Nov-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if only a few hundred people start using it, it seems decent marketing

yes... its just for a test.

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
right now few people even know about KMDICE

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] ciumete#3212
i think better do this airdrop after the dealer is stable, he brokes when played a small group of people, what happen when play a large group of people ?!

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe we can give the airdrop to holders with less than certain quantity of KMD

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
with an airdrop, it will get covered in the main KMD media

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that way it gets better distribution.

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
or cap the amount send in the airdrop per address

[05-Nov-18 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that too... can be like the airdrop for chain... which was the same quantity per address instead of per balance.

[05-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
maybe just change the whole coin for the airdrop. I wouldn't mind seeing 20% of circulating supply go to KMD airdrop for example

[05-Nov-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that is an idea

[05-Nov-18 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The new dealer nodes will be more efficient... we will try to evade the errors we did in the first chain

[05-Nov-18 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
is it possible to omit a specific address from a blanket  airdrop? If so, please give 0 to RUdNzKNzsyebRdDoprrkDZum1PkGoMY4RP

[05-Nov-18 08:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
whos that?

[05-Nov-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
likely more value from airdropping 20% than having 8 million vs 10 million locked in bankroll

yes, I can confirm that is the address I have sent to genie

[05-Nov-18 08:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
compromised?

[05-Nov-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I had a worm and all the KMD got got

[05-Nov-18 08:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, anyway... Lets do the airdrop now... just 425 coins  short on rewards from 27k

[05-Nov-18 08:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and if miners bailed then its not that important.

[05-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
mine the first ~128 blocks yourself

[05-Nov-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
>I had a worm and all the KMD got got

shit

[05-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
then stop the chain and post params

[05-Nov-18 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... ill do the snapshot now but we will work on the new chain during tonight and tomorrow.

[05-Nov-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
snapshot only includes confirmed, yes?

[05-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
The total amount of coins I got from default win bets should be 35-36k

[05-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
should all be from that address you posted

[05-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
sent 7k to jorian from that so he could empty the plan

push that onto new chain with oracle

[05-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
also, BACK UP the original chain

[05-Nov-18 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lets do the snapshot 1:1, then you guys can help with those funds however you can.

[05-Nov-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
can't just be a blackbox in the future

[05-Nov-18 08:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
good

[05-Nov-18 08:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
will do.

[05-Nov-18 08:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was also planning on pushing the changes done in a oracle in the new chain too

[05-Nov-18 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok... no worries everyone. 1:1 snapshot will be done once we have the new chain ready.

[05-Nov-18 08:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If anyone for some reason had coins in a zaddress, please come forward to claim funds giving proof of ownership.

@siu - Chainmakers that's what I came up with for the 150s; I think there was a couple bets of 4 that timed out last night, so I'm just going to go with snap2 -snap1 because the scan result seems only about 1/2

Oh @siu - Chainmakers just realized you want to do a snapshot from last notarized block

[05-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise someone can reorg it

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
Can someone explain why `while true; do; bet; done` seems to produce free money?

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
Almost as if the house has a tendency to produce entropy that results in better winning more often than losing

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
so if you use *all* of the entropy UTXOs, you have better odds

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Alright based on what I learned today, I'm thinking maybe the timeout thing?

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
no, it worked while dealer was fine

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
did a couple thousand minbets at 1 odds

[05-Nov-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
in the realm of statistical probability or literally every bet won?

[05-Nov-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
No, lost *plenty* of them

[05-Nov-18 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
but it seemed to win out every time I did it

[05-Nov-18 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
like reproducible

[05-Nov-18 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
always ended up with more wins than losses

did you make that?

[05-Nov-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
sounds like you ended up with the odds of the "old" way?

[05-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
What I'm saying that spamming minbets at 1 odds seems to always result in >50% wins

[05-Nov-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is some sort of overflow, any sort of result can happen. all anomalies are clues

[05-Nov-18 09:17 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and tony always had <50%, so I guess it evens out?

[05-Nov-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
yes, so luck?

[05-Nov-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's been over a decade since I've done odds math to any degree beyond 52 cards (it makes my brain hurt anymore) 游땠

[05-Nov-18 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
the thing I found odd is that it only worked if you used up every available entropy utxo

[05-Nov-18 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
I did a blocknotify script that would do 10 bets each block

[05-Nov-18 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
didn't have the same results

[05-Nov-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I so wish this were craps, then I'd know more about the implied odds to even know if it's luck, bug, or in the realm of "normal" possibilities...
I do know that the lower odds you pick is the more likely you are to win, so depending on *how much* 'seems to always result in >50% wins' might make a meaningful difference (52% likely meh, 62% likely issue)

[05-Nov-18 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
using up all the utxo maybe confused the dealer node

[05-Nov-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or that

[05-Nov-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt, but if you could duplicate this, it is clearly a bug to be fixed

[05-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
maybe we need pow for bets?

[05-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
a single 0 on each end?

[05-Nov-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
no, might as well go to confirmed bet resolution

[05-Nov-18 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
using mempool makes things much trickier, but i hope after the next round of optimizations and bugfixes we will be close to a workable system

[05-Nov-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers can you create an identical test chain with identical dealer setup

[05-Nov-18 10:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
An identical?

[05-Nov-18 10:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A kmdice identical chain with 15k entropy?

[05-Nov-18 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why?

[05-Nov-18 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The context wont ever be the same

[06-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm working on `dice` documentation.

Is anyone around that can help me better understand what this is?

[06-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have the existing documentation.

[06-Nov-18 12:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to rewrite, and there's some missing info.

[06-Nov-18 12:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have already used dice on a test asset chain.

[06-Nov-18 12:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So I get the basic idea of cc's

[06-Nov-18 12:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@Bryan_Beus

[06-Nov-18 01:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have a few  questions.

[06-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is dice designed to be used by itself, or can we use it in combination with other smart contracts, in a more complex dApp?

[06-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Mylo#8306
it's an introduction crypto condition.   shows a challenge-response mechanism, PNRG by getting part from dealer part from player.   2nd story here https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-8/  @Bryan_Beus

So, it is not designed to be used in combination with other smart contracts, for larger dApp functionality, correct?
