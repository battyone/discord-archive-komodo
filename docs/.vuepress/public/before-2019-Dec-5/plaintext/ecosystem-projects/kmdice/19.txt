seems would make it near impossible to pull off a 51%

[22-Oct-18 12:06 AM] SHossain#0007
should we get it to freq 2?

[22-Oct-18 12:07 AM] jl777c#5810
that will burn up KMDICE and KMD pretty fast, but it would make the 51% have to be done in a couple minutes

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Even 3 is probably fine

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
since 2 divides into 10 evenly, we can deploy the freq:2 in dpowassets and when enough notaries update, it will start notarizing like crazy

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
freq:3 would isolate new nodes from old

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh yes makes sense

[22-Oct-18 12:08 AM] ca333#0118
freq:2 excludes a 51er practically

[22-Oct-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We found possibly issues with momom on freq 3, moving to 5 appeared to help it, but I was told the momom assumes there cannot be 2 notarisations in the same block

[22-Oct-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which was probably the issue

[22-Oct-18 12:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Would there be any issues with natural reorgs at freq 2?

[22-Oct-18 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
lets find out

[22-Oct-18 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
best to find out such things on relatively low value chains

[22-Oct-18 12:12 AM] jl777c#5810
estimated marketcap is $20,000 now

[22-Oct-18 12:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i can update my 2 nodes now if you want with freq 2 and announce for other operators. i guess we have some operators online now

[22-Oct-18 12:12 AM] SHossain#0007
would be a nice test 😃

[22-Oct-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will do same too if you want

[22-Oct-18 12:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's 3

[22-Oct-18 12:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For just 1 chain kmd cost won't be so bad

[22-Oct-18 12:13 AM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers @Decker seems online as well

[22-Oct-18 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, why not?

[22-Oct-18 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
push at the edges to find edge cases

[22-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
how do you even calculate market cap for this

[22-Oct-18 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
coins * 10 cents

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Alright#0419
the supply can change dramatically in a day

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
until it does, it didnt

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Alright#0419
locked or unlocked from contract

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ca333#0118
We could in general let dpow parties decied on freq if they d be willing to pay more (additional efforts, fees, etc.).

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ca333#0118
In various cases it seems a good thing to do.

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
even though it is doing more tx per block than KMD just from bets, the total amount isnt so big

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we should verify if freq:2 runs stable

[22-Oct-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In staked its a required parameter in asserchains.json

[22-Oct-18 12:16 AM] SHossain#0007
https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/pull/998

[22-Oct-18 12:16 AM] Alright#0419
freq 2 was not stable for STAKED

[22-Oct-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was 3... And dpow seems ok

[22-Oct-18 12:16 AM] ca333#0118
what sort of issues did you face?

[22-Oct-18 12:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But we had a small amount of nodes

[22-Oct-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Momom was much worse at 3 than 5

[22-Oct-18 12:17 AM] ca333#0118
3 is  problem due to new/old iso

[22-Oct-18 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but that just confirms that MoMoM 5% issue is related to timing

[22-Oct-18 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if a new notarization comes in during the MoMoM calc, is the issue

[22-Oct-18 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
more notarizations, more likely to happen

[22-Oct-18 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might make a couple of chains with freq 15 and let them migrate 1 coin per block for 24h and see

[22-Oct-18 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain i dont see your pull requst

[22-Oct-18 12:19 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c probably github is bit slow now?

[22-Oct-18 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
which repo?

[22-Oct-18 12:20 AM] SHossain#0007
SuperNET

[22-Oct-18 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i guess just slow

[22-Oct-18 12:21 AM] SHossain#0007
probably something wrong with my PR. i dont' see it either. please update if you don't mind

[22-Oct-18 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[22-Oct-18 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
seems github problems, my pull request doest appear either

[22-Oct-18 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
we can stop iguana, edit the `dpowassets` with the following line and start iguana again
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"dpow\",\"symbol\":\"KMDICE\",\"freq\":2,\"pubkey\":\"$pubkey\"}"
```

[22-Oct-18 12:29 AM] SHossain#0007
i have already restarted my nodes

[22-Oct-18 12:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Who will put the extra funds for notarizations?

[22-Oct-18 12:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I used 300KMDICE of what i mined for notary nodes.

[22-Oct-18 12:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But wont have more to send later.

[22-Oct-18 12:33 AM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c  you need to bpyass the suppress for KMDICE as well

[22-Oct-18 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
othersie freq 2 wont do anything

[22-Oct-18 01:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my git is also deaded.

mempool is getting busy

[22-Oct-18 01:42 AM] SHossain#0007
create a lot of entropy tx to cover high demand

[22-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need about 1000 entropy of very small size and it will stop getting stuck

[22-Oct-18 01:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i cant, i dont have access to the node

[22-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not hard to dice bet 0.001 in a while true loop 😉

[22-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will just lock to game for anyone trying to play

[22-Oct-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe someone is doing that already

[22-Oct-18 01:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if i dont own the dicegame pubkey i can still send funds to the contract?

[22-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot send entropy unless you have the dealer private key, otherwise anyone could fund entropy and cheat

[22-Oct-18 01:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
right.

[22-Oct-18 01:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well, we will need to wait.

[22-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont hurt anything... it just means noone can lplay until its fixed ... I thaught it ws done yesterday tbh.

[22-Oct-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[22-Oct-18 01:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
jorian added a couple of entropy, but i dont think it was that much

[22-Oct-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need 100 or 1000

[22-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least .. too many is bad too

[22-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can make the dealernode bog down

[22-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for dicestatus, if there are too many bets at once

[22-Oct-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probably send another 50 and see how it goes .. if still getting stuck increase to 100.

[22-Oct-18 01:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think its stuck again

[22-Oct-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no entropy, until a block is mined to return them its broken... and currently there is no error msg, apart fomr stdout to let you know why its not working.

[22-Oct-18 02:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh well... already message jorian, he should wake up in a couple of hours
