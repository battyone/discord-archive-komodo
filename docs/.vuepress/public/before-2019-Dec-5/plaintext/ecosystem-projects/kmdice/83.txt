_think that he probably did the same on host system too 😣_

[08-Nov-18 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version hasnt deadlocked so far, auto detects orphans and forgets about them, autocreates entropy and txfee utxo

[08-Nov-18 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
oh and batch processes all pending bets every second

[08-Nov-18 10:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeaah

[08-Nov-18 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
plz turn up the pressure, and really increase the load

i think it can do 5000 tx per minute

[08-Nov-18 10:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok let me update one more node and try from 3 this time

[08-Nov-18 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
likely your error rate will increase

how fast are the dicebets finishing?

[08-Nov-18 10:41 PM] jl777c#5810
from this side it looks like pretty quickly

[08-Nov-18 10:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Is proper way to check it from my side to get `dicestatus`?

[08-Nov-18 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Nov-18 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
just immediately after you send the dicebet

[08-Nov-18 10:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try

[08-Nov-18 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
do a dicestatus and see what it returns

[08-Nov-18 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
likely you can do it in a loop and measure the latency

[08-Nov-18 10:46 PM] TonyL#3577
```{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
0 minutes and 1 seconds elapsed.
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
0 minutes and 1 seconds elapsed.```

[08-Nov-18 10:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Timer starts before`dicestatus` call and ends when response received

[08-Nov-18 10:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Most likely it's < than 1 second

[08-Nov-18 10:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 sec instead of the old 5? sweet, now I can really do some betting 😈

[08-Nov-18 10:47 PM] TonyL#3577
But I wrote these scripts when I just started to learn programming so it's on bash not python and bash not work with decimals straight 😃

[08-Nov-18 10:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`var=$(echo "scale=6; ( some math )" | bc)`

[08-Nov-18 10:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, bc

[08-Nov-18 10:50 PM] TonyL#3577
But there using $SECONDS envinroment variable for time counting, there is no $MILISECONDS one

[08-Nov-18 10:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway should be some workaround I guess if we need milliseconds 😃

[08-Nov-18 10:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://bobcopeland.com/blog/2012/10/goto-in-bash/ < I use that **a ton** in most of my scripts and just use a decimal sleep loop

[08-Nov-18 10:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```check=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=$AssetChain dicestatus $gamename $fundingtxid $sendbet | jq -r '.')
    result=$(jq -r ".status" <<<"${check}")
    if [[ "$result" == "bet still pending" ]] ; then
        ((PendingTimes += 1))```

[08-Nov-18 10:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you could do something similar just increasing with bc instead

[08-Nov-18 10:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_**still** doesn't do py_

just dealer node handling

[08-Nov-18 11:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, not that I'm on the real right branch, I ran out of entropy and have an ass ton of
`add validation for refunds
`

[08-Nov-18 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is some code commented out in CCtc.CPP I think k it is, that allows random choosing of local utxo

[08-Nov-18 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To spam bets you will need to uncomment that

[08-Nov-18 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Otherwise your bets will keep picking the se utxos

[08-Nov-18 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And refuse to broadcast with missing inputs

[08-Nov-18 11:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will have a look where exactly soon... To make a lot of parallel bets you need that code, 5000+ entropy and 500 utxo in local wallet, and at least 3 nodes

[08-Nov-18 11:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`And refuse to broadcast with missing inputs` that's actually what I'm getting now when trying to re-broadcast not accepted hashes

[08-Nov-18 11:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I had at least 70% of bets fail without the random utxo selection code, but I disabled it in the official sources to stop everyone spamming the dealer as just 2 node with it could totally stop it dead before

[08-Nov-18 11:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just work up will post the location on it and make sure it's still there in a minute

[08-Nov-18 11:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I have 3 synced nodes with some KMDICE and spamming scripts on it

[08-Nov-18 11:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just have to generate UTXOs

[08-Nov-18 11:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```#!/bin/bash

address=RRoC3gu4cTgPsVSbYg1vFGbtcum8X7PPz9 # Fnode
#address=RU3yYGAz1xVjkLbeEdxKq5WpQNDdkYd83V # cc
#address=RGySymLoUMN4LEFFwCFSxo14GSJFvFjH8p # test node at home

JSON='"{\"'
JSON2='\":0.00001,\"'

for i in `seq 1 500`; do
     JSON+=$address
     JSON+=$JSON2
done
JSON="${JSON%???}}\""
echo $JSON```
You will nned this to build a sendmany to make enough utxo to make the random sleection work.

Just wanted to ask if there any ready script for UTXOs generation and you posted it. Thanks! 😃

[08-Nov-18 11:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That code will skip utxos to select more randomly

[08-Nov-18 11:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe make it activate lower than 500 utxo

[08-Nov-18 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577
```        //if ( numunspents > 500 ) {
        //    if ( (rand() % 100) < 80 )
        //        continue;
        //}```
This loop?

[08-Nov-18 11:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think last time I uesd it was actiavting on 150 and above

[08-Nov-18 11:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[08-Nov-18 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha so I have to uncomment it and rebuild on my nodes, make UTXOs and try to spam

👍 

[08-Nov-18 11:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The entropy random selection isnt that good either, when I was testing there waslike 15,000 utxos with only a few hundred, it will ned ot be better optimized.

[08-Nov-18 11:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently it randomly picks a number beteween half the total amount, and 0 then skips 90% of them... so only chooses in the middle, rather than over the whole list.

[08-Nov-18 11:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I willl have a look at that today and see if I can make it work better, shouldnt take long.

    tx=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE sendtoaddress $address 0.001)

There seems to be many places, where you stop one error and it then causes another
