the crazy level of network activity is exposing deadlocks in the networking code!

I wonder if the mempool being so big makes the miners have problems.

the fix for that is setting queu in confing @Decker

[11-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Alright#0419

[11-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
ping me if you need it to stop, just going to leave it running

[11-Nov-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
1 per second is nothing, it seems to be handling more like 20 per second

[11-Nov-18 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the utxo got used up, so it is taking 10 seconds per block to make new ones. during this time there will be extra 10 seconds delay

[11-Nov-18 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i stopped and updated dealer node with new algo that will speed up the creation rate of the utxo to prevent getting so low

[11-Nov-18 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
realtime systems are quite tricky and everything needs to be in balance. the dealeer node is automating all the requred utxo and entropy creation

[11-Nov-18 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Just visually from my side seems that my nodes spamming as fast as before

[11-Nov-18 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it's ~3-5txs / second from one node

[11-Nov-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm getting 2-5/s

[11-Nov-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
num normal 0.0002 utxos.4453 < 7777 -> n.6
it was down to 500 utxos, so it is regenerating faster than they are being used up

[11-Nov-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when it is caught up the latency will improve

[11-Nov-18 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
So should I stop nodes before o sleep or can left it?

[11-Nov-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
leave it

[11-Nov-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
nice to make sure it can handle sustained load

[11-Nov-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
@jorian ready to take over the dealer node? I am not seeing any lockups anymore

[11-Nov-18 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Alright, they were preset for 1,000,000 txs, should be enough if I'll not burn all in tx fees faster 😃

[11-Nov-18 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
seems we might do over a million dice CC contracts in a day, on one chain

[11-Nov-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if any troubles, update to latest FSM. some of the fixes would affect the non-dealer nodes under high load

[11-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Mylo#8306
Wow full block congratulations!!

[11-Nov-18 05:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is the dealer node off?

[11-Nov-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if a bash script halts with a segfault and the fault is the cli, will gdb show that?

[11-Nov-18 05:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or is the spamming not letting me get status?

if you run komodod via gdb -args ./komodod ...

then when the cli crashes you can do a backtrace

but update to latest FSM it runs more stable

[11-Nov-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I can try that, the problem is that I'm only guessing that the fault is coming from cli and not bash (since terminal doesn't actually say)
