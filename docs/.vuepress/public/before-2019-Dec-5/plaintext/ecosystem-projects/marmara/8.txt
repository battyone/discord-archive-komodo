before, after marmarainfo add doc. 
```https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z46-uUVPkEIAR2uRPL4H6ZZ70imb9hP5Cc_Kj0OZ0HM/edit```

[26-Jun-19 08:09 AM] dimxy#2587
so the test report shows that there is something wrong with the coins distribution.
checking ...

[26-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Paro#7842
ok wait you.

[26-Jun-19 10:06 AM] dimxy#2587
Are these pubkey1,2,3  all on non-mining nodes (neither staking nor pow)?

[26-Jun-19 10:11 AM] Paro#7842
pubkey=1-2-3 
```
{
  "staking": false,
  "generate": false,
  "numthreads": 0

[26-Jun-19 06:48 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Great. It is going very  well.
1. What about boosted coins? Do they get 3x staking with boosted?  
2. Do we lock boosted in common fund? In the first case, the  PK1 should have 3x boosted staking. In the second case, both PK1 and PK2 should have 3x boosted staking with half (credit/(n-1))
3. Is settlement automatic?  Or do we need to make marmarasettlement manually?

[27-Jun-19 07:05 AM] Paro#7842
hi @dimxy

[27-Jun-19 07:08 AM] dimxy#2587
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner  
1. Yes, boosted coins take 3x multiplier in staking
2. We lock boosted coins on an 1of2 address that is unique to each credit loop and common (shared) for all loop's participants. But each utxo in a loop is marked by the pubkey who made this utxo. So we know what part of a loop fund belongs to which endorser and use this in the calculation of staking value. 
3. Settlement is automatic and is executed by a miner. There are some implications from this:
- anyone can now execute settlement
- it is now a problem to move the baton after the settlement (as it is stated in the requirements doc) because the baton is on the holder pubkey and anyone who does the settlement can't spend it

Did you pass the baton in marmarareceive call on pk3? 
It seems not, as this field in tx opreturn is empty (as explorer shows) In this case marmaratransfer would not work (because it is supposed to be a new loop, so maramaraissue is only possible)

[27-Jun-19 08:21 AM] Paro#7842

Why are LCL empty in all PK1, PK2 and PK3? @Paro

[27-Jun-19 06:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Did you make boosted (LCL) tests? Any plan?

[27-Jun-19 06:17 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
How do you activate settlement?

[27-Jun-19 06:18 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Automatic?

[28-Jun-19 10:04 AM] dimxy#2587
LCL values are empty because they are null before the test and should be clear after the settlement (the table shows the status after the settlement). So the results are correct (as I understood the algorithmüòÄ )
Total credit amount was 10 coins. After the settlement those 10 coins eventually were sent to pk3 normal.
For pk1 its activated account decreased by 10 coins and normal account increased by 5 coins. These 5 coins were sent to its normal when the look-in-loop amount was redistributed between pk1 and pk2 at the moment when the baton was sent to pk3.
For pk2 its activated amount is decreased by 5 coins (which he donated to the loop).

The settlement now is automatic and is started by any miner.
(And it creates a problem: the miner who started the settlement cannot send the baton to the issuer as required by the document. The baton is on the holder's pubkey and the miner cannot spend it)

[28-Jun-19 05:15 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@jl777c may give idea on the solution of problem.

[28-Jun-19 05:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Could it be spent from the blockchain fund in third layer?

[28-Jun-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think just seeing the case of the miner completing the settlement can be the indication that the loop is done. as long as we can tell, it doesnt seem it needs to get back to the issuer

[28-Jun-19 06:27 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Do you mean we do not need to transfer the baton back to issuer during settlement?

[28-Jun-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if it settles properly on all other aspects, why is it needed?

[28-Jun-19 06:34 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
That is right. We just need to have a flag saying the loop is settled.

[28-Jun-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
this condition can indicate this

[28-Jun-19 07:06 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy then no need to transfer the baton at the end and hence making spending.

[28-Jun-19 07:07 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
You can ignore the part in requirements document which suggests transfer of baton to issuer at the end during settlement.

[28-Jun-19 07:14 PM] dimxy#2587
We have not only a baton but also a marker, it is on the global address. It can be spend by miner (he spends it already)  and it indicates the loop is settled.
