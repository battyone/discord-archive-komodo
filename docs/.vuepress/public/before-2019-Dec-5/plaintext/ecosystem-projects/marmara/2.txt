It is a trust based linking system shifting the trust from the first issuer to endorser. Then circulates between pairs of two sides who always trust the previous ones. Names of credit issuers are known to each other. It happens in business. They stamp on papers and put slgnatures.

[02-Dec-18 02:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
There are more. If there is not enough fund, the second node in the link is responsible. All nodes from top to bottom are responsible. They are visited and their funds are used to redeem. There is also 5% blockage for issuing a credit. And finally the 10% fund is used to clear. If the link fails they are all blacklisted especially the first node.

`Suppose I sell furniture worth 10k lira and you have no money except MARMARA immature coins. You write a post-dated cheque or create a credit with a future date on say 1 july 2019 worth of And you have immature coins spendable only after 1 july 2019 worth of 10k liras in MARMARA. There will be names on the system but even if I don't know you, I will sell this refrigerator to you without hesitation because of your immature coins after post-date.`
That's nice of you to give me $2k USD worth of furniture on credit, but what will you have in place to stop me from putting my mature MARMARA coins in a z_addy on 1 july 2019 and you never see the coins or your furniture again?

[03-Dec-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the immature coins would need to be locked in a CC contract that prevents transfer if there are any checks outstanding

@jl777c That's what I was thinking, but was curious if he has, or will have, something in place where dear old gramma can figure out how to do that

[03-Dec-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if grandma can figure out how to send funds to an address generated by the GUI, that is all that would be needed to invoke the CC contract

Anyone interested in building an e-commerce site by using #cryptocurrencies. Please join in our Discord group. Marmara credits (instead of credit card) and Marmara Coin as well as some other coins such as $KMD may be used during business. https://discord.gg/8mBSKC7

I thank very much @jl777c on behalf of Marmara community for opening the important issue for delivering timelocked coins to miners. As you know, we will have a policy of timelocking the coins indefinitely in Marmara. Since timelocked coins are a must to solve the non-redemption problem in credit creation, we will always have coins with timelocks in coinbase ranging from 3 months to 2 years. This makes mining in pools a great problem. So the coinbase CC will solve this problem. It will be really a great innovation in Blockchain. By this way, we will be able to decentralize the credit creation of post-dated cheques and promissory notes in Turkey with at least 200 billion USD market size.

Initially this CC is specifically for MARMARA project for handling timelocked coinbase funds, which makes running a pool impractical. However, it could well be that we will extend it in the future ...

Deutsche Bank declares blockchain currencies as a failure and tries to blur the potential of blockchains. But there is one simple fact they are hiding successfully: It is creation of money by banks as credit. Majority of money is created as credit by banks out of thin air. And this may be decentralized completely and could happen in real economy as in Post-dated cheques and promissory notes example in Turkey. Credit creation by masses in a decentralized way without banks will be a real challenging thing to their surprise.

@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner 
Please take a look at this article: https://hackernoon.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-mind-blowing-feature-of-cryptocurrency-860c3f25f1fb

He says: "The true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power." and "You see, Satoshi understood the first part of the maxim, the power to print money. What he missed was the power to distribute that money." 

I think peer to peer credit creation and settlement might be the solution to the "decentralization of creation of money" problem. In the article, he goes on to talk about ways to do it, but its all very abstract and futuristic for now.

It might be a good idea to engage him about your ideas regarding peer-peer credit creation. He has some very good ideas and has a large following. https://twitter.com/dan_jeffries1
He has a podcast episode on the same topic: http://dailyposthuman.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-mind-blowing-feature-of-cryptocurrency-2/

@gcharang Thanks very much. I read the article. There is a common misunderstanding about the reality of money creation by banks. Many people are confused by the theory of Fractional Reserve banking (FRB)  system. I was also confused until I read the "lost century in Economics" by Professor Richard Werner. The main cause for misunderstanding is the publications made by Fed. The major one is "modern money mechanics". In reality, it is much easier to understand. FRB is fictitious and problematic to explain banks as intermediary institutions. In reality, banks just create credits when giving loans without need of any relending. And majority of money in circulation (97%)  is created as credit. In my opinion, banking could not be replaced by Blockchain unless credit function is solved in better way than banking system.

This is traditional money used by tea/coffee houses (Kahvehane) in Turkey. It is simple money creation. You buy them from the coffee shop in bulk and you pay for tea by using this plastic money. Do you have such practices in your country?

To Komodo community! In MARMARA CHAIN, We are testing the settlements in Marmara credit loops to see if redemption is made according to top-to-bottom approach or not. If pubkey-1 has not enough with Marmara, it should be redeemed from pubkey-2 and so on to the last holder in the credit loop. We need to test with 3 or more nodes in credit loops. Reward is 100 MARMARA for each settlement. Please make a report for each test. everyone

Electronic cheques are to be initiated in Turkey. They are proposing through banks. They will most probably introduce insurance which means additional cost for users. I believe this decision will ease the things for MARMARA.

I went through the marmara rpc and docs.
I think the current implementation is almost clear to me.
There are some questions.
In our implementation issuers in a loop lock their money for future settlement.
But as I can see it, vadeli cheques allow to create payment means while issuer does not have money yet. He wants to create a debt and pay it when he earns some money.
But do we require he should have the money? And if holder receives the money in settlement when it matures how could he use it before?

@dimxy In Version 2.0, no need to have activated or boosted coins during issuance. It is money creation. But in Version 1.0, the issuer should have 100 % of coins locked. When the marmarabatonapproval is done, the activated/locked coins are transferred to boosted.

[25-May-19 07:01 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In version 2.0, we will create credit as fiat currencies. It will be vadeli cheque (post-dated cheque) information on chain.

[25-May-19 07:11 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In Version 1.0, we do not create money and no there is no fiat. Why would anyone give credit then if he/she cannot create credit? Well! We rely on the ability to generate MUCH MORE coins with boosted staking when locked in credit loops.

[25-May-19 07:13 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
25% of coins are produced with mining. The remaining is through activated and boosted.

[25-May-19 07:16 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
There are three types of coins as normal, activated and boosted ones. Boosted has three times more chance to find blocks during staking than activated coins*. Btw, staking needs activated or boosted, i.e. locked coins. 
* "three times more chance" is to be confirmed by @jl777c

[27-May-19 06:30 AM] dimxy#2587
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner hello,
I have several more questions:

Is \'settlement\' actually a cheque redemption, that is, when cheque holder enters a bank and requests cash in exchange of the cheque?

Do I understand it right that the main purpose of the currently implemented v1.0 (aka Millenium ed) is to check how the settlement of locked coins would work and how their owner would receive some benefits from their coins being locked?
But the functionality of credit issuance itself was just very much simplified (as it does not actually send any coins to holder when credit is issued)?
So it is not the real business case but rather technology studying?

From this article https://medium.com/@cemilturun/we-had-paper-blockchains-for-decades-13ac29c4efd0
I understand that only the first cheque issuer is the payer for it. The rest cirantas just bypass it to the next holder and they do not pay anything when the cheque payment day comes. 
In our implementation all endorsers might pay when settlement is going on. I was also told actually each endorser would garantee exactly 1/N fraction from the total credit value.
So is it some new advancement for the real vadeli cheques?
(Or, maybe real vadeli endorsers also would have to pay if any previous issuer defaulted?)

Why is it needed to have endorsers at all when vadeli cheques are passed to a next holder? Why not just pass it as a usual banknote and simply allow to bearer just go to a bank and convert it to cash after the cheque has matured? (maybe, endorsers should pay if the issuer defaults)

The main idea is that an issuer could create a vadelie cheque not having money yet (in the hopes he will get the money later). So it seems, no need for him to lock his money.
(Also we spoke in the chat that issuers would not need to lock their money in the version 2.)
So, how is it supposed to use this locking feature in v2, who will use it? (maybe it is other roles who will be backing credits)

I have read some about lending loops in Canada where people make small deposits and this funding is used for short time loans for small businesses. We are not implementing this model (as it does not create money), yes?

(Sorry, if I missed anything in the docs)

[27-May-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a full spec for v2, probably that will help. with v1, it had 0% default rate and nothing very complex so it was decided to start with that to get things going

[27-May-19 06:46 AM] dimxy#2587
Oh, yes, B. G√ºltekin √áetiner gave it to me, studying it.
(I'm a bit confused with v1.0 as it seems the model implemented in it does not match to the concept in that medium article)

[27-May-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
correct, it is a millenium modification

[27-May-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that you only need 1/N capital tied up for a creditloop, where N is the number of participants. by incentivising participating in a creditloop, it shouldnt be hard to increase N.

[27-May-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so you do have to start with 50% (issuer and first), it is expected that soon there will be second, third, ... thus reducing the amount that is locked

[27-May-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this is indeed different, but the advantage is 0% default as all creditloops are 100% secured with locked coins

[27-May-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
granted it doesnt perform the money creation that an unsecured creditloop will, but I think once we make a 100% secured creditloop system working, going to a fractional reserve system should be a matter of changing an internal parameter

[27-May-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
at that point it will be money creation as described, though it opens up the possibility of default and triggers the need for multiple layers of insurance, arbitration, etc.

[27-May-19 07:02 AM] dimxy#2587
thank you for the explanation.
Is it correct to say that in v1.0 an issuer actually issues credit to himself and provides a collateral for it with time-locked funds?

[27-May-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty close. but there is always the first reciepient to create the creditloop, so it is being issued to another pubkey

[27-May-19 07:29 AM] dimxy#2587
remembering of vadeli concept I would say the receipient just receives IOU of the issuer

[27-May-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes you are correct, the issuer is 100% backed at this point

[27-May-19 07:41 AM] dimxy#2587
So I would say an issuer creates a credit to himself, backs it 100% with time locked coins and uses this credit as legal tender to pay for goods provided by a recipient. The recipient, in turn, receives a sort of IOU in exchange for his goods and settles it when it matures.

[27-May-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
with v1 idea is to extend the credit loop

1. Yes. Settlement is actually cheque redemption at the date which is decided during issuance.
2. It is a real business even in Millennium edition (Version 1). Suppose I issue a credit of 600 MCL. When the first endorser (which is also holder) gets the baton, I buy goods and services for the amount of 600 MCL. But it does not leave my Wallet until redemption date. Furthermore, it is boosted so I get full power of staking. It is fully collateralized. At any stage, the zero defaulting occurs. However, as you discovered, the Version 1 is more miner friendly.
3. Yes, The millennium edition is simplified. The article explains the paper based analog chain Version of existing cultural system but Version 2 is a complete solution to nonredemption problem and other problems in paper version. 
4. In all versions, it works best with transfer of goods and services. But I admit that the Version 1.0 is more miner friendly since anyone can create to accounts and issue credit to himself/herself to use boosted staking. However, we want to spread Version 1 among community for exchange of real goods and services.

Great! Thank you.
Now it is much more clearer to me

[27-May-19 09:15 AM] dimxy#2587
So the first task is to correct the settlement to provide equal distribution of debt payment between the issuers?

[27-May-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and also managing the changing lock amounts as creditloop is getting bigger

[27-May-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the most efficient way. moving all funds into and out of credit loop locked addresses might be too much overhead

[27-May-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
alternative is to track who owes how much, but it becomes hard to enforce the locked nature

[27-May-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and there are two levels of locked funds, one is the normal locked where it can only be used for staking or creditloops

[27-May-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then when it is in a creditloop, its staking power increases 3x

[27-May-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the was to implement that is to change just one function deep in the staking code, that is solved how to do, so just ask when you are doing that part

also current code has some definite bugs with settlement as that was coded before there was any clear idea of how exactly to make settlements

[27-May-19 09:35 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, it is what I actually was going to ask: now as I can see the marmara cc does not check if sufficient funds are locked by the issuer.
And probably it should not because it would be like the first issuer would already have the full amount backed.
From the other hand if we do not check this we could not say the credit is 100% backed.

[27-May-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, these are the issues that need to be solved

[27-May-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with efficient methods

[27-May-19 10:11 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We will have the third layer, i.e. the blockchain fund in Version 1.0, too. It might be used to clear the dusts with transfer fees. We should not stop transfers for small fees in credit loop operations.

[27-May-19 10:16 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@dimxy You are right. Currently it does not check if sufficient funds are locked by issuer. This is because We did not have in mind millennium features where we have collateralization. This feature might be useful in Version 2 as well since We have new improvements with community layer.

The formula for risk share is same for all steps. It is Credit/(N-1). If there are 2 nodes in credit loop, the first is issuer and the second is holder. The issuer's 600 is locked in boosted. If there are 3 nodes, then 1st is issuer, the 2nd is endorser and 3rd is holder. So the credit risk is divided b/w issuer and endorser as 300. The issuer gets 300 back as normal coin while ensorser's 300 is locked first and then boosted when batonapproval happens. At each step, there is 100% collateralization.

[27-May-19 10:58 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
All previous nodes are responsible against the holder at the end date of credit loop.
