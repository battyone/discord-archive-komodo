[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol ok my bad no worries

[11-May-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Shouldnt we go for an Asian market exchange? I don¬¥t think neither DP or STEX support any of the asian languages.

[11-May-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It would be wise to decentralize on exchanges too, I think. So Asian market is a good idea

[11-May-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> ZBG.com is big Asian exchange, perhaps too big for Verus atm?

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The form doesn't want to open here... I'll go to the ZBG site first (after I read the article)

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> -"At this trading platform, you can list your token for free, and when it has received sufficient liquidity and trading, it can be promoted to the big brother-exchange: ZB.com. "

[11-May-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Would be nice for asian fans of Verus to have a asian exchange üòÉ

[11-May-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree, but this scares me: `We run all exchange-websites in Mozilla‚Äôs Observatory-test (https://observatory.mozilla.org/). The score in such test is one of many indicators of the exchange‚Äôs security. ZBG only received an F-score in this test. This is naturally below industry average and is thus not a competitive advantage at all for this trading platform.`

[11-May-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Still, it has a lot of volume - most volume on XRP right now of all the CMC exchanges

[11-May-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Still trying to open application form

[11-May-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Try clicking "Listing Application" top left here - might be a personal link for me as I see it contains checksums https://www.zbg.com/trade/xrp_usdt

[11-May-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did. It simply won't open... I'll try a different browser...

[11-May-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I use Chrome

[11-May-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-May-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Must be an IP-block, I think. MS Edge doesn't open it either

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I wish I was in that early üòÉ

[11-May-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> only started with crypto last year

[11-May-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got the page to finally open. I don‚Äôt have all the info they want... üòí

[11-May-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> heard about it from some friends in 2012, but I thought nothing of it

[11-May-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> made no sense to me than, as it was described to me.

[11-May-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Me too, I was busy with other stuff, so back then it was no priority for me... stupid, stupid, stupid...

[11-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> "Value out if the thin air" poposterous, I though. That was before I got educated that the FIAT currencies of the world are also not tied to a fixed commodity but rather created out of the thin air by the central banks üòÉ

[11-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Think they stopped tying FIAT to fixed commodities like gold in the 20s or 30s worldwide.

[11-May-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed. The value of our money hasn‚Äôt been backed by gold for a longer time than most of us know....

[11-May-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Most people think that money is backed by "something physical", though, as did I üòÉ

[11-May-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The only thing backing it is ‚Äúperception of value‚Äù....

[11-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is aacoin still functional? Think they're a decent sized asian exchange that we are on.

[11-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> What¬¥s great with ZBG.com is that they welcome new coins, they have their own "Innovation Zone" list of traiding pairs. Very nice üòÉ And they don¬¥t have a listing fee, got a decent volume, and will be the first asian Verus exchange for asian fans.

[11-May-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And it¬¥s listed on CMC, for Verus to be on CMC we need a second CMC exchange I think.

[11-May-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I definitely do not have all the info they want. Also I don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving out contact details of developers etc. without them being aware... I should discuss it with them first.

[11-May-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> aacoin is not great

[12-May-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> lol btc/vrsc

[12-May-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @dude Yes, I think ppl are selling altcoins for bitcoin as it pumps. Bitcoin dominance is going up.

[12-May-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> yeah I agree and think the same

[12-May-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Once it stops pumping ppl will buy altcoins again I think, but I¬¥m no expert üòÑ

[12-May-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> but I would never sell for that price

[12-May-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> More to earn with BTC for the moment I guess. Some YTber said that BTC usually pumps first, then the altcoins.

[12-May-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Not sure if it¬¥s true, but makes somewhat sense in my head. The reasoning is that people sell their altcoins to join the BTC pump, when it flattens people sell off BTC for altcoins and as a result they start pumping.

[12-May-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> it‚Äôs maybe one reason

[12-May-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> No real news with Verus today that I¬¥ve heard atleast, so that would explain the selloff.

[12-May-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People still look at fiat prices... They sell when they get high fiat. They don't realize they loose money because they could've gotten more sats for their alts

[12-May-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you time it right, you could earn good money selling altcoins for BTC and when BTC flattens buying some good altcoins for them - but it¬¥s hard to predict the top/bottom.

[12-May-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If it were easy, we'ld all be rich

[12-May-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I hodl because I suck at predicting where things go.

[12-May-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Says the one guy I know with a 2,000 BTC wallet üòÑ lol

[12-May-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hodl because I believe in this project. And because I'm waiting for my shitcoins to go up, to minimize losses.

[12-May-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Back then it was 2k.... it doubled by now...

[12-May-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> ü§£

[12-May-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good morning, by the way

[12-May-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I¬¥m with you on that, @Oink PBaaS could be the next big thing. I also believe in staking coins as it causes people to not sell but rather get interest - further pusing the price. My LindaCoin has exploded in value for example, and Verus being a very good staking coin in addition to PoW with about 38% yearly interest atm I think is the perfect coin.

[12-May-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> More a question about marketing, most people think PBaaS is brilliant once they understand it. Merge mining is also a nice feature that Verus has.

[12-May-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did some math yesterday. yearly staking rewards are now down to 28%, but it's still a lot.

[12-May-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk

[12-May-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've been tweeting some stuff about PBaaS and @Godballz made an excellent article on PBaas, so we're working on the marketing. You just cannot market effectively if you cannot show people what it does exactly. Makes it hard to understand

[12-May-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Linda is 50% yearly staking interest I think(don¬¥t quote me), there are staking coins that yield more interest, but when I looked at them last year most had very low volume.

[12-May-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> So, by Verus being a 50% staking 50% PoW coin with a decent volume I gather that 28% staking reward is still pretty good.

[12-May-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People discovered the staking on Verus the last couple of months, so I saw the profitability half over the past 3 months.

[12-May-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's by the way assuming ALL available coins are staking (timelocked funds and Z-balances exempted)

[12-May-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> No point in having 1,500% staking reward if no one buys your coins üòÑ

[12-May-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed. but 28% makes a nice ROI if you want to leave it there for your pension, like me...

[12-May-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Yes, but with crypto it¬¥s always more of a gamble than an investment, though.

[12-May-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Isn't any investment an educated gamble?

[12-May-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You never know hwat the staking coin is worth next month.

[12-May-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Some say so üòÉ

[12-May-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True, but with the knowledge of upcoming technologies for a coin, you can make an educated gamble whether it will survive in the long run or even grow valuable

[12-May-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Was a guy on YT chat yesterday that wanted to pawn his $30k truck for BTC, had to tell him that BTC is a gamble not an investment and asked him if he would gamble his truck on roulette in LV üòÑ

[12-May-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I tell people all the time...only spend what you would readily throw into a fire

[12-May-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> they usually look at me funny

[12-May-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Saw a guy on Reddit the other day that had borrowed funds from family and asked advice on how to get crypto for it... I advised him to go to Vegas, because if you don't know what you're doing the odds of getting profit are better there...

[12-May-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At least he would have a good time there...

[12-May-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> People I know think it must be easy.  But they only see my end result...not all the people that loose it all.  They think I am just trying to keep them out of moon lambos

[12-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I still have to triple my holdings to be in the black myself, I suck at "investing" in crypto üòÑ

[12-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> oops

[12-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... Be prepared to loose on one side and gain on the other. And monitor frequently.

[12-May-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I can say Im way up.... its  been house money for a while for me

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Nice üòÉ

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I spend waayyy to much time monitoring markets... almost an addiction

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I keep stopping then say one more trade....and hit it right.  Cant stop now! ha

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I tried stocks in 2000 too, guess how that went üòÑ lol ... Bad luck or stupid - take you pick üòÑ

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm still in the black, but just barely. Haven't checked with the BTC price today, but it should do well for me...

[12-May-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got out of stocks in 2005... My luck!

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Oh, really, it¬¥s  above 7k now. Think it was 7.4k at one time.

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Then I'm definately in the black + someprofits... Which are just going to sit there and ride the rollercoaster.

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Yeah, BTC went through 6k like a warm knife in butter.

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since I only put in money I don't need, I don't need to cash in on anything

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> wait for the correction

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Bound to be a selloff soon, there are a lot of shorts out there.

[12-May-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And a lot of longs too... No one knows where it¬¥s going.
