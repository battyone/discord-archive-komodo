[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> lol

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So let's add yet anohter layer

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Coinbase

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, So, using the old wallet is like using a different room

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> wait

[31-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you mean:

[31-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> using a wallet on a forked chain, then that is like using a different room

[31-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> and if you then take that wallet back online to the main chain, any entries made to it from the other forked chain, will just not exist and be removed/replaced with the main chain consensus entries that occurred during that time

[31-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> What I mean is how can using the old wallet cause a fork or (leaving to another room as you were saying)?

[31-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> using an old wallet doesn't cause a fork

[31-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I thought you said we need to update our wallets so we are not on a forked chain

[31-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No I said it could result in you forking away

[31-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> why you would fork away is not just because you're on an old wallet

[31-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> what's the difference in 'forking away and 'causing a fork'?

[31-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it would occur for other reasons like an attacker taking advantage of the security issue that was fixed

[31-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Oh, you mean older versions with security issues

[31-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yes

[31-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but all the older versions have security issues right?

[31-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's why this is a critical update, it addresses an issue

[31-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right, v0.5.5 fixes the issue from prior versions (5.0 - 5.4)

[31-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Ah, thanks for explaining , you have been very helpful.

[31-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 😃 glad to help!

[31-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> what do you do for verus? do you code for them?

[31-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So much of the tech of blockchain is really simple, but the "tech" layer makes it hard to understand a lot of time

[31-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> how does staking fit into your room full of people analogy ?

[31-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right now I'm contribute by helping with communications and am doing some coding on a couple cool things which I'll share soon

[31-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> oh, that's cool what kind of resources do you use for the communications?

[31-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So that's another layer, coinbases, in the simple example everyone is just exchanging tokens...the coinbase is where the supply of coins originates, so people have tokens/coins to exchange with each other

[31-Jan-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> staking and mining are like "jobs" that let you get paid from the coinbase

[31-Jan-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> What is the metaphor for layer? floor room?

[31-Jan-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> but the coinbase isn't a person, it's another algorithm driven function, and spits out coins if you solve a puzzle

[31-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it's sort of like a game really

[31-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 😃

[31-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Idk

[31-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So everyone comes into the room and there's this shiny cool, maybe ancient-looking, box, we'll call it a "box of truth"

[31-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> maybe staking means that the people in the original room are forced to stay in the room and piss their pants!

[31-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 10 sit around the box like a seance

[31-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok, I want to hear what happens to the box of truth!

[31-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> and for mining, it's a really hard problem to solve and each works super hard to figure it out before someone else.

[31-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if it's getting too difficult for anyone in the room, difficulty can drop so it takes only a minute to solve

[31-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> like sudoku

[31-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sure!

[31-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> solve it first, the box of truth spits out beautiful shiny coins

[31-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 24 of them

[31-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 😃

[31-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but how is that different from mining?

[31-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that was mining

[31-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> you use the same metaphor for mining and staking!

[31-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 😜

[31-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> basically

[31-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> i'm tired honestly lol

[31-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> but staking is showing you value the coins, because you hold onto them

[31-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok, how are you means of communication going? what do you use?

[31-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the more you hold, the more "stake" you have in the entire thing, the room, the group, the box of truth

[31-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> etc etc

[31-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> okay going to stop cos I actually am tired and need to do some work

[31-Jan-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz So, what is the spoon a metaphor for in crypto?

[31-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> No not me,   I was working on OpenCL stuff, but I got to a road block and havent found a big enough ladder yet...

[31-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I hope we chat about this stuff later, its fun

[31-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sorry not avoiding your question on communication, but we can talk more about it, I do have some tasks that are pressing at the moment. In short I'm not sure what you mean by tools, I use the tool of words I guess

[31-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz I would love to get the AMD's working. Do you think the radeon 7 might do well. I was thinking about getting them?

[31-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I mean median and means

[31-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just try to help as much as possible getting word out, writing stuff, helping drive marketing stuff, help where I can with branding/rebranding efforts, pr, really anything I can help with in all that.  And then working on the website and some cool and exciting upcoming projects I'm working on now

[31-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ah, yeah, not youtube or twitch...would love it if someone was good at those things to pitch in

[31-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I picked up some AMD cards back in early equihash days.  Had a few 390X and 480's.  I haven't used any AMD cards in a few years now...

[31-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook So you are like  website designer mainly?

[31-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz so you don't know much about the radeon 7

[31-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> No, it would be nice to get OpenCL working though...hehe    
I think Chris mentioned he would jump on it as soon as they figure out how to get as much as possible out of cuda...

[31-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I'm trying to grow my twtich and youtube, but not much luck so far. Keep at it I gues.

[31-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> my history is very diverse lol

[31-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz yeah, but I mean the features of the 7nm and the 16GB HMB2 memory. I wondered how much difference it would make

[31-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> been an entrepreneur my whole life...literally like when I was 11 I was calling biz op adds in the back of Popular Science
