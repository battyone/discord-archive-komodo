[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Fairly sure I'ma hit one up. already gotten the SQRL Acorns and ordered UKMiners so why not get this on üòõ

[16-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ahhh! I did it...now for the waiting.... going to kill me

[16-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> actual üòõ worst bit!!

[16-Apr-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I just hope its legit 300 on the first order and I am on it

[16-Apr-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> make sure to have a cooler / psu ready üòÉ

[16-Apr-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Piles of them üòÉ

[16-Apr-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Im actually most likely going to place it insdie my threadripper case.  They can be buddies

[16-Apr-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Plus it'll look cool ha

[16-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wind> @Badfish  dont worry. all thing is on the way

[16-Apr-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> VRSC on the edge of great things = Very Possibly
VRSC at All Time Low Price = Definitely

[16-Apr-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Intresting Times

[16-Apr-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools indeed. It‚Äôs showing of with a nice cooler, but that‚Äôs not included...

[16-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Probs give it a crack with a stock intel first. See if that keeps it cool. If not I have a couple other better ones around.

[16-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> stock intel heatsink would work ill bet

[16-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ill bet it wont really even need the fan

[16-Apr-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But 22MHs at 50W versus, I‚Äôll wait for the 70MHs at 80W from UKMiner.

[16-Apr-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Mine will be inside my threadripper case with just a heatsink. All the air movement will keep it cool

[16-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Double the price too

[16-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wind> No fan is needed if mine VERUS with F1-mini

[16-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Wind: if I can place a heat sink on a device, I will... better safe than sorry... üòÄ

[16-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Even if it‚Äôs not designed to take one: I will place one...

[16-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I might go RGB just to match the rest of my unicorn shit üòÑ

[16-Apr-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got lots of glass in my internal doors.. too much LED and I‚Äôll be awake at night... LOL

[16-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> When I wake up in the middle of the night, I dont need to hit any switches

[16-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> RGB everything lol

[16-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wind> yes, better safe than sorryüòÜ

[16-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> RGB = +10 MH/s

[16-Apr-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Thanks for making me buy a Mini tonight @wind  ha

[16-Apr-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @Ginasis Mining Pools  For sure!

[16-Apr-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got 1 GPU in my rig, I cannot switch off RGB without s/w installing, which I don‚Äôt want on my rig... tempted to cut some wires....

[16-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> You just install it. Turn it off. Then uninstall

[16-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Oink wouldn't even need to cut. its just a plug on the GPU PCB

[16-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> My strix 2080 ti has a button right on it to go dark

[16-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nope, after restart it lights up like a Christmas tree again... tried it.

[16-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Then yeah, just unplug it

[16-Apr-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> You would hate my case.  All synced up asus RGB

[16-Apr-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> On a gaming rig it‚Äôs fine, but not in my mining rig

[16-Apr-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> gpu, 8 sticks of ram, all  the fans, the case, an ssd

[16-Apr-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Oh just because its my main doesnt mean it doesnt have to earn its keep

[16-Apr-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Oh and keyboard and mouse

[16-Apr-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Still got a bunch of led fans here... ordered non-controllable led fans for mining rig by accident... I replaced them asap....

[16-Apr-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Just wondering. With BTC now with LN and their privacy layers coming in. How is Beam suppose to be different or stand out?

[16-Apr-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> mimble wimbles for everyone

[16-Apr-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> So is BTC

[16-Apr-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> All right guys. off to have dreams of the lambos from my F1

[16-Apr-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I am just trying to figure the tech aspect

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Way to go  @Oink! Looks great! Tested on android chrome, I'll give opera a try with the data saver cranked and see how it goes. Nice work and way to go  @basti while I'm at it, getting the word out there! This is what makes Verus a formidable community project!

[16-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thank you @Godballz , for your nice words and for testing!

[16-Apr-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No prob man, thank you too for the hard work. Not to mention being an inspiration! Every project could use a few more  @Oinks. This is the kind of community efforts that make me feel that there is hope for crypto and if everybody pitched in just a little we could move mountains. (Merkle mountains?üòÜ )
Oh, works well and looks great on opera mini as well (with data saver on high) btw.

[16-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We‚Äôre going to move entire Merkle Mountain Ranges!!!

[16-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Great, thanks for testing... The bulk of the work is starting now.... converting the FAQ‚Äôs and How-To‚Äôs in a readable format.... üòÇ

[16-Apr-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> (Every crypto project needs some pensionados with time to spare...)

[16-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> @Oink working with Seamonkey. Just one note: Under "Phase 2", last line, "It will some work to get it finetuned, though" could use a little rephrasing üòâ

[16-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yeah, indeed, it does...

[16-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> But setup is appealing to me

[16-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Content is not really my strong suit...

[16-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Oink working fine from what I can tell on iOS (iPhone X). Looks great!

[16-Apr-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Tnx for the feedback!

[16-Apr-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Anyone see the order book on DP from like 2 hrs ago? And another üê≥ is born üòÜ

[16-Apr-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 37% up today üòÉ  so far.

[16-Apr-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink  Looks good and works with Tor Browser and Waterfox - just didn't check for all the links

[16-Apr-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Still working on the FAQ‚Äôs, so NP.... I‚Äôll have a clicking session when I‚Äôm done with those...

[16-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth How's production getting along? ^^

[16-Apr-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> It's going well,  just talked to the factory cause they had to make some minor adjustments since the circuitry inside the V was too thin, so we got that resolved.

[16-Apr-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I should be receiving them in a week to a week and a half

[16-Apr-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll make a post updating the status when I have an estimated date to receive them,  the day I receive them,  and the day I ship out the preorders

[16-Apr-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So, how many orders did you finally get?

[16-Apr-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 2 lol

[16-Apr-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I got them manufactured anyways in the hope that there will be more orders later

[16-Apr-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Which is something I try to avoid but I really like the project

[16-Apr-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thanks for the support, @Draeth

[16-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Any time! Keep up the great work!

[16-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Still on it, but I‚Äôm going to call it a day....

[16-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Whoa whoa whoa, what on earth will I ever do if my "V" doesn have ridiculously small circuitry? üòÇ 
Jk  
The coins look awesome. If it isn't too much trouble to answer again and since I'm sure it's already been said, but how would one go about getting one again?

[16-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[16-Apr-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Https://physicalcryptocoins.com

[16-Apr-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Awesome! Thanks  @Draeth!

[16-Apr-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Np!

[16-Apr-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> there's a good chance that in 10 years all will regret not to have ordered their hard coin ^^

[16-Apr-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In that case getting a numbered one, will be a good investment.... everybody here should see the investment value and buy one!

[16-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And #1 will be the most valuable...

[16-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> first series will not be much worse, too ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I got #1...ü§£

[16-Apr-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But you‚Äôre right

[16-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> of course only if Dreath doesn't mess it up ... what did we nagotiate again Draeth? üë• üòâ

[16-Apr-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lool

[16-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll give you number 1 if you buy the remaining 98 coins üòù jk

[16-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hehe ^^

[16-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> But yea,  I def need to keep track of each individual one to make sure the right number goes to the right place

[16-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Same thing with the pure silver pirate coin im designing

[16-Apr-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess right now it's still not too difficult üòâ

[16-Apr-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol Yea, not too bad atm

[16-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hey!!! Don‚Äôt!!!

[16-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If i buy 10, 11 and 100, I‚Äôll have a ‚Äòdigital‚Äô set...

[16-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I think your on to something.... maybe I should add in a number request to the order form

[16-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At a premium, of coarse!
