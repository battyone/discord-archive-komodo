[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I also need to check where I can cut a bit off

[07-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’ll just have to wait for mining payout, which will probably be April 8th....

[07-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> so, here's something cool. I sponsored a couple videos by Voskcoin, who has a pretty decent size audience. i'm hoping to not only get a bigger spotlight on my shop, but a spotlight on projects like Verus and Pirate. The videos should be up next week. i told him to make sure to mention Veruspay as well

[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> He should be reviewing my stuff and the verus physical coin currently in preorder

[08-Apr-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Awesome! Thanks @Draeth ! Love the design 😃

[08-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @sundownz On the veruscoin.io page there's a link to a profitability calculator (I never noticed it before, but that's probably me):

I know the answer is 'a bit' late, but better late than never...

[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Thanks Oink

[08-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’m in the process of putting all FAQs, How-To’s and other information that can help (new) users in operating their wallets, running miners and so forth in a central place.
Presently I have my own how-to bootstrapping and the faq’s from our #faq-chosen copied and online. I’m still reviewing / renaming / editing / supplementing this info.
What I would love is others to add to, review and rectify this info too.
For now I put that info on my github, but it is my intention to put it onto the veruscoin github and finally create a full-blown help section on the veruscoin website, to reduce the risk of being overwhelmed with help requests of new users in the (hopefully near) future.
You can send your comments to me. If you want access on the repository, that can be arranged.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Oink thank you!!! How are you with web sites 😉 ?

[08-Apr-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My web knowledge is about 15 years old....

[08-Apr-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But as it turns out, I still pick up skills pretty quick!

[08-Apr-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I see what you mean, @miketout . The present website is just 1 page with referrals to other pages. Hardly more than a Point of Presence. If a FAQ and/or How-To is added, it needs some work. I had a look at the source and it’ll take me a fair amount of time, but it’s worth a shot...
After I’m done with the FAQ’s...😇

[08-Apr-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kiramine.com - x23a1s> hey there verus community, can somebody tell me how big the blockchain is at the moment ?

[10-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Unknown I think vidulum.app has a web wallet that supports Verus

[10-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Hey everyone. So, I usually require 20 coins to be preordered before I get the manufacturer to start producing the coins,  but considering I have no preorders yet and the fact that I truely love the design of the coin, I'll cut the my pre order requirement in half (the reason I have this requirement is so that I know there is interest and I won't be stuck getting a bunch of coins manufactured that nobody ends up buying).

[10-Apr-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> How much again?

[10-Apr-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Apr-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Draeth count me in too...

[10-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Awesome

[10-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are...

[10-Apr-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 😃

[10-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Draeth just ordered.... is the coin sent yet? 
Are they sent now?
Or Now?
Are they here yet?

[10-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you know you can adapt the number of confirmations in Veruspay this suit your needs?

[10-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol Just received your preorder

[10-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Yep, I went over all that with John

[10-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I left it as the default cause I haven't had any issues,  but I'll probably drop it to 5 confirmations

[10-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 20 seems unnecessary

[10-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 20 confirmations is the standard setting... a bit over the top for these kinds of orders...

[10-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you buy a car, that’s a different story, though...

[10-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> By the look of the exchange rates, it looks like I screwed you.... happened to buy at a high....

[10-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Im not worried about it lol

[10-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I have faith in verus

[10-Apr-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I dropped the # of confirmations requirement to 8. That should bre good right?

[10-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That should be sufficient... You'll be safer than DP!!!

[10-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[10-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Oh btw, the image of the coin on the website is missing the sequential numbering i added to it (didn't want you to think I forgot about it)

[10-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I have it on the back side to the bottom right of the eye

[10-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So now every coin will have a unique number

[10-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth order finished ^^

[10-Apr-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Nice!

[10-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So I have nr 1, you have nr 2....

[10-Apr-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> according to order no., it's 595 😉

[10-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How many did you order??? 🤪

[10-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lool hes talking about his order number (order numbers are cumulative throughout all orders placed on my site)

[10-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So Oink, you were the first person to order the Verus coin, so you'll have the #1 coin

[10-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Thoskk will have the #2

[10-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know..... just pulling his leg....

[10-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Ahhh lol

[10-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you get a share of the pi, @Draeth ?

[10-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I did, thanks!

[10-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Bon Appetit...

[10-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Btw, did you enter a submission for the pirate slogan on Twitter? (I got so many I haven't read them all yet)

[10-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I read it, but I couldn’t come up with a catchy one....

[10-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Gotcha. Well, here's a little secret: there mayyyy be a free coin given out too for the winner on top of the 500 ARRR

[10-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> (One of the pure silver pirate coins)

[10-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> There will only be a total of 50 ever made too

[10-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hehehe, i think I’ll Twitter this screenshot I just made.....

[10-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Nooo! Lol

[10-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Y not?

[10-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Kinda want it to be a surprise for most people

[10-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... and then you post it here... lol... while I’m online... it’s a public secret now...

[10-Apr-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I figured most people who posted their slogan idea aren't in the Verus discord. Either way, you can if you want

[10-Apr-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Just make sure to tag me

[10-Apr-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You already have that many replies to read....

[10-Apr-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’ll do...

[10-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It closes the 14th, right?

[10-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Correct

[11-Apr-19 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> If anybody watches voskcoin on YouTube, check out his video today. At 7:25, I'm in it and he briefly shows my site and mentions verus

[11-Apr-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'm a little disappointed he didnt mention pretty much anything I asked him to, but I'm hoping he will in the second video I'm in

[11-Apr-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> “Veruscoin—Breaking through the blockchain impossible triangle"，what about this slogan？😏

[11-Apr-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vrsc.52hash.com> 不怎么样

[11-Apr-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> 为什么呢

[11-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm waiting another 12-24 hours on satisfying updates from UKminer, then i'll start the refund circus. i'm deeply disappointed with them for a number of reasons other than the actual (probably existing) hardware alone.

[11-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> what a 💩 show

[11-Apr-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I understand your feelings... I’m pretty disappointed in the lack of communication and the continuously promising to communicate, but no sign of progress...

[11-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> your diplomatic skills outrun mine by miles.

[11-Apr-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Well the hardware definitely exists, I’ve been developing on them. Software-wise just have a wait a little longer till I get it pool ready.

[11-Apr-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vrsc.52hash.com> 😲

[11-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 我想知道谷歌翻译是否有用

[11-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
