[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> and WP

[10-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> I did not see it in the WP but have not tryed the faq yet. where is it it tho?

[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @PascalV Seriously? And whose market is growing? Maybe Bitcoin 10,000 is worth? or the first hundred coins rose in price?

[dscrdvrsc] <PascalV> @Takoy_Nahal  your are right .... all go down of course ... but some resist üòâ

[10-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Verus in my opinion well resists)

[10-Dec-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Verus is releasing timelock + have PoS so it should be going down all the time, otherwise it means the project's value is increasing steadily.

[10-Dec-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Read this about the new algorithm created by equihash developers and implemented in Zcoin. Interesting article

What is MTP (Merkle Tree Proof) and why it is important to Zcoin
Zcoin is working to be the first cryptocurrency to implement MTP as a proof of work algorithm and work is ongoing.

[10-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> MTP is very interesting but as-is is widely thought to be asicable.

[10-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> They write that in this algorithm all types of miners have equal opportunities. But Progpow is interesting too.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That is a market dropoff, Bitconnect...
Verus is doing just fine.
I don't know why people insist it isnt  @PascalV

[11-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> If verus does nose dive, remember me plz, I would like to buy some of that nose dive. :smiley_abused:

[11-Dec-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> i have 3   i9-9900k/ NVIDIA 10809ti SC2 Hybrids. not sure if its worth mining anymore with normal hardware. was guided over to verus recently and reading up, not much info on the site, seems kind of empty compared to other cryto sites. not muich in the way of explaining things for noobs like myself.

[11-Dec-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> it seems nicehash profitability is very low , 40-60 cents per day per hardware. which is kind of crappy if you ask me. i mean cmon, thats like 15 bucks a month. for one  pc.  and thats not even half the what the power bill is gonna be. >_<

[11-Dec-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> i feel like the earning power of high end consumer PC"s is extremely under achieved somehow.

[11-Dec-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Wild guess would be 4-7 vrsc/day. 0,00012 - 0,00021 BTC. Hard to say now that FPGAs are on the network, raising difficulty for CPU and GPU. A fork might happen, but this is where we‚Äôre at until then.

[11-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> lol its almost like i should just spend 20,000 on some fucking ASICS  >_<  sigh sigh

[11-Dec-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> even so i dont think its really worth it unless it was a massive bank of them

[12-Dec-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Feifeirun> What happened ? DP down

[12-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> it's working now

[12-Dec-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zanzarismo> Yeah, back up and running fine

[12-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Question... if we are able to get an update out and the fork quickly, but Chris, Pallas, or someone else can't update the GPU miners immediately, would people want to go forward with CPU only at first, or wait for GPU support? FPGA will likely follow, but will pretty certainly not have the same speed or efficiency delta we are seeing now. If they don't follow, it will be because there isn't enough advantage to justify dedicated equipment.

[12-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> I'd mine with CPU. Sho' nuff.

[12-Dec-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> And screw fpga

[12-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Even playing field. Cpu only again

[12-Dec-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> That‚Äôs fine

[12-Dec-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> But cpu only is good

[12-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I guess cpu only is ok to start...I'm assuming gpu won't be too far behind, so why wait?

[12-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Croot0n> Yes for CPU

[12-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shtirlitz> gonna leave the farm and will mine with processor. only the hash isn't high.

[12-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kotto78> Yeah. CPU's rock.

[12-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103> Again CPU is fine to start with.

[12-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> Well, none of my cpus are any good for verus. Haha.... so I guess GPU...

But I'm happy to just go straight to CPU.

I am currently not.mining verus dur yo the high loss factor.

[dscrdvrsc] <CREATOR> Asic

[12-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I would say it depends on how confident you are with the new algorithm, @miketout. I wouldn‚Äôt want to rush it if the levels between cpu/gpu/fpga aren‚Äôt what you hope, but I trust you guys can make the right call. IF we go cpu only at start though; I‚Äôd like us to take the opportunity to market the sh*t out of this to attract new miners/investors. Else it‚Äôs just us regulars getting a stab at better profits again, with the same low market volume.

[12-Dec-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I think the question may be how this affects pools

[12-Dec-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Dec-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> still more to do

[12-Dec-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Rough idea. Before Christmas?

[12-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i definitely would like that before Christmas üòÉ i don't like predicting dates because it won't change anything. there are always unknowns until it's done, and it's more important to get it right. it will be as soon as is reasonably possible. i do think before Christmas.

[12-Dec-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, good idea. Really looking forward to this fork.

[12-Dec-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> With this fork we can have fpgas for breakfast üòâ

[12-Dec-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's pretty complex this time, as the algo is brand new and focused on a number of strategies to close all easy optimizations for hardware, and many for GPU. we'll need it portable, which is after hand coded is final or in parallel but lagging. we'll need Python for Electrum (anyone up for that üòÉ )?. we'll need Javascript for pools, and we'll need a good miner, which will likely be the nheqminer again unless Chris gets it into his as well.

[12-Dec-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I just bought a raspberry pi and a buying a python book soon. Does this qualify me üòÇ üòÜ I should probably learn the basics before I work on the electrum problem.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Cat> cpu

[12-Dec-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> the portable version will be used in gpu miner so the gpu miner should go hand in hand with it

[12-Dec-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I have a lot more GPU's than CPU's, but I am ok with CPU-only for a while since I think decentralization and a big community is the way to go for the progress of Verus.

[12-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Takoy_Nahal no functional changes, but i'm using the same key for both the new core Haraka and the new POS hash
