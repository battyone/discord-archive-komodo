[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ran down price? Not born out by evidence

[04-Dec-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> producing something more efficiently is increasing supply. you can do the maths

[04-Dec-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Supply is fixed and the difficulty will not impact it.

[04-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> jup, doesnt matter if 1 MHs or 1 THs is on the net

[04-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> The supply structure is at stake, not the supply volume.

[04-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If they run down the price, I will buy more and stake more and make more

[04-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Price is no issue at all imo

[04-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> staking is the free fpga

[04-Dec-18 10:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
Think of it as buying real estate, and the price just went down temporarily

[04-Dec-18 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
If you believe in the project and want to support it, invest in it. Buying crypto right now is universally cheaper than mining it

[04-Dec-18 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
At this moment in time

[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 Oh, I see. Supply stays the same but the supply is limited to just FPGA miners, as they are the only ones who can afford it.

[04-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You are talking against your own arguments here man.

[04-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> On one hand you are claiming they will tank the price, but then on the other hand you are saying they will be the only ones who can afford it

[04-Dec-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah, I was wrong about supply point but the FPGA miners gettin coins for so cheap will run down price as they can sell for much cheaper than everyone else

[04-Dec-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So can people who were getting bigger block rewards

[04-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Either way your arguments contradict each other

[04-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> afford to mine it not afford to buy it

[04-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman there is no company. this is a community project, and i am not working for a for-profit company. i get bounties from the Foundation that I helped create, and the foundation pays much more in total to other community members. It also helps cover things like listing fees for the community, nodes, and more. Finally, it uses its funds for critical things like this for the benefit of the project and community, not for a profit.

[04-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If they run down the price, you buy it and stake it.

[04-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You don't need to mine it

[04-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> My cost basis is pretty close to 0 at this point and I haven't mined a single coin

[04-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when someone mines and sells, they are distributing the coins to people who can stake.

[04-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, that's fine @Patrick ManBearPig . So you agree with me. FPGAs will mine and other wont. Then traders will come and try to buy and sell coin for profit instead of casual miners and interested people. We agreed?

[04-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think people will do what makes sense for them. Mining does not make sense for me so I don't mine.

[04-Dec-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Thats what I'm saying. It will be for FPGA's and savy traders

[04-Dec-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I definitely don't consider myself a savy trader

[04-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and unsavy traders then 😉

[04-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I was smarter 20 years ago. Dumber too though

[04-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for casual mining, we haven't given up. i see everyone else has, but i am hoping we can close the gap enough to have casual miners and more professional miners, as well as stakers of course. when PBaaS comes, we will be happy to have many people who consider themselves serious miners decentralized on the network, as more resources will mean more network capacity

[04-Dec-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> By the way @miketout . I dont believe that everyone is into the VRSC community because of altruism, or part of the foundation for that reason.

[04-Dec-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman I don't either, and I hope and expect many businesses will be able to be built on Verus Coin over time. just the protocol itself is not the business.

[04-Dec-18 10:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
If you’re mining anything right now with a home rig you are losing money. It’s not just a verus problem.

[04-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I made thousands flipping nvidia cards this year. I could cry about that gravy train being over, but think about how nvidia feels

[04-Dec-18 10:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
Think about all the retirement accounts that took the hits thx to trader’s short sightedness

[04-Dec-18 10:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
On wall st

[04-Dec-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It is interesting to me that this announcement seems to have generated more activity on this discord than anything I have seen since I joined

[04-Dec-18 10:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
You can look it up but wall st is eating way more shit than crypto right now.  It’s all relative. Sorry if thats cold comfort

[04-Dec-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig I dont care what the market will be like or what new tech comes along. I just adjust. Maybe this will be a great project in future. But for now I think from people I've spoken to in this community believe that this coin is for FPGA miners and traders. So, I'm out

[04-Dec-18 10:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
Going on vacation is always a good idea.

[04-Dec-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'm not sure why you feel so strongly about it while you have such a small amount of verus. Not sure I would be in such a rush to action in your situation, but to each their own

[04-Dec-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm going to have to 😴 , but there is one thing that we are definitely not focused on, and that means something that is easy to ignore. We are not worried about these miners 51% attacking us. That's actually a big deal. Anyhow, thanks for the discussion everyone. I'll give an update when I learn more after some hours 😃

[04-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout sleep tight budy

[04-Dec-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> Input from a small miner here: I only have around $700 worth of mining hardware so I can't make much from mining. I joined Verus in the beginning because it was enticing from a small miner to actually be able to make some decent coin. I stuck around because of the community and have no regrets, and will continue to mine. I think a lot of smaller/ new users of crypto might have the same mindset as me. "Oh look something I can make beer money with, neat." I feel if Verus allows fpgas to continue then that would be the end of any new users being enticed into trying out the coin and thus wouldn't stick around to find out how awesome the community we have built is. I don't feel that would mean Verus would fail, but I think it would slow our growth. Just my 2 cents.

[04-Dec-18 10:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
This is one of the only ecosystems that will be around in 10yrs time.

[04-Dec-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @evilwar I agree

[04-Dec-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But this is the current market situation no matter fpga or not

[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Last year a this time I could make $1000 in an hour of arbitrage trades, today I can barely find $1 worth

[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Patrick ManBearPig for some people, this is actually a lot of VRSC sir. Mining that 500 VRSC with current difficulty means running your typical gaming CPU and top shelf GPU on home PC for over a year ... So just understand his side 😉 And 5 years, for typical notebook ^^

[04-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'm not saying that to belittle the amount of coins, but that with 500 coins and the current market situation why rush to action?

[04-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and paying £1000 worth of lecky

[04-Dec-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well how much would it cost to buy 500?

[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Sell and buy back at a lower price point, sure, but this trashing all my toys and taking my ball home reaction seems premature

[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig Some people enjoy being part of projects and building a portfolio

[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So sit on the 500 and see what happens

[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> what do you mean @Patrick ManBearPig ?

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> No, because its a good time to seel

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or set a sell order at 10k sats

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> sell

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig I am as soon as i figure out how to use the exchange, lol

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
You could buy 500 for around $80

[04-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I had to sell some and cash out recently because I need the fiat, and it suckssss

[04-Dec-18 10:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
Its not rocket science

[04-Dec-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Is this fpga datacenter or whatever in China? They should let me go visit

[04-Dec-18 10:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
The bull market is over for now, there is no more low hanging fruit anywhere in crypto town

[04-Dec-18 10:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
You either believe in it and buy with both fists, or you go home.

[04-Dec-18 10:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
When and if the next bull market comes around, you cash out or keep hodling. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum

[04-Dec-18 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
I’m about 5yrs into this fantastic disaster/paradigm shift, and I’ve missed out on enough profit to have set me up for life. But I’ve taken some as well. I’m in it because I know this technology will change the world for the better. Guys like miketout are doing what they believe in. If you dont, then by all means do  something you believe in instead.

[04-Dec-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> @evilwar  yeah

[04-Dec-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I may be wrong but focusing on the algo-miner race is a distraction if anything. Decentralization will never be perfect. It's just enough if it is good enough. Decentralization was ment for double spend protection and abusers - and this is already fine as dPOW works for Verus? Or not? So in my opinion does not matter what algo you use, but if you believe it's most important you will never finish the key features, just be participating in algo-miner race like all the other small coins, that believe they are sth because of the algo. No they are not. The thing is to bring a new tool or new solution, like voting, and focusing on anything else for too much time is just delaying the true features to infinity. First time when I saw Verus project I though - really cool, let's watch it. Then I saw first few months they do not discuss how to make a better democracy - they discuss wallets and mining... same  waste as other projects... Nothing new = miners, wallets problems, hashing algos... nothing about voting.

[04-Dec-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Exaggerating a bit but for a good cause

[04-Dec-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> my 2 cents: nobody runs a datacenter in his house and sell cloud services; why a blockchain service should behave differently? Today, almost every company has shifted to an infrastructure as a service (even Verus wants to be aaS); why Verus "product" should be affected by miners? From a "product" view, imho, mining is exactly the same as powering on a server, it serves to a purpose (the service) not the other way 😃 @miketout I would focus on delivering the "product", shifting the paradigm from mining for profit to mining because it is needed to run a service. I may be wrong, but no real product/service can rely on storage room miners 😛

[04-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes but let's say hypothetically all the miners leave and all the people who are originally interested in this project and all that is left is one man sitting in a room with his fpga- would you call that decentralization?

[04-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm absolutely not saying that's the case to be clear but as a hypothetical it is still a possible problem

[04-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> At this early stage I think it's important for the hash to be as spread out as possible but I believe verus wil turn out okay either way as I agree with what you said in that verus will be a valuable asset regardless

[04-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Diabolik If you want a service (currency) run by one organisation, why not use dollar.

[04-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Godballz In your hypothetical scenario, do all the stakers leave too?

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And why would there only be 1 guy with 1 fpga?

[04-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> These rhetorical scenarios don't make much sense

[04-Dec-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Gloryman  Currency? Last time I read Verus's vision, currency wasn't part of it 😃 I'm interested in a secure poll platforms where an end user can retain all personal informations and still be "authenticated". When I turn on a server on AWS, I don't care if it is made by Dell or HP or custom made with paper and scissors, I only care it suits my needs and it is able to provide the underlying layer. To provide a blockchain corporate service (either US national election or rents hamsters to kids)  mining is absolutely useless (you don't mine ripple or vechain). Please, let me underline "corporate service";

everybody likes decentralization but would you accept, from your employer, a "sorry XXX, we have paid your monthly salary but all miners left to a more profitable coin and we are unable to process your transaction; maybe we will be luckier next month"

[04-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Diabolik all hardware is backdoored. It will not take long until Amazon starts censoring (open source) competitors.

[04-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> They only know about one thing - $$$$

[04-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Diabolik I agree with you about the service being the most important thing. I'm not saying that the service will be worse with that vision in mind. What I am saying is the currency will be largely adopted by FPGA miners and traders and not casual miners or service users. So, in effect the service wont grow as quickly. Just my opinion, call me stupid if you want.

[04-Dec-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what percentage of BTC users are BTC miners??

[04-Dec-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is actually ok if the miners are a separate group than the ones using a coin

[04-Dec-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree in mature coins. But not when you are trying encourage new adopters in my opinion

[04-Dec-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> mining is not a required part of adoption, that is where you seem to be going totally offbase

[04-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I may be biased, but I really can't understand how (and why) a blockchain benefits from an unrealiable tech infrastructure. What if tomorrow I deliver the Diabolik super coin and all miners switch from bitcoin to mine? You may think it is impossible/idiot but a company needs to rely on something more "stable"

[04-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> VTC is suffering a 51% attack, even though they are "ASIC resistant"

[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> ASIC resistant just means there is no publicly sold ASIC (FPGA)

[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> ultimately the coin security is best if there are FPGA and ASIC actively mining the coin

[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree

[04-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so short term, there will be a shift in  miner demographics. long term VRSC becomes even more secure, faster than expected

[04-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> How do you "guarantee" that the miners you need to secure your coin will stay here for the next 48 months?

[04-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree, very long term its fine, imo

[04-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> having a market price guarantees there will be some miners

[04-Dec-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @jl777c would you use (and pay monthly) a phone provider under the following assumption: you may or may not be able to call; it really depends on how much appeal we have on the people running our gsm network

[04-Dec-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> 😃

[04-Dec-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Some projects seem to think people will do something similar-- Skycoin for example. Internet based on blockchain
