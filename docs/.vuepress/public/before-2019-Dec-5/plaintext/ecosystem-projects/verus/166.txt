[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> why do i have over 8k confirms on coin i received?

[13-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Because you received it 8k blocks ago...

[13-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i thought you only received a few confirms

[13-May-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> didn't know you still received confirms

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Basically every new block confirms all previous blocks.

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> like delivery, costs more for the more confirms

[13-May-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> err more for less confirms

[13-May-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, it doesn’t. It’s basically by confirming the previous block. Since every block uses consensus, you can be pretty sure you are on the correct chain after a number of blocks. So the older the transaction (the more confirmations) the more trustworthy that balance is.

[13-May-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> BTC it costs more to decrease the confirms amount and decrease delivery time of funds

[13-May-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> almost all transactions do on all crypto

[13-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct. Because on less confirmations there is higher risk that something may go (intentional or not) wrong.

[13-May-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @Codeman  you are thinking of gas

[13-May-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> tx fees

[13-May-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> gas (tx fees) and confirmations are  totally different things

[13-May-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I am a bit confused about the latest announcement

[13-May-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> New version of the cli coming out that will be a mandatory upgrade for everyone?

[13-May-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or is it something strictly pbaas related?

[13-May-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not PBaaS related... The CLI & GUI will stop functioning if not upgraded in time... So work a new release is being created now

[13-May-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The TECH PREVIEW for PBaaS is not affected.

[13-May-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @miketout The website should be updated for the newest version too, once it is released.

[13-May-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Patrick Crypto mandatory in a sense... If you don't upgrade you may not be able to connect...

[13-May-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Oink is your website ready to go? Can we try to get yours ready, you add that on the banner and we do the update when released? Do you have a link to the current update?

[13-May-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ues, IMO it is

[13-May-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as it is on the github, I'll have the link to the latest update

[13-May-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll put it in the site as soon as it's there and I'll activate the banners now.

[13-May-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> seems the culprit is found? 😂

[13-May-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Latest version isn't the culprit, but lots of folks apparently 'forgot' to upgrade to 0.5.6... And that one is closing it's deactivation block too...

[dscrdvrsc] <wookie™> geezuz what happened to the price

[14-May-19 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> the entire market is down in sats not just verus

[14-May-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> thanks! I need to send this to the few crypto oriented friends I have 😂

[14-May-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Carlos Crypto Economy> @Oink We have made some changes in the article to reflect that the Verus expenses are just for notarization purposes

[14-May-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Carlos Crypto Economy We linked to the article on our webpage

[14-May-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Someone needs to clue em in at some point. Verus solves literally every issue described, offering both privacy and security without sacrificing scalability, while remaining public (this is something unheard of outside this community, most erroneously believe that in order to excel, businesses must move to privately owned blockchains instead, meaning allowing for a massive hole in security to be an integral component of their system!). It may not be known yet that there are better ways but when word does get out Verus' PBaaS is going to take the world by storm- <https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblack/2019/05/13/microsoft-and-intel-detail-the-deep-seated-problems-with-blockchain/amp/>

[14-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I kid about clueing them in though, really. With such big players it might be wisest to fly low on their radar till things are in full swing but still, where a functional version of PBaaS is already in motion at this very moment, I don't think even those big players with their closed minded views on the technology, can compete.

[14-May-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don’t forget: these are just the parts that this particular journalist picked up and highlighted. But even those points are futile:
- performance: scales with number of PBaaS chains
- confidentiality: zk-snarks ensures confidentiality on a public blockchain.
- governance: isn’t that what blockchains are fundamentally about? To decentralize governance, so every participant is equally in charge (consensus).
- Processing power: by comparing it to the most energy inefficient chain you always look good. PBaaS uses power that is already available with merge mining.

Let them believe in their ideals. Time will tell which model is viable.
(I have a strong feeling I know which one, though)

[14-May-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Carlos Crypto Economy> Thanks @Oink !

[14-May-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Oink plus the more chains that get added the more efficient Verus becomes. PBaaS is designed as such. Imagine all cryptos right now under a PBaaS-like system. The entire crypto world would use the energy it takes to mine a single project and that project itself is super efficient on CPUs AND it is halved even further because it is 50% PoS. Elegant, beautifully designed system, really.

[14-May-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean, I know you know that, just adding to your point.

[14-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-May-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nettrip> can someone please help me: i want to sent VRSC from my private wallet to stex,  but there always comes the following error message: "Unknown error
An unknown error occured, if you are sending mined funds, check that you have shielded them to a private address before attempting to send"  ......what did i have to do and how did i create a private address?

[14-May-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @nettrip I don't know if I understand the details of what you have done that isn't working. If you have mined or staked those funds, it may be that you need to create a private address in your wallet in the "receive" screen, then in the send screen, select "shield all recent coinbases" and shield your coinbase transactions to the new private address. After they have been shielded once, they can be sent to transparent addresses and used normally.

[14-May-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @miketout  we already addressed him in #community-support  and waiting for his reply 😉

[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> @miketout I saw in your announcements you said we had to upgrade. I am running gui wallet and on the website it says it is still v0.5.6. I already have that one. Is there a newer one out or coming out. Thanks

[14-May-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @gamer278  please check pinned message in #gui-wallet , latest version is 0.5.6a ^^

[14-May-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> iirc, the website also would lead you to github. So there's nothing magical, you just should choose the one for your operating system 😉

[14-May-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> extraction and application procedure are still the same.

[14-May-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just extract to a suitable folder, and run agama.exe

[14-May-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if it takes too long, you could try the bootstrap procedure pinned in #community-support , or maybe check if Oinks fix applies, which is pinned in #gui-wallet

[15-May-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Same. Sorta sad. Perhaps it's time we start letting go of antiquated centralized exchanges in favor more PBaaS-like solutions. I've message a few struggling projects too that at one point had legitimate use cases but for one reason or another, began to fall apart (insecure chain, poor former managment or algo choice, etc) so they might consider a potential future coin swap to get more onboard to join the next big evolution in blockchain technology. 😁

[15-May-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> What kind of use cases are we going to see with this coin and how far out until it is used? Thanks

[15-May-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gamer278 What kind of use? For some examples of use that our community thought of have a look in #off-topic & #pbaas-development . Options mentioned are elections, supply chains, coin projects, but much more is possible that we didn't think of ourselves.
Regarding the timeline: We like to put enough time in it to develop it properly. We had one public test and will be conducting a 2nd public test in the near future. For a release date I can only say: it'll be released when it's ready to be released.

[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> hi i m back

[16-May-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've got a nice discussion starter here. We already discussed it a bit in #off-topic , but I feel more people may have an opinion on the matter:

[16-May-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With mining activities using enormous amounts of electricity from the mentioned Common-Pool Resources (CPR) and that amount ever growing, that would mean that PoW blockchains or even our own PoP mechanism can in the end not be sustained.

Mining is meant as a mechanism to make the chain work, secure it. An incentive to help the chain is offered in the form of a block-reward. Nowadays the majority of the miners don’t mine to secure a network, but their sole purpose is cold, hard profit.

While mining is profitable, hardware developers produce more powerful miners, that use more energy. To feed these beasts, the need to be centralized in areas where energy is cheap. In order to stay making profits, the need exists to keep buying that equipment, which raises the profits to your old level. The only ones making more profits are the energy companies and the hardware manufacturers.

The undesired result for any blockchain is that mining power is heavily centralized.

IMO the only way to keep sustaining PoW is to severely limit the maximum allowed hashrate on a chain. The biggest question is: how?

[16-May-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since mining is done locally, the chain has no influence over the amount of hashpower needed to solve a block, except for varying the difficulty. Since the difficulty is basically the governor for the chains blocktime and depends itself on the total networkhash, using network difficulty is not an option.

Out PoS system uses a minimum UTXO age to prevent from 1 UTXO a second time within 150 blocks. Could we use a similar mechanism to limit a miner from successfully submitting a block to the chain if he already successfully submitted one in the last, say 150 blocks?

If we could implement this mechanism and make the block submission cool down time dependent on a desired network hashrate. The
Desired network hashrate could be dialed in, in such a way that mining on a raspberry pi would give you the same chance to find a block, as an F1+ FPGA. Combine that with a block submission cool down time for new addresses and switching to a new address won't give you an advantage as a miner.

[16-May-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mechanisms to bypass this limitation would be possible, but implementing that the block submission cool down time only works when that wallet is still mining (at a minimum hashrate, a fraction of the power used, to create a heartbeat for the miner) then it would get increasingly difficult to bypass the system.

Such a mechanism would stimulate decentralization (pool mining will be obsolete), reduce global energy consumption, reduce the need to develop faster specialized mining hardware and make it about securing the network again, instead of profit.

[16-May-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just want to add that we discussed some ideas about that in #off-topic  on May 16, from 10:52 pm (UTC+2, CEST / CET DST), so it may be interesting to read there also.

[17-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hm...@Oink- that system is intriguing, well thought out and obviously well intentioned. The problem is that the profit motive/incentive is not merely a by product of public blockchain implementation and infrastructure. It is essential and integral to the mechanisms that make them sustainable and make them thrive. That's the whole point of PoW- No one would bother mining, and thus securing the network, if they didn't make a profit. Then we'd be left with private, permissioned blockchains, which in a sense, is what we already have now, with modern day business systems/organizations and their proprietary systems. If we begin to artificially implement the kind of hobbling mechanism you articulate, it would be almost purely idealistic, and would almost certainly (in my opinion) hamstring the adoption and development of any chain that went that route.

[17-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The reason that capitalism in the context of a free and fair democracy is still the most successful financial system in history (in terms of the broad base of involvement and enfranchisement that it engenders) is the unfettered (sort of) opportunities that it gives for multiple parties to have at it, with the fittest, so to speak, rising to the top. Now, this is an oversimplification, and glosses over many of the glaring problems with these systems, but in broad terms, that is essentially how we can describe them. In essence, democratic capitalism is a human, organic Proof of Work system...literally. So, the question is if your idea of a cool down mechanism is akin to the regulation that is intrinsic to these democratic capitalist systems. Well, yes, but therein lies a subtle distinction. You can't be too heavy with regulation or you stifle creativity, innovation, meritocracy. Of course, if you're too lax, then the wealthy, powerful, or plain ruthless and unscrupulous simply run roughshod over the masses, quickly turning the entire system into an unfair, unsustainable oligopoly.
