[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> thats what i thought. i am just supprised. Hope he will be back soon

[15-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Me too, he is like my best friend in crypto

[15-Feb-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What the heck  @GlorymanRTS!

[15-Feb-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Jk. I'll miss him too

[15-Feb-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hope he was kidding

[15-Feb-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He wasn't

[15-Feb-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Could have just burned himself out with crypto

[15-Feb-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know that feeling

[15-Feb-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> CryptoBridge... get ready for the dump

[15-Feb-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't think most of the crypto community gets that there are community members, with what they would consider, little to very little crypto. I'd put myself in that category. I think Stretcher was in that boat too. 
I like him though. He likes Verus & crypto, a lot.
Sad to see him go.

[15-Feb-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jimboscott Why so?

[15-Feb-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just seems it always works that way...

[15-Feb-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Funny thing - over the last 6 hours I have staked 5 blocks - that is WAY above expectations of 1 block per day at best.

[15-Feb-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Wonder if people moving to exchanges in that kind of numbers that makes staking less difficult.

[15-Feb-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well it's funny you should say that because I have been staking higher than usual lately but the last couple of days I've only hit once so it could simply be luck or in my case a lack thereof. I wonder about that though myself. It makes sense but if so itd be in our favor to hold anyway unless it really dumps but I think the dumpers have already been doing so and most here I like to think are holders and understand the longer term value of the project

[15-Feb-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Nice to know that my lack of luck is making others happy at least! I‚Äôm way under average. Nothing wrong though. ^^

[15-Feb-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @zpajk me? I was trying to be reassuring, sorry if it came off wrong. What I meant was it could just be a random swing of luck too as I've been on a dry spell myself in the staking department but it wasn't so bad just a few days ago. So while you were wondering why rewards were higher than usual, I found it funny because I was thinking they were lower based on my own experience recently.

[15-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @zpajk remember _your_ luck when we did your pool. üòõ

[15-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Godballz rest assured he knows about good luck üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> OoO now I wanna know.. I like lucky stories. Mine here was the first mined block I hit in the solo days within the first couple of hrs. Thought it was the norm and I left it on while I went on vaca for the whole week without a hit, only to find out when I got back just how lucky it was

[15-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> he wanted to learn how pools worked, i showed him.

[15-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we were...about done, i logged off his premises, we minded our own business, and with practically 0 hash he hit a block within like... was it 30min

[15-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well within a time frame you wouldn't even bother checking if anything happened, basically

[15-Feb-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Oh, sry @Godballz, I didn‚Äôt intend to actually sound disgruntled. I fully understand the ups and downs of luck. üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @0x03 no way! Man  @zpajk that's crazy lucky

[15-Feb-19 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cruz#3678 I am also in the bracket of not much crypto. I was always trying to give stretcher a little boost every now and again because he was the best at finding projects and teaching me stuff, such a great guy. It's a pity it wasn't more financially rewarding for him. We new more people like him and less shrewd businessmen, it makes crypto so much better.

[15-Feb-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @GlorymanRTS I agree. Good dude. Really hope he still pops in now and then

[16-Feb-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dogracer> You can burn yourself out with crypto? Damn I'm just getting into it... Hope that doesn't happen to me. I'm planning on years of following this project as it marches towards fulfilling its vision!

[16-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @dogracer don't get me wrong I'm with you on that. Wasn't speaking of this project at all. This one's a keeper for sure at least in my book

[16-Feb-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I know we use AVX when mining in nhegminer, read a little about AVX at wikipedia. Then there is AVX2, Does that make any difference in hash rate? And question about AES, some cpu:s are have superfast MB/s in AES benchmarks, is that used by miner, the speed i mean? or is it just needed and the mining speed only depends on cores, ghz and cache?

[16-Feb-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @fng77 You need SSE2 for "_mm_xor_si128", PCLMULQDQ for "_mm_clmulepi64_si128", SSSE3 for "_mm_mulhrs_epi16", AES-NI for "_mm_aesenc_si128 "

[16-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> As far as I know you don't actually need AVX for mining Verus, but I read that nheqminer might need AVX to work on linux?

[16-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is what I call a helpful answer

[16-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Answers the how and why

[16-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Cool, new stuff to read bout! Thanks  @Cuttlebit

[16-Feb-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> no worries

[16-Feb-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Curious how and what the functions require. No specialized knowledge, but still curious

[16-Feb-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @aelder can you pin cuttlebits response to fng77, that one is good to be able to find back

[16-Feb-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> @boxalex knows what he's talkin' about. the electricity prices in DE are sky high... üõ´

[16-Feb-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103> Exy in aussie land as well

[16-Feb-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Approximately ‚Ç¨0,13 in Hungary.... Whoehahahaha

[16-Feb-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> UK is terrible too. Close to $0.20 üò¶

[16-Feb-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In Holland I payed ‚Ç¨ 0,22 - 0,25

[16-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> By the way, now I see you‚Äôre online... Will the FPGA‚Äôs be sent out BEFORE the Brexit happens? I don‚Äôt feel like paying import taxes over it!

[16-Feb-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Shipping commences around 14th March. Brexit is still unknown here üò¢

[16-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> If we can bring shipping forward then we will try but the 14th is where it‚Äôs set at the moment.

[16-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know, ‚Äòscheduled‚Äô for March 29th... Hence my question...

[16-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> I‚Äôm hoping the idiots in charge see some sense and don‚Äôt Brexit in the end. It‚Äôs quite a mess right now.

[16-Feb-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Agreed

[16-Feb-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm really itching to get one myself... but on the other hand, at current rate, it would take more thant 450 days starting to pay out üò¶ F*cking energy prices here ...

[16-Feb-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just 1 sucked up my mining profits for the past 8 months, so I consider mine to be free...üòå

[16-Feb-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Crypto prices will rise on Monday: my wallet is depleted...

[16-Feb-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, they only wait for us to spend the coins before they rise üòâ

[16-Feb-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and I'm not sure if it's coincidence, seen it too many times ü§£

[16-Feb-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What doesn‚Äôt kill you, makes you stronger!!!

[16-Feb-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but what you don't hodl, makes you poorer ^^

[16-Feb-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Eternally devaluation of shitcoins too!

[16-Feb-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> true

[16-Feb-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Think of it as bonus profit for ukminers if BTC value rises drastically. If Brexit happens, they‚Äôre going to need it.

[16-Feb-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Hahahaha

[16-Feb-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> If Brexit happens I may well go and live in the EU

[16-Feb-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let‚Äôs move to #community-support

[16-Feb-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink well, as they voted in majority for the "hard fork" themselves, I don't have too much  compassion for them., sorry

[16-Feb-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> actually I'm rather angry about them, because they will make things so much more complicated for the rest of the EU just because of a totally selfish thinking.

[16-Feb-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True.... United States of Europe is a mile further off now....

[16-Feb-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> exactly

[16-Feb-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ca‚Äôn‚Äôt we call Trump for funding of a wall around the UK?

[16-Feb-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or maybe just around England and Wales? I think the rest of the UK woudl appreciate üòâ

[16-Feb-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think so too... Is Hadrian‚Äôs wall still intact? (Those Romans really knew what they were doing)

[16-Feb-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it'a only about 1 meter high... but maybe it can be used as a foundation üòÑ

[16-Feb-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should call Berlin, see if we can reuse theirs....

[16-Feb-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think that wall already has been re-used in streets and buildings... but there may be some fence left from the GDR ... hehe

[16-Feb-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or get a cheap-ass wall from China maybe?

[16-Feb-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Have you checked alibaba?

[16-Feb-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> just afraid it won't sustain the strong wind up there üòÑ

[16-Feb-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How about low-to-the-ground wind turbines? Anyone who crosses the border will be chopped into pieces

[16-Feb-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not a bad idea... and use the power for mining... I'm in! ^^

[16-Feb-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Me too!!!! And we‚Äôll sell the idea to Trump for 1,000,000 BTC

[16-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and we tell him, it's the same as Pesos, only the internet kind üòÑ

[16-Feb-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ugh, the sun is hitting my face right away... guess I'll go for a little walk, cu l8er ^^

[16-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
