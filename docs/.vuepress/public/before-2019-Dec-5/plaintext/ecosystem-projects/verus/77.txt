[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I want cpus and gpus to be relevant again

[06-Dec-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> valid option!

[06-Dec-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Emmanuel agreed

[06-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> no...no...hw placement wrong

[06-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> joking man,

[06-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> sorry

[06-Dec-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Lol

[06-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> If team decides to go fight FPGAs - I agree and follow. If we decide to cooperate somehow with miners - I agree and follow. No bad choice here üòÇ I have my personal thoughts on FPGAs acting as a very growth limiting factor for the community, therefore acting as the network effect suppression so basically achievable value suppression too. But I am no tech guy and my point of view is limited to the experience I have. The team could have a different point of view and I will accept that. Lets just allow the team to peacefully reach a decision and act, its all about trust and it always have been, I believe we all await the updates and have already cooled down enough ‚úå

[06-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman You know what you are doing  anyways. Like I said earlier, take an opinion and stick to it

[06-Dec-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ok88 I like your approach, it is very sound and seems like the smart thing to do.  I just think that the community should be more informed, about what the project is handing over, to keep a specific group of FPGA's mining limited... Bc other models could pop up..
Im not trying to cause any bad feeling or doubt.  It's just an opinion

[06-Dec-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> With all of the arguing, not much discussion has actually taken place..

[06-Dec-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Well, it has taken place in private channels.

[06-Dec-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Well, the community is in public...

[06-Dec-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What needs to be private, that can't be public?

[06-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I guess it doesn't matter....Peace.
Everyone have a great day

[06-Dec-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I personally like to hit the Heavy Bag

[06-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I was well looking forward to that and it was a draw , not as good as id hoped for

[06-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Geees!

[06-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah those are the big boys

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im 6foot 3 and a bit üòÇ

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Well then.. Good lad

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We are about the same height

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I was skinny all my life from my teenage years , and im only just bulking up now üòÇ

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Weight is irrelevanf in a street fight

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm 34

[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's endurance

[06-Dec-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Boxing is great for your stamina

[06-Dec-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Heavy Bag

[06-Dec-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I say though, i would of loved tyson fury to win but i had a sneeky feeling wilder was gonna knock him in the 5th

[06-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Release the built up tension too

[06-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> They are both so damn big

[06-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's not like two Middleweights

[06-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> They have gloves.
But they also have 280 lbs behind them too

[06-Dec-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Honestly a consecutive barrage of punches, from them with gloves on, would kill me lol....
They are two Huge guys

[06-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> England needs a Heavyweight that is 6'2 to 6'3¬Ω...
Not 6'6

[06-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üòÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Godballz  what cpu are you packing in your rig bud ?

[06-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @stretcher83 Haha

[06-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv got two quad cores , not much for solo mining , but im still ready to give it ago if need be

[06-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Will you bet 2k VRSC on me?

[06-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha

[06-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Umm

[06-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> If I win, I can be like Gloryman and buy an FPGA and complain about CPU being irrelevant, at the same time

[06-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sure. Some time locked ones

[06-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Should have enough time to pack my bags

[06-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> No not been in voice yet

[06-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Not my cup of tea

[06-Dec-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It would be bloody easier though , typing is not my best form of communication

[06-Dec-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Anyway , bed time for me , Stretcher signing out .

[07-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok...

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I have a better sense of the team's direction, re: the FPGA question.

[07-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hell, I have a pretty good sense. Thanks for the announcement and clarification, Mike.

[07-Dec-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I feel @miketout spelled out pretty clearly what the next steps are, actually, sort of a mini road map- an "autoroadmap" if you will üòÑ on the path forward for dealing with the FPGA question....

[07-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The carrot, the stick, the open mindedness, the firm stance, the clear eyes, the flexibility and adaptibility- it's all in there....
