[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Thoskk did you tell them how ridiculous that is right now?

[15-Mar-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i guess just a disservice to their members

[15-Mar-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> still trying @miketout  ... but I don't think it will be understood.

[15-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can show that yes, we do have FPGAs on the network, and based on price performance of what is currently available, they perform competitively with the best CPUs right now, meaning CPUs are still competitive.

[15-Mar-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> seem's they're quite puristic about what they call a "CPU minable" coin ... and the're judging the whole project from a few numbers. I can't see how this will work out. And I'm not sufficiently motivated to argue with a "religious" miner.

[15-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I second that, @Thoskk. Hard to measure but I don’t see our presence there making a difference either. Yet, sticking us under primarily fpga is just ignorant, no offense intended.

[15-Mar-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm with you, and I also think it's at least not totally openminded for possibilities @zpajk  . However - discussion will not change anything in their minds, so ... I rather spend my time with more important things 😉

[15-Mar-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks for trying to help them 😃

[15-Mar-19 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> let's wait until the panic settles.

[15-Mar-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well. we tried talking to them.

[15-Mar-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> now we're talking about german tax laws

[15-Mar-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> 😄

[15-Mar-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it can be summed up to "whenever there is something thats slightly more efficient than a cpu, or at least offering remarkably more hashrate than  a cpu it is not cpu favourable anymore"

[15-Mar-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> finding yescryptR16 coins labeled as GPU coins speaks a similar language.

[15-Mar-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well... as said before, there wasn't much traffic in that channel neither, so I don't think we lost a lot.

[16-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk yeah I agree. In our brief time there and my occasional visits, I've found being added there to be minimally beneficial both to us and for their own members. The layout doesn't help anyone to find anything new out anyhow.
Apparently they have a very specific definition for what a CPU mineable project is now, one that they're seemingly ok with misrepresenting to their own members that look to them for guidance and one that also technically happens to not fit the standard English definition for the suffix "able" by any account..
I'm making a mental note to make it a point to revisit this cpuminersclub in a bit to see just when it is that they finally see the light and decide to come back around. Matter of time.. ⌛

[16-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Tell them there is a noob mining on an atom cherry trail. So cpu mineable indeed! 😬

[16-Mar-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @zpajk I came from CPU Miners club fwiw

[16-Mar-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> in fairness this is the natural way of things. I've seen many good projects get rotated out because they simply aren't in line with profitability from other coins

[16-Mar-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> They might be jumping the gun a bit (I haven't pulled my miners, or anything), but the FPGA netshare is almost certainly just going to grow

[16-Mar-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> If I do the cold profit calculation, at this moment yes, I am better off mining PascalCoin

[16-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Here are my calculations. 1. 200mh approximately 30 coins a day 2. 0.00002000 vrsc/btc. and btc $3950. 3. 30 x 0.00002000 x $3950  =$2.37 minus electricity, thus $865 minus electricity. F1 miner is 2k. I don't no why anyone would buy an f1 miner to get close to 30%-40% ROI. I don't expect blackminer F1 FPGAs to stay on network for long but we can wait and see.

[16-Mar-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Hello.  Any idea of wallet.dat between windows and OS X ? Can I just copy over ..

[16-Mar-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> should be the same format.

[16-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> After copying over when I select verus. Nothing happens.

[16-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 😦

[16-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It worked... for some reason his Agama hadn’t shutdown all daemons on exit. System restart fixed it...

[16-Mar-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Yeah done.

[16-Mar-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> So I have always noticed the tips/thunderstruck thing....but how exactly does that work? Is there a discord wallet? Do you need to register a wallet somewhere? Noob question...Hardware Im good, software-not so much

[16-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can dm the tipbot directly with the !vrsctip command. That should tell you all you need to know. You don’t need to register

[16-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Faucet and rain functionality are not functional!

[16-Mar-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can transfer funds to and from it....

[16-Mar-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> #tipbot

[17-Mar-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> !tipbot

[17-Mar-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> #tipbot

[17-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> heh. your command was incomplete i think

[17-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> retry with `!vrsctip info` for example, but use #tipbot to do so 😉

[17-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anybody interested to have a veruscoin patch to sew onto his backpack, jacket,tshirt or whatnot?

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Anything new with verus?

[17-Mar-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Anyone know why I seem to only get 5 to 6 connections when I have p2port 27485 open, maxconnections=40, server=1, listen=1,listenonion=1 in the config file?

[17-Mar-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @bishop have you gotten more before from that? 5 is what I always get too but I never changed those values either

[17-Mar-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 5 is what you cap at unless you run a full node (like the explorers or pool servers run). Just stumped why I'm not maxing out on connections

[18-Mar-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop it was dropped to 4 some months ago to reduce connectivity pressure across the whole network. at 4, open connections were often not picking up much traffic in the way of incoming. We raised it to 5 to strengthen the general connectivity and raise average connection count a bit, rather than jump to 6. Raising it to 5 did create more connectivity on some nodes that we were watching, but raising it to 6 might still strengthen things further if the network can easily handle it. Network connectivity overall seems pretty healthy, but if it can absorb a little more connectivity at 6 outgoing, because there's extra capacity on open nodes, then it won't hurt. thanks for the info.

[18-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> verus is one of the few PoS coins I like and participate in, how many of you would like to see a stake pool to get more returns for staking ? I had an interview with Polyshield and can get us added... possibly not sure about the technical difficulty with sk-snarks adding

[18-Mar-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GeekOPS-101> yeah I dont have a masternode yet, id throw my stack of coins in with Verus people for sure

[18-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout How are the pools and explorers getting more than 5 or so connections? What am I missing?  I figured the config file and port forwarding on my end was enough to connect to more than five.

[18-Mar-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is nothing special they are doing that I know of. As long as the ports are open, it should be able to get more connections, and with the explorer at 160, I would think there may be another issue on incoming. Are you sure you have IPv6 support? Maybe @0x03 would have an idea.

Largest volume, I think. There’s also CryptoBridge, AACoin and Stex.

[18-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @bishop  DM me, lets talk about your setup.

[18-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Hi all.  Is it true that modern processors usually do more with less energy? Am considering the viability of using my old rigs. I revive an AMD triple core and despite plugging out hdd 2 and dvd rom , it burns 120watt at rest -.-

[18-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I even took out the dedicated sound card

[18-Mar-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Are you referring to modern cpus being more power efficient in general or verushash specifically as it uses modern instructions which renders older cpus less viable for mining?

[18-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @zpajk i guess for wallet staking and mining ..     figured i use an old rig to be a 24/7   however the power seems too high ..  even my i5 intel 4 cores useless less than that amd

[18-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Staking doesn't require much at all, but mining does. For mining the cpu should support AVX, AES-NI and PCLMUL, else the hashrate will suffer greatly. Older AMDs are power hungry in general.

[18-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> yeah .. my another rig is a pentium R 2ghz    i think its pointless for that too

[18-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if power prices arent your limiting factor, theres some other altcoins you can mine with these.

[18-Mar-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're not useless, but it's not going to be the profitabilitybomb either

[18-Mar-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> There are generally huge differences between old and new hardware in terms of compute per watt, yes

[18-Mar-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Power consumption has trended mostly flat (exception is memory), but obviously total theoretical compute has gone up dramatically

[18-Mar-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> if we're comparing a chip from 2008 to 2018 for example, the newer chip is likely more than 10x as efficient when running flat-out

[18-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> But for mining basically any currency, there are considerations besides pure compute output, like vector extensions, hardware crypto acceleration, etc

[18-Mar-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> those are much more important than generational CPU improvement

[18-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> If you're determined to do your own staking, I would suggest getting a used server off eBay. They are cheap, efficient and extremely reliable. Plus it's cool

[18-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> However they are loud, so ensure you have a good spot for one

[18-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I just bought an R420 for $150+$50 shipping, it came with 4x 500 GB drives, 8 GB memory and rack rails
