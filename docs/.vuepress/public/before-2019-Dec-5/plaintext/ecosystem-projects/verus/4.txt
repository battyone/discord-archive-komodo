[21-Jun-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> great

[21-Jun-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <karero> @jl777c I’d expect a dip in the network hash rate when rewards half as some miners might be tempted to reallocate resources, wouldn’t you? If there’s no dip then that would be an extremely positive sign.

[21-Jun-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it would be unlikely that hashrate doesnt fall at the halving, then again with other coins the hashrate doesnt really change so much at halving

[21-Jun-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i dont think BTC hashrates goes in half at halving, rather the price tends to go up due to less incoming supply. here it is still locked, so totally new territory

[21-Jun-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <karero> Yepp. Only 10 more days ...

[21-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Lanmo> Might dip a bit, but that’s all the better for me. Gonna keep Mining this for a while.

[21-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <sys039995> There is no reward for 1 day. I don't even know if I set it correctly. Do I need to set a wallet?? I'm digging to have 2.2 HASH.

[21-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <osta> 2.2 mega hash?

[21-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <osta> if yes, it can take days or week. Depend if you are lucky or not

[21-Jun-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Can locked coins be moved to another wallet by exporting Private Keys?

[21-Jun-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes, coins dont actually exist inside a wallet. a wallet is just a way to view coins that are on the blockchain

[21-Jun-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK - then how do I do it?   I see nothing anywhere on how to move immature coins from one wallet to another.

[21-Jun-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> The steps for getting the Priv key do not work as described for other coins.

[21-Jun-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> As I possibly understand it - it may not be possible to do this with immature coins because locking them means... they are not really mine on the blockchain...

[21-Jun-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Not yet.

[21-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but if you know the address that mined it, you can dumpprivkey for that address, importprivkey in a different wallet

[21-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the wallet wont know that it was or wasnt the original. possession of the privkey is possession of the coins

[21-Jun-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe the actual address is not clear, but it is encoded in the OP_RETURN that has the redeemscript for the p2sh address, which is basically a standard <locktime> CLTV OP_DROP <normal script>

[21-Jun-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> By the time I figure that out...  my coins will all be mature...

[21-Jun-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> May I just copy all my wallet.dat files for backups.

[21-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> maybe

[21-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> No.... YOU can.... not me - necessarily

[21-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> given the normal script you can calculate the address 😃

[21-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe just doing listtransactions will  just display the address

[21-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> is that a CLI command?

[21-Jun-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> yes

[21-Jun-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> i know very scary

[21-Jun-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> possession of the privkey is possession of the coins - true - but when the coins are locked.... I really do not possess them....

[21-Jun-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> @jimboscott They're yours, no one else will ever be able to spend them, they just have a condition attached to them. They aren't liquid, but they're yours.

[21-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Got that.  Using the GUI Agama wallet, the steps for exporting the Private keys for a transaction are not available it seems...

[21-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Maybe I just need to backup my wallet.dat files on all my boxes and forget about trying to move all to one wallet.

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> We'll have to take a look at that. In the mean time if you go to settings and scroll to the bottom, there's an interface where you can run CLI commands. I would expect it to work if you use the command:

dumpprivkey "address"

[21-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> *of course, replacing address with the address you want the private key for

[21-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> That did give me a response.... thanks.   Now I will try to import that key...

[21-Jun-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK - apparently the Priv key is not the right format...  nothing happened when i imported it.

[21-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I got the Priv Key - and it said 'imported' but no change in the wallet.

[21-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Ideas?

[21-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I did a rescan too.

[21-Jun-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> It doesn't give much output on operations like that, so I'm not surprised it didn't appear to do anything. The rescan should have made those show up though. Which way did you import the private key, and how did you initiate the rescan?

[21-Jun-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Hold a sec and I will get some snippets...

[21-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Also shut the wallet down and restarted it - no change

[21-Jun-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> But, I pasted the raw Priv key.   Not sure if WIF is different or how I get it.

[21-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> Just in case, would you mind trying on the CLI in settings?

importprivkey "private key" rescan

[21-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK

[21-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> To be honest, I only use the CLI personally and have limited experience with Agama, so while I'm the one here right now I'm not the best guy for help on Agama stuff. 😛

[21-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> CLI returned the destination address but transaction not imported into the wallet.

[21-Jun-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I am sort of thinking the locked status is making it impossible to move from wallet to wallet.

[21-Jun-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Otherwise I could be trading locked coins and defeating the purpose.

[21-Jun-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Backing up the wallet.dat file is going to be the way to go here.  I can keep track of 5 of them OK.

[21-Jun-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jam> Is there an exchange for this coin

[21-Jun-18 05:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
barterdex

[21-Jun-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @jimboscott you can see the destination address to use for dumpprivkey for every transaction either in your Agama wallet by clicking on the magnifying glass next to the transaction, or through the listtransactions command, either from the </> CLI section in settings menu of the Agama wallet, or the actual command line. Generally, you can use the </> CLI in settings or the actual command line to run commands not supported in the Agama GUI.
@TexWiller had posted an FAQ submission, which is in #faq-chosen and will be part of the full FAQ in the future. I'm copying it here, just to make it easy to find:
Q: How to consolidate multiple wallet.dat files in one?
 
Answer:
1) Edit the VRSC.conf file on each instance you have, adding the following line: exportdir=/LOCAL_PATH/ (ie /home/user/)
2) Restart verusd
3) Issue the following command (on the verus-cli): z_exportwallet FILENAME (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01)
4) Copy the generated file to the machine who host your main wallet
5) Issue the following command (on the "main" verus-cli): z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME (ie /home/user/export_instance01)

[21-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Cool - thanks.  I did manage to export the WIF private key into a second wallet with success, but your method will work better when dealing with a more global approach.

[21-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> actually, I can't take credit for that. Tex posted it 😉 , I'm glad you have a way, and I hope that works for you as well

[21-Jun-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> a lot of people are concerned about wallet.dat security; my advice, assuming you only have access to an home desktop, is: create a free tier instance on cloud (google/aws/azure). Use the firewall to restrict acces only from you IP and only to port 22,  disable password auth and use a ssh key (with passphrase), use a 2fa to access your cloud env. If you're in paranoid mode, create a new account (ie a new google account) and use only for it. If you already have a ledger nano, you can use it as 2fa. All of the above is free of charge and you can have a complete peace of mind 😉 Also, use only a linux minimal instance without gui.

[21-Jun-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just mine to pubkey that is only on a computer you have physical control over

[21-Jun-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> @jl777c true, but how an avg user can have physical control over a daily used PC? Imho, cloud allows to use dedicated instances and reduce near to 0 all security issues. Lastly, you can create crossplatform encrypted backups (ie from aws to gcloud) and you can be absolutely sure you will not lose your wallet

[21-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> well i guess if you are saying about windows computers, i didnt mean to say keep it on windows as that is quite insecure without some serious efforts (or disconnecting it from the internet). so yes if you arent running a more secure OS locally, then what you say is a good way

[22-Jun-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Best way is to get Ubuntu desktop, not a big learning curve, download agama, go to settings and do validate address. Get pub key and mine to that. Turn it off

[22-Jun-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[discord] <jl777c> and the first VRSC atomic swap has been done!

[22-Jun-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> this is at the cli level and there could still be some issues, but fundamentally it is proven that the atomic swap works (with unlocked transparent coins)

[23-Jun-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <jl777> for now you need to importprivkey for you address into VRSC.  i had tested with a daemon with privkey already imported
