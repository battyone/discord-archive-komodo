[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nope... I‚Äôll wait for an all-time BTC low. Then I‚Äôll ask a refund...

[18-Jun-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Why the delay?

[18-Jun-19 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Because they don‚Äôt refund the coins you payed, but the amount is was worth when you payed

[18-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The guy with the 300 GHash - what is he using? FPGAs?

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 3 GH is wild

[18-Jun-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think so, but I think it‚Äôs farm that distributes to its clients itself, but let every device on the same address

[18-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luck pool is 1st backup pool, Ginasis 2nd Backup pool for that farm

[18-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 52hash is main pool they mine to

[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus price does not directly coorelate, or react to fluctuations in Bitcoin, like the rest of the market does.

[18-Jun-19 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> There are no groups running it, like a coin on Binance.
It's price movements are natural & they are consistent

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Please let us know if your block height does not match the explorer. It seems that vrsc.52hash.com pool is currently on a fork. We do not have other reports of a fork from the community.

[19-Jun-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Checked all my nodes and I'm g2g. Curious of what happened, especially with the nortarizations

[19-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it looks like they dropped then added a lot of hash power and had some very poor connectivity at that moment, maybe even a network split. They began mining very fast on their own fork with more than 51% of the rest of the hash it looks like while the network was split. We attempted to connect to them with a couple nodes, but we never did confirm a connection until it was all over and their fork re-merged. It seems that broader network connectivity came back before it was considered irrecoverable and proof of power used the stake on the main chain, even though he had greater hash power to reorganize him to the right chain. It wouldn't have needed the notaries, but if somehow PoP would have failed, that would have been a secondary backup as well. If it had been irrecoverable, they would have had to reset their chain, but it would not have affected the rest of the chain.

[19-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> So, basically it seems all worked as expected except the pool's network connectivity, and we will talk to him to see how to improve that. Also, it would be good for big miners to spread their hash around.

[19-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> theres a handy list of verus mining pools at https://miningpoolstats.stream/veruscoin for everybodies reference.

[19-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> having all the major mining pools directly crossconnected would mitigate such things, but if the major hashrate loses connectivity...

[19-Jun-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> "crossconnected"?

[19-Jun-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> each pool doing addnode <poolip> for all the other pools

[19-Jun-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Oh, got it!

[19-Jun-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @jl777c i spoke about that more than once with the other pool operators, believe me on that.

[19-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they refused?

[19-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not refused

[19-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just didn't listen

[19-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> well if just one operator does it, it ends up having the same effect

[19-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also, given the special circumstances of the problem we faced it may be wise to have a node or two __within__ GFW territory

[19-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If we get anymore exchanges, I'll need to think about redesigning that section....

[19-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hahaha not necessarily the worst problem to have

[19-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean maybe just put on the site the ones that don't have Verus yet, might be easier at this point üòâ

[19-Jun-19 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nah, that's not my style. There are probably tons of small exchanges around I'm not aware of.

[19-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was thinking in to Put them nicely in 3 columns, like the mining software below. With a bit more information about the exchanges and with their own logo. Then put sites like coingecko, coinpaprika and hopefully coinmarketcap where the exchanges are now.

[19-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That sounds really cool and more interactive feeling. Funny all those little details add up very nicely. I like even the little icons for discord, reddit, twitter, etc. Nice touch! üëå
