[17-Apr-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Oink what do u mean "subscribe", do u mean "describe"?

[17-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yeah, my autocorrect sometimes has a life of itself.. corrected...

[17-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> yeah i dont think that was a binance description

[17-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Apr-19 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôll warn you before I rain tomorrow, so you‚Äôll get your share!

[17-Apr-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Thoskk you have no idea (or maybe you do). I am one of the "survivors" of the bear crash. I survived, and was left with an extra laptop, which i recently sold to invest in crypto and bolster the devastation that is my "portfolio"

[17-Apr-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Oink nice!

[17-Apr-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn‚Äôt sell anything after the crash.... some shitcoins are recovering a bit, others stay down... it‚Äôs hard for me to,leave those coins be...

[17-Apr-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i had to stop selling recently too. made a few lifestyle adjustments

[17-Apr-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I only invest money I can miss. In my mind it‚Äôs written off... I‚Äôll have a look at them in 15-20 years.... It was for my retirement, but that m already retired... LOL

[17-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's why it's better to sell _before_ the crash

[17-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> can this coin be mined on a laptop?

[17-Apr-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure, look at the rates of respective CPUs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit?usp=sharing

[17-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> even solo mining?

[17-Apr-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if you have some patience ... although for single CPUs, pools would maybe be the better choice

[17-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm running 4MHs on a amd A10-9700E. Wich is Little more than a Laptop cpu

[17-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> Thanks. Will check this further once I get home

[17-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> I have a Asus laptop but not entirely sure of the cpu. But I think it has an i7

[17-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Should be profitable

[17-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if you have low power cost

[17-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> How much VRSC earned per MHS?

[17-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> uhm, dunno, don't have current rates at hand

[17-Apr-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Depends on network difficulty.

[17-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think with around 200 - 250 MH/s, you should get a block a day... approx

[17-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> although that's not what youre notebook will produce üòâ

[17-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> yeah, I am thinking just around 3MH/s is possible, dont want to stress it that much

[17-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> a good i7 can get you 4 - 5 without stress I think

[17-Apr-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> based on the calculator 5MH/s will result to 1VRSC per day lol

[17-Apr-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sounds realistic ^^

[17-Apr-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's a coin in demand ^^

[17-Apr-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> how much coin is needed to stake?

[17-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Every coin stakes if you run the wallet in Native mode, but for a daily stake you need about 23k

[17-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> 23 already .. wow ^^

[17-Apr-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> 23000?

[17-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> that is a lot, lol

[17-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> how much is the reward for staking?

[17-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> There is a staking pool....

[17-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Same as for mining, 24 VRSC

[17-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> i see, thanks

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> YW

[17-Apr-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That being said: as soon as PBaaS is live, that amount could go up, because you will be notarizing the subchains. There‚Äôs a fee for notarizing.

[17-Apr-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I did, but there was none üòñ

[17-Apr-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
