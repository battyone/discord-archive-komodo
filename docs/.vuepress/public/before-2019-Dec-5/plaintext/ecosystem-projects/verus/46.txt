[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Gameoverzoin b-addresses tend to be tricky for agama, try to use cli for shielding every one of them separately

[26-Oct-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gameoverzoin you can try as ok88 says. i can help in a few hours. I am sure we should be able to solve it without an issue. @Hollowman9000, I have confirmed, pending full testing of the fix, that staking transactions are not added to the wallet until rescan, making it look to the wallet that the amount has left addresses under your control, though it hasn't. I expect an update with the fix and a very good cheat catcher out later today or tomorrow, just in time for the Sapling and cheat catching to take effect.

[27-Oct-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 you are right, and I am going to announce shortly. all the software protocols and transitions are looking good. the new update with your fix is on its way, and the work on pools and the Electrum server is shaping up so that activation should be quite smooth across the network. I made a mistake on the activation block number, and though I was able to confirm all other changes, testing to see that it activates on a specific date wasn't really an option as much as just not making the error to begin with. The good news is that the working protocol was released some time ago, a new point release with solid cheat catching is imminent, and we get a couple more days for everyone to be ready.

[28-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Sorry to hear that @miketout

[28-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yeah, thanks. it's been a lot of work recently for some great stuff, and I wish all that would be the only focus. the one thing I'm glad for is that we're learning from this size of a scam and will definitely be more vigilant going forward

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Shit happens

[28-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Zec doesn‚Äôt even have electrum support for z-transactions yet, do they?

[28-Oct-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Maybe I should clarify the announcement. Our Electrum now supports Sapling, and even transparent transactions are different in a number of ways. It doesn't have the full support for z-transactions that I believe is necessary for a good experience. Theoretically, you could send z-transactions through it, but there's more support needed to find them in your wallet, which will extend the API in a non-trivial way. We just didn't find ANY support for Sapling, even transparent txes, in any of the Electrum forks.
BTW, your issue is completely fixed in the coming update, and we're trying to make sure we have everything ready before release, as it includes the much better cheat catcher and a fix for the non-latin user names as well. the foundation is considering running some cheat tests  after activation which when foiled, will allow miners and stakers to make something on the cheats that the foundation tests.
Should I update the announcement?

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Phantaruk7

[28-Oct-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Total coin supply, including locked and unlocked is available in the spreadsheet above. I wouldn't say it is a solution that Ethereum wasn't capable of. They haven't done it yet in production. No one that we know of has, and Ethereum's plans to solve it take a different philosophical approach, which ends up with a more complex implementation plan. Verus has a working, elegant, released solution for solving the POS nothing-at-stake problem, which will activate at block 227520 along with Zcash Sapling support.
Probably the best place now to learn about Verus coin is on the project Medium https://medium.com/veruscoin. @benohanlon wrote a great introduction, including public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) in the Pocket Guide, and @John Westbrook 's articles on the nothing-at-stake solution and Sapling give a great overview of what makes VerusCoin different today.

[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> @miketout  thx but i don¬¥t know why i¬¥m getting only 300-400mh/s with a 24 core xeon skylake when some people get 500-600mh/s with weaker cpu, am i doing something wrong in the ccminer config?

[28-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Zoroaster#5093
Thanks! Those are great to know!

[28-Oct-18 02:45 AM] Zoroaster#5093
Can I store Verus in Agama

[28-Oct-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Only in the Verus enhanced Agama on veruscoin.io right now. it also supports lite mode and other Komodo coins. we have an update in the works right now that should be out tomorrow

[28-Oct-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Phantaruk7 I'm not sure about that. You might check the mining channel. I would expect 24 skylake cores to do better than that. if it's a multicore bottleneck issue, you could try a few instances of 6 cores each or the nheqminer, just to see if that's the issue.

[28-Oct-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> Multicore bottleneck means that the Miner cant handle ALL the cores power and the performance goes down?

[28-Oct-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it means that there may be a frequently updated shared memory location that requires bus locking and/or spin locks. on few cores, this may be a very small amount of the total overhead, but as the cores increase, it can't scale, and eventually, synchronization consumes a large part of the overhead. in the wallet and nheqminer, i made sure multiple cores would not have this issue. Chris's ccminer beats my loop by interleaving 4 hashes at once, but if there is a multicore bottleneck, that will takeover at some point and nheqminer would win above a certain number of cores. alternately, you can take advatage of the speed in ccminer and divide your cores among multiple instances that don't share the same synchronization objects

[28-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> Oh i see, is there any tutorial for this nheqminer? @miketout

[28-Oct-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are releases and some instructions here: https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases
I still think you may do better running multiple instances of ccminer to split up the cores

[28-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> @miketout  ok if i run multiple instances how much cores do you recommend?

[28-Oct-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can try one instance at 4 or 6 to see what the performance is, and if it scales to the value you're seeing at 24. if not, you can choose 6 instances at 4 cores or the other way around, I would suspect. i would like to know if after running the test of 6 cores, it is much faster per core than at 24.

[28-Oct-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> i tried to run the nheqminer benchmark

[28-Oct-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> 445mh/s is this accurate?

[28-Oct-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that should be accurate and the ccminer when running without core contention should be at least 50% better

[28-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jl777c @crypto_nate  So then, the VRSC market cap is about $15 million USD, I guess from your suggestion; that would make VerusCoin 282nd largest by market cap in CMC as far as I can tell - if it gets listed on CMC, that is.

[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Morning! Just to be sure, I should ask:
can I keep using Komodo Agama wallet or rather the seed and wifkey for my VERUSCOIN exported with Agama?
the reason why I ask is that Ihave not quite yet understood whether VERUS is a full Komodo clone that will at some point diverge from Komodo or whether it will remain in the same scope of keyspaces... ‚ùî üåê

[29-Oct-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> and how does the wallet on VRS website:
Agama-linux-x64-v0.4.0a.tar.gz
relate to Agama 43c?

[29-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi, and welcome to the community! Here was my answer on Bitcointalk:
You can still use the same seed and WIF key for both wallets and all Komodo family coins. Verus is not really a clone as much as a friendly fork with its own technology and features. At the same time, we intend to remain compatible with Komodo as an ecosystem coin, meaning we intend to remain compatible with formats and share technologies. Sapling keys, for example are not supported yet in Komodo, but when they are, they will be compatible, as we will work with Komodo to integrate compatible changes. We have our own work on Verus Enhanced Agama, and though we expect a lot of our changes to be picked up by Komodo's Agama, they are also making changes, so there is not 100% overlap. We do pick up changes from them and vice versa. We will either converge changes more regularly or rebrand our version of the GUI wallet at some point with attribution. Until then, you should consider them generally compatible with feature differences, and you will need the Verus enhanced wallet to run Verus.

We are working on a Verus Branded, React Native mobile wallet as well, which will also be compatible with the same seeds and WIF keys. Until that is released, we recommend using the Agama or Pungo wallet on mobile.

[29-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> Pungo is very user-friendly interface, enjoy, suggest.

[29-Oct-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm just curious and for all I know it might not even be possible but is there any way for something someday to be integrated into the agama wallet that so many coins share and use something like the crypto conditions so that as long as conditions are met by both parties it would be possible to make trades between two totally different coins without an exchange or third party? Probably very complicated but itd be nice if someday it were that simple for two users to trade different coins easily amongst themselves
