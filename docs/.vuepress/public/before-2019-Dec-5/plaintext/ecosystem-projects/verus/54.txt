[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Version 0.4.0g includes all improvements in 0.4.0f and an expiry on stake transactions to allow deletion from wallets later

[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> Got my wallet set up in native mode. Can anyone tell me the easiest way to view/save my private key. Having trouble finding it. Should I be looking for a seed phrase?

[08-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B z_exportwallet exports all keys in plain text so I believe it would be easiest that way if you need them loud and clear. You fill find the description of how to use z_exportwallet in #faq-chosen. In Agama, you can just copy the private key to clipboard using the three dots in Receive tab, next to every address too!

[08-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B Other easy way for Agama would be just using the Config menu, Wallet.dat keys

[08-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> If you leave the space empty - you will receive a complate list of all R addresses and their keys. That will skip the z-addresses though.

[08-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> Thx ok88! So the WIF code on the right side are the private keys? I found the ones correlated with my public address. Why does it list so many addresses?

[08-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> It should list 100 addresses that are in your keypool. When you created your wallet, you got all of those assigned, and they are yours. This is because Verus uses default keypool size of 100 (just like zcash), which means when your wallet gets created, 100 R-addresses are generated just for you and stored in the wallet. If you solo mine, your rewards will eventually land on those addresses. Thats just how the wallet is designed, it starts with 100 semi-hidden addresses despite showing you just one in Agama Receive tab. WIF is not exacly a private key, it's a way to present them in a nice way so that they could be easily copied and moved around. But it translates to you private key indeed, its just another way of representing your original private key. Check up https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format

[08-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Every Verus wallet now and in the future until our doom's day will be able to use WIF keys instead of the private keys so do not worry about that, you might want to just know that private key is not exacly WIF

[08-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> Easy enough. Ready to start staking and mining. Thx a bunch!

[09-Nov-18 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <crypto_nate> i just need to leave the coins on the wallet to stake?

[09-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @crypto_nate leave `shielded` coins on `R` addresses and run `staking` on the wallet constantly, to be a bit more precise

[09-Nov-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Hollowman9000 you need to state your pubkey with -pubkey=xxxx as verusd param

[09-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Is that something that can go in vrsc.conf?

[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> @ok88  I have my Agama wallet set up and have the WIF addresses on file.  When I try to *import multiple keys from a second computer by pasting ALL the keys on file. I get several *wallet addresses imported notification, however my balance still shows 0 and I haven't gained access to any of my wallets. Am I missing something? Trying to enable mining/staking access from a 2nd computer.

[11-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B you should never stake on more than 1 machine. The best way to copy keys from machine to machine is z_exportwallet and then z_importwallet. I believe you are not using that, but some GUI feature that I have little experience with. But I believe that feature you would like to use needs other kind of an input than you have provided. Can you show which gui import feature you try to use? I will try to check correct format it needs

[11-Nov-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> I believe it is better to use cli for z_import/export. For GUI if you import WIF you should need to restart and rescan when importing

[12-Nov-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney Our next technical/project focus for release of new capabilities is mobile, and we have actually already released some pretty amazing technology that is new and neither well understood nor yet accepted as the advance I believe it is by the crypto community.
Not sure if you know who Emin Gun Sirer is or have noticed this:
https://twitter.com/VerusCoin/status/1060740979714486272
I see his offer to render an opinion on a proof sketch of our consensus algorithms a big opportunity for Verus Coin recognition.

As a community project with fair launch and no ICO, we don't pour money into marketing, and I believe that our path to success in the long run is to build, rather than talk about, better solutions and a more secure and scalable system that proves itself in the real world and with real use cases over time.  To make progress, our focus so far has been on creating the platform solutions that lay the foundation for each next step, but we have not devoted resources to academically/formally proving the systems we have invented beyond proving their correctness to ourselves, advisers, and other community members. Before now, we considered formalizing such proofs as time and energy that may not actually benefit the project more than building the next advance or solution. With Emin Gun Sirer, one of the most respected experts in fintech and crypto, willing to look at our proof sketch when it's finished, we've added that as a high priority item to the work list, and it will take some work to complete. I'm actually very excited about that as our first real opportunity to get broad recognition for our real contributions to improving fundamental consensus algorithms. The people who will be paying attention to his opinions are experts who others pay attention to and represent many orders of magnitude more investment capital than the entire Verus market cap, I'm sure.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout thanks for your detailed responce. I'm always excited to see Verus tackling the real issues of crypto (as there are many). It may take some time, however eventually with continuous forward momentum in this regard, the VRSC team will be recognized as some of the leaders in crypto tech. While everyone else is barley keeping pace with upstream, Verus continues to push to the front. Always impressed, keep up the good work.

[12-Nov-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah  @miketout ! I'm sure many of us support the technological advances and many more support your vision of the future. Where so many others like to talk, you and your team consistently lay down solid work, pushing not only this project forward but the field itself. The great cryptographers before you would be proud. Looking forward to the advances in mobile and whatever else!
