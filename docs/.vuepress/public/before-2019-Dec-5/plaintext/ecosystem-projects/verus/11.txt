[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> I have 4 threads going, when you minimise and then maximise the mining bit that number resets to zero however it still says 4 threads.   Have increased to 10 now 😄

[29-Jun-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> do we know what the total supply of veris coin will be ?

[29-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> or what they are worth ?

[29-Jun-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <capo100> might want to check trading for price.. it may be to early to get an accurate number, until it hits an exchange.

[29-Jun-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> do we know total supply ?  and how come no one is talking about this coin except for crypto ritch ?   s this a really new coin ?

[29-Jun-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <capo100> not sure of the total supply.  but the white paper looks really good.

[29-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> 80m total supply. currently around 20m i think? no sure check explorer.veruscoin.com

[29-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> or whatever the site is

[29-Jun-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> FYI everyone I am suggesting something for Komodo that you may want to have a say on because it could benefit. It's an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not official KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

[dscrdvrsc] <superbergs> I have two cores in my laptop so do i enter thread count as 1?

[29-Jun-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @superbergs what is your CPU model number?

[29-Jun-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @capo100 You can increase this number to the maximum number of threads your CPU is capable of running.   Any more is pointless and could even be counterproductive

[29-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Why did you say your laptop has 2 cores?

[29-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Most modern Intel CPU's have two threads per core.

[29-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So AMD might be this way also - not sure.  But try 5 threads for sure.

[29-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> No, it's a dual core excavator CPU.

[29-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> for 5 total

[29-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> they're counting it weirdly

[29-Jun-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> ahhhh

[29-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Like Monty Python's Holy Grail.... 1,2... 5

[29-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> How many threads should he try then?

[29-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Try 2 at the max.

[29-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just curious - would trying too many potentially cause problems?

[29-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Nothing that rebooting wouldn't fix I don't think.

[29-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> system might become unresponsive.

[29-Jun-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That's what I was sort of thinking too.

[29-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless the wallet detects the max number and ignores any input over that.

[30-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I've added infos about circulating supply. The "actual circulating supply" dashboard will (or, better, should 😃 ) update every time a timelocked block opens. Basically, sums "mined/minted non timelocked" + "timelock expired". The query behind is rather complex and may have wrong values; I'll keep it monitored but let me know if you find any bug. As usual, here --> http://35.231.87.124/

[30-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Not sure where this should go exactly, but the faq for setting up staking seems to make no sense at all for those with the GUI wallet (the commands listed return as errors).   How does one manage their coins for staking using only the CLI commands available in the 0.3.9 CLI command set?

[30-Jun-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @jimboscott you mean staking but not mining? I believe you are always staking when mining. In the GUI if you set the number of threads to 0, you are staking. Have you tried that with the CLI?

[30-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> If you are already mining with one process you can try this 
./verus setgenerate true 0

[30-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Or when starting  try 
./verusd -gen -genproclimit=0

[30-Jun-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I know that's what it says, other sources state the coins must go to a Z address first, then come back to a public address before they will stake.   That is what I am wanting solid guidance on.

[30-Jun-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> That‘s true for mined or minted coins

[30-Jun-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Here's what I wrote in #faq-draft about time locked coins & staking:
The Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining or staking (reward transactions) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that’s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the „Send“ screen and use „Shield a coinbase transaction“ (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you’ll automatically start staking.

[30-Jun-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <penguin> Is there an issue with my wallet, if a transaction of a found block (192) displays a destination address which is not mine? (GUI wallet)

[30-Jun-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
b address ?

[30-Jun-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @penguin Go to Agama's settings, select wallet.dat keys menu, pick VRSC, click get keys. Check if there is a key that you have mined into and I am pretty sure it is there. That means you are mining to your wallet.

[30-Jun-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @penguin in the GUI, all mined blocks go to a new unique address in your wallet. There is a way to make them all go one place (-pubkey) via CLI, and that will be added to the GUI in the future

[30-Jun-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <penguin> @ok88  Perfect, had forgot about that! @dukeleto , Thank you both

[dscrdvrsc] <bigmopap> I started mining using my labtop back in June 17 and have 384 at immature status. how long before it gets to be matured

[01-Jul-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigmopap> and how long before you start to get new rewards . i get 45 mhs

[01-Jul-18 12:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
0.0045/500*1440*192

[01-Jul-18 12:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
0.045/500 * 1440 that is how many blocks a day roughly (network hash at 500)

[01-Jul-18 12:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But the luck plays a part

[01-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @bigmopap you could calculate it like this (but remember this is just a statistical probability): you have 45MH/s. The network is at 380 GH (varies). There are roughly 1440 block rewards, in theory 50% for mining and 50% for staking. Thus 720 minable block rewards per day. With your power 45/380000*720 = 0.085 blocks per day. Or 11.7 days for one block. I guess network hash will increase soon.

[01-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbergs> @jimboscott thanks mate i appreciate the help!

[01-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
just in case, I noticed that it seems that dynamically changing the genproclimit via setgenerate true XX end up in going very slow if the point is to go up : an example : I start with genproclimit=1, 20MH, then go to genproclimit=20 : move very slow to 40 MH.
When I just stop it and restart directly with a genproclimit=20 : I go directly to 240 MH

[01-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
and it keeps stabilized at that hashps

[01-Jul-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> <dwy> that is because it does a simple average with how long the current node has been up. If you sync without mining (which is recommended), then turn mining on, the hashrate slowly climbs to what you expect. But if you stop and restart, you will stabilize on the correct hashrate very quickly.

[03-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> That Colin Andrews interview sent me on the path to mine Verus , and I am here with a question about thread counts and expected  mh rate.

[03-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> If my processor is an amd ryzen 5 1400 quad core ( 8 cpus) 3.7 ghz, should I be running my thread count at 2 or 4 ?

[03-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> And, if my MH rate is  37.9 /s   @ 2 threads, is that good or should I be seeking more

[03-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> Nevermind, I take back my question and will refer to the cpu hashrate guide

[03-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> Thanks for your patience, no assistance is required ;p

[03-Jul-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @n3rfed Run every thread you can - that would be 8.  My son mines this on a Ryzen 5 and he is getting around 170 I think.   I am hashing about 1.3 Gh/s here and I get 2-4 blocks per day.  One Ryzen 5 is probably going to find a block every 4 days or so, but luck might be such that you get two in a day... or none in two weeks.

[03-Jul-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> thanks for the good tip. Should I be worried about overheating if I run 8 ?

[03-Jul-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @obbi I'm back to help the day after tomorrow, but this can't be the actual message, as there is no directory in that location that is used. can you please post the exact steps and messages on community support? i have very spotty internet right now, but I will look in about 8 hours, and if I can help, I will. I suspect that if you post specific and correct information, others may be able to help as well.

[03-Jul-18 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it would also help to know where the message you are seeing comes from. for example, is it from the command line or debug.log?

[03-Jul-18 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @n3rfed I would just monitor it to see where it gets up to.   Obviously you do not want to truly overheat, but I tend to think that people get worried about overheating well before overheating actually happens.  I mean, there are thousands of posts about people freaking out that their GPU's are running 70c.
