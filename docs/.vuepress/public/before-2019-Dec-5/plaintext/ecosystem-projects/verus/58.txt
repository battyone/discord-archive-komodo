[dscrdvrsc] <newmanireland> Hi all what is circualtion of this coin?

[27-Nov-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Hi! welcome to the community! You can see current circulation, etc here: https://explorer.veruscoin.io

[27-Nov-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It's right about 35MM I think

[27-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <newmanireland> 35 million?

[27-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> right

[27-Nov-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <newmanireland> Wow that's a lot

[28-Nov-18 12:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Godballz Verus sharing their innovations with Komodo helps benefit Pirate yes.

[28-Nov-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GeoAloha> @newmanireland  most of the current supply is timelocked (almost 2/3) and will be released at a linear rate over the next two years or so -- the total available (usable) supply right not closer to 12 million (there's wonderful a spreadsheet somewhere that calculates the available coins based on blockheight).

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> On the explorer, I expected to be able to search all available wallets and balances, but couldn't find a way to? I know privacy is a core feature and principle of this project, but I figured the R addresses might be searchable...or am I just looking in the wrong place? Agama wallet.

[29-Nov-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> once i export them, which one can i mine to?

[29-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> They're just keys. The blockchain keeps track of your balance. Mine to whatever address you know that you still have access to. Reminder: Always backup your wallet before doing big changes. You're in charge of your own money.

[30-Nov-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like that Verus is growing and is listed in more places, however much of aacoin is difficult to navigate if you only speak English. Here is what seems to be a direct link to the btc/vrsc trading section of aacoin- https://www.aacoin.com/#/trade?symbol=VRSC_BTC

[30-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That didn't work.. ☹

[30-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well vrsc is located under the "pow" tab

[30-Nov-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I recall it being stated that once Verus is listed on two exchanges recognized by CMC, it would automatically cause VRSC to be listed on there? Both DP and STEX are on CMC, so it seems I'm mistaken?

[30-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> DP is not on CMC as an exchange, only a token

[30-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> that looks like some lofty washtrading, 38 btc? and chart is perfectly symmetricly the last hours 😄

[30-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> On aacoin?

[30-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it used to do a trade every 7 seconds, then 4 trades every 7 seconds, now it is reduced to a trade per 16 seconds

[30-Nov-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> Very suspicious trades, it seems that the bot works

[30-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is blatant wash trading

[30-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> part of coin launch maybe?

[30-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> their launch promotion includes something like 5% VRSC for trading volume up to a limit. I wonder of some trades are external bots using the API and trading the cost of a trade fee, which is fairly low, for the trading bounty

[30-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's hard to know what to make of the trading, but i'm also not an expert. what it seems is that there is automated trading between bid and ask that would likely qualify for the trade bounty, and then I see what look like normal buys and sells that don't move much. It seems the trade bounty could explain what look like bots earning the bounty. if so, then I would guess once the trade bounty is exhausted, it should settle down to something that looks more normal

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Funny 😃 there was just a tweet about this. There are designated representatives of the foundation, which isn't a team, per se. Its a nonprofit organization that was setup with fairly mined and staked coins that it uses towards realizing the vision. Aside from that, there are some of us who work all of the time in a community 😃 The foundation can probably designate you as a representative for this, but I think we'd need your name and I'd have to check. We can have a foundation representative or me do it as well, if you want to DM me.

[01-Dec-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gordon Komodo dm me if you’re still having trouble. Very little changed, but we can try a couple things.

[01-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jonske1 It seems like its been quite a long time, but we paid the fee on October 15th. Some time after, they said their wallet team was backlogged and they would get to it likely sometime in November, and we heard this month that they didn't have a specific ETA. Nothing new since then.

[02-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Well, while other coins rely on mixers and similar services, VerusCoin already has it incorporated.

[02-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> A superior technology, superior to any mixing services.

[02-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> You mean to pay for products and services? I don't know if there is any partnership like Komodo has with Peer2Group...

[02-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> But, with Peer2Group you can have a Komodo debit card.

[02-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Maybe there is something similar for VerusCoin?

[03-Dec-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so what should I think about this now?

[03-Dec-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am regularly looking on AACoin exchange, and though they definitely do have fake volume, we keep being told this is normal in China and have seen nothing else negative. They have been good to work with on the tech side as well. To make sure I have a little at risk there, since it was announced, I keep a small amount of VRSC and a small amount of BTC there. Every once in a while, I have seen a low ask and bought a little, or a very high bid and sold a little. I am not getting filled in the off-book, in-between trades that seem to be by bots. That has been my experience, but I can't say more either positive or negative.

[04-Dec-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> YEs, cheating and faking things is unfortunately quite normal in China

[04-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Umm...so, just read Mike Sr.'s announcement. In pretty much every description on Verus by the team/supporters, inevitably listed as a top feature after triple secure and sapling is asic/industrial miner resitant...it's not even eoy yet, and someone's already developed one. I'm  a huge supporter of the project, so this concerns me and I'm raising questions accordingly. Tbh, the team's approach of the hardware manufacturer to broker some kind of deal struck me as...a little naive? What did they expect in response? That wd be like approaching Bitmain and asking them to slow down their miners cos Satoshi wd have disapproved. I don't mean to come off snarky, but pls take my tone as a reflection of how jarring this news was to me. I took the team at their word that this sort of development wd be near impossible, but more realistically - an exceedingly onerous undertaking that wd likely not be seen for a significant amount of time. If we're hard forking already, then it seems this is just the beginning of the same old story in crypto- the cat and mouse game that bigger projects like Monero have been playing for years now. If it's more accurate to just remove the "equality of cpu/gpu" and asic resistant selling and strong points, what does that mean for the future of Verus as such a strong community underpinned project supposedly built into its DNA? Thanks for responses to these concerns. I imagine I'm not the only one harboring these reservations .

[04-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The thing is, as there are more and more developers and manifacturers coming out for FPGA's, you will be most likely forced to fork them off every month or so unless you build the algo around the machines like progpow.

[04-Dec-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> take it easy,these are all small things.

[04-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I really like the progpow path, every unit is on equal ground etc

[04-Dec-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @jintaa you're not alone.  good comments in my opinion.   What I see is a philosophical battle going on about how egalitarian mining will be achieved.  Basically the ProgPoW argument is that we can use an "extension" to other algorithms to assure mutual cost sharing.  Therefore, "ASICs" could still be made but they wouldn't be anymore profitable than mining with a CPU or GPU.  The other argument (and I'm sure there are others) is that the only way to truly achieve egalitarian mining is to default to the fact that we are human and rely on human influences even if that means tribal warfare (BCH ABC vs BCH SV).  Therefore,  the true measure of egalitarian mining relies on the AGILITY of algorithm developers to stay ahead of ASIC producers or some other source of centralized mining (network warfare).  

ProgPoW is definitely interesting but I'm not so sure how widespread adoption will go.  So far, I'm still stuck at a point believing that developer agility will remain the dominant influence on PoW mining.

Admittedly.. I still have a bazillion videos to watch to learn more about ProgPoW and how it's not an "algorithm" it's an "extension"... okay, but even that lends more to favoring developer agility lol

[04-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @miketout the problem with the mining fpga is they have a rental plans for mining not only sales, my opinion it's not talk with them, you should do something to block them, it's no possible to mining with this rewards at this time. Thanks, good day.

[04-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @grendel25 developer agility is a form of centralization too.

[04-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> how bout limit hashrate per ip address ? 😄

[04-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> people can buy entire ip ranges

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Your philosophy it's changing?? Because the team only want to mining with cpu, now gpu, and you want to talk?

[04-Dec-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> This things don't talk only acting like many others projects.

[04-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> even wth FPGA , if there is a hashrate limit/ ip address , it can only do so much hashrate per ip address ?

[04-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> That's no a solution, fork a change . That's all

[04-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> so if the hashrate limit is set to match CPU / GPU then

[04-Dec-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Fork is a solution

[04-Dec-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Gordon Komodo , if you use a pool, nobody knows who is solving the charade, what is its ip,etc. , except for the pool operator.

[04-Dec-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> then pool will be abolished if the limiter is applied?
