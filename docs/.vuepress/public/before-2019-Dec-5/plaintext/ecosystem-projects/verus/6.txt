[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Thanks for making me feel young ðŸ˜›

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I remember when RAM was 50 USD per meg.   I bought a 210 meg hard drive for 700 USD in 1990.

[25-Jun-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The machines I am mining with would have cost a half million dollars in the early 90's.

[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Did you hear about the guy who implemented SHA-256 on an IBM 1401?

[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> It's good that my parents taught me a lesson. Money should be invested in education.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @SadykovT too cool.

[dscrdvrsc] <aBro> Hi  mates. Is Verus listed on any exchange ?

[26-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aBro> and is there any coin calculator for this coin ? ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Jun-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jay> no

[26-Jun-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> soon

[26-Jun-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aBro> how long does it take for rewards to be calculated and  to appeare in the wallet ?

[26-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> What happened with Crypto Rich's interview with Michael J Toutonghi? Why is it gone?! It was the best interview i saw in a long long time

[26-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I've updated the analytics dashboards; the address is always the same (http://35.231.87.124/)
Again, please, can you share feedback about it? Is it useful? Is it a waste of time? Is there anything that can be useful (here, a feedback from blockchain devs or with some experience will be appreciated)

[26-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> What does not portable mean

[26-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> And what cpus allow this new method of mining @miketout

[26-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> The new version is up.

[26-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Remember that if you're using compatibility mode you don't want this update. If your machine doesn't support the AES or AVX2 instructions please stay on v0.3.7

[26-Jun-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> In the next release we should have a fix for portability mode along side this accelerated mining code.

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal how do I upgrade? or do I need to build from scratch?

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> The new releases are on the website at veruscoin.io

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> so download the cli?

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can either download them there and run or if you built before just do a git pull and build again.

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> or can I upgrade my existing install that I compiled yesterday?

[26-Jun-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That is probably your better bet

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> so follow the same steps, but it will be quicker?

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> or will it build from the beginning?

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> just go into your veruscoin directory (not src) and run:
git pull
zcutil/build.sh

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Here's my update procedure (takes me 3 min for Linux CLI):

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> (using TMUX: sudo apt-get install tmux + links2 Browser: sudo apt-get install links2)
It's important to stop mining before updating from what I understand.
links2 veruscoin.io
Navigate to Linux CLI and save
cd verus-cli
./verus stop
cd ..
tar -xzvf verus-cli-linux-v0.3.8.tar.gz
cd verus-cli
tmux
Launch komodo daemon for virus with 12 threads (set a the number of cores of your CPU, try doubling it later, maybe each of your core can do 2 threads)
./verusd -gen -genproclimit=12
[ctrl]&b d (to detach TMUX)
To check (in verus-cli directory):
./verus getmininginfo
To change threads (from outside the Verus process), e.g.
./verus setgenerate true 24

[26-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> It won't have as many dependencies to go out and fetch, and there are other steps it can skip, so it should build faster than the first time.

[26-Jun-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, but generally installing the cli will be quicker?

[26-Jun-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Yes, unless running on a system that has some dependency difficulties.

[26-Jun-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, so less risky to stick with what i have

[26-Jun-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I guess those won't have bene magically fixed yet ðŸ˜‰

[26-Jun-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> been

[26-Jun-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal how do I check it's finished?

[26-Jun-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I mean, check the version

[26-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> also I did build.sh, not with the -j command? is that going to be a problem in terms of speed?

[26-Jun-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> j something, for thread/core number

[26-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> It depends on the machine, but it will probably be slower I really don't know how much slower, but the build shouldn't take very long even on a single thread if it isn't the first time building.

[26-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, and how can I check the version afterwards?

[26-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I guess I'll see I have more mhs for one thing ðŸ˜‰

[26-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That's going to be your clearest indicator. It won't be a small difference.

[26-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok

[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> @englal Where can I find out how long it will take to mine a block at 38MH?

[26-Jun-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There probably won't be an accurate way for a little while as the hashrate shoots up. The difficulty adjustement is going to be catching up with it, so underestimating hash power until it stabilizes a little bit.

[26-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> But in general you would use the getmininginfo command either in the cli or the cli section in Agama settings. That will give you your hash rate and a best estimate for network hash rate based on difficulty.

[26-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> I'm still just trying to find my first lol

[26-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can then divide your rate by the network rate to find what percentage of the hash rate you are.

[26-Jun-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> .002068

[26-Jun-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I'm getting 50% increase, I read 20x was possible somewhere?

[26-Jun-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> I went from 2MH to 40MH

[26-Jun-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> 0.002068 times 720 PoW blocks per day would mean that on average you should get 1.489 blocks per day. Again, that probably won't be the case since a large portion of the network is upgrading right now.

[26-Jun-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Hope_Trader If you haven't, give it a few minutes after starting up and check your hash rate again - it often takes a little while to stabilize and report correctly because of how it averages.

[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok

[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> yeah sometimes it's taken hours to find it's peak

[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And make sure you're mining with the number of threads you expected.

[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> then on my am 2700 build it goes the other way

[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> and reported double what it's capable of ðŸ˜„

[26-Jun-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Yeah, it can take a while. It's not actually the hash rate settling, it's just in how it averages to calculate and report it.

[26-Jun-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok

[26-Jun-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal getting timeout message

[26-Jun-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Some of this may be happening because so many nodes are going offline to update.

[26-Jun-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I don't have an answer at the moment other than to sit tight for a little bit and see if it resolves as more nodes come back up.

[26-Jun-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok thanks

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> can I make this update for agama?

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> and if i can, how?

[26-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> and...what is "DEV BRANCH OF TREE" ?

[26-Jun-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Sosky, have you built before? And which OS are you on?

[26-Jun-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> i am on w10

[26-Jun-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> I haven't... built :|... i just downloaded the thing and started mining with the setgenerate true n instruction

[26-Jun-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> but I first want to back up this wallet

[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> Save it somewhere

[26-Jun-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> But updating shouldnt affect it but better safe than sorry!

[26-Jun-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> thank you

[26-Jun-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> done

[26-Jun-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> now, how do i update?

[26-Jun-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> i am on 0.3.4 currently :/

[26-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> go to website and download latest

[26-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Forgive the stupid question - when do mined/staked coins become spendable/transferable to other wallets?

[26-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> went from 4.8 mhz to 45 mhz, its like black magic

[26-Jun-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> @runningwithbeer if you have immature blocks, go to more details, and look for blockstomaturity

[26-Jun-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> if you are mining/staking in the agama wallet

[26-Jun-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Yes I am as that's the only way to mine isn't it? My oldest block shows 13544 confirms but my balnce is still zero

[26-Jun-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> click on the magnifying glass next to it

[26-Jun-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> there you will see a number next to blockstomaturity

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Blockstomaturity    237276

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> you need to wait this many blocks until you can spend your mined/staked coins

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> ok

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> which is 237276 blocks = minutes

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> so there is no particular date per se

[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> /60 is hours
