[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I couldn't even imagine yet what level of applications a combination of Open AI + blockchains would make

[26-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I'd really need to read and learn a bit of AI specific applications which could be useful for such use case to get better understanding and then can probably at least be able to express them properly.

[26-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> because you have solved the in between puzzle of making blockchains without requiring special servers and knowledge to create a secure and scalable independent blockchains that's few steps forward in creating some interesting applications. and that's super interesting progress! üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> thanks for this chat. It also clears a bit more better how Verus and Komodo fit together like lego pieces with each other in this whole picture.
It is really amazing to understand that üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I've done some work in AI, both machine learning on images, text, voice, etc. and reinforcement learning, so creating active, real time learning decision makers. Being able to leverage blockchain data with AI is definitely something I believe we should do after the fundamentals are solidly in place.

[26-Jun-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Can you also share some more resources to better understand MMR?

[26-Jun-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> that newsletter post was not as much digestible üòõ

[26-Jun-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> hmm... a home security system can be done with your PBaaS for damn sure with this AI learning capabilities üòÖ

[26-Jun-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> recently learned an article on how to make a face recognition setup. but that can be linked to authentic proof of faces verified by blockchain üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> there I understood a lil use case more üòÅ

[26-Jun-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you making me more bullish on your tech Mike üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Here's a generic description:
https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md
We actually use more advanced MMRs than is written up anywhere, in the sense that we are including proof of work and stake in the MMR tree for the chain. There is a research paper that described using just work in an MMR on a proof of work chain to make an ultra-light client that can validate transactions. Their use of MMRs is closer to Verus: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf
Finally, the implementation is a scalable system that uses chunked memory allocation, templated node types that can include stake, work, power, nothing, or other properties. It also includes a virtual overlay on the active blockchain array (no space used for lowest layer, saving half space with nodes realized when needed). It's quite flexible and could be adapted to other blockchains as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Of course, with the MMRs that Verus has, it is fully prepared to have those ultra-light validating clients made for it as well.

[26-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> these ultra-light validating clients would be electrum servers or would be directly talking to the existing p2p network nodes on Verus Network?

[26-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if the later, then it would be super amazing! no dependency on electrum servers and more better decentralised lite clients!

[26-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you could do the latter, but it would take some protocol changes

[26-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> bookmarked those links. I'm up past my bed time, would def read them. very very interesting stuff. tonight was best productive night for me! üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I enjoyed your conversation. Sleep well!

[26-Jun-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Me too! Great resources too!

[26-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The AI talk and IoT stuff really got me. Aside from some iota uses those broad usages didn't even cross my mind for blockchain. That really is exciting! I'm picturing an android-esque mobile OS that is sort of like linux's open source in that it can learn preferences and change democratically but based on blockchain governance instead. Something like that. But man, yeah, video and audio distributed via blockchain is seems like a perfect fit both for copyright and also for more control to the artists.

[26-Jun-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Man it could open up all sorts of new collaborative efforts for open source development. You could make an open source video game company on PBaaS with developers from around the world and who otherwise would have never met!

[26-Jun-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Could change basic company structure as we know it. They'll have to start up a new type of business course in colleges! üòÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> just a heads up please mine on a few different pools

[27-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> they are too centralised atm

[27-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree. The hashrate should be distributed more evenly, but we cannot force people to do what we want. That's not the spirit of this community.
That being said: Because of the 50% PoW / 50% PoS consensus (Proof of Power or in short: PoP) they cannot take control of the network.

[27-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> naturally however it is important to make people aware a lot of miners dont check üòÉ switching to smaller pools can mean bigger payouts but a little less regularly

[27-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cypher You missed a pay-streak on the pool, but your first share is maturing....

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> this helped a lil bit understanding MMR: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimblewimble/grin/master/doc/mmr.md

[27-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> also read the other GitHub MMR post by Peter Todd. helped a bit.

[27-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> would like to understand how Merkle Root of Merkle Roots of Merkle Roots (MoMoM) might be different to Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMR).

[27-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will read next that pdf link of FlyClient

[27-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Found this a while back when trying to understand merkle mountain ranges, apparently also by Peter Todd. Guess he knows his MMRs.

[27-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Peter Todd came up with MMR idea as I understand. üôÇ

[27-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> had skimmed through that link and next messages related to it. Guess I will need to re-read it again to try grasp it better.

[27-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I get a fair bit idea how things are going with MMR after reading that Grin's MMR description, it was helpful.

[27-Jun-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I only have a general grasp and I saved your links and the ones Mike posed yesterday to read up on. Thanks for sharing. It's not something you just find laying around the internet.

[27-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> true

[27-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> to be honest mathematics is my weakest skill, and only I know how I cleared my Masters with all those probability maths. üòÖ

[27-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> reading that lists link again from the start, and after reading that Grin's MMR, it is making a bit more sense now

[27-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> haven't started that FlyClient pdf to read yet

[27-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha yeah same here with math unfortunately. 
The stuff you said yesterday was really eye opening tbh and presented in a really thought provoking way.

[27-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Talking about Verus as a tool for people to get things done is really big because blockchain to many is just a game to be played but for developers to have all the work done in an orderly environment so that they can actually implement blockchain usages is a huge big first step

[27-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A first step toward devices that use blockchain's unique capabilities to their full potential and completely discrete so that most ordinary people will never even recognize the tech behind the tools they use

[27-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Seems like there would be good reason for a lot of different developers and users to have a safe environment to build on or experiment even

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I just get really excited to think about the possibilities. Really looking forward to all the different and unique use cases and how things might evolve.

[27-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree üôÇ It is very exciting.
The real adventure is the other possible solutions offered by the industry researches around.
You can have a look at them, try to understand them, and it is possible that may be one of them could end up in any of your favourite project.

As I understand MMR is a solution to handle blockchain bloating, and keeping the blockchain UTXO size small or manageable, like some level help in scaling as well as to make the light wallet clients better 
and securer as compare to existing protocol and data structures. I'd definitely need correction on this part if anything needs correction on this understanding.

[27-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> And since UTXO is a part of Transparent public transactions only, this scaling part applies to the 1 part of Veruscoin.

[27-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> For the Private transactions there is one more project in industry which is very interesting, Coda Project.

[27-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Have a look around, you'll find it super interesting.

[27-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I just hope that one day Coda could be implemented or at least be available as either a smart chain or PBaaS chain in future üòÉ

[27-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> If I get that right, that will be extreme scaling solution to create very very small size/lightweight blockchains.

[27-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks, I will take a look!üëå 
Another cool thing about the MMRs if i understand them correctly, along with reducing blockchain bloat, it also uses only those small fractions of each to make up a whole, but in doing this all chains are verifiably connected in the blocks along with being much smaller in size. Such a cool idea and amazing the amount of information that can be efficiently organized in this fashion.

[27-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm actually hoping to see a mass exodus of serious minded projects that truly care about getting their vision accomplished. Who knows, the big centralized BaaS solutions may find that if they can't beat us, join us..

[27-Jun-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> it is getting harder to beat this developing tech actually. üòâ

[27-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I still guess the hyped projects like ETH/Polkadot/Cosmos etc will still get major developer share from industry, but the ones who will either be looking for alternative and better freedom choice solutions in industry might end up in projects like KMD and VRSC, or the ones who will get frustrated with the shortcomings of those mentioned platforms.

[27-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> this is very new industry, and people will learn by experiencing only, and that will take them some time to end up here.

[27-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Also if it is easier to use and all the hard work is done developers may see it as the most appealing choice

[27-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> the problem with our low budget and technical superior projects is the level of help from the communities those big bois gets which our small projects aren't getting as much as compared to those big ones.
but whatever little or more we are getting is superbly amazing!

[27-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is all very new and just the past year has been a rollercoaster. I hope someone is documenting everything haha cause itd be a heck of a story
