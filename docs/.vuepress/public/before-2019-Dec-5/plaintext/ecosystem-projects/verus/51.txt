[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> hi, where can u check for the coins u mine? i started mining yesterday and i still dont see any coins. im mining thru the agama wallet

[01-Nov-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> They will appear on your wallet listed with other transactions but at the current network hashrate the probability of a regular computer solo mine a block is very low. Solo mining is a game of chance/probability

[01-Nov-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @verz36 If you want a more consistent and regular reward for your efforts, try minning #pools

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> oh, i was thinking i was going to be able to mine 1 coin at least for 24 hours

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> so maybe the best way to get coins will be to buy them

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> either way thanks for the reply bud

[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> Hey Devs! Embedding multisignature functionality in GUI is a good idea for the concept of Verus. Although based on the marketing strategy - everything has its time ... or not? ü§î

[02-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the big issue is getting the multiple signatures and how the nodes find each other

[02-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> we implemented an automated process in the gateways CC embedding the partially signed tx in opreturn

[02-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but it is a backend process, not really a user visible one

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm just popping in between compiles, and I see the discussion on multisig. Since we have stake delegation, the challenge with stake pooling is one of trusting the stakers to actually submit when they are requested to provide a winning stake. can someone explain how multisig will help us solve a problem like that? thanks

[02-Nov-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I figured he was asking for multiple signers to move a tx

[02-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the stake tx is bound to the block being staked in a number of ways, and in order to prove it is a valid stake, the original UTXO, which is almost always going to be in an individual's wallet will need to be spent to an address that might as well be the individual again. right now, all of an individual's UTXOs are stakeable without being blocked for use. if someone can explain how we might use multisig to improve something about the security of pooling, i would have something to consider. right now, i'm not clear how it will help

[dscrdvrsc] <mykdark> hi all

[02-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykdark> how high is the supply of vrsc? not find it

[02-Nov-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> from the last FAQ in the FAQ-chosen channel, you can see this spreadsheet link, contributed by @Cragorn : https://www.dropbox.com/s/yvclqq98j8nxdmg/Verus_POS.xlsx?dl=0
If you download it and enter the blockheight, you will see max staking coins, which is actually the circulating supply. The total supply on the explorer is both time locked and unlocked, so it is the max staking coins + time locked coins that must unlock before staking. the spreadsheet calculates unlocking as well

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> VerusCoin is still not listed on CMC, even though it checks all their requirements:
- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token. 
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. 
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined. 
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.
If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.
 
Perhaps @miketout or someone else from the team needs to fill in the CMC request form? https://coinmarketcap.com/request/

[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> @miketout 

The multi sig was more for a public pooled staking thing we are doing.

A few of the members from the Ginasis Pool, had a private thing going, where we all sent our verus yo a single wallet, therefore increasing its balance, and therefore, the likelihood that we would get more blocks from the POS.

However, we are looking to now take it public due to the fantastic results the 10 of us achieved from out private pool.

We did it to help even out some of the randomness, and to create another stream of income from out combined efforts. I personally was the one responsible for keeping track of the eearnings and the fair and even distribution to the participants, based in their contribution amount into the pool.


We at Ginasis, recognize that there needs to be a MASSIVE level of trust in that you need to sent your verus yo someone, whom you have likley never met, and at the end of the day, there is nothing to stop them stealing it from you. This was an issue for us in our private group aswell, where a few members had met eachother face to face, but as we are all from a few different states in australia, we havent all met. However, we all had a go, and a bit of trust, and it just escalated from there, out first pooled week was about 12k verus. And our highest week was nearly 30k.

The multisig was mentioned as a way of preventing having never met people from been an issue, as it would require 2 or more separate people to sign off on the TX out of the combined pool wallet, so, if you can have that, it can then be used to instill a huge layer of trust, as you could have a few of the high standing members in the verus community as authorized signatories to send anything out of the wallet.

I hope that makes sense. And I hope you see the value in multisig. But i understand it's not needed for most things.

Apparantly, it is supported, and we are looking into it. But we are not 100% certain of this, and we are by no means coders of any sort.

[03-Nov-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @EvilRabbit As per a conversation I saw in another channel, CoinMarketCap on their application requires TWO exchanges that support CoinMarketCap. Luckily, we now have STEX and Cryptopia should be soon. Once that happens, we meet all requirements, and hopefully it will be quick

[03-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @miketout That would be great; CMC is the 380th most visited website worldwide according to Alexia https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinmarketcap.com , and the most visited crypto website by far, even bitcoin.com ranks far behind at 8,150. I think it would mean a lot for VerusCoin adoption to be seen on CMC.
