[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> What happens if one doesnt download the latest version of the Agama wallet from veruscoin.io prior to the 28th? Wld I lose all Verus in my wallet currently?

[21-Dec-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa no. you can upgrade later, but you will miss out on the fork and its new CPU mining. i your wallet is running and staking, you will likely go onto a fork and require a chain resync when you do upgrade, but you will not lose your coins.

[21-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, great; thanks for the response, @miketout

[21-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Great job on getting the new Verus wallet out and the merging of the other Komodo coins. My Pirate suddenly has an R-address when it didn't before and I am now able to switch to sapling; It was something I knew I needed to do, nagging at my subconscious. It's a good feeling when an update goes well, but to unexpectedly have some other thing updated as a result is a new and pleasant surprise. Thanks for that and everything else you all do @VerusTeam! Looking forward to the fork.

[21-Dec-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> does the new wallet need a complete new blockchain sync?

[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> ok ive updated to new wallet and sent over all my kdm and pirate also , everything is now good for the fork ???    or is there anything i need to do to continue CPU mining ?

[21-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> all i did to install was deleted OLD agama directory in %appdat% delete OLD wallet and run new one having pasted the wallet.dat file  is this enough will i be on the new chain ??

[21-Dec-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @bassliner do not delete the appdat folder

[21-Dec-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that will remove your wallet üòõ

[21-Dec-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> jsut leave the appdat stuff and use the new wallet you downloaded

[21-Dec-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bassliner you should be fine. deleting the agama directory shouldn't hurt, but it isn't necessary. just do make sure you backup your wallet.dat, just to be sure, but it doesn't seem you have more to do.

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Hey people I remmeber(?) some people were talking about disabling sprout addresses. Is there potentially a way to lose our funds that way?

[23-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus Coin is not doing that. I believe Sprout addresses will be disabled on Komodo and Komodo asset chains that run on the Komodo daemon sometime after Feb 15th, but you will need to discuss details with them. I know that Komodo is working to make it easy for everyone to transfer funds. Verus Coin has no schedule or plan to disable Sprout addresses at this time.

[23-Dec-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CREATOR> So there is a fork to get rid of FPGAs and a bounty to for FPGA implementation. Makes sense..... NOT !

[23-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks for your thoughts. there is a fork to make hardware returns more equitable across types, and a bounty to ensure that the new tech in the algorithm is tested on FPGAs in the open and implementations shared

[23-Dec-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @CREATOR I think your assumption is not right. The fork is here to introduce new hash algo that will lower FPGAs potential, so that we do not fail the current stage of the network's growth that we are in. We want FPGAs but not with hashrates that exclude any other form of mining from incentives to mine, as we are very early in terms of the network expansion and want as many miners as possible on the chain so everyone can join our community, mine and benefit the vision. The incentive for FPGAs developers is here to challenge the current algorithm, so that we may verify the current hashing algorithm resistance to FPGAs and further improve the algorithm if necessary or create a dedicated hardware solution that will be effective, open-source and available for everyone that want to secure the network. Its all about fairness, openness and creating a community driven environment that embraces the project. Current FPGAs are not doing any good for the community and their distributor and developers are not willing to be a part of the community and adapt to its ideas. The steps that Verus developers have taken were discussed openly with the community and decisions made reflect the community's way of thinking. So, just to sum it up - if you believe it all makes no sense, you are just questioning collective decisions made with a feedback from all of our community members - a bit late for that, but still great to hear that you have a different opinion on this, like some of us (minority) did. Its appreciated ‚úå

[23-Dec-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well put  @ok88. Couldn't have said it better.@CREATOR Many of us believe in and have openly voiced our concerns and opinions on this matter at great length, and through these discussions, as a community, we collectively concluded that this is the best possible solution for the long term benefit of the project. A move that should aim balance things rather than resist progress. "Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it¬†grow, be like¬†water." - the late great Bruce Lee
Forget "asic resistance", what this new algorithm symbolizes is more akin to the dawning of the age of hardware homogeny. Who knows, Verushash 2.0 may lead by example and set a new industry standard.

[23-Dec-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> In that sense, this situation may prove to be a unique opportunity rather than a death knell. For the developers to take something that many would consider problematic and turn it into a positive change, only stands to highlight their ingenuity and resolve. How many projects have forked away from asics out of fear only to deal with them again later on down the line? How many projects fork, learn, adapt, and then welcome asics back, rising to the challenge? This is exactly what sets Verus apart. These are the things that got us here, aren't they? I, for one, am excited to see how this fork goes and have a very good feeling about this approach.

[23-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> He is just a troll from the FPGA discord forum guys.

[23-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's ok. Might as well try to get people to see other sides in hope they may come around. There are many angles and I can understand where some might lose sight of what is best long term rather than chasing instant returns into the ground. When Verus grows and the price goes up, then those same fpga guys may find themselves happily coming back here to mine Verushash 2.0 even at reduced fpga hashrate if incentives are high enough.

[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> as a fpga and gpu miner it all seems like a knee jerk reaction to misunderstood hardware and infrastructure akin to when gpu's first start coming on the scene as miners and started to push out CPU's as the dominant mining hardware. The same will happen with fpga's over the coming years. It's a natural progression in hardware and the argument of centralization because people have access to and buy a new form of hardware makes little to no sense. It's more a fear of people that have invested in gpu's not wanting to lose profits, when the move towards maximizing mining returns vs power usage and cost will continue to be leveraged across the mining ecosystem

[24-Dec-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Hi @uchirosan, welcome to the channel, maybe take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with our #announcements esp with regard to FPGA, and I encourage you to read some of @miketout ‚Äòs conversations on the subject in this channel if you do a search and filter by his name or simply scroll up.  Your message seems like the knee jerk here, esp as you just joined and posted this, which I believe you‚Äôll see if you take a moment to do some research.

[24-Dec-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I read a number of posts as well as posts in other discord‚Äôs and your release notes for verus 2.0. None of which really made sense in terms of decentralization; it‚Äôs a term too often thrown around like loose leaf paper, but I decided to join the discord to hear more about what the community was saying about fpga‚Äôs

[24-Dec-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Definitely hope more coins and devs choose to keep an open mind regarding fpga‚Äôs and hardware progression as a whole

[24-Dec-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Out of curiosity what kind of equality are you looking to achieve amongst hardware?

[24-Dec-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> In terms of hash rate

[24-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If balance can be achieved across most hardware, I say why not? When the price rises then fpgas may find it profitable to mine again, hand in hand with cpu and gpu. Wouldn't that be a better solution for the vast majority? It's a sound concept and one that makes the most sense rather than continually buying new hardware every time something better comes out. It's more spread out but also more efficient and economical. I don't really see a down side if a proper balance can be achieved

[24-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Finding a balance across hardware that has completely different capabilities and price points doesn‚Äôt make sense

[24-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> In what world would a $200 cpu mine the same as a $700 gpu etc

[24-Dec-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> So majority of the community the runs gpu‚Äôs goes down the tubes ?

[24-Dec-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Affects a lot more than fpga‚Äôs

[24-Dec-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well ideally, what if a $200 cpu that hashes at 20mhs and a $2000 cpu hashes at roughly 200mhs maybe more for the investment? That seems like an ok deal

[24-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Not for a community built in people that already have hardware

[24-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Cpu or otherwise

[24-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs the same arguments cpu miners made when gpu‚Äôs started mining

[24-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But there was never a solution such as this proposed

[24-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It was unfair to have gpu‚Äôs mining so much faster

[24-Dec-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But there is no unfair here

[24-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This Is a new concept one that focuses on balance

[24-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Reducing hashrate to hardware analogous  hurts more than helps the network

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Unless your whole mining setup is based on CPU‚Äôs already vs gpu‚Äôs how does that help the current miners

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The network should be able to handle the hashrate drop

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs not about handling, I‚Äôm asking how it actually helps

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Equalisation it isn't going to make CPUs any better

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It makes them better if their speed is the new norm for the network

[24-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Then yes it does

[24-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Any hash they can do becomes the new hash norm

[24-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm sorry then I don't understand

[24-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't see the problem with balance being a goal

[24-Dec-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> More expensive Hardware will still perform better

[24-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You're fpga will still perform much better than any CPU on the network

[24-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> That remains to be seen, your guessing

[24-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It isn't going to make the CPU more profitable than using anything else

[24-Dec-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> For one, from what I read there will be no gpu or fpga miner to start

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> So all the hash will be CPU‚Äôs

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No that is literally exactly how your Hardware functions

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes of course just like a lot of other projects

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Bitstreams take time and require a coin be profitable

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Exactly so that should come in time

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And at that point your fpga will be the most powerful thing on the network but CPU will still have a chance to be profitable at the same time

[24-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Which makes cpu mining more valuable does it not?

[24-Dec-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until something else is on the network of course CPU will be the most profitable but you'll always get zero when you multiply by 0

[24-Dec-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It will be the only option for a Time

[24-Dec-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is how this coin started out

[24-Dec-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> We‚Äôll see how it plays out, I have a feeling gpu‚Äôs will get harder than you think

[24-Dec-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But community members and active Developers created GPU miners and bit streams

[24-Dec-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I am with you there. We will see. I have no idea myself but I have my fingers crossed

[24-Dec-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Rarely works out to artificially  slow hardware progress by trying to reduce profitability of next gen hardware

[24-Dec-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> And has nothing to do with centralization

[24-Dec-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> That word is misused more than anything

[24-Dec-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree it is. I believe a lot of it is due to misunderstanding and the fact that there are a lot of complex Concepts coming together

[24-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But at the end of the day we can only try

[24-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Fpga‚Äôs are open to everyone and will move to replace gpu‚Äôs

[24-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> They aren‚Äôt isolated or kept by companies like vitamin

[24-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Bitmain

[24-Dec-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Any miner can get an fpga and save on electricity and gain hash rate

[24-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Without buying a door stop asic

[24-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> If anything it should be the hardware most embraced moving forward especially as we see it start to cover all price points this next year

[24-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That isn't really how things played out recently though

[24-Dec-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
