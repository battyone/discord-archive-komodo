[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you will need to wait till it gives you an address in the receive tab

[09-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thats the one?

[09-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> public is the one you will use

[09-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> something like ```RQQnQCaooNmBbTxmbNG16RSe935HwFB5om```

[09-Mar-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> quick question... miner has no GUI?

[09-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> it will have a CMD window

[09-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that will spit info out constantly for you to track it

[09-Mar-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> any idea for my cpu "Kaby Lake" 3.4 GHz Intel "Core i5"    what is the max thread?

[09-Mar-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> how many CPU cores / Threads does it have?

[09-Mar-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> it is 4 cores but not sure if there is hyper threading

[09-Mar-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> get cpu-z

[09-Mar-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Id guess its either 2 core 4 threads (HT) or jsut 4 cores

[09-Mar-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> so do ```-t 4```

[09-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> if i dont want to max out my cpu cause i am doing some stuff i just do .  -t 3 right?

[09-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> or are you on mac or linux?

[09-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac!

[09-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, sorry

[09-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> yeah could do -t 3 to use the computer still

[09-Mar-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @SmeLLyArMpiTs Whats the model of your Kaby Lake i5?

[09-Mar-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Kaby Lake" 3.4 GHz Intel "Core i5" processor (7500) with four independent processor "cores" on a single chip,

[09-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Nice! I had one of those that I had to sell. You will get a pretty decent hashrate with that one!

[09-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac is really messed up .. i choose 3 threads but the os is saying the miner is using 200+% of the cpu -.-

[09-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok, I kind of recognize that.. Dont know from where but do you have some other cpuload info app?

[09-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i found the answer

[09-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how it work in mac

[09-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 100% = . 1 core -.-

[09-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 1 core

[09-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thats right!

[09-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so i am using 2 cores +

[09-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thats how it is. What hashrate do you have with 3 threads?

[09-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 2.49 MH/s (Now)

[09-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> is this crap

[09-Mar-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> hmm thought that one would produce more..

[09-Mar-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its wierd cause i was doing vertcoin on bootcamp windows 10 .. i got 25mh on radeon

[09-Mar-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> what is the acceptable "average "

[09-Mar-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its 2.8 now

[09-Mar-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 89 watts of power used

[09-Mar-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I did see a averge of 5.40 on the 7500, have a look here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=201266774

[09-Mar-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Its not that bad. Ive seen worse üòÉ 0.1333 on one of my cpus. Another around 4MH/s

[09-Mar-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> but y is it 25mh on vertcoin .. or its apple : orange?

[09-Mar-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> we cant compare it direct?

[09-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> More like pineapple / Handgranate

[09-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 4.22 now

[09-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its wierd

[09-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> y will it grow

[09-Mar-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> isnt it a direct function of cpu

[09-Mar-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> it goes a little up and down, you have to look at the average rate when you have mined for a while.

[09-Mar-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> But still at 5MH you will be able to get some verus. Sometimes you have to use what you got. I can agree that the watts is a little high, but at time maybe you can upgrade to something else?

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> LOL i punch in the figures in the calculator . .   monthly profit . is .    $ -13.91

[09-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I know. But remember VRSC can also rise in value in the future!

[09-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> yeah !

[09-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thats what i am counting on

[09-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Then ist good to have a couple in your wallet..

[09-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> give me a bitcoin style explosion  muahahah

[09-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i maybe dreaming,, but dreams can be good .

[09-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> muahahah

[09-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> You never know. Mine some and we also have some fun here in the forum!

[09-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> lol lowering the monitor to dimmest is now 84 watts

[09-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> muahahahaha

[09-Mar-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> you know .. now i doubt those folks who say they mine casually and still profit ..

[09-Mar-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i think it is highly unlikely

[09-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> is it a laptop? Mine with 3 therads, do your other work with the forth, surf and so on. Im not sure about profit either just think Veruscoin is a intersing projekt. See you later! must take the dogs out for a walk.

[09-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thanks and bye!

[09-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> üëç Bye!

[09-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> oh btw guys i can stop anytime i want right? i wont lose the progress?

[09-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the shares the pool has already credited to your address usually won't be deleted

[09-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but thats a thing you'll have to trust the pool operators with üòâ

[09-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but in this case: i think i can safely say: no you wont lose progress

[09-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am on ginasis

[09-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> now is   Shares: 32768

[09-Mar-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Ginasis Mining Pools hello . . do u have a guide on what the terms mean? like luck .. etc

[09-Mar-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> basically thats the work youve submitted

[09-Mar-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> once the pool finds a block you will be paid a portion of that block in relation to your shares

[09-Mar-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> say all shares on the pool equal to 100% then divide the block by total amount of shares and times that number by your shares minus the 0.75% pool fee and that is your earnings for that block

[09-Mar-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> then it resets and starts again

[09-Mar-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luck basically means the AVERAGE time you hit mine a block. It is an ESTIMATE! Don‚Äôt be disappointed if you don‚Äôt mine a block yourself within that period

[09-Mar-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The rest as per @Ginasis Mining Pools comment

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Luck numbers probs still off as numbers need changing in the pool code to match verus better (Fairly sure this has not been resolved on Ginasis) but it didn't exactly make high priority since its jsut a pretty number xD

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hm, we changed the avg block time

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> with the code as is, it won't get any better

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not a lot at least

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> there is some in one of the site pages

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the math behind isn't very complicated tho

[09-Mar-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> in the website folder from memory

[09-Mar-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that it pulls from
