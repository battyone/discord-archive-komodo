[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Is this a Scroll marketing campaign? I've never heard of this semi-private blockchain solution, but they are winning against everyone, including ETH and KMD. Looking at them, it doesn't seem like they have much coverage or deserve that. Voted KMD, but I think it may be about making you look at Scroll.

[25-Aug-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Not sure, I donâ€™t research coins anymore outside of stuff that filters in through KMD discord

[25-Aug-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you mean you had 3 orphaned stakes, I can only say that we are all going to see orphaned stakes for a while. it is also statistical. the fact that you have those means you are sending your stakes to the network. it is really a statistical thing, so if you are staking, you will get them sometimes

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> How come I can see my transaction in the explorer https://explorer.veruscoin.io/address/RFqN57nVW7mtSd2cg1NehcAAWdFsSFXF1j but my wallet says 0 on balances. komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getwalletinfo

[25-Aug-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> but my address RHUNXyE8KSzbaaSnugr3kUowEQjoR8qg2j is on the list when I run  'komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getaddressesbyaccount ""'

[25-Aug-18 01:25 PM] bishop#9773
What version wallet are you using?

[25-Aug-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Matterbridge 60000

[25-Aug-18 01:27 PM] bishop#9773
The first address prior to you generating your own with getnewaddress is going to be different (randomly created at the start of wallet generation)

[25-Aug-18 01:28 PM] bishop#9773
validaddress should show you have ownership of that

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Hollowman9000 Those were all public, right? Hard to tell.

[25-Aug-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Explorer shows itâ€™s in there, so itâ€™s an issue on your end one way or the other

[25-Aug-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Yes, youâ€™re fine

[25-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Problem is that balance is 0, even though the explorer says I have gotten some Verus from my mining pool today, trying to figure out where the problem is.

[25-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Nevermind, now it suddenly popped up ðŸ˜…  when I ran 'komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getwalletinfo' just now, been 0 for 2 hours since the funds where transmitted - txn delays?

[25-Aug-18 01:38 PM] bishop#9773
When in doubt to rule out a fork, compare your block hash to the explorers

they are either in a private zaddr or you mined them on a fork between version 11 and 12

[25-Aug-18 02:31 PM] bishop#9773
Considering that tx isn't valid on the explorer, those coins were mined on a forked chain

[25-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sys039995> Then do I switch back to 0.3.11 to use these coins

[25-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sys039995> ?

[25-Aug-18 02:35 PM] bishop#9773
no, that's a forked chain

[25-Aug-18 02:35 PM] bishop#9773
those coins are worthless

[25-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> @sys039995  just check your real balance on the explorer https://explorer.veruscoin.io/
If you see more on your wallet that means that you were mining/staking on forked chain and those coins are usless

[25-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sys039995> Ok, I am stupid mining for a month.

[25-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> update to 0.3.12 should be announced as mandatory and it wasn't. Many people had the same problem as you

[25-Aug-18 02:56 PM] bishop#9773
Yeah... even the OP on bitcointalk is referencing 0.3.11

[25-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Can someone please explain to me the following strangeness happening on my account? I had 4 coins in my account. I created a new address and then sent 0.01 coins to another account that's not mine, in the same transaction the rest of my coins was also sent to an address I've never seen before and that does not come up in the list of my addresses when I run getaddressesbyaccount from the cli, but DOES validate to true when I run validateaddress from the cli. I never sent those other 4 coins, just the 0.01 coin was sent, just how is this possible?

[25-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Here is where I sent 0.01 coins from RFqN57nVW7mtSd2cg1NehcAAWdFsSFXF1j to RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno https://explorer.veruscoin.io/address/RFqN57nVW7mtSd2cg1NehcAAWdFsSFXF1j , the 4 coins sent to RDd2woyS8yTsJPgDqyRNQAdF7ewjuQpfQG was not sent by me, all I wrote was this command: komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC sendtoaddress "RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno" "0.01"

[25-Aug-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The recieving address RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno does not appear in my address list:

komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getaddressesbyaccount ""
[
  "REBrCYF6Mvvj33e2memZncBirtvMPkMCkB",

  "RHUNXyE8KSzbaaSnugr3kUowEQjoR8qg2j",
  "RNPM1PhEpeBYpE5JVB6wZCLZLL1SHbYbRe"
]

But the address RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno does validate even though not in the list:
komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC validateaddress "RDd2woyS8yTsJPgDqyRNQAdF7ewjuQpfQG"

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti Your change from UTXO's is sent to a separate address.   I know it seems odd, but I think it is perfectly normal.  Happens to me too.

[25-Aug-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Is your balance correct?

[25-Aug-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I was cleaning up my wallet this morning in order to consolidate some transactions for better staking.  This is what it did to my GUI wallet...

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Matterbridge I just changed address prior to transferring the 0.01, but I can change again I guess.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> UTXO - Unspent Transaction Output

[25-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott And where does that unknown public key come from as its not on my address list but still validates with my private key.

[25-Aug-18 03:40 PM] bishop#9773
since no one listens, Jimbo, you got this

[25-Aug-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti Your wallet creates new public keys.  This is not like a QT Wallet coin where you have to do that yourself.  The wallet starts with a pool of public keys (and, of course, the private keys for them).  But it will also create new keys on the fly.  These get used for your 'change'.

[25-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So if I have 100 VRSC in one UTXO and send 50 to a different address - it seems that is the same thing as pulling a 100 dollar bill out - leaving the address that held it, then splitting it.  The change comes BACK to me, but at a different address.

[25-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> In real life, it comes back to my WIFE's wallet about 100% of the time.

[25-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott ðŸ˜‰ Ok, thanks for answering.

[25-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I really wish there was a way to clean the wallet up so that all of the little details did not clutter things up...  but as long as your balance is right then all should be well.

[25-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @arton The issue with the fork was not foreseen.  It coincided with the creation of pools and the release of the new wallet.  Sort of a perfect storm.   In retrospect it should have been mandatory.  But nobody could see clearly enough into the future to make that call prior to its release.

[25-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Another thing I wanted to bring up is _transaction times_. I'm not proud of it, but I have dabbled with Ripple XRP and EOS for some time, and their transactions take less that 1 minute to confirm. I know that it's technically hard to compete with those blockchains with a *truly* distributed blockchain like this, but two hours is a very long time for a transaction imo. Is there any worked being done on this issue?

[25-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti It does not take 2 hours for me to send coins to you.

[25-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Or for you to send to me.

[25-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> It takes two hours (a little less actually) to confirm a mined block - unless you are having wallet issues.

[25-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti shoot me a public T address - I will send you a VRSC

[25-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Let's see how long before it is confirmed in your wallet

[25-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott That may be so, but in reality people don't get their money until 1-2 hours. I experimented today by sending 0.01 coins to my exchange, that was 48 minutes ago and it's still not available for trading with 113/120 confirmations.

[25-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OHHH.... an exchange.   There's your problem.

[25-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The exchange is setting the rules.

[25-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Not Verus

[25-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Ok, so more confirmations needed with an exchange then, I gather?

[25-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just because the exchange says so.  They may be creating a big lag in order to stake their balance.

[25-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just sent you 1 VRSC, BTW

[25-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Thanks, very nice of you ðŸ˜„

[25-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Let me know when your balance ticks up

[25-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Ok, I'll send it back once I'e gotten it confirmed on my side.

[25-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And, the UTXO it came from was a 3.2 VRSC payment from a pool.   My available balance just went DOWN 3.2 VRSC - but when you get your 1,  I will get 2.2 back in change.

[25-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Probably to an address that no human has ever seen before.

[25-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> @jimboscott - as you wrote, time showed that an update to 0.3.12 should be mandatory. I totally agree with you, no one could foresee those fork problems that appeared
