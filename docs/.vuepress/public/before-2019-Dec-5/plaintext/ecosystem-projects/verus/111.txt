[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @paia: in my universe i differ between `native clients` and `full nodes`, the latter being `listen=1` and as cipi so fittingly added, `listenonion=1`.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm doing a resync on the explorer, sorry for any headache but it's out of sync.  Thanks for being patient with the process 😃

[04-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> feel free to use https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/ while the official explorer is out of shape

[04-Feb-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats why i run the optional one 😛

[04-Feb-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...speaking of which, my explorer does now enforce https in the clearnet. missed that before, whoopsie.

[04-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...speaking of which even more, my explorer now has a TOR .onion url as well: `http://bmpw3nesmfchsdmp.onion/`

[04-Feb-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and since a bunch of seconds ago it actually works *ducks*

[04-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> I just upgraded to new wallet b and it says unknown error rescanning blocks. Should i just wait?

[04-Feb-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as long as it's only complaining about the blockchain data and it's not complaining about any wallet related stuff it's ok to wait or brute-force this "problem" away by using the bootstrap or something. differently put; rescans happen, sadly

[04-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> looking for a smart way to extract keys out of 100+ wallet.dat files so that I can easily import the keys to a single wallet. Any ideas?

[04-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> @ok88 That will need to be scripted, there isn't a dump all wallet keys RPC call (I do not think..)
There is a dump single address key   RPC call though...

Look up your addresses,  then script a loop to dump all the keys for them one by one...sorry, i don't have examples...just the concept...hehe

[04-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> List your t-addr: `getaddressesbyaccount ""`
List your z-addr: `z_listaddresses`
Dump t-addr key: `dumpprivkey addr`
Dumpy z-addr key:  `z_exportkey addr`

[04-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> Looks like there is a `dumpwallet` for t-addr and a `z_exportwallet` for z-addr  command to dump then all into a single file...

[04-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You can dump all wallet keys with z_exportwallet, but for 100 wallets, you may do better to run a recoverwallet Python script that I have as a gist, as long as there aren’t many z-addresses in the wallets, as the script pulls out t-addresses only. I can post a link when I’m back to the PC.

[05-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I was just about to install latest VERUS wallet, but realized that it is _STILL_ called Agama, and Agama0.5.5.b at that- 
I really do not appreciate that, am I the only one who does not like that?
What is this about?
Is this going to fuck up my Agama0.3.3 installation?

[05-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Are the other coins still accessible in Agama0.5.5.b?
I do have separate users for each wallet I use, but I still dont like the idea of mucking about with _TWO_ different versions of an app that run under the same name

[05-Feb-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> So why does Komodo main not adopt Agama0.5.5b? 
Something in there that does not go with Komodo, ARRR and all the other chains?

[05-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hi @LocoMB !
Have you read the post from february 4th in  #announcements? It can't tell you what to do, but it explains the options. Don't know if the non verus enhanced agama has gotten around to support verus fully yet.

[05-Feb-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> no, will do, Thanks!

[05-Feb-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 this script, which does require the prerequisites and Python 3.5+, can create a bash script to import all the transparent keys in a wallet: https://gist.github.com/miketout/ce869cbbedf48d55a813ff6c026e2166
after you run the bash script that is its output, you would want to do a rescan of the wallet. If you were doing 100 wallets, you would want to do the rescan after all the other imports to make it faster.
It's nothing official or that I can even say anyone besides you should use, but I have used it to recover a few wallets that were corrupted.

[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> You think verus coin will be registered on bigger exchange sites any time soon?

[07-Feb-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> depends on what you mean anytime soon. personally, i believe we will be on bigger exchanges or make the exchanges we are on bigger within the next 3 months, probably both. that is just an opinion. i can tell you about the project, but my opinions on these things are not necessarily more valid than others'

[dscrdvrsc] <keen> anyone using 1050ti for verus mining?

[08-Feb-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Some are, @keen . Saw one users mention it gets around 1MH/s.

[08-Feb-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <keen> my miner gets 252mh but not showing shares on genasismining pool

[08-Feb-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 252MH/s for one ordinary device is too high. Most likely using verushash 1.0 instead of 2.0.

[08-Feb-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, it's probably running the old verushash 1.0. Any pool running the main algorithm, 2.0, won't accept those shares.

[08-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ginasis isn't accepting verushash1 shares either

[08-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[08-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so i kind of wonder whats going on

[08-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'm guessing you don't actually want to use verushash 1.0?
Use a newer ccminer release for verushash 2.0 instead, if that's the case.

[dscrdvrsc] <topuabhishek> which miner to use ...? and how to setup with the pool ....

[08-Feb-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Oh, all of it. ^^
I'm assuming you have Windows and have already gotten a address?
Then head over to: <https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/v3.3>
Download all the files, except the two extra compressed files named 'Source code'. Be sure they're all in the same folder after downloading.
Edit 'run.verushash.bat' with a text editor.

[08-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ```ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956 -u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.1050 -p d=6000 -i 18.5
pause```
If you want to change to another specific pool, change `-o  stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956`
But most of all, change `-u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.1050` to `-u YourOwnTransparentAddress.WorkerName`

[08-Feb-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> When you're done, save and start 'run.verushash.bat'.

[08-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> When running 'run.verushash.bat' ? I would mean that 'ccminer.exe' and 'run.verushash.bat' are not in the same folder.

[dscrdvrsc] <GeoAloha> @jimboscott Fwiw, I had that happen as well -- so I chose Verus from the menu that gives you the option to add parameters and it appeared to work, but then it threw an error. I quit and restarted it and rescanned and it worked.

[11-Feb-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Will give that a try.  Did you choose any additional parameters when you started VRSC from the top menu?

[11-Feb-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK - I just shut it down and restarted normally using the quick start menu - seems to be working for now

[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes! Thanks!

[13-Feb-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Regarding gpu hashrate vs cpu, I'd recommend you either check out #announcements from 4th december and on, or maybe <https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-community-responds-to-secret-fpga-mining-be5e9ce0eafb>
But in short, it's a result of an algorithm change to equalize hardware, as FPGAs were "too efficient" on verushash 1.0. With the new algorithm GPU miners are still being optimized in aim to gain more hashpower, but as of now CPU is still favored.

[13-Feb-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> #announcements miketout 2019-01-04
```... Chris has also helped us validate that the new VerusHash 2.0 does a much more complete job of equalizing non-CPU hardware. For now, the best GPUs will be comparable to a low to moderate speed CPU. Knowing Chris, he will improve performance over time, but even with multiples from where we are now, we have some hard evidence that the new algorithm is working exactly as intended. VerusHash 2.0 retakes its position in the crypto-industry as only algorithm we know of that can be mined competitively on CPUs alongside GPUs through equalization. We will find out soon how it stands up to FPGAs, and though I expect them to be able to mine reasonably, I'm confident it will do much better in that respect than the last algorithm. If we are successful in equalizing FPGAs in the final analysis, this will be the first algorithm ever to achieve that. ...
