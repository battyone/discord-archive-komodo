[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas changing your algo means every pool + exchange needs to update. It can't be done very often

[04-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Monero does it

[04-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what if fpga devs can make new bitstreams faster than you can update?

[04-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and who knows for sure, that there are no private FPGAs for XMR? updated every 6 months, hours after the hard fork

[04-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> They won't, because it's a lot of work to mine for a few weeks

[04-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> It takes weeks to develop a bitstream

[04-Dec-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> sure, about the same to upgrade a p2p network securely

[04-Dec-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I don't see the big advantage, of any coin, or SUQA, to stop FPGA's

[04-Dec-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> But you can develop all the software without revealing the algorithm details

[04-Dec-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> So the FPGA devs can never catch up

[04-Dec-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> FPGAs can mine in secret, and you will never know if your current algo can be FPGA mined, if miners stay discreet

[04-Dec-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> It is like 51% attacks: the best protection is making them unprofitable

[04-Dec-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you know when a 51% attack is happening

[04-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> You can't know if there is a small FPGA miner just like you can't know if there is a small optimised GPU miner

[04-Dec-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it basically seems like cat-and-mouse, I don't see coin devs as having any advantage, like with ASICs that can be bricked

[04-Dec-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Let's take the suqa case: a FPGA developer would need to develop 3/4 new algorithms, make it work on multiple boards, with 4 times the memory requirements of the usual X algorithm, and all this knowing that in a few months it's all to be done again.

[04-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> maybe. I have heard of FPGA miners for XMR

[04-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it just wont be publicly advertised

[04-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and not really any way to detect

[04-Dec-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> theres lots of scammy crap out there one company claims 2.1ghs on eth. no working hardware tho

[04-Dec-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas i am no expert, but FPGAs with ddr4 sdram slots are coming, so your algos will need to balloon in memory size very soon. Extra memory use doesn't seem like the stronger factor, it seems that you are mostly relying on the fact that you can change your algorithm faster than FPGA devs can update their bitstreams

[04-Dec-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> how much faster? Is that edge defendable? Against a team of fpga devs at a company/fund who's only purpose is to secretly mine with custom fpga's?

[04-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> You don't need to win all the battles to win the war

[04-Dec-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> what do you guys think about setting a max limit for hashrate on each IP address using CC?

[04-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Regnar> Quick question about Sapling transactions. Is Verus able to make ZS transactions over lite wallets yet, or is it still exclusive to native?

[04-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Still in native mode only.

[04-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Regnar> cool thanks. I'm not sure the process of how to make those over SPV, but wasn't sure if that's something Verus was working on currently.

[04-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> interesting. the thing is that people don't seem to understand the issue of relative performance, and we have people opposed to solutions here as well. if all FPGAs can only get 100 hashes/second, they would still each have the same return if they are alone in the world and competing with each other. the people there, who i assume are only some of them and based on our discussions, not the company, seem upset that they may have to accept casual miners having a chance to make anything over time. any performance change on FPGAs won't affect them relative to other FPGAs, so there actually isn't any argument except not wanting any other devices to have a chance. the goal for what we're working to achieve if we do come to agreement is casual miners can still help decentralize and professional miners would get best ROI with FPGAs. if those specific people don't want to mine Verus because of that, then the more for everyone else.

[04-Dec-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What I don't get is why would they rather burn it all down than compromise? Suggesting a fork is like cutting the baby in half

[04-Dec-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't think they are accepting the long-term benefit to a compromise. Rather than sacrifice some now they may end up left in the dust if/when big players get in

[04-Dec-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Because of bitstreams. There are huge resources involved in making those work. Going opensource can lead to a lot of people making their own FPGAs -> lost (potential) revenue to the company.

[04-Dec-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like the idea of a compromise if only for the idea of spreading the hash. Mining was great while it lasted but that happens with all successful coins eventually and at least staking generates consistent Rewards

[04-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do you mean for other algorithms? Or for vrsc? If they were to release the bit stream for vrsc with that compromise anything else?

[04-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> VRSC

[04-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Right so then there is no harm

[04-Dec-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A fork would mean it is off the table entirely

[04-Dec-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> not really. majority of bitstreams can be adjusted to the new algo. If they show VH to the world, a lot of people would have a huge advantage, therefore they offer huge time-locked bounty from the foundation

[04-Dec-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> #mining on the HAC discord seems to say VRSC is free to fork if they don't like FPGAs, and they will update their bitstreams. Cat-and-mouse game, engage.

[04-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Fork would just cut F1 users off with higher memory requirement. (Possible) F2 with more memory can handle new algo

[04-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> What Mike is proposing is the only usable solution for Verus

[04-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people have verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpga's, that have lots of RAM

[04-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> But they cost way more then 2.5k

[04-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> and only one CPU, F1 has 6

[04-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the ones you know about

[04-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Each FPGA would require custom bitstream = more work

[04-Dec-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people have automated software to convert bitstreams to various FPGAs

[04-Dec-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Worst-case short-term what is wrong with forking to something more difficult on fpga and then in the event of a large company getting involved and creating an Asic wouldn't it always be possible to Fork back to the easier algorithm when the time is right and the entire ecosystem is more saturated with fpga thus maintaining decentralization and a healthy spread of the hash

[04-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Can there be true decentralization with encrypted bitstreams?

[04-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus could change VerusHash slightly every few months, it's an annoying solution to mining pools, expensive for exchanges (they charge for updates) but might prevent most people from having bitstreams that worked. But each change to verushash would need to be different and unique, not some tiny change. Or the changed bitstream will be trivial and be available hours after the latest version of verushash is released

[04-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine that is a possible short-term solution and at least levels the playing field

[04-Dec-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus would have to try to keep the new version of verushash secret until the latest possible moment, or fpga devs can start coding early

[04-Dec-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> is it all worth it?

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If fpga becomes more available I can understand opening the gates but does anyone know how many of these things are actually out there?

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Why doesn't verus foundation make their own FPGA and compete? Be better than the competition

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm going to take a rough guess and say around 22 terahashes

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and many people would rather give money to VRSC foundation + Mike versus some rando company that only cares about profit, not the coin

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Maybe not that high

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Godballz most are turned off right now, almost all

[04-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> yeap, back in 2 days

[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dukeleto where did you see that info?

[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So the actual core miners make up something like 10 to 15% pow work? That is extremely lopsided

[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> 145 MH/s per watt. If you do the math, you will not sleep well

[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until fpga is a common household thing I feel like it is early to be exposed to this

[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook what in particular?

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> most GPUs get maybe 2-5 MH/s per watt

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> CPUs do a bit better. But these FPGAs will completely control the network soon

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> reg moving 50%, elec safetey, govmnt inspec details

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook hashaltcoin discord

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So 90% of 50% of the coins could potentially be going strictly to fpga owners

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> all the miners are angry, their rigs are down

[04-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> most people host their FPGAs at the company DC, because company offers 0.10 USD/KwH electricity

[04-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people can mine with a FPGA, without ever leaving their browser

[04-Dec-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is nearly half of the coins. That means a very good incentive to dump price but also a good time to buy I guess unless it's just going to get worse

[04-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This is a good chance to see the actual pow hashrate and like you mentioned that doesn't even include the ones that people ship to their house

[04-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> By the way guys it's a great time to get us mining back on

[04-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Some fpgas are not currently on the network

[04-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> We are probably closer to 5 terahashes than 30

[04-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I got a coin in 2 hours so it's like 13-14 Coins a day

[04-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Close to ¬£1.50

[04-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So more than 10 x

[04-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DigitalCruncher> Guys, if you choose AES based POW, there is completely no point to stick to GPU. FPGA is much faster and efficient.

[04-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That could mean fpga control more than 90% pow coins

[04-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @DigitalCruncher agreed, unless they are offline, lok

[04-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> from what I understand, these F1's are "starter kits", big FPGA miners use PCIe fpga's, that are $5-10K each. They can mine VerusHash on those too, it's just not setup to be as easy as possible. So just trying to make the F1 not able to mine VRSC, it's not quite a good solution. It prevents small hobbyist fpga miners, and allows the biggest fpga miners with most expensive equipment to continue

[04-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> "hobbyist fpga miners" are the new GPU miners
