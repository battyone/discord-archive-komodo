Does anyone have any links about this clandestine fpga mining ? This is an interesting development that seems like it could have some real ramifications

[04-Dec-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> maybe we could just go back to cpu mining from wallets and cut out all the pools and gpus

[04-Dec-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @miketout I understand you, and see where you're coming from, honestly I do. It just seems that there may be some underestimation of the human capacity for greed here. I dont see the manufacturer giving you any option other than the nuclear one. The parable of the scorpion and the fox/toad comes to mind. And EVEN if we were able to strike a deal with THIS manufacturer....it's just ONE!!! manufacturer....what stops the next one and the next one, esp as Verus grows from strength to strength as intended? I understand my arguments actually raise even MORE problems, as the seeming only option it leaves is go nuclear and prepare for an endless arms race that will ultimately cripple the project anyway, but I feel it's worthwhile to raise these questions now, if they address the exploratio of avenurs that lead nowhere anyway...

[04-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jintaa I agree, you cant negotiate with terrorists.

[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> lol, terrorists üòÑ

[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We are not a toad :)
by addressing the issue now, we have a chance to put it to rest at a low and accessible price point, especially if by not ratcheting up, we make mining accessible to many more people going forward. more casual mining with CPUs and GPUs for those with cheap/free electricity, and professional mining, still decentralized with FPGAs, that will have versions with similar economics for less than the current ones if we get agreement. not just from one company, as the algorithm will be open, which is an important part of agreeing, but they developed it or paid to develop it, so being first to market is just where they are. if they cooperate and have a good product that they make more accessible to the community, they will have done something to redeem themselves. they did promise to us that only their customers were mining, not them, so there is still some argument that they didn't centralize Verus.

[04-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> What would stop all of them is the fact that it is our algorithm, and it would be open

[04-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its a trick @miketout . That's what they want you to believe. So, you wont do anything.

[04-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I can assume it is optimized in hardware with their design. they do seem to be competent. they didn't come to us. i went to them after hearing about it.

[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Why not go back to cpu mining only. It would encourage more users, as everyone could mine.

[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what is the trick? i'm not closed minded, but I don't see one.

[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> They said they aren't mining it

[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we had the only algorithm I know of that I believe has credible CPU mining

[04-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> not anymore

[04-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> any algorithm we choose will not get us back there

[04-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> is their website

[04-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> $2500 for a miner

[04-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> not cheap, but its the cheapest FPGA I have found

[04-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> that is avaialble

[04-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> some things we need to do are attenuate FPGAs, boost relative perf of CPUs, and there is a GPU dev that has beat Chris's numbers, so that will help GPUs as well when it gets in. The algo change can improve the first and second, though we don't have a guarantee, and the new GPU dev has also agreed to follow the new algo once we agree on a bounty. if we choose to stop them, it makes us a more expensive algorithm for any hardware, which just puts it out of reach of more people when someone eventually cracks it. then if we can fork again, the same thing happens to another level.

[04-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we get agreement, there would be an even less expensive option as well.

[04-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Nothing can match FPGA. Mining GPU and CPU is not wroth electricity. It will get worse as it goes along, even with a slight boost in performance or small limits. Its like mining bit coin with a gpu. Its finished. Its all FPGA now

[04-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have not agreed, so please understand that all options are still on the table for us. if we fork away from these, an investment now might need to be directed at another coin, and if we agree, you might have some additional purchase options.

[04-Dec-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> what do you mean additional purchase options?

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> lower price of entry for same economics is the goal

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and what do you mean by anther coin verus 2.0?

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
So its like war then. You gotta pick your battles I guess.

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I didn't say verus 2.0, and if i did, i only meant VerusHash 2.0

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically if it's going to happen anyway we might as well find a way to make the transition as seamless as possible

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the new algo

[04-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or adjusted, i should say

[04-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah, when is this decision going to be made?

[04-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> asap from my perspective.

[04-Dec-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I still dont understand the point of cooperating. Its like asking a robber to only take half so he can rob us next week

[04-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Asap, days or asp weeks?

[04-Dec-18 09:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
Is fpga hashrate over 51% ?

[04-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @Gloryman you really dont understand?

[04-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Ted understand what?

[04-Dec-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> the point of cooperating

[04-Dec-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> too right @Ted I agree. So, what is the point of cooperating?

[04-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how is it a robber? they are like an nVidia of a sort, specialized on mining, have sold to people in a way none of us like, but are obviously capable and targeting many coins. if they open source their VerusHash design, so the community can implement it on other hardware if they don't serve the community well, they have done us a favor to offer us a path onto hardware that isn't prohibitively expensive. the question is whether they will really cooperate or not. i don't see how they take more by cooperating. we could fork away, but i think it has a higher cost to the project than if we find a solution that protects us from having this happen in the future. at least until the first ASICs, which are MUCH more expensive to make than FPGA bitstreams.

[04-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> 1. They are making money at our expense. 2. Why do we want to be on centralised hardware at this stage of the project? It seems harmful to me. They will manipulate the price or do pump and dump. 3. I dont see how even agreeing with a cooperation deal is good for us because the future FPGAs bitstreams wont have to agree with it. 4. If they are making a killing and the are worried about a fork. Why would they want a deal? They would just want to make as much coin as possible before its forked. @miketout

[04-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> No offense but some of you guys sound like gamers having a fit about miners stealing all the GPUs.

[04-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, wild thought here, @miketout ...correct me if I'm being batshit...I get your point. It wd be bawss on another level if verus was the original AND the blackmarket controller in a way that ultimately did nothing but advance the vision. Do you see a possibility in the future of Verus foundation bankrolling the highest quality fpgas that transformed the duopoly of cpu/gpu into a sustainable triumvirate of cpu/gpu/fpga that evened thi gs out across the spectrum, heralding the dawn of a glorious epoch in which paeon and rich man, serf and baron, mine side by side in harmony for the betterment of all???!

[04-Dec-18 09:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
If these guys are selling verus on exchanges at least they‚Äôre creating volume right? I mean it might sound dumbs but usage is usage at any price

[04-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I am not personally against FPGA miners, just like I'm not against companies, businesses and government. But you shouldn't let them take more of what you put in. Its a financial game. So, we either let them tax us more or out compete us or we do something about it.

[04-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> If we cant outcompete them, then so be it. I will just pull out while I'm still ahead.

[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Standard gpu miner: If you dont fork those fpga/asics of the net, i will dump my coins. I swear, ill do it üòÖ

[04-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ignoring AAcoin, the volume on Digital price has actually been trending down it seems. Price average is up from a few months ago(I was buying at 2500 sats, now it's hovering between 35-4k) Stex volume is pretty low

[04-Dec-18 09:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Just think of it as a turbocharged transaction/mining test. You can pull the rug out and see what happens, but maybe in some weird subversive way they are actually increasing adoption.

[04-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman why is FPGA hardware inherently centralized? i think it is the way mining is likely to go. there are FPGAs with RAM and more, they are just too expensive right now. i think what is happening is part of a market evolution towards the investment being focused on mining vs. more general purpose use diluting the ROI. as FPGAs get more sophisticated and people push the envelope of the opportunity to do better on coins without hardware, it is a niche that is emerging as a profitable approach. i think this trend may continue, and i think it will become more and more decentralized. the more we can depend on the FPGA perf than RAM and all of the other components, the smaller and more decentralized we will be able to get if that's true. I still want to work towards CPU and GPU being worth enough for me to keep mining with them, and with PBaaS, there will be new rewards over and above the block reward.

[04-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why can't you just sell your GPUs(or move them to another coin) and buy an fgpa? Why am I even asking

[04-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah i dont get that part either. A good rig costs more than a fpga ü§î

[04-Dec-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You buy 2 2080 and have one fpga üòÖ

[04-Dec-18 09:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
Getting worked up over 1k sats up or down seems a little reactionary. Especially in this market.

[04-Dec-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> But at least the fpga makes some money and dont loses money every day....

[04-Dec-18 09:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
Is there a profitable coin left to mine with gpu‚Äôs right now?

[04-Dec-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The order books for verus are so thin a few thousand moves the price significantly. It spiked up to 9-10k a little while back, but that was very brief.

[04-Dec-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I have nothing against FPGA miners. I want to buy them in future. It is not inherently centralised. But the jump in the hash rate means that this coin is very much in control by a few miner. That means that they decide the price. And the more they mine the more control they will have through staking. When you have this much coin controlled by so few people, this is where the problem occurs. I dont mind FPGA miners being part of the long term vision. But at this stage us cut out all new miners and casual people interested. The only people coming to this coin will be FPGA miners that want to make as much money  as quickly as possible and traders who want to make as much money as fast as possible.

[04-Dec-18 09:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ahh yes, the American way

[04-Dec-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> And casual just hodl the coin, trading dies, way better

[04-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they may have had a month starting small and growing to take some percentage of the 50% that is PoW so far. they didn't centralize the supply, and if both they and we make good decisions now, they will sell miners, but won't centralize Verus Coin and neither will the next one who comes along, as we will be pre-FPGA'ed

[04-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You cant possible know how many people mined with their gpu/cpu as you dont know how many people are mining with fpgas now

[04-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I was attempting to inject some levity into the discussion. My question, @miketout is this- since youre being rational and clear eyed about the inevitability of these high capacity miners, all towards the ultimate safeguarding of the Verus vision, cld you take it one step further and actually have Verus ITSELF put out the best, leading fpgas that wd keep the ecosystem stable between not only the original vision of cpus and gpus, but now making room for fpgas? I ask bcos it cld be a means of staying ahead of what I see as having to continually pay sort of a "protection" fee to companies that come up with this hardware. If verus made or bankrolled  the best ones on the market, that wd automatically default the ecosystem back to the original vision of fairness amongst everyday, non commercial community members/regular miners. Sure, some "market share" so to speak wd be siphoned away from gpus and esp cpus, but this new balance wd def leave them better off, since verus wd be the main distributor of these machines, and thus wd have the community's best interest at heart, while still achieving the required decentralization.

[04-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also tend to believe them from what I've seen on their Discord that their customers, not them have been mining Verus, meaning maybe we even have a few new members of the community who might even contribute at some point that got in for the opportunity

[04-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout it will be 100% soon, no one else can compete. That's what I mean. Casual miners out and casual users out. Only players left will be FPGA miners and day traders.

[04-Dec-18 09:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think sia coin and decred both sold their own mining rigs.

[04-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "No one else can compete" 

Anyone can buy the miner though

[04-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa ah

[04-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Siacoin did. They changed asic algo to only their own asics. THAT is cenralized.

[04-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The people over there are mostly small gpu miner. Some are mining verus, but some are also mining other coins, way less profitable coins as they believe in their project and dont care about profit right away

[04-Dec-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Personally, I care more about whether something works than whether it's centralized or not

[04-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Main reason I use centralized exchanges far more than I use dexes

[04-Dec-18 10:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
They cant take over the chain and do double spends thanks to dpow. If they drive the price down into the dirt they‚Äôll likely have to move on to something more profitable sooner or later. Maybe the problem will fix itself.

[04-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why would they tank the price? Need to pay for the hardware somehow

[04-Dec-18 10:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats what i mean, if they get too greedy they‚Äôll shoot themselves in the foot. Maybe the market do it‚Äôs job.

[04-Dec-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we actually have had someone who hasn't been full time working on an FPGA design. we also have now three more people who said they could do one. the thing is, HashAltCoins have done it on this algorithm, proving they are capable, and have a business interest to do it well for the community and more sales if we can cooperate. one of the conditions is that they make a reference version open. The foundation would also offer them a time locked bounty for following the algorithm and making it open, so they will have an ongoing future stake in Verus Coin through this transition.

[04-Dec-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Yii Yes everyone is mining for fun, not profit

[04-Dec-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> What is the incentive for FPGAs to have the interest of the coin or community. They want to make a killing on the coin and move on to the next one. Its that simple.

[04-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Haven‚Äôt they already been mining their bounty? üòâ Seriously though, I‚Äôd like to be introduced to fpga, so I‚Äôm not totally against the idea. But I don‚Äôt see why versus has to comply with fpga if that agreement is months away.

[04-Dec-18 10:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well if they have the best tech, they will be rewarded. And yes perhaps they will move on. In the meantime. I may be a customer in the near future.

This is the first mention I have seen of this company. This may also be a trading opportunity if their tech is really that superior. I highly doubt verus is the only coin they are capable of dominating right now.

[04-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Gloryman, I get your point, but pls at some point, I hope you're actually reading what Mike is saying. He's saying this is coming, and in his opinion, the best option is to work with them. It's sort of a trust and verify set up. I think one thing he's saying that you're not appreciating is it's not going to be that easy to just declare all out war on the fpga company and fork the algo. It's gonna take up too much time and resources, and just get worse as most of the development will start being directed to being an endless forking project. If the project can cooperate now, it not only solves this immediate stuation, but ameliorates the inevitable issues that will rear their heads down the line because of the new economics created by coolerating with this company..does that make sense...?

[04-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I am not blaming mike. He needs to do what is best for his company and development team. But as a casual miner and someone interested in the project, I believe that this will damage the project for casual miners and casual people interested in the project. So, I'm getting out before the coins will be all mined by FPGAs and control the prices/run down the price.

[04-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @miketout I think we are missing something. This community is currently built around CPU and GPU miners that cooperate to mine the coin. If we decide that FPGAs are ok, and don't fork, we are basically cutting 80% of the community from the PoW supply as currently a single 2500$ specialized mining hardware is mining more hash than ~160x GTX 1060 GPU farm, forget the small CPU miners or single GPU miners that will not even get a dust as reward for their mining. Actually, that single unit of FPGA represents and average of ~100 people mining casually with their high end CPUs or ~5000 people mining with their typical notebook CPU. I have no problem with the existence of FPGAs, I have a problem with cutting any economic incentive for regular people to get involved when we basically are extremely early and have no big community. If we say ok to the FPGAs, we are fine with ASICs too by default - so we just want more hashrate for the network and are not interested in casual miners or non-miners that are willing to start their journey. The question in here is - are we really mature enough to cut the PoW mining as a way to get involved? Are we really already there? Bitcoin is not mineable at home, ETH is not mineable at home, but those networks are mature, have worldwide community and so on. Are we not afraid that we will kill the growth of our community with the exclusion of any PoW mining incentive? No one will run their CPU for months to get a single coin worth pennies. I am really afraid we are not ready for any other move than hard forking the FPGAs out of the network at the current state of the community.

[04-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm actually in the process of saving up for an FPGA. So, maybe I will be the next group of miners making money on your ran down price VRSC, lol
