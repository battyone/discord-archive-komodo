[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> According to one of the comments below and from what I'm reading about now, it seems- "For now Crypto-bridge is the most active decentralize exchange that we can use. There are few others but they don’t have so much volume." So crypto-bridge doesn't look so bad it seems. Are there any pros and cons to these DEXs that anyone is aware of, or anyone familiar with some of these platforms?

[17-Jan-19 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  In the past, I know IDEX had issues with the exchange being unable to handle high amounts of traffic. And just in general, it's just a little different than using a traditional exchange. Everything has advantages & disadvantages.

BCH Developer Unveils Xthinner Scaling Protocol – Claims to Comp...
On Sunday, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developer Jonathan Toomim unveiled a project he’s been working on called Xthinner, a new block propagation protocol that Xthinner can compress blocks by 99.6 percent and performs roughly 4x to 6x more efficiently than block propagation concepts...

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> what do you guys think about that?

[17-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think, in addition to HODL, LOTR will be a thing soon, too.

[17-Jan-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 😛

[17-Jan-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i should add a  maybe

[17-Jan-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> 😂

[17-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the literal claim in the headline is a bit bold tho

[17-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If it's true then that is pretty impressive. So technically it's not for bch? Looks like he is working toward making a whole new chain

[17-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I feel like that is more off-topicish though

[17-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> btw devs stop dumping your coin so much

[17-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> we know you are mining close to 50% of everything and you have been from the get go

[17-Jan-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> hence thats why you switched again to CPU algo, since you or your pals own or have access to server rooms

[17-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> not sure if its that relevant now, cause i dont know how well optimised its on GPUs but still i suspect you dump major chunks

[17-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @rptr Er... unfounded accusation, really. You could *always* make the accusation the devs chose the PoW due to having some sort of advantage, and it's impossible for them to disprove.

[17-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> The burden of proof is on YOU.

[17-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> no, compared to putting up accusations, that would require actual work to be done.

[17-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03>

[17-Jan-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I’m banking on a MN coin that should have a DEX out soon.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  Hope no one else here lost anything on CT.  I lost a little bit but nothing too important.

[17-Jan-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @0x03 Then it's about as credible as any random, unsubstantiated trash you might read on the net. Background noise.

[17-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I love all the hysterical claims made here, despite them not being born out by any evidence... like trading activity or anything

[17-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Last month it was "FPGA miners crashed the price 7 billion percent since they started!!"

[17-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Wolf0  actually i was here from launch, so i know my share of first hand information and talked to certain people enought to know

[17-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> its up to you whether you believe or not im not gonna fud

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @rptr I can make declarative statements too. "Some dude told me..." is not evidence, nor is it even reasonable suspicion. It's called a cop-out.

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> would be nice if (lets call it "these people") these people stopped dumping the fuck out of this coin

[17-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i dont want to fud here or anything

[17-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i wanna keep it civil

[17-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> I believe they call accusations with zero evidence or justification "defamation of character", or something. Not that you'll be sued, just pointing out it's not a nice thing to do. 😛

[17-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well, like I said, I dont benefit from fudding here, so I need not to convince anybody here about what i said.

[17-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> Oh, and I suppose I should just trust you on that?

[17-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> there you have one dude "block-miner"

[17-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> that guy with virgin account mined like 25%+ of coins first month or so

[17-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i believe there was another one or two big guys that came, as it seems like they been here just for this coin, with vanilla accounts

[17-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> And could be anyone here - even you.

[17-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> Motive would be - dump, spread FUD to drop it more, and buy back.

[17-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well believe whatever you want, these people were devs, their pals or actually whatever but they took way more than its healthy for any crypto environment

[17-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> 90% devs or their pals tho

[17-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> anyway cheers i could be wrong im not here to fud, but raises concerns to me at all times

[17-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> dropping in out of nowhere with loads of fud isn't exactly "keeping it civil" @rptr

[17-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm not seeing anything productive or contributive from you.  Spreading fud is not in any way helpful to the community.

[17-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i was saing the same thing before

[17-Jan-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> its not that its something i just figured out

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> If you want to have a constructive discussion, you'd be coming in with a different approach.

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right now, all I see from you is totally the opposite.

[17-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well however it is, im sure you wont admit anything. So it cannot be constructive I wanted to say you or "maybe not you" could use some limit with the dumping

[17-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @rptr  Do you have any proof?

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm just asking that you stop the fud.  Personally I have not sold any VRSC in months and don't intend to for quite some time...and having lived on day trading in my past I know a thing or two about irresponsible dumping of small coins and take it seriously in general...but even moreso when it comes to a project in which I have a strong love for and belief in...as I'm sure many other community members here do as well.  Especially those who are here for the long run, contribute regularly to the project, etc.  If I were to look at it logically and make any unsubstantiated claims, it would make more sense to assume someone without a vested interest in and who doesn't contribute to the project's success would be dumping and potentially fudding the community to create ideal dump scenarios.

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> Ok i respect it, I stop right here.

[17-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thank you.

[18-Jan-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @rptr 🙄

[18-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Where is this dumping taking place? And when? There is hardly any volume of trading going on. Why is it always people with hardly any stakes at play being the loudest fudders here?

[18-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I don't mind those fudders since they are so obvious. Now if someone with two parts of a brain did some research and made an effort they might be able to do some damage, but I have faith in the community calling out stuff like that.

[18-Jan-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I just want to say that I hate fud more than anyone on this discord.

[18-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> if you arent thinking of selling now, current price doesnt matter. fud/selling is healthy, let people dump. more people would own part of supply. it would be stronger when it rises.

[18-Jan-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> Hi I'm having problems trying to send KMD from Agama wallet. I'm using Verus version (which should be fine afaik).  
v0.5.0 I get an error message about electrum server: "sheperdelectrumsendpromise" 
this comes up when I try to send, or try to claim reward

[18-Jan-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> guys, do you know that crypto bridge now charges additional fee for wallet updates?

[18-Jan-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> I hold another coin and they are delisting from bridge because they charge smth like 0.25 BTC for wallet upgrade

[18-Jan-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @nick cloudpost what coin is that buddy

[18-Jan-19 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> At risk of sending negative vibes, but that sounds like a deal-breaker in my ears, IF it’s true. On a positive note, I’d like submitting a listing query to TradeOgre, preferably by someone good with words. 😃

[18-Jan-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> But does the community think we should get the coin listed if they are going to keep milking the coin with unexpected fees?

[18-Jan-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> should probably be verified before further discussion of alternatives.  Never good to make decisions on incomplete information I think.

[18-Jan-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> "Also SUQA is out.
"SUQA is getting delisted on Cryptobridge in 2 weeks because we will have 2 mandatory wallet upgrades first one at the end of this month and the second one Late March Hard-Fork time. CB is asking 0.5 btc for each upgrade while there is no volume there so we decided to get delisted from Cryptobridge on our own! Please send your SUQA funds to TradeOgre, Coinexchange or Stex!""

[18-Jan-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> I'm holding a bit of Credits (CRDS) - argon2d CPU coin, they will delist from bridge, I think such fees are rediculous

[18-Jan-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> maybe nowadays some upgrades are included in initial listing fee, but you need to verify that

[18-Jan-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> is it depending on trade volume?

[18-Jan-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ver_User I believe 0.5.0 stopped working on the Sapling-upgrade with other Komodo coins. You would need to upgrade to the latest, which works fine.

@CoinMarketCap Hello wonderful people! It's been a focus of my attention for some time now, https://t.co/a5w8GrMJMM exchange. A Great community that's growing by the day, but yet to be listed as an exchange? How come? Many of us would be delighted to have your approval :) ...

[18-Jan-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If anyone wants to pop by CPUminersclub's discord to represent verus in the verus section down the bottom, they might move us back up top and it could be a great place to attract new CPU miners who otherwise might not have heard of us. I'll post a reminder in a day or two but details are in the marketing section here if anyone wants to show support or post helpful links or even just to say hi! 😀

[18-Jan-19 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Would anybody be interested in doing a competition designing the best bumper sticker on stickeryou.com? Perhaps we could all put 50 vrsc into a neutral wallet and pick the winner by vote so it's fair and fun and wouldn't cost the foundation anything!?!?

[18-Jan-19 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Or as @Thoskk just thought of- the vrsc in the pot could be used to make the stickers to pass out to everyone!  I love that idea because everyone is a winner!!!

[18-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I guess it doesn't have to be specific to that website so long as it's a sticker

[18-Jan-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If this gains traction I'll get working right away on a legit one

[18-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah I think the idea of @Godballz is worth considering, and the community here is definetly the right one to join

[19-Jan-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hey!  @Thoskk thought of the coolest part where the pot goes toward winning stickers for everyone instead of just the winner. Perfect community prize come up with in a perfectly community way!

[19-Jan-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  @Thoskk   I would enter that competition

[19-Jan-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> For fun

[19-Jan-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Support the community

[19-Jan-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz awesome! So far a good start! This could be a lot of fun for everyone to participate in and for everyone to also be winners! Plus, at the end of the day we all get really cool kick ass community selected bumper stickers to rock and further support the community when other people get to see em!! 😆

[19-Jan-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> 50 Verus is okay

[19-Jan-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> Yeah the sticker contest sounds rad!

[19-Jan-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> great idea @Godballz!

[19-Jan-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> Is "Truth & Privacy for All" the official slogan?

[19-Jan-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Mike_O. Yes, maybe “and” vs “&” ?

[19-Jan-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just so it matches the website

[19-Jan-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @John Westbrook Thank you!  @Thoskk too! Thanks. 
Hopefully we can continue to work together and maybe make something fun work where we get to all participate and have a good time. I'd be interested myself. That one don't count! 😆

[19-Jan-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> On the issue of Cryptobridge... I would say dance with who brung you. DigitalPrice will be added to CMC at some point, and adding vrsc to more exchanges which are not well known or used, I don't see as benefiting the project. I stand by my initial reaction that there are better uses for 2 bitcoin.

[19-Jan-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @Patrick ManBearPig What would you suggest to do with the btc?

[19-Jan-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I was going to ask the same question. Digital price is good. I have hand no problems using it. Also, if Crypto Union comes out making fiat a smooth transition, then I am really happy about this. But,  we do need to encourage users as quickly as possible or we might find that another coin (unknown as yet) with a similar application of verus becomes more popular.

[19-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> When Verus was announced, it was done so on Bitcointalk. That's the standard. When you go to find the price & price history on CMC, you can't find it. 
People expect it to be on CMC and there's a level of trust, that comes with that.

Maybe it's just me--and I know a few btc is a lot, it really is. But, in some, way, shape or form---most other projects have paid many times over that, for listings..

[19-Jan-19 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I think the community needs to grow. 
And in order to do that, we need exposure.
It's about time more of the crypto community starts to know who Verus is

[19-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz agreed. Exposure is key now

[19-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Patrick ManBearPig , i tend to agree with you. I as well think there might be better exchanges. But than again, we should know which exchanges wants how much listing fee exactly to compare if crypto-bridge is a good deal or not.
