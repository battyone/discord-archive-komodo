[KMD-Discord] <VirtualSoundNW> We do have a web based explorer at https://explorer.veruscoin.io/ which shows you the total network hash power among other things.

[12-Jun-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <JohnWestbrook> woot woot!

[12-Jun-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> wow 14gh

[12-Jun-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> 15.6 now

[12-Jun-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> üòÆ hash rate. wow

[12-Jun-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> I dont know mike there might be a GPU out there üòõ

[12-Jun-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> Or someone going crazy on amazon

[12-Jun-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <lil Komodo> Anyone here know which settings for amazon LOL..

[12-Jun-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <lil Komodo> theres so many its confusing the fuck outta me

[12-Jun-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> someone with Amazon's biggest servers maybe... anything's possible... just before time locks came on, i saw it get up to 18 GH/s briefly on the explorer, and we didn't have GPUs then for sure

[12-Jun-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> ah ok

[12-Jun-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> i think two things are happening... one, we are getting a rise in hash power, and two, we are getting perceived higher hash power than it is sometimes when that happens because of compensation for POS. when it's an issue of compensation, it's not a bad thing, IMO at all. when they happen at the same time, it might look like a bigger burst than it is. i'm curious what we settle at.

[12-Jun-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> right now, it looks like we're already somewhat here/settled.

[12-Jun-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> we're near final on the white paper, so if people like it, we might get a little busier soon. maybe it will calm down when we get to the 192 blocks. at least we'll also announce a bounty soon for some unlocked coins. reddit, twitter, and FB pages ready to open up as soon as we release the white paper. it would be great if people from the community could follow Verus on twitter, talk about the white paper on reddit, and like Verus on FB when that happens.
right now, i think we hit a rise due to combined incoming hash rate and POS. we will see a drop at the next block, I'm pretty sure.

[12-Jun-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> yes. i'd guess the real number is closer to 13-14 GH/s right now

[12-Jun-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> we'll see in the next few blocks

[12-Jun-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <ted> Sounds great.

[12-Jun-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <block-miner> Can't wait for the whitepaper

[12-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <AkiraX> if i have more verus do i have a better chance at staking?

[12-Jun-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <hansen.ng> yes, you would have a better chance.

[12-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> whats the code to point to single address across multiple machines again?

[12-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> I think you're looking for -pubkey

[12-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> yes

[12-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> can you point me to that?

[12-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Hmm - I'm not sure where or if it is documented. Just pass it a public key for an address you have in another wallet. You can get the pubkey using the validateaddress CLI/RPC command.

[12-Jun-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> validateaddress

[12-Jun-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> in windows

[12-Jun-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> tried add -pubkey=03xxxxxxxx

[12-Jun-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> wrong cli format

[12-Jun-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Ah, I don't believe pubkey works using cli/rpc. I believe verusd has to be invoked with the pupkey parameter in the command line or in the config file

[12-Jun-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> so what should i type?

[12-Jun-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> you need to set -pubkey=<66 char hex pubkey> when you first run verusd, so:
./verusd -gen -pubkey=<66 char hex pubkey>

[12-Jun-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> why can not complete immu ??

[12-Jun-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> help ??

[12-Jun-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> 1000 confirm ?

[12-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Hi @Norain, coins mined right now are time locked for a random number of blocks within a range. Immature blocks can't be spent or used for staking. The number next to mature tells you how long it will be until the transaction is unlocked, in blocks.

[12-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> so when i have coin in my balance

[12-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Expand the Direction column so you can see the number next to immature.

[12-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> 831389

[12-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> second or block ?

[12-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Block, and the block time is 1 minute.

[12-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> The range is from 3 months to 2 years and 3 months, approximately.

[KMD-Discord] <Norain> üò¶

[12-Jun-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> why so long

[12-Jun-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> To give us a chance to reward early miners with large coinbases, create a community of those people who all have an itnerest in the coin succeeding, and prevent quick selloff of early coins.

[12-Jun-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> They can't be spent by anyone, even the devs, as these are coins we all mine together.

[12-Jun-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> As soon as the block reward has dropped to 96 the newly mined coins won't be locked any more.

[12-Jun-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <SevFC18> How long to mine any verus at 3mh
