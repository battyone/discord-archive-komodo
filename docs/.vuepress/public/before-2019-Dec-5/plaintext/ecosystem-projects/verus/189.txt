[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This would have to be after PBaaS, I believe, but it would be nice to see an ultralight protocol that was compatible and could benefit from notaries, but work either way

[30-Jun-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it's a good plan to give the choice to the creators of the PBaaS chains if they want to sacrifice (a part of) decentralization for the ability to have faster notarizations and access to the nSPV clients.

[30-Jun-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I fully understand too that we shouldn't expect it in the release of PBaaS on the mainnet. Remains to be seen if Komodo has that implemented by then.

[30-Jun-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I will continue reading verus vision paper tomorrow 
Today was exciting day following nSPV
Any way Verus development goes with ultra lite client either just using MMR like tech or nSPV I would love to see that progress. üôÇüëç

[30-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I guess both implementation can exist in parallel if I get right, nSPV and MMR based like client

[01-Jul-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's good... Cheap transfers to the exchange... Too bad that exchanges requires full KYC

[01-Jul-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that alone would justify trading there üòÉ

[01-Jul-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Jul-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LB what's the issue?
@bimagets best miners right now are CPUs, like AMD Ryzen R5s or R7s or others, and FPGAs. GPUs aren't fast enough yet to make a profit. That may change with PBaaS, but you should always do better on CPUs and FPGAs.

[02-Jul-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @bimagets CPUs are the best with VerusHash v2, but 970 GTXs give about 2.7 MH/s

[02-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You have seen more than us. I hoped his presentation was put on video and published somewhere... haven‚Äôt seen anything yet, unfortunately.

[02-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Malti> i took some pictures of slides that were interesting, but didn't get everything

[02-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Malti> very professional, liked that as well

[02-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you could share them in marketing, that would be great.

[02-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I just setup a demo of the new (currently in development) VerusChainTools so you can play around with it and learn about CLI commands!  The VRSCTEST wallet my server is using doesn't have a balance yet, I'm working on finding out why it's not moving along, maybe something up with the VRSCTEST nodes, but I'll get that working, in the meantime hope it's a fun thing to play with and let me know of any errors you encounter since it's very beta and I'm hoping people playing with it will help me test all the Verus daemon rpc commands.  Here's the demo site: https://veruspay.io/vct/

[02-Jul-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> this would be worth a pin in #cli-wallet  , woudlnt it? üòÉ

[02-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I just put it in VerusPay with some screenshots giving sample commands üòÉ

[02-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I need to get the syncing thing figured out, because right now my balance is 0 until the chain moves along

[02-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Oliver Westbrook When lambo?

[02-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Are there separate z_ cli commands for sapling addresses?

[02-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Cli window in settings on agama 0.5.6a-beta doesn‚Äôt like my input for some reason

[02-Jul-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No seperate sapling command, but ~~sapling~~ sprout has be deprecated, afaik

[02-Jul-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> You mean sprout

[02-Jul-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Sapling is current

[02-Jul-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> @Hollowman9000 what do you mean?

[02-Jul-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yaeah, sorry, I'm doing a couple of cenversations simultaneously right now

[02-Jul-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> There are commands that are specific to working with private txs

[02-Jul-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> What command are you trying?

[02-Jul-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm working on a CLI guide, but other things keep popping up...

[02-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> Great idea.

[02-Jul-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @0x03 had that Idea... I'm now trying to make 1 guide for Linux, OsX and windows CLI... Some commands need to be formatted 'differently' for windows...

[02-Jul-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> windows doesn't deserve the formatting requirements it demands

[02-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @Oliver Westbrook verus cli interface in agama settings wasn‚Äôt liking my input

[02-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Went to command prompt and it worked

[02-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> Ah, interesting. I'm not familiar with using the agama cli interface

[02-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I rarely do

[02-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I haven't spun up Agama in I don't know how long

[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> I understand there are many other priorities at the moment, but just curious if there is any idea or intention of producing a Verus specific wallet at some point in the future?

[02-Jul-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> You mean a non-agama wallet?

[02-Jul-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> Yes exactly

[02-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I know many of us share the sentiment üòÉ do you code at all?

[02-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I only use.CLI.

[03-Jul-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> I have a feeling the world has no idea what its in for, in a good way of course, when people really begin to hear what Verus is all about.  Kudos @michaeltoutjr @miketout @Asher @englal and all of you who diligently contribute and have been part or parcel to making Verus what it is now and what it will be tomorrow ‚ù§Ô∏è glad to be a part of this project

[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Just wanted to say a big thank you to the  verus community for not only providing help with agama and an alternative wallet, but actively adding new coins to help out such as zexo and oda

[03-Jul-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> üôè

[03-Jul-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crabby Paddy I don't believe we added ODA, and I don't think anyone knows anything about it

[03-Jul-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is not on the list to add, and it was a surprise to see the PR. we have not heard about it and really need to get PBaaS done as the priority. If there is some reason to believe it must get in before, please talk to @michaeltoutjr . Right now, we are only planning to add DP and Hemp Coin before PBaaS.

[03-Jul-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks everyone for all the kind words towards devs and others contributing on a regular basis. I would also thank many of the people here who have contributed to helping us build a strong supportive community or in the case of @Oliver Westbrook and others, doing great work on development like VerusPay and web tools for Verus. We are trying now to focus on getting finished with PBaaS, as there is a Komodo hard fork in mid July, which we had hoped to upgrade alongside and are not going to, at least partially due to the extra work from the wallet and new coins. That will cost the foundation some amount of Verus directly to maintain uninterrupted notarization and we are not looking for any new work to add before PBaaS is complete. We want to have the PBaaS hard fork as soon after Komodo's fork as possible, and there is still work to be done. Devs may remain a bit scarce on the channels until after that, but we all try to check in and help periodically.

[03-Jul-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think he meant OUR not ODA. ODA is still an erc token

[03-Jul-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I would like to take the time out to thank myself, Cruz, for being a good Verus community member...  
There's no need to beat yourself up over things in life, bc others will do that. So I try to keep it positive with myself... 
Verus is on the right path. Mike sounds busy, bc he is busy. And that's how he prefers it. 
Keep at it Mike.
