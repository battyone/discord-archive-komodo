[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> it's good to see you in the discord tho @verz36 üòÉ

[31-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> thanks

[31-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC.html you can get the zipfile from here and extract that to the right place for your OS, @verz36

[31-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> this will cut it down to a bunch of minutes, and others have done it successfully as well

[31-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> cool thanks

Did the reddit troll mean ‚Äúshill coins nobody knows about‚Äù?  

Can‚Äôt even get his crypto terminology right

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i smell triggering

[31-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> @Hollowman9000 you just fell for it

[31-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> If I was triggered I would have posted on reddit üòâ

[31-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Just calling a spade a spade

[31-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> you were not triggered _enough_ to post on reddit

[31-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> nah for real, "do not feed the trolls" is about as valid as ever

[31-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> what we _can_ do however, and we're doing this with great success already, is being an excellent supportive community.

[31-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> go have some fuckwad talk troll-bs on reddit. all it takes for somebody to be convinced that this here is a special community and project is to join us once, and ask a bunch of questions (and actually be helped)

[31-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> my first impression on the komodo discord i remember was not as smooth as the experience new users will get in here. and no troll on earth probably can stop this.

[31-Oct-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> (minidisclaimer: i love komodo. the parlance in the slack was just different.)

[31-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> @benohanlon i know i'm dumb sometimes, can you just post the URL of the reddit thing here? only yesterday i failed to find a mention of myself using discord search function. i feel so bad.

[31-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> sure i just didn't want to get accused of brigading

[31-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i just now notice, reddit labels you as a crypto god

[31-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> whats the metric for that? (nothing inbetween the lines here, i just wonder about this metric)

[31-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> let me build up my monologue even further. @benohanlon i'm under the impression that this 'hianone' account is under a lot of other komodo/verus related posts with a similar tone to it

[31-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> not sure but i am pretty godly

[31-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> to be fair it may be a special label just for me?

[31-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> memento mori, benohanlon

[31-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't understand people down voting something without any comment. It's like reading a newspaper article on the subway and giving thumbs down to the stranger next to you

[31-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> oh well, it wouldn't be the first time something like this happened to me in real life, or at least witnessing something similar.

[31-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> a wrong tshirt, a wrong newspaper, frickin' SITTING the wrong god damned way can trigger people to way worse reactions than just a thumbdown gesture

[31-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> for example: a a german, being a bald head with a long (nerdy) beard, wearing exclusively black and having a favour for proper boots (over sneakers) will definitely be enough to trigger a nazi comment

[31-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and dont you dare react any other way than admitting that you were just about to deny holocaust!

[31-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> its like the 'can i talk to your manager' haircut, moreover the associated behaviour, is now in a lot of peoples heads. and as long as attention will only go as far as to judge by whats right in front of you, it will only be worse.

[31-Oct-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> One way to quiet trolls is to just demonstrate what we are really about...like strong community, innovative and forward-thinking development, strong leadership and brilliant coding by example from lead dev @miketout, I could go on üòÉ

[31-Oct-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i agree

[31-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i kind of said that above, too üòâ

[31-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I haven't even read anything above yet lol

[31-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Same brain waves!

[31-Oct-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just woke up

[31-Oct-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> here, have a can of dr pepper cola

[31-Oct-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> got a cup of joe at least

[31-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, hahaha, I like how you put it better @0x03 (veruspool.xyz) üòÉ

[31-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> All those who are interested and excited to hear the news immediately came to check out the project and didn't have time to comment on reddit.  It's like when you read a column in the paper that you totally love but writing a letter to the editor either falls through the cracks or you don't think of doing it, you just sort of enjoy it.

[31-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Plus people just upvote, commenting praise is hard and your history follows you.  It's more acceptible to create a history of snark on reddit...if you are positive the guy like that comes out and criticizes you (like he did @benohanlon ) for having a history of being positive!

[31-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Sort of funny and a touch immature.  @benohanlon you clever bastard always ready to go to bat and demonstrate strength of position and rooted in intelligence and maturity.  My brotha!

[31-Oct-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points. When your brand new drone breaks, first thing you do is go complain on Amazon but when it works perfectly well who has time for reviews when you can fly

[31-Oct-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sounds like personal experience talking haha

[31-Oct-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> By the way and I don't know how frowned upon this might be but if you have a VPN I found that you can vote for verus as many times as you want..

[31-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I actually don't have much interest in drones don't even know why I picked that to be honest haha

[31-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I agree with that concept

[31-Oct-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> I'd like to add to Godballz example from above: when your brand new drone breaks, nowadays, you go out to seek the error everywhere, but not in the fact that you missed to correctly tie down the fucking propellers.

[31-Oct-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)>

[31-Oct-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hahaha

[31-Oct-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So what you're saying is that the trolls need to look inward?

[31-Oct-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's not my preference in crypto projects that's getting your panties all bunched up, you're just a hurt soul that's crying out for help in the form of negative ignorant Reddit comments

[31-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'd like to make a complaint. Those damn sapling transactions are way too fast. So what, now anybody and their mother can send private Z transactions anytime they want?

[31-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The couple of posts I put up about verus have been downvoted almost instantly. I'm wondering if they are even finished reading the title before they start clicking away.

[31-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> We will find those same trolls in the trading section soon enough wishing they listened

[31-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wtb an open mind

[31-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> hahaha

[31-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> Godballz, on that very matter, i kind of CAN actually see a corner case where a too fast z-tx will maybe be a trouble for my working setup

[31-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and rest assured if i hit that i will make a fuzz about it being mikes personal fault and not me fixing my damn pool ü§£

[31-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> oh, forgott to add:

[31-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha. Nicely stated. Very much in the spirit of anybody's fault but mine. The reddit trolls would be proud

[31-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Curious though. How could that be an issue?

[31-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> for example, if you depend on the duration of some operation

[31-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Curious though. How could that be an issue?

[31-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i can imagine 10 ways easily

[31-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oops

[31-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> depending on something to take 5min when it takes 1s is an awesome denial of service vector üòâ

[31-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh I see

[31-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> can anyone help me? i was mining yesterday using my vrsc address, received the payment but when i opened agama today my address was different and i didn¬¥t received any payment

[31-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Phantaruk7 are you using Agama in Lite Mode?

[31-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Or did you at any point?

[31-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @John Westbrook @miketout 
1. once we have the changes from verus merged to komodod, would be possible to make 50% verusPoS and 50% Equihash PoW assetchain ?

[31-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's definitely a @miketout and @jl777c question üòÉ

[31-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> yep, asked James already, and he pointed me to mike üòõ

[31-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I have further question too once that's answered üòÅ

[31-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, putting number to questions.

[31-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> 2. Assuming once it's merged to komodo code, later it'd be possible to add different mining algorithms to chose an option for assetchains, like scrypt, x11, etc. etc. Not entirely sure how hard or easy it might be, but I'm sure it is possible.
So, assuming other algorithms are also supported to be configured to make an assetchain, will verusPoS be supported with those other PoW algorithems?
If not, then can you please give a bit detail why verusPoS would be specific to verusPoW ?

[31-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> uh, good questions

[31-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> eager to see the answers really

[31-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c may be you can partially answer the second question too?

[31-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Okay, continuing on just assumptions... üòÑ

[31-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> 3. So, let's assume verusPoS will be possible to use with other PoW algo to create an assetchain, does that mean that the same Nothing-at-Stake problem is solved with those assetchains created with this combination of 50% verusPoS and 50% otherPoW algo? Am I getting it correct?

[31-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i think you are (disclaimer: thinking is bad)

[31-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the PoW side of PoS/PoW wont affect the PoS side much

[31-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> meaning how can the blockhash function specifics invalidate the N@S solution?

[31-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> for the PoW blocks

[31-Oct-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> cant say its impossible, but it seems highly unlikely
