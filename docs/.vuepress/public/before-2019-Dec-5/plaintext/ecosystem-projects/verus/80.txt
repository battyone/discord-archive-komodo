[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk If you have a POW algo- the whole point is you don't care about the intent of miners. It's part of the trustless part. Innovation is painful yes, but don't see any signs of 51pct attack or fucking up the integrity of the blockchain. It's just folks with really fast miners - for now until faster yet stuff comes along

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey,  @Post and  @Patrick ManBearPig shall we just not talk to each other. Sound fair? Are u going to follow me around and disagree with everything I say?

[07-Dec-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> If its not true, yes, i will

[07-Dec-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If anything no conclusion at all can be drawn from the price action of verus due to the low volume of trading. A stronger case could be made that the price dilution is because the trading is now spread across 3 exchanges rather than 1 at the time of the price spike. Not to mention the absolute dump the entire market has taken.

[07-Dec-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Ok, trolls are just a part of life if u guys want to chase my attention then so be it.  @Patrick ManBearPig and  @Post

[07-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky , yet at this point in time the project seems to want to appeal to the masses, not the few fpga owners.

[07-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> @GEBucky  I understand where you are coming from. presumably all here are "small" in comparison to china. Crypto has to take measures to decentralise, otherwise we all get screwed in the end!

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> guys chill please

[07-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> And way thanks,  @zpajk  @Lumbi @John Westbrook @GEBucky for trying to keep the conversation sensible.

[07-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Would you stop trying to monopolize the conversation at every opportunity?

[07-Dec-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @Lumbi yep - skipped past the bitchy coments above üòÉ But you are spot on. And by the way - it's not China. Its US, Europe, Asia at large, and from what I can gather not a lot centralization but indiviuals hosting on platforms.  but there is some risk in pool centralization on Verus. Most attacks don't come from pools - they come from people buying shit tons on NiceHash - your algo isn't there so that's good. Frankly you will get cheap coins from the flippers, and it will settle down in a week or two (better algo to chase or fork). Regardless I am keeping mine as think it's a cool project

[07-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @miketout  if "secret mining" is bad then why private money are good ?

[07-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout  My thoughts on FPGAs
The 'promise' of FPGA in coins they can successfully mine is that they are about 7x the cost  of gpu with 11x the speed. (ballpark). 
As I see it though.. on Verus they are currently about to gain 17-20x gpu.  Verus might be the most profitable thing for FPGA's to mine currently. 
If more miners had the bitstream, then the hashrate would go even higher. 
To gain parody, the FPGA's hashrate would have to be taken down to around 7x that of a GPU. IMO 
Eventually this same conversation will come up with ASICS
If at any point we give up the fight for parody, what was even the point of trying to make CPU and GPUs equal if it quickly got overrun but the next bigger thing?
Unless VRSC fights for parody to the end, then there was no point.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I believe all of us here want the best for verus , which might just be allowing fpga‚Äôs to mine verus or not ,( I totally get the decentralised aspect , anyone should be able to mine verus ) but on the other hand , the people that decide to secretly mine verus with fpga‚Äôs choses to go a different route to all the rest of us, they kept it quiet instead of openly announcing it to us all ,even if they knew most of us regulars haven‚Äôt got any fpga‚Äôs , they could have simply just told us all at the time they have cracked it and made a fpga able to mine verus , we all could then have worked together to see what we could do to keep the smaller hash rate contributors still in the game , maybe even all put together and purchase or rent 1 or a few fpga‚Äôs for the verus community to share the hash rate , i know, not the greatest idea but , more along the lines of community spirit , maybe im well off the mark , i dont know , all i know is this has been a bad time for us on discord having to deal with mixed emotions over the subject , i would love it if we could all mine verus together cpu,gpu,and fpga, but i can see theres lots of factors in the way at the moment , i will vote with my limited knowledge of the subject , to make verus a good and fair project to follow for all , but i will be disappointed if the verus fpga miners decide to go there own path and just keep everything to them selfs and not be open about it , like before , we need more community spirit together , and not two separate verus communities working against each other , even though this is a community decision that we need to make , i thank mike for his patience and understanding , i think hes doing a bloody good job so far trying to be fair and i wish him the best of luck bringing both communities together , if possible, ü§û

[07-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @stretcher83 . Me and mike had a good chat this morning and I think the issue is pretty conclusive now. The other community is not cooperating fully. So, he is creating a fork of verus so that it limits the hash rate of FPGAs, Verus hash 2.0. This is a great solution in my opinion and hopefully stop the driving down of the price of Verus.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Do you know when the verus hash 2.0 will be in effect and do we need to use updated miners?

[07-Dec-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> yep @jl777c Read that.. I was just adding my thoughts into the situation and just outlining its an important fight to fight. Just thinking out loud with some numbers and stats.

[07-Dec-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> this situation is quite interesting actually.. 
the dev team have been killing it..
now this stand as another test, on that is real world and happening now
Can Verus come out with another win that betters the whole community with more tech to upstream. ? üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi all, seems we have concerns. I understand, and it's no fun across crypto, but until we get onto to more exchanges, for example Cryptopia and others, we are subject to sentiment of a few. personally, i'm going to roll with that in this market. last night, based on the trades, someone, maybe 2 people, but I think maybe one in two trades, sold a little over 11K in a few minutes, and we went down. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't call that a trend. If it's shaking weak hands, then we will get stronger, I believe. We are small now, and it doesn't take that much to do that to the down or upside. I realize some people might think that is a telling sign for the future, but personally, I can't see it as telling for post-VerusHash 2.0 or beyond. We could go further down, or we could go up. We've been counted out before, and it hasn't been true. I wish we could all have perfect future-vision, but we can only have vision and work towards making it the future. Right now, we make VerusHash 2.0, and if it doesn't equalize the way we think, we can adjust or tune. If I didn't think there's a very good chance we will be much more equalized, hopefully with FPGAs at less than 7x, maybe much less, I'd change the algo until I did. In any case, I probably won't have an FPGA bitstream to iterate and test unless someone develops the bitstream for us and that purpose. I believe I could likely dive in, bite the bullet to learn what I need and do it myself, but that would be too inefficient. Once someone does develop a bitstream and we get numbers on the new algo, we will reevaluate then. At the end of it, we still have all of our options. If we are impatient, then we can be worried, otherwise, I don't think we are in bad shape.

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In fact, I feel this has helped us in ways we might not see yet. We have more dev resources across the community asking to help, which is great. We have our own plan that, if successful, will be a model for others, and if not, we can solve it in one way or another.

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Currerntly we are in a market where price has little representation of performance. I would not worry about price. We are in the great washout. A part of that is price (weak hands).. but the bigger washout is weak tech. This is the only thing to focus on..

[07-Dec-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Thanks @miketout . I'm really looking forward to Verus 2.0. Do you have a time frame? Also, what is the relationship between Verus and chips? Is chips part of Verus?

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> If the crypto market does anything well, it's test you to see what you are made of. And it does this, over and over. I've met nobody that can predict the future. You just do the best that you can, in this market, to respect and stay true to yourself & always be measuring your  Risk v Reward. The way I see it, Verus did exactly that.  And we can't honestly say, it was for certain the best move. We need time to be able to say that. But Verus did deal with something that 95% of crypto projects would have no sustainable answer.

[07-Dec-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney that's my feeling too. My priority now is to get this next release nailed, and then to get back to PBaaS work while the bitstream developers go at it. Once they have something, either people will mine in secret, or they will see that we don't inherently hate technology and decide they might do better to let us know this time. If someone comes to me/us to offer bitstream testing as soon as it's available, we should reward them with a welcome, even if our new algo doesn't equalize as much as we'd like. Then we decide our next move, no nail biting, IMO, just work on what we can and adjust if necessary on this. Most of us, if not all, hope it's not necessary to adjust at all. I personally think there's a good chance of that, but as with many things we've done, this actually hasn't been done yet, so no one, not even the bitstream devs, know for sure. @Gloryman the target time frame is in the announcement as well, and I wouldn't call it Verus 2.0 yet üòÉ only VerusHash.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, you don't have to go back and read it again, we said within a couple weeks is the release target. Thanks @Cruz , but I also see the same vision in people among the community. I have a vision for this project, but I'm sure I'm not the only one in sync with it based on a lot of conversations. Nothing in what is happening now shakes (or actually even impacts) my belief in the long term vision.

[07-Dec-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout what about chips I see there is a verustest channel

[07-Dec-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> are they using verushash for chips?

[07-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Go ask

[07-Dec-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CHIPS uses sha256d, I believe, which had ASICs. I helped them get VerusHash in for testing. Now that we see what likely some of the best FPGA devs can do, on our last integration, we will iterate. The current algorithm uses AVX and AESENC instructions in very tight code, and the issue is that while it leverages CPU optimizations enough to near equalize GPUs, that doesn't take enough space on the FPGA layout to prevent significant HW parallelism. The new approach leverages much more CPU integrtion, much more than originally, and in much tighter code that I hand tuned over some of the fastest code using it in the world today. It does a complex operation called a carryless multiply (kind of), further optimized to lean even more heavily on those instructions. As far as FPGAs go, there is research showing that this has unique challenges to make performant on hardware, especially the way we are using it. Right now, I can only go by research and theory, and then the chaos of the real world will test that theory.

[07-Dec-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> GPUs were not quite equalized before. that may change with this algo too

[07-Dec-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Thats really interesting. Do you know any good resources to help me better understand what you just wrote?

[07-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I actually think that predominatly CPU mining is better for the project. Also,  I have a threadripper üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It will not be exactly the code in this, but very similar in approach. This paper mentions some of the instructions we will be using, but says testing them is beyond scope: http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12618023/index.pdf

[07-Dec-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman all solutions have issues. as someone pointed out to me when discussing this, CPUs also mean botnets. I think ideally, we should have CPUs and GPUs able to mine reasonably and FPGAs that are fast enough to be the professional solution. I think that will result in maximum miner decentralization over time.

[07-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Yeah, Thanks for paper. I'm looking forward to KMDlabs apparently they teach newbies how all this stuff works and I'm anxious to learn.

[07-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm sure that will be a great experience and super useful for learning. at the same time, i don't think there is a place besides the fire of doing a project with a world of people leveraging any tech they can to get an advantage that can teach you many of these things üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Yeah, I guess Its one of those subject without a textbook to teach you because the writers and teachers are busy getting rich instead of writing textbooks.

[07-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout perhaps time to collaborate at least in conversation with Kristy/OhGodaGirl. As the dev for ProgPow (which is the only other algo that seeks parity)  and quite knowledgeable about FPGA's as they were a focus of Minority hosting. (Although minority is closing up shop and sending their FGPA business and hosting to SQRL. I'm not sure what project she is moving onto). Either way, seems like a great place to start.

[07-Dec-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> someone who has the private keys of this address: RAf5mi6Ma9fSwGa7SeziW2rQa2qnAAuMia, signed the transaction to send it to the 4 addresses in this transaction: https://explorer.veruscoin.io/tx/f5536df9be77c8f8611dcec64d5fa74435e416ca5cc52d98dd676648d8ab8ed8

[07-Dec-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if that's not you, then someone has the private key

[07-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Also, only 1000 tokens were taken which were transfered 10 minutes before, nothing else

[07-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> That's why I'm asking

[07-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> still no idea what happened

[07-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> So, the thing is. Someone made a donation to the fee address

[07-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> 10 minutes after the payment was received, it was sent to the 4 addresses, of which 3 are mining on the pool, and one is random and I've never seen it

[07-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> why? that's a good question

[07-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's a good question. you may have one of the types of malware that takes your wallet.dat. they are in the wild. i see that the address was first used yesterday, as you say. it also looks like you're still using it for mining. the transaction to those 4 addresses was definitely signed by the private key of this address. you're right that there's no normal way someone could get that if it was made by your wallet yesterday unless they got it from you or your machine, and there's no way that transaction could have been signed with current technology unless someone had it. since you're mining to the same address, if you believe it is compromised, I'd recommend moving funds to an address that is not. somehow, the facts are that the transaction that moved that 1000 VRSC was signed by the private key, and if someone other than you has that, I would somehow get another address to mine to.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> She definitely didn't end up there by accident. As I said, from the short videos I've seen she seems very knowledgeable.  I apologize if I've misinterpreted your last sentence but did you mean to imply that she had a hand in the creation of the eth asic or did you mean she was able to create and steal an eth asic from bitmain?

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Looks like she does some work on fpga and asic design but also a lot to fight them using that knowledge. Found an article she wrote about progpow that reiterates and expands on some of what we've said and seems relevant- <https://medium.com/@OhGodAGirl/thank-you-alexander-for-your-constructive-feedback-d39078079186>

Good reads on the very issues affecting not just us, but the entire community.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Pallas reading about that now, thanks. Seems like she has a realistic view while striving for idealistic goals, I can dig that
