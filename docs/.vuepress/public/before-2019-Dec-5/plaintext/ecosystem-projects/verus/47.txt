[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Godballz you mean an atomic swap? KMD already have it on barterdex

[29-Oct-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When sapling goes live , will we be able to stake some coins from within this desktop pungo wallet on ios ?

[29-Oct-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Probably not ?

[29-Oct-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> Will involve some development I guess

[29-Oct-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kimmel (Peer2.group)> will need to better study how it works

[29-Oct-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Oct-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks @CryptoAlex and  @ok88. That's really cool I had no idea that's what Atomic swaps were

[30-Oct-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> Why have the blocks been moving so slow on the explorer?

[30-Oct-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they are always averaging 1 minute, but have high variance. that is normal

[30-Oct-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <djchahal> how do i start with VerusCoin?

[30-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <djchahal> do I just download the miner and start mining?

[30-Oct-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> Download the wallet
Rustle up an address
Buy some hashing power or use your own 
Point said hashing power to your new address
Firmly tuck dick between your legs then run around the house screaming *‚ÄùI‚Äôm a girl ... I‚Äôm a girl‚Äù*

[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> hey guys

[30-Oct-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> what¬¥s the command to set the miner name on ccminer?

[30-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> i¬¥m using luckpool what¬¥s this ''jackpot''?

[30-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <EvilRabbit> When you're the who finds the right solution for the block you get extra 2 coins from the block reward

[30-Oct-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> @Phantaruk7 the workername would be set by adding it to your address (which you specify as username). i guess like this: `-u REu8nyxMxtX3vYFKeCE21FLZduqdjDvZA2.yourname`

[30-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> feel free to use that address to mine to

[30-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ellkira> ccminer or nheqminer is better ?

[30-Oct-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> ccminer

[30-Oct-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> @0x03 is there any boostrap available for 4c wallet?

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> updated bootstrap node/archive this morning

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> so yes

[30-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> (i did a 'manual' regeneration of the archive after the software update)

[30-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> perfect thanks

[30-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 10-1/2 hours until fork

[30-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Roughly

[30-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> correct

[30-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> I wonder, is there any way to count number of nodes in the network? If cheat-catcher stakes some reasonable amount - I bet that number would be huge.

[30-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> @gBall you can track the price by using blockfolio!

[30-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Daira> or hasn't it activated yet?

[30-Oct-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> in ~10hours or 600 blocks

[30-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Daira congratulations on Sapling, mate. Hard work there, tough math.

[30-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I try to follow, but it is really really deep math, out of our reach, sincerely.

[30-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> it's like freaking magic.

[30-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Great job.

[30-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Looking forward to this activation, this is historic.

[30-Oct-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Daira Sapling activates at block 227520,  ~518 minutes from now

[30-Oct-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Welcome @Daira!  Thanks for checking in on us.  Looks like we'll be live at about 8:30PM EDT today.  Thank you and the Zcash team for your incredible work.  This is one of the most important shifts in crypto IMO.

[30-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Daira Thanks for stopping by, and thank you for all your work on Zcash and Sapling! We'd also be happy to discuss and/or share work that we're doing on extending some Sapling functions to include smart transactions, proof of stake solutions, or otherwise. We're activating at block 227520. We've got the pools and Electrum servers updated, and it looks like everything is ready.
BTW, we have an updated Electrum server and wallet that supports Zcash lite mode for transparent Sapling transactions, and we are also looking at lite mode z-transaction solutions. We'd be happy to collaborate if you have interest.

[30-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but bots for that number makes sense

[30-Oct-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> They have a captcha

[30-Oct-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 you can generate addresses the same before and after. You will still need to specify ‚Äúsapling‚Äù after the fork to get a sapling address.
