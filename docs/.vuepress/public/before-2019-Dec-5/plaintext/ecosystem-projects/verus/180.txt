[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> DP's down.

[14-Jun-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe time to try Graviex ðŸ˜ƒ

[14-Jun-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i asked them about it and haven't heard back yet. are you just getting a cert date problem or worse?

[14-Jun-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lord Power> @jintaa I just noticed that as well, I dont see anything on their twitter about them being down

[14-Jun-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> They're in Europe, so I guess they may be sleeping

[14-Jun-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103 (Ginasis Mining)> Well hope we can try for a CMC listing again now having two exchanges that are CMC listed

[14-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bubu> good morning folksâ˜•

[14-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> There has been two CMC listed exchanged for a few months now. Since January?

[14-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Mid February

[14-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Patrick Crypto, I think just one for a bit. I guess DP has a coin on CMC but DP as an exchange isn't actually on CMC unfortunately. 
But... Now it should only be a matter of time.. and I really couldn't imagine things working out better.

[14-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> VRSC has been listed on Stex for almost a year, and Crypto-Bridge since mid Feb

[14-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Things seem to be coming together at a healthy, natural rate and we should get there at least, in no small part, thanks to the goodwill brought on through our continued mutual support for and from our KMD brethren. What better way to forge ahead in this sometimes seemingly jaded world of crypto that's quickly becoming calloused over from the past decade's model of selfishness and secrecy. Reading the tweets from the last few days has been a refreshing change of pace. Way to lead by example!   Would also like to thank the Pirate team and community too!

[14-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> They paid for the CB listing because CMC.

[14-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is stex and cryptobridge on CMC as exchanges?

[14-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yes

[14-Jun-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but CB sucks, and I think only me and some bots trade on Stex

[14-Jun-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hmm not sure but perhaps there are other stipulations like volume or something

[14-Jun-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yes

[14-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well I set up accounts on the two new exchanges and sent a few bucks over to try to help things along. We have the means now so hopefully just a short matter of time

[14-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I like DP, and they seem like nice people, but they need to get their shit together

[14-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Just when they were starting to get some traction and momentum they are stumbling

[14-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, I try not to get too attached to any one exchange, simply because there's too many unknowns and the history hasn't been the greatest for many seemingly established exchanges. That being said, I have grown quite fond of Digital Price and I hope they continue to grow along with some of the better projects they had the foresight to support. For that reason, along with their pretty good support, I wish them the best.

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> where did you get support @Godballz ?

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> discord? livechat?

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Pretty prompt email response and resolution

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This was a few months ago

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> ok ðŸ‘Œ

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> This SSL issue, right after the KMD theft, degrades my confidence in them. Hopefully they learn from it. It's a misstep which can cause a huge loss of business though.

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if you have a selection of different coins, it's difficult to get attached with one exchange anyway ^^ I think I'm registred at least on a dozen exchanges, to get all the coins sold and bought I mined and hodl until now.

[14-Jun-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Zaddex is supposed to launch in a day or so. Supposed to have a VRSC/Fiat gateway(not sure when)

[14-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> yea @Patrick Crypto i once made a marketbuy... got the vrsc but the order was still "open" and i could cancel it

[14-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> i canceled it, got the btc back and kept the vrsc...

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> CryptoBridge vrsc/btc, is an unverified market ....

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> what exactly do you mean by unverified @10

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> go look it up

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yeah what

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> probably bc it has no volume at all

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Context?

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Okay

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> On an exchange, you choose BTC pairings etc

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus pairing is unverified

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> What are you talking about?

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> On CryptoBridge, they have a section, unverified

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's like you started in the middle of a story

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> okay you're already annoying today

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dÎ›tmox> sorry i didn't get it either...

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Go look at it

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guys...

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> On an exchange, you have different markets

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> BTC ETH BNB

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> unverified

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I've never seen it

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> But that is where I found Verus

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i have no clue what you mean by unverified still, and please be kind to each other

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that goes for you too, Patrick

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @0x03 listen

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> ffs

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> All i did was ask what the context of what they were talking about was-- I clearly wasn't the only one who didn't know.

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm just saying before you stick more questionable emojis to 10's posts ðŸ˜‰

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess he's trying to say that ~~DP~~ CB has a section called "unverified market"

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ~~hard to see now as it's still down~~

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> CryptoBridge

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> My emoji was better than what I was going to type...

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I'm surprised you didn't type an essay about it

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> lol

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> take your fight into a DM if you want to spar on

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I'm not even fighting

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Just banter

[14-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Im fine lol

[14-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Okay

[14-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> So Unverified

[14-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Thosk was spot on

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> It's hard to describe.
I've never seen it on any exchange

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I showed Godballz

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah, just wrong exchange ðŸ˜„

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> lol

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I couldn't find the pairing

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> So I used, find in page

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Viola

[14-Jun-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nille> good day everyone

[14-Jun-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but that might be related to DEX, don't you think? @10

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Well it should be on CMC then

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Bc CryptoBridje is on CMC

[14-Jun-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> might be related to API, or maybe volume

[14-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Did I hear my name? Haha hey y'all. Mornin here! Gotta rush off to work but did I see something about fiat to z-address?! That would be crazy..

[14-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> miketoutLast Saturday at 2:10 AM
we have Stex and CB. not many people use them
we applied to CMC, and they said to point them to a CMC listed exchange that gets volume. DP volume would be fine, but it's not on CMC listed exchanges

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> FishyGuts fixed that

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> DP will be CMC soon

[14-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @Godballz Supposedly on Zaddex. CrabbyPaddy could give more info

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> he's getting the API issue resolves with CMC

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Bc Verus has decent volume on DP

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Over 1 btc

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> That's good

[14-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think it is, for such a small exchange

[14-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> CMC is only relevant bc it will give the project more exposure ...

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> volume is one thing, but I really like the interface of Stex a lot more than DP or Graviex

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and that one additional digit on Graviex is ridiculous, tbh

[14-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't mind STEX but they need a better way to find/display markets
