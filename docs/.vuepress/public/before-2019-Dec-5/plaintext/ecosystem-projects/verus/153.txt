[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't know about the vulnerability in the older wallet version. Screenshot didn't say which version

[27-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Either way there's not much to do about it.

[27-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Just learn.

[27-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Yup

[27-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Milk has been spilled

[27-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> This is my wallet. I don't know why there are three transactions.

[27-Apr-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The wallet version is up to date

[27-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> How did you get the 21k?

[27-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> By the amount of immature balance I‚Äôd guess early mining and investing. ‚úåÔ∏è

[27-Apr-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> So if they have an immature balance, they are unable to move those coins right? If the wallet is compromised, then the attacker can try to move them when they mature?

[27-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yes.

[27-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> They are in other addresses, but if the whole wallet is compromised then the immature balance is as well.

[27-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @superbig Only thing he can try to do is to transfer coins as soon as possible after each of the blocks mature. Needs to be faster than the hacker. If not he might lose the rest of the coins (immature) too.

[27-Apr-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Find out how long for each to mature and plan on transfer within minutes of maturing.

[27-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If I were a hacker I would have that automated within seconds. I advice **transferring** all remaining transferable fund to a new wallet on a trusted machine

[27-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Would it be worth moving the wallet to a new machine?

[27-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or is it more than likely the attacker has the keys

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Wont make a difference if he has the wallet.dat

[27-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> That's what I figured, but thought maybe it's someone with another form of access

[27-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ssh, Remote Desktop in some form....

[27-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Either only that transparent address is compromised (he mentioned paper wallet) or the whole wallet.dat. The later would mean that the immature balance is also compromised and will be game of who is faster to transfer them when they mature.

[27-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And @Oink has a great point. If this is a hacker with halft a brain he wont spend time waiting for doing this manually, but make a script to run automatically and snag the maturing coins within seconds.

[27-Apr-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Winbloze, launch command prompt and netstat -a

[27-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know of an easy way to accomplish this, but for safety reasons (or to give folks bad ideas) I won‚Äôt elaborate here...

[27-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> There are shielding scripts, like in Oliver‚Äôs article, so there‚Äôs nothing special about it.

[27-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> lol, sry Oink. ;D

[27-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> NP. My solution is infinately easier...

[27-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Exploit the flaw in the timelock opcode and autoclaim the rest of the balance

[27-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> _zeroday things_

[27-Apr-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @Oink check dm

[27-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> @zpajk ah that reminds me those scripts need some updating!

[28-Apr-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vmail> How long has this been going on?

[28-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 8 hours give or take

[28-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JS> Way to go lol, over a year and we still can't get on a HALF decent exchange that doesn't have maintenance every other week? Really?

[28-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> No real rush to get on other exchanges @JS

[28-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Already on enough and cannot sustain them volume wise

[28-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Didn't have major issues on Stex yet.

[28-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @JS STEX is ok, but the Verus volume is still much lower on STEX than on Digitalprice - that¬¥s probably why people still prefer to use Digitalprice

[28-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, if the chosen exchange  is not doing what it should - why stay there?

[28-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Thoskk With you 100%, but I think there has to be a critical mass that starts to use STEX before it becomes popular.

[28-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm critical and I'm using it üòÑ

[28-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> jk

[28-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Stex is not a bad exchange, just the KYC for trading FIAT is annoying - but that's common on many, if not almost all

[28-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Thoskk Sure üòÉ I meant that perhaps if 1/4 of all volume was on STEX then almost everyone would start to use STEX, atm it¬¥s usually like 4-5% of the volume every time I check.

[28-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure. And everyone may choose his favourite exchange of course. On the other hand, volume is more relevant for dumpers I think, traders need patience üòâ

[28-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Spread is also a lot higher on STEX than on Digitalprice, I suspect (just guessing here) that this has something to do with the low volume on STEX also.

[28-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, I also think so.

[28-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But I¬¥m no trader, so just my amateure opinion, folks üòÑ

[28-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> each opinion counts ^^

[28-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Thank you üòÑ

[28-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Currently, there¬¥s 18% spread on STEX for Verus - that¬¥s a lot in my op.

[28-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> My reasoning is; Higher volume equals more competion between buyers & sellers, which in turn causes lower spread percentages. Basic market dynamics, I guess.

[28-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP has maintenance every other week? I haven't noticed.

[28-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I see activity on DP!

[28-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha right after I moved funds to stex which was cool of DP to let me withdraw and I'm pretty sure when I started they had a much higher limit. I was pleasantly surprised.

[dscrdvrsc] <TheBitcoins> thanks man

[28-Apr-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @TheBitcoins See my CoinGecko link for a list of Verus exchanges, most volume (I guess about 90-95%) is on Digitalprice, though.

[28-Apr-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoCarlos> May I know current marketcap and any blockexplorer?

[28-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Blockexplorer:: `https://explorer.veruscoin.io`

[28-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That will also show you the current coinsupply in the top line.

[28-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> if you wanna. I just did it as a quick thing and I figured anyone interested enough might just go check out all the useful stuff on your twitter

[28-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> what do you think? i can add em no prob

[28-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or you post it on Reddit o Medium

[28-Apr-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> mostly just a compilation of stuff in one place with a little bit of new

[28-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me read the new version and DM you the screenshots I made

[28-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dunno reddit has a new whitelist thing. i thought maybe if i did put it on medium that they might be whitelisted but its insane you have to jump through hoops to talk openly about crypto

[28-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm am now officially allowed to open my mouth....üòÇ

[28-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> actually I think I can get em off twitter

[28-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I liked the twitter shout out and felt the link less relevant if I only put the pic..

[28-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> the community effort I feel, is a big part of the draw

[28-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If it's OK with you I'll see if I can put it on Medium, link to it on Reddit and tweet about it...

[28-Apr-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Fine by me, might be better if someone else did, come to think of it

[28-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> should i do anything?? hah

[28-Apr-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> prob better if  I do post, I do it after anyway. I know how reddit can be touchy

[28-Apr-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would rather you do it, so I just have to link/like/retweet... I feel uncomfortable showing off other peoples work like this... People may easily mistake it as being of my hand.

[28-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just minimize mthe credits to me... The entire community and especially the development team should be credited

[28-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> maybe hold up a sec. i just threw this together. I know its old stuff but I also dont wanna misrepresent

[28-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dunno?

[28-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dont want credit, Id prefer if it went out like that

[28-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> ok now i feel like im cluttering the page I'll DM ya

[28-Apr-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> hello Verusians. Just to confirm: Roughly 10% of the total supply has been mined (~9mio), which places the market cap at slightly under a million bucks?
