[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> ok

[07-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I am going to bring on another IP that can handle 250-500 connections tomorrow. Hopefully that will help.

[07-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <tin1260> @oscar you stil use v0.3.9 ?

[07-Aug-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> 3.11

[07-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @oscar You should shut down the wallet before the machine sleeps or set the machine to never sleep.

[07-Aug-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> yes,I set it

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Will there be an independent wallet in the future?

[07-Aug-18 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> Why have independant when you can have a multicurrency wallet!

[07-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Can all the waiting for blocks be worth the electricity cost?

[07-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a Depends upon what your electricity costs are.   I am running about 800 watts or so worth of electricity on an annual basis for my CPU's.  I have run them for about 8 weeks.  That's about 123.00 in electricity for so far... a little over 32,000 VRSC.

[07-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> and another orphaned staking rewards block. (in and out with no mined line item). Second one in 2 days.

Anyone know why periodically my verus daemon is stuck? I'll getmininginfo after a few hours and realize I am a couple hundred blocks behind the explorer

[07-Aug-18 11:11 PM] bishop#9773
stopping it and restarting the daemon catches it back up but it seems like this is occuring almost on a daily basis a couple times a day. I pretty much expect going to bed at night and waking up will need me to restart it to get caught up

[07-Aug-18 11:12 PM] bishop#9773
Would a mirrored image have anything to do with it?

[08-Aug-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> For anyone interested - check out the auto-staking script in the repo I just linked in #staking

[08-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> hi guys, I just read Verus is about voting and since I was doing propaganda about that in KMD channel I'm happy you are working on it

[08-Aug-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> just want to add 2 more things which are to me equally important and co-related with voting which is identity - identity system, best - decentralized identity system which could buld trust similar to google page rank or so (where replace page with profiles) AND decent forum engine - engine for mass knowledge/information processing (the closest wikipedia was to that, but not exactly)

[08-Aug-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Decentralized identity system + decentralized forum (or actually massive information processing engine = MIPE) + decentralized voting = new democracy

[08-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> welcome bro

[08-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> actually it would be best if all 3 could be configurable and get from KMD the possibility to create "configurable democratic worlds" same way as KMD allows for creating chains and assets. Just here it would be createion of communities with some pre-config. Both the creators and pre-config + random events would make some communities evolve or die...

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> welcome to the club üòÉ

[08-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Wallet was doing the same thing.  I guess no blocks solved for about 13 minutes?  That seems, intuitively, to be a bit out there.

[08-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @jimboscott A few days ago there were a similar event. I think it was almost 30 minutes with both Explorer and wallet not moving.

[08-Aug-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I have seen the gaps be up to 15 minutes.

[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> How many is the total supply of versus coin?

[08-Aug-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> And when will versus be available for kmd aga a wallet?

[08-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup Verus is already available for the Agama wallet, if I am playing Wheel of Fortune well enough...

[08-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @devpro There is a trading channel.  There is also an exchange.

[08-Aug-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <terwenlee> I think Vers is a better project than Bitcoin and other currencies. The only downside is that the current wallet can't be encrypted.

[08-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> wallet encryption is incompatible with shielded addresses (zaddrs), so that is an issue for Zcash, Komodo and every Zcash-related coin

[08-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> if someone hacked your pc, no encryption will help

[08-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> I just can't find versus coin In agama

[08-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> How do I stake my coins?

[08-Aug-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup What version of the Agama wallet are you using?  You need the one found at the veruscoin.io site.

[08-Aug-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @jimboscott the big gaps have been quite frequent, hard times waiting for a transaction to process... especially just before bed üôÉ

[08-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> regarding identity in Verus whipepaper, I quickly jumped through, not sure if I can see there a place for profiles or (any) institutions doing profile verifications in a more open way. What I expect by identity is actually an identity that changes in time, and has time-based properties. Meaning: if someone from the network meet with me in person and confirms my profile photo matches my name and second name with my gov id - it will be differently weight in markin profile as true based on if that happen yesterday or 10 years ago. For example each profile check or even profile check type could have a life time, also specific properties could have a lifetime, and scale linearly to weight 0 at end of life. Also if someone confirms pgoto + name without id it will be differently weight. This way anyone can confirm anyone. Confirmation should send some points based on confirming profile rank. This way in time some institutions or profiles will come up which will charge fees for professional confirmations, and they will have big trust. HEre a penalty must be introduced - if someone cheated/mistaked. So profiles should have many properties regarding confirming profiles itself. This way everyone could be confirmed with his friends on facebook (for example) but much stronger in gov office or in some company doing such service, or even in a bank.

[08-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Quite a lot of work, part of which will be needed still after implementation and monitoring the system in the wild (to weight in penalties to recognize profile cheaters).

[08-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> so the komodo agamawallet is no good?

[08-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Great if penalties could propagate live, so when a "cheater" is detected (by kind of error-rate?) by system (network = conflicting profile marks in narrows space-time) all previous profile confirmations should be some way cancelled or weight zero? just guessing should work some way like that, but calibration may be hell üòÉ

[08-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup No - it is fine.  But if you have a non-Verus version you are not going to be able to use it for Verus.

[08-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> As I asked before, and for a good reason, which version of the Agama wallet are you using?

[08-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @samson People had the wool pulled over their eyes during the 2000 elections.  The notion that a paperless voting system that is NOT 100% verifiable (as a blockchain would be) would be superior to paper is simply wrongheaded.  With paper there IS a record.  With the current system?  Who really knows.

Was the 2000 election a false flag?  Probably not.  But the result would be the same.  A non-verifiable electronic election is subject to all kinds of deception and frankly, it is just a matter of time before such a system is captured and used to keep one party in power indefinitely.  Just like 'digital books', electronic data can be edited on the fly.  Ie., what Wikipedia said in 2015 might bear little in resemblance to the same entry in 2020.

[10-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Your hashrate/stake is low or you are just unlucky, wallet fix wont help much because everyone is getting out of sync in a similar manner so all lose mining resources proportionally

[10-Aug-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Observation: Win 10 Agama GUI v11. Only my i9 machines get out of sync. Even if I run them slower than my Ryzen 1700s and i7s. Another thing: I can't stop the i9s from mining using the STOP button. _Whether or not the i9 machines are synced_, if I click the STOP button, it will briefly show a grayed-out LOADING button state and then the button-state just goes back to STOP and the machine continues mining & staking. Even if I go to the Verus badge on the left side of the interface and click the three-dot menu and select _STOP_, nothing happens‚Äîit just continues to mine. The only way to stop it is to X out of Agama.

This is not true on any machine other than my i9s. I am beginning to wonder if there isn't a bug specific to machines with greater than 8 physical cores.

[10-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BTC-BTC-BTC> @ok88 I have 650 MH/S not that bad. I should have at least get one reward in 13 days. Out of sync happened within a day after I restarted the wallet. I never have this problem from the beginning.

[10-Aug-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> My last block was 11 days ago, the block before that was 27 days ago from now , im only running 61Mh/s across two pc‚Äôs, i started about the 1st july and found my first block after 4 days , which at the time was lucky, i was estimated to wait 18 days before i found a block, so for me the luck was good at first with such a little hash rate , but oh boy did the odds change,

[10-Aug-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I am lucky enough ,not to have had to deal with out of sync problems at-all , yet,

[10-Aug-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @BTC-BTC-BTC With your hashrate you should average a block per 7,5 days with current hashrate. Having no blocks for 13 days is not that much of a bad luck - but definitely you should find one sooner than later statistically.

[10-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BTC-BTC-BTC> @ok88 I have been keep restarting my wallet because I see an error message lower right corner or I see the 99.92 out of sync. Do you know if it's ok to keep mining with 99.92%?

[10-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @BTC-BTC-BTC: Nope. It needs to be 100% synced.

[10-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BTC-BTC-BTC> @wistar Thanks. That is why I keep restarting the wallet wait until 100% then start mining withine one day I check it again is under 100%.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Funny I jumped on this almost 3 weeks ago with a single 4770k  and within 6hrs hit a block and now none since. It might be time to let her rest now as I dont think this coin was meant for the little guys. I will check back here and there for the rumored pool and wish y'all the best.

[11-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> For those that may be interested in trying it a bit early/helping test, the website has been updated with links to a new CLI build. We'll have Agama out soon once one last bug is squashed, and will post an official release announcement then that has full details for the release. This release implements some changes that should help with node congestion and improve staking efficiency.

[11-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz pools are coming. I can‚Äôt promise an exact day, but could be tomorrow, definitely imminent.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thank you for the reply I look forward to it. Is there a miner I should download to use? Been using enemy but that's gpu.

[12-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This is a good one that is at least as fast as the wallet miner, which has been the fastest CPU miner in the world on any cryptographic hash algorithm. Right now, you'll have to build, but I will post a Linux release when we validate it on pools. You can use it to benchmark your CPU with as well, using:
nhequminer -b -v
