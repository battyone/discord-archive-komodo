[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @stretcher83  thanks for this ^^ @Cruz see? ^^

[08-Jan-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Thoskk @stretcher83   Lol. Nice

[08-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Very creative. I like it

[08-Jan-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> @GEBucky just under 50% of the network hash is controlled by 4 miners from that one pool and they represent 95% of that pools hash

[08-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 51% attack proof... they don't "control" the network hash. They might make a dent in trade price, but still no control.

[08-Jan-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Since we are talking about CPUs now instead of FPGAs, their electricity costs are likely higher giving them incentive to sell higher. This is still a much more favorable outcome and the best way to spread the hash is to get the word out there and tell everyone with a CPU to get mining and get in on the PoW revolution!

[08-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CPU mining is where it's at

[08-Jan-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> everyone community member @Godballz just published a really informative and timely article on the rise of specialized hardware, FPGAs, and the impact on the mining community.  Great work on this @Godballz!  https://link.medium.com/X19zhgljjT

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  You are the man!!!!! 
I've read half of it, and it's really good. I'll read the other half on lunch. Great job.

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OliverDay> Awesome article, bloody hell that was an awesome read!!

[08-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thank you guys and thanks John! I'm proud to be a part of such an amazing community that is taking the lead and innovating for the benefit of everyone.

[08-Jan-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Great article @Godballz üòÉ !

[08-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks @miketout! That means a lot!

[08-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Exciting time for Verus.
Exciting time for crypto.

[08-Jan-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> VerusHash 2.0 will eventually be made available to other Komodo projects, right? I know not everything should but would the algo?

[08-Jan-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Nice work @Godballz 
Awesome read!

[08-Jan-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> love the article

[08-Jan-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cragorn, @Lennart thanks, hope it wasn't too long. I wanted to break down and simplify a lot of complex things so it could be easily understood by even those not so familiar with crypto.

[08-Jan-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> yeah you did a great job there. i¬¥m not english native, but was so easy to read

[08-Jan-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Really blown away by what Verus has been able to pull off. I can't imagine other PoW coins being able to ignore this now

[08-Jan-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> sadly this kind of information seems not so valuable to the masses in these times...

[08-Jan-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> but there will be a time "soonish" i hope, when people will value true decentralization again

[08-Jan-19 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It is very impressive! I have love for a good handful of projects but honestly Verus is the most outstanding by a fairly large margin in tech and invention, development, community, and vision...with the talent and skill within the community to realize the vision. ‚ù§

[08-Jan-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> yeah and with Komodo as a great kickstart üòõ

[08-Jan-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> love to see the KOmodo - Verus symbiosis

[08-Jan-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Can someone tell me what‚Äôs the use case for veruscoin ?

[08-Jan-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Before getting too far into it, I can think of one right off the bat after yesterday's attack on ETC...a secure 51% hash attack immune place for your crypto money!

[08-Jan-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So you might say a 51% hash attack immune and private store of value.

[08-Jan-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> üòÉ

[08-Jan-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz we've got some time to go before that is likely, while we work on PBaaS. Komodo has their own timelines and priorities. At some point, I would expect jl777 and I to coordinate to get VerusHash 2.0 into Komodo because people will want it. Talking about that, or speculating on when it might be probably won't help anyone, as right now, it is in Verus. There is no specific timeframe or energy going towards doing that now, and it will be a meaningful amount of work for someone whenever that time comes.
@dude as with all cryptocurrencies, a primary use case is money, and the level of network security and resistance to various forms of attack that Verus is demonstrating right now shows why people should use very secure networks like Verus over other, maybe even larger coins based on older technologies that haven't been upgraded with solutions to their well known weaknesses. We prefer to talk about how it works today, while we work on, but don't hype or sell the future. Right now, Verus has many use cases, starting with one of the most secure cryptocurrencies for money to private / permanent / notarized messaging, to every BTC and Zcash use case with arguably much more advanced security, and as such provides a better, more secure, more private cryptocurrency than most all of the projects out there.
As far as use cases that we envision for the future, that is PBaaS, including the advance of public provisioning that it will bring, the new profit potential for stakers, miners, and service providers, as well as applications, such as identity and voting that it will first enable, which we believe will be only a couple important ones among many, geo-scalable blockchain applications.

[08-Jan-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> How will PBaaS work ? Are there any PoC ? How will it look for a dev that will use PBaaS ? Is there a API available ?

[08-Jan-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dude I recommend reading the vision paper, it's really the best place to begin.  It's a really well articulated and in-depth document.  Here it 'tis: https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf - I recommend the entire read, but you can also jump down to page 7 "autochains"

[08-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> is there a roadmap ? Or when can we exspect some milestones ?

[08-Jan-19 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No, there is not a roadmap, there is a vision paper üòÉ which discusses phases of the project

[08-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> If you're curious as to specific achievements made in the project, you can also read the blog at: https://medium.com/VerusCoin and particularly the post I did at the beginning of the year where I listed out some of the big highlights, here:

[08-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> So there is only a vision but not really a PoC or any idea how the vision could work or how it could be implemented ?

[08-Jan-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What part of the technology and vision are you specifically referring to?  I think it would make more sense if you read the very thorough and infomative visino paper, white paper for phase 1, post above and maybe dig a little in the blog to see what has, so far, been developed and implemented.

[08-Jan-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Talking about the autochains

[08-Jan-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Going to read some stuff

[08-Jan-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Cool.  Something I like about the Verus project and the developers is their commitment to actually creating things without hyping anything up in advance. As a community member and contributor to communications and messaging I find this to align with my own philosophies of actions over words and spending "talk time" talking about what has been done or is being done now.  And, at the same time, having strong vision...that when combined with the sort of consistent and strong follow through developers have demonstrated...inspires belief, support and more contributing members üòÉ

[08-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> speaking of which, who was talking about some needed changes to the site yesterday?

[08-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @John Westbrook If you have a look onto the image, resolution looks quite a bit low, and there are some kind of watermarks ... don't know if this is intentional.

[dscrdvrsc] <silverlining> ok, i got questions, if this aint the right place, redirect me.
How does this equalize CPU vs GPUS, and what prevents a person from rewiring a GPU software mine a GPU like many CPUS ?

[09-Jan-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silverlining> PS @LOUD Mining made a pool for you guys, thus im here.

[09-Jan-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A quote from John Westbrook's latest article (<https://link.medium.com/0PkgXaJ3jT>) -
"The algorithm leverages the features of modern CPUs, leaving other hardware such as GPU or FPGA, already advantaged in other ways, to do the same work using whatever optimizations developers of such software and hardware are able to achieve. For example, modern CPUs have higher clock speeds than FPGAs, highly integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, the fastest being it‚Äôs L1 Cache.
By designing VerusHash 2.0 such that it utilizes each of these advantages to run more efficiently, any device without them needs to find other ways to get those same efficiencies. Rather than explicitly attempting to block FPGAs or GPUs from functioning on the algorithm, the approach simply goes all out in leveraging efficiencies that CPUs can bring to the table, leaving FPGAs and GPUs to fend for themselves in other ways."
