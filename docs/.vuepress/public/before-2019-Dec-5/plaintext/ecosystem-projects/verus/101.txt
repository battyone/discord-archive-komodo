[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are only waiting for Cryptopia

[16-Jan-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that was the most expensive listing

[16-Jan-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 2 BTC

[16-Jan-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> covered mostly by donation by the Foundation and also by broader community donations. otherwise, the foundation and community covered Stex and DP, and the Foundation gave AACoin Verus that was used for their promotion. AACoin was otherwise free and did staking

[16-Jan-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> ohhh so we have paid cryptopia already :L

[16-Jan-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes

[16-Jan-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> thats damn awkward

[16-Jan-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was paid quite some time ago

[16-Jan-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Wonder how they will come out of this loss of funds. *Hope their insurance was up to date*

[16-Jan-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Wasn't there funds sent somewhere that turned out to be a spoofed email or something like that too?

[16-Jan-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Really, my only wishlist for Verus at this point is increased security of my staked coins. However that can be achieved. Encrypted wallet, or preferably hardware wallet, or some other solution

[16-Jan-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I'm only basing my news from it from their official post. "Security Breach" Substantial loss of funds" are 2 of the things they confirmed.

[16-Jan-19 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I was referring to Verus sending btc somewhere for a listing but it was a scam

[16-Jan-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> then verus send to the real cryptopia for listing

[16-Jan-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> so paying twice

[16-Jan-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Patrick ManBearPig  oh yeah that did happen

[16-Jan-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> I've used CryptoBridge before, and it's a pain in the ass for sure.  Once i got it working, it is what it is and it's very powerful, but volume on the platform was modestly low

[16-Jan-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> Cryptopia was a semi-active platform, so that going down the tubes is a bummer for sure.

[16-Jan-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> CMC listing would help alot, so I'm mixed

[16-Jan-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Wow, someone just dropped a 33k vrsc order on digitalprice

[16-Jan-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig there was a scammer that offerred 0.1 BTC for listing on Stex, which the Verus Coin Foundation, a contributing organization, but also part of the Verus community, paid and was scammed. Then, Stex came back and said they would want to list Verus, but the fee would be 1 BTC, which was partially raised by individuals the community and the rest paid by the Foundation.

[16-Jan-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That was a lesson learned, but not a big hit for the Foundation and not the community.

[16-Jan-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Sounds like it must have been an inside job by an employee

[16-Jan-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> employee of who? are you referring to the Cryptopia hack now?

[16-Jan-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Stex employee

[16-Jan-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think so

[16-Jan-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Seems far too coincidental

[16-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i got the mail from the scammer, and it was through an SMTP relay, which I didn't verify

[16-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> A scammer and the exchange both happen to contact you?

[16-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Stex didn't contact me, they responded to my reply, just not in time

[16-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> telling me that they had not had any prior contact with us

[16-Jan-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> ah ok

[16-Jan-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and that was their actual listing fee as posted

[16-Jan-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I will list vrsc on my exchange for a low fee of 33,000 vrsc

[16-Jan-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i assume you're joking and aren't like cz_binance incognito ðŸ˜‚

[16-Jan-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, I don't have an exchange but if you send me that many coins I will make sure I throw one together

[16-Jan-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> sounds good. i'm sure the community will like the idea too

[16-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It will have a strict KYC requirement which unfortunately prohibits every country, and a withdrawal fee of 1btc while I stake all the coins

[16-Jan-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ðŸ˜‚ ok, so you'll be self-sustainable from such high fees, so you'll be stable. i get it

[16-Jan-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and with the kyc, you can take z-txes from nowhere. sounds brilliant

[16-Jan-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Think of it as a good way to test the security of staking on a VPS

[16-Jan-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Oh and don't be surprised if I get "hacked" just before tax time

[16-Jan-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, i guess the KYC applies only to withdrawals?

[16-Jan-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> of course

[16-Jan-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> makes sense

[16-Jan-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I actually made the mistake of depositing to an exchange or two which require kyc for withdrawals

[16-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Thankfully it was only like $10 worth of eth but I will still pissed

[16-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> really?

[16-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Granted, they don't tell you until you try to withdraw

[16-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it seems if you're going to do that, it really needs to be for deposit as well

[16-Jan-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But then how could you steal people's funds so easily?

[16-Jan-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just seems it shouldn't be legal that way, because yeah

[16-Jan-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are many many many bullshit exchanges out there.

[16-Jan-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I made the deposit to do some quick arbitrage, then the order book wouldn't even work. Kept trying to place buy orders and it wouldn't fill. Then tried to withdraw the eth and it hit me with the kyc requirement

[16-Jan-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there are, and some that are just good and trying to make it work. Cryptopia's event isn't going to make things easier

[16-Jan-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm glad DP turned out to be a solid, small exchange

[16-Jan-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So far I have had good experience with them

[16-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and AACoin with staking is great. i just wish they had a way to earn more trust in the market

[16-Jan-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> very hard to trust an unknown CEX

[16-Jan-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and very hard to earn trust as one

[16-Jan-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They could hire me to proofread their siteðŸ˜Ž

[16-Jan-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ðŸ˜„ you should ask them

[16-Jan-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I feel like something has to pop with vrsc trading soon. The order books are the fullest I have seen but with the lowest volume of trades

[16-Jan-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I have nothing against AACoin, but with yet another Exchange having been  hacked(Cryptopia) I still wouldn't recommend anyone leaving funds on a Exchange after filling buy/ask orders.

[16-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> AAcoin withdrawals take far too long

[16-Jan-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I am concluding my informal experiment with staking on there and putting everything back in my vps. As scary as that is too

[16-Jan-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @zpajk problem is that making lots of withdrawals can rack up some big fees.

[16-Jan-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> vrsc withdrawal fee is .01. Someday that might be a significant amount but right now it is not

[16-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @Gloryman In the eyes of the beholder. Risk vs reward.

[16-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> hmmmm why should i trust this?

[16-Jan-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig  You said you feel like something needs to pop and we need volume, but getting on another exchange is a waste of money. There's a reason that most projects are on major exchanges--exposure. This community can only buy so much Verus. And we can only grow, so fast, if the community does not know who we are.

[16-Jan-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> @Cruz  I'm pretty sure Kucoin was trying to force certain coins to up their volume by any "means" necesarry in the downtrend. They delisted rdn which shortly after launched mainnet and ran for +50%. So I believe places like Kucoin could be a double edge sword.

[16-Jan-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @yaheardme What do you think would be a better option?

[16-Jan-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> @Cruz  Not fully sure in these market conditions, but I don't think there is anything wrong with moving slow in regards to listing on bigger exchanges. I do think places like bittrex is far more reputable than say kucoin.

[16-Jan-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  IDEX listing is free

[16-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Are those all cmc?

[16-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah

[16-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well the free one wouldn't hurt would it?

[16-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CryptoBridge is a Dex..
So is IDEX..
It's well known too

[16-Jan-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Their volume was very high from like June-August last year. They are known for listing projects right out of ICO

[16-Jan-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Free is good

[16-Jan-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I think the purpose of being on CMC is about the same as, announcing projects on Bitcointalk, it's a standard within the community.

[16-Jan-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Outdated, yes. But that's what everyone goes by.

[16-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah so if idex is free and they can get us on cmc, what's the harm in trying to get on there? If cmc is the main goal. Unless it's more the combination of getting on cmc along with having the additional exposure and user base of their community.

[16-Jan-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> Any thoughts on blockfolio signal? It could help with a little bit of exposure, I know personally a handful of friends who use the app.

[16-Jan-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> i believe IDEX is only for erc-20 tokens

[16-Jan-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @yaheardme would you feel like reaching out to them by chance? I could look for a contact when I get home later if not

[16-Jan-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I have been thinking about it a lot lately and where so many projects do have big ad campaigns and where we are currently a somewhat smaller community coin, it's only up to us to do as much as we can for the project because anything you or I do is beneficial to each and every one of us and in that same way, anything that the community does to better itself benefits you and me just the same. We each hold coins and we understand how much more technologically advanced Verus is compared to so many of the larger flawed coins. Any effort that goes in adds value and that is good for us all

[16-Jan-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No pressure haha but where I dont have certain social media apps and others may, together we can be a mighty force of an ad campaign

[16-Jan-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> I am looking at the app currently and under VRSC it says "token team" can contact them. When I click on that it asks for who will be allowed to post on behalf of the team ect ect.

[16-Jan-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I ran into that as well

[16-Jan-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Mike said that because it's a community project that there is no official "team" and that if its beneficial the the community that one of us could act in that capacity for that purpose. I'm sure if you run into a spot where you get stuck someone will help

[16-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ph03nix you're right

[16-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I don't think IDEX can do anything that isn't an erc20 token though?

[16-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig you're right

[16-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I just feel like we went over all of this several months ago

[16-Jan-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Oh I just saw someone said that

[16-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you wanna try getting as far as you can maybe someone who knows more could take over. I can try too later

[16-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "You said you feel like something needs to pop and we need volume"

That's not really what I wrote though, @Cruz
