[30-Jul-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> A process that _cannot happen any faster than the span of two years_ is a mighty slow "dumping."

[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> Any plans for Ledger Nano support?

[30-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> No near term focus on that right now. I believe PBaaS support is our highest next priority.

[30-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôm hitting about 15mh/s now.

i7 4770

Is that normal?

[30-Jul-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> Yeah fair enough too, didn't think much was required to get added  @miketout. By the way, I clicked "Copy public key" from GUI to mine to in CLI and I added the key at the end with the correct syntax. But I didn't click "validate" first and it seems it's just copied the public address that's visible on the GUI front end. What has happened to all the blocks I've found?

[30-Jul-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a this is the best comparison i could find for you so far

[30-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Check out the #cpu-hashrate section you should get a rough idea if your cpu is running slow or normal

[30-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Personally i still think that 15mh is too slow

[30-Jul-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> How many threads you got it on @ChrisC30a

[30-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Andstar I want to know how you are able to put those five words together... 'all the blocks I've found'.   I am hashing with 1.7 Gh/s and have not found anything in about 30 hours.

[30-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Or were you just sort of assuming you had been finding blocks while using the wrong pubkey?

[30-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Welcome @Faisal

[30-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> #cpu-hashrate is only for inputting your cpu specs and your hash rate for verus, looking forward to seeing what you have got

[30-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That does seem a little low.  I‚Äôve tried 1,2 and 4 threads all with same result

[30-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Can you bring up a cpu monitor on your desktop so you can get a rough idea whats getting used by the cpu

[30-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im on windows 10 and the task manager does an ok job displaying the cpu usage, i know windows 7 task manager is not as good

[30-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You can also check the processes thats using the cpu,

[30-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There was a instance on here the other day when i got told certain programs can slow your verus mining down

[30-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> For an example , if i use minergate for mining ethereum only on gpu, it actually uses like 70% of my cpu aswell, even though i didnt start the cpu mining, because of that my verus mining would slow down alot

[30-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> On the other hand im mining ethereum on nice hash, gpu only and it dosnt touch my cpu- only about 3% cpu usage , so im ok mining verus on my cpu without nice hash slowing it down

[30-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Maybe you have got a program your using thats doing a similar thing

Is there a resource that has the current time locked coins listed? Obviously maturities will vary but just curious how much of the 27M is unavailable

[31-Jul-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> from the #faq-chosen in verus discord.
Rewards >=192 are time locked.  so about 26 million time locked.  And no you can't see them because only the miner knows the transaction data.
```
Block Reward
1 week smooth linear ramp from 0 to 384, then halving every month (43,200 blocks)
1st week:  Block 1 -> 10080 = 1,935,360 VRSC
1st month: Block 10080 -> 53280 = 384 VRSC = 16,588,800 VRSC
2nd month: Block 53280 -> 96480 = 192 VRSC = 8,294,400 VRSC
3rd month: Block 96480 -> 139680 = 96 VRSC = 4,147,200 VRSC
4th month: Block 139680 -> 182880 = 48 VRSC = 2,073,600 VRSC
5th month: Block 182880 -> 226080 = 24 VRSC = 1,036,800 VRSC
Block 226080 onward for another 2 years = 24 VRSC
```

[31-Jul-18 01:09 AM] bishop#9773
I'm not in the verus discord, I only have a shared channel in komodo here

[31-Jul-18 01:10 AM] bishop#9773
But some have to be available because of the linear ramp

[31-Jul-18 01:10 AM] bishop#9773
in the beginning

[31-Jul-18 01:11 AM] bishop#9773
blocks 1 through 5039ish?

[31-Jul-18 01:11 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah about 700k probably stakeable atm (yep i realised the channel), so i joined you in komodo glory üòÉ

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] bishop#9773
Ok good, I come up with about 742k

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] bishop#9773
good to see the math isn't that far off

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] bishop#9773
given current block height

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] bishop#9773
and absent all random time locks that have yet to free up

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Mylo#8306
it was ~480k when 96 block reward started.

[31-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Mylo#8306
2 days ago

[31-Jul-18 01:13 AM] bishop#9773

@CHMEX Should add VRSC to dexstats. Curious what the richlist looks like

[31-Jul-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Duke might do a PR on Verus for getsnapshot and than it's easy to create a richtlist. Insight Explorer is working so addressindex works fine on verus

[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> Is there a reasonable reason that a mac downloads the blockchain 5x faster?  I installed 0.3.11 on both machines at the same time, and got them both started within about 30 miinutes of each other.  The mac had the blockchain in 3 hours, the Win10 machine took 16+

[31-Jul-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> and now on my Win10 laptop it's been going for 3.5 hours and is at 16%

[31-Jul-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Cam - [triforce] Windows is historically slow on the networking side in Komodo, and I guess Zcash and possibly Bitcoin. I haven't looked deeply into it, but the original Agama even has a workaround to limit the number of connections just on Windows when synching, which speeds up networking as well.

[31-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> I would recommend ubuntu , I was using windows before. It is pretty user friendly.

[31-Jul-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> @jimboscott your screenshot shows you have found 2 blocks is that not correct?

[31-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kezz> anyone familiar with komodo that can explain to me how holding in the agama wallet generates 5% interest?

[31-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> The main question is, what happens when you mine to your address and not public key?

[31-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> On Komodo, it's actually just a rule of the Komodo blockchain that all nodes can calculate and add the same way when making a transaction. the wallet does not need to be running, as it is not staking in the sense that it does not validate blocks. it is a function of the UTXO age and size.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im not promoting verus because i want the bounty but i am spreading the word about verus to anyone i can , big problem is all the other coins or tokens or projects that are going round spamming people with adverts, its becoming a problem where you carnt even mention another coin incase you get banned or put in to a special group where you carnt interact with other members of that discord or discussion, i thought all crypto enthusiasts would be welcome in any crypto group, even if they mine something other than there coin
