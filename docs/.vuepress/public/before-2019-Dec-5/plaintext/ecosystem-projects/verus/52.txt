[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Actually, something odd  @miketout when you have time you may have some insight or at least be interested

[03-Nov-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It seems there are 24 vrsc in my zs address that I cant account for and cant move as I normally would

[03-Nov-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I will PM

[03-Nov-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Cool seems it was spendable after all. Restarted my wallet and tried sending again and it went through without issue

[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> Ouch, we are back to #2 on  Txbit.io voting. Over 19K votes for each of us and Atlant has us by under  100 votes. Go, go, go to https://txbit.io/Coin#voting-head and vote Verus! ‚úå ‚úå ‚úå

[04-Nov-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Slipped a little from #1 down to #2 on https://txbit.io/Coin . Please, let us keep the pressure on that got us there to begin with. We know the steps it took to get here but for many it's the first time hearing about us. Let's open some eyes, vote, and dont forget to comment.  Dont forget, there are many new projects out there daily and our duty as a community in these still early days is to be the harbingers of new tech to those uninformed and to pave the path that others will soon follow. https://txbit.io/Coin . Vote, comment, change the world, bring on the future!  We are not a #2 project, we know it, let's show the rest of the world what a strong, unified community can accomplish!

[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> For staking through Agama wallet, does it matter if it's in Native mode or SPV/LITE?

[04-Nov-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> i think you can only stake with a native node

[04-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @ethacetin Native mode for staking

[04-Nov-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Thanks, just wanted to make sure I was doing it right. I've never staked anything before (only mined). 
I looked through the #staking section here and I see the reason why I haven't earned any rewards yet is because I haven't been staking enough for long enough. 
But thank you both for assuring me that native is the right way.

[04-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> If you all are so kind to answer some more n00b questions though, I made an SPV wallet first, and have my seed phrase written down, but never did anything more with that. 
Then I went into native mode, because I wanted to mine (and this is where transferred all the VRSC I bought, because I wanted to stake it). 
Are these the same wallets? 
For example, if I installed Agama on a different computer (or something happened where this computer died), could I restore the balance iny native mode wallet with that seed phrase?
Or do I have to make sure my .dat file I stored somewhere else to recover the balance in Native mode?

[04-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> I think I answered my own question again, derp. I just signed into SPV with seed phrase, and it shows a different public address and 0 balance. 
So clearly they are different wallets. 
Just to double-check, to safeguardy VRSC balance in Native Mode wallet, I just need a copy of the .dat file backed up elsewhere, right?

[04-Nov-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yep

[04-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> %appdata%/komodo/VRSC folder you will find your wallet.dat file you need to keep a backup üëçüèº

[04-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You can import your seed phrase to your native wallet and send your balance to the SPV address, which would then be in both

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Okay so that's a little dated, pre-sapling

[05-Nov-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So all that and then some

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey everyone, how do I back up my agama/vrsc wallet.dat file on mac? The 1st time I opened it, I got an error msg saying there was no program available to open the file with, so I chose text edit, and now when I double click on the wallet.dat file, a window with a bunch of gibberish pops up. Anyway, is the file still valid? And how do I back it up? Thanks.

[05-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not really familiar with Mac but it sounds like you Associated that file type with a text program

[05-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You probably want to clear that Association the wallet.dat is just something that you want to save and it is used by the agama wallet
