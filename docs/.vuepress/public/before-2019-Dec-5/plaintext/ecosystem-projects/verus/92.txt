[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig the fork shouldn't affect staking

[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> I'm going to enjoy this fork.....payback

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So - what are the anticipated changes in hash rates relating to GPU versus CPU mining?

[28-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> anyone?

[dscrdvrsc] <shitcoin_shaman> Hi everyone .
Can anyone tell me if I need to update anything before this snapshot tomorrow?

I have some vrsc in the Agama wallet for Android .

Complete noob here, sorry if I sound stupid .

[28-Dec-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shitcoin_shaman> @John Westbrook ? Please anyone?

I'm not on windows or Mac ,I'm on Android mobile Agama wallet .
I don't want to lose my VRSC after this fork , will I need to update the wallet ?
There's no update available on Google play yet .

Can anyone tell me what I need to do,  please?

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @shitcoin_shaman You will not lose your balance of vrsc, as the main fork will continue on. If you're staking(POS) your balance you'll need to update your wallet(0.5). If you mining(POW) you'll need to have the latest miner or wallet supporting verushash 2.0, depending if you're mining solo(wallet 0.5) or pool(nheqminer).

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shitcoin_shaman> Thank you for replying @zpajk 

I'm just staking in the Android version of the Agama wallet.
So I guess I'll just wait for that update to hit the Google app store and update it then?

I was worried I'd lose my funds if I didn't update before tonight.

Phew , panic over.

[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> so, im curious as to how the difficulty will scale down? as the difficulty is so hogh now, when the fpgas are not on the network, will the difficulty be manually adjusted? or will it have to wind down as the blocks are slowly found? ü§î

[29-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùî™ùî¨ùî≤ùî´ùî±ùîûùî¶ùî´ùî°ùîØùî¶ùî£ùî±ùî¢ùîØ> What are you talking about? Still looks like  20Th of  the networks 27TH is still going strong. Many are still here. http://vrsc.52hash.com/stats The thing I am noticing is a lot of F*** FPGA sentiment. I am under the impression that Verus isn't necessarily against FPGA's, in fact they seem to  be support by the VRSC community. It is just that it turns out FPGA's had a unfair advantage in VH1, and VH2 is aimed to even the playing field,  not necessarily get rid of them like some coins have tried with ASICS. I may be missing the point here, but what draws me to this coin is the concept of trying to include all types of miners on as even of a playing field as possible

[29-Dec-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> @ùî™ùî¨ùî≤ùî´ùî±ùîûùî¶ùî´ùî°ùîØùî¶ùî£ùî±ùî¢ùîØ  The VRSC team is doing the right thing. I would add they are doing more than I would do if I was in their situation. Working with the FPGA developers to try to get them to slow down their devices is a losing battle and shouldn't even be offered. Especially considering the secret mining they did; that act could be considered an act of aggression against their project and shouldn't be rewarded with cooperation. IMHO

[29-Dec-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> So to the FPGAs... here is my response to that secret mining... karma is a biatch
