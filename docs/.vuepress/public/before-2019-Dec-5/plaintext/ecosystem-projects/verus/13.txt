[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> staking is actually SUPER EASY for those with unlocked coins.  It will never be easier.

[04-Jul-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> when rewards cut to 96 staking will happen on those coins..  And it will be more accessable to all

[04-Jul-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> As time goes on, staking difficulty rises with more and more unlocked coins.

[04-Jul-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Never thought about only staking. Many lower powered machines that only stake.

[04-Jul-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you have a one core CPU that runs slow as molasses - you can stake.

[04-Jul-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I mined 32,000 TZC last Fall.  Have been staking them since - 42,000 now.

[04-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So I have one pair of shared addresses imported on every machine. Any idea how that will work? Should I try to convert everything to separate addresses?

[04-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Staked rewards are a constant - just like mined rewards.   When just a few people have staked coins they share 50% of the daily minting of coins.

[04-Jul-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Before you get rewards, I would delete the wallet.dat files and let Agama create separate and unique ones for your installs.   That's just me.

[04-Jul-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> This was possible by importing the private addresses before the initial sync finished.

[04-Jul-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I tried deleting the wallet.dat. I do not remember if that worked. I will do it though on your recommend.

[04-Jul-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> especially since I imported them using the multiple feature.

[04-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Oh... you can import priv keys all day long.  But there is a store of 'empty' addresses that the wallet creates and if you duplicate the wallet then you will have non-unique addresses.  That could lead to some confusion when you run out of them from what i read here.

[04-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You imported with the multiple import?

[04-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Do NOT do that.  If you had transactions on those addresses they will not really import.

[04-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You only lock those out and cannot use them again.

[04-Jul-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Some of the wallets have an additional address.

[04-Jul-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I will have to transfer my rewards to you and then get them back.ðŸ˜€

[04-Jul-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would only import actual priv keys from rewards transactions and.... PLEASE just do them one at a time.  TRUST ME!

[04-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you try to import a reward transaction and it fails to produce the transaction then you will need to go back to a backup of the wallet before you tried the multiple import.

[04-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So far as I know I have no rewards yet. I have to check everything and delete the dat files, right? Thats it.

[04-Jul-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would do that.  no rewards - nothing to lose.  Then each box has its own set of keys.  But you can move the blocks by hand until a better way is implemented.

[04-Jul-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Do I need a private address?

[04-Jul-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I am not an expert on this, but have been messing with this for about 3 weeks and have had some experience with it.

[04-Jul-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Private Z address

[04-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Agama will create all addresses automatically.  Each reward will have its OWN address that is assigned when rewarded.

[04-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> But the reward address is tied to the wallet address.

[04-Jul-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You will need to download the Z Cash proving keys or something like that.

[04-Jul-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The reward addresses are all different.  there is a way with the CLI wallet to set it to a single address, but this is not like mining RVN or ETH or MDEX or whatever.  It is a bit different.

[04-Jul-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The wallet will tell you that the Z cash keys have to be downloaded.  Takes a few minutes.

[04-Jul-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And, to further complicate things, when you look at the block explorer... you will see a DIFFERENT address to where the rewards were sent...  it is strange.

[04-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> SAME transaction....

[04-Jul-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So the addresses are in the wallet.dat. Deleteing that will clear them out so I can get new ones.

[04-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Yes. All of your keys are in the wallet.dat.  If there are no rewards then you are losing nothing.  The wallet.dat is the only file that has the value in it... when you have coins.

[04-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All keys are in it - private and public

[04-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The math is amazing.  For IOTA, I think there are more private keys than there are atoms in the known Universe...

[04-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> WAY more in fact.

[04-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The Z cash proving keys must be somewhere else. I did not have to download them again.

[04-Jul-18 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Maybe in your Komodo folder?

[04-Jul-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> deleted the file and the previous addresses were gone and got a new single address assigned.

[04-Jul-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I just need the one address in the receive area, right?

[04-Jul-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> No.  That address might or might not be used.  The addresses are assigned automatically from a pool that your Agama wallet created when you made a new wallet.  If you create a 'receive' address that is needed when you want me to send you coins, but this is NOT going to be your mining address.

[04-Jul-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You CAN make it that way with the CLI wallet, but the GUI version creates addresses on the fly and they are all unique.

[04-Jul-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just let the wallet do its thing.  The only thing to remember is this - when you import a Private Key - ONE at a time.  If you have multiple ones to import, import them as singles but on the LAST one set the switch for a wallet rescan so they all show up.

[04-Jul-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Ahh . Now I get it.

[04-Jul-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All of these are different and I did not choose any of them...

[04-Jul-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I have been importing the receiving addresses to to all the machines.

[04-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That actually could cause a problem.

[04-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless you did them one at a time..

[04-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So the mining address in not visible int he GUI.

[04-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The mining address is what it is when you get a reward.  You do not know what it is going to be.

[04-Jul-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And you cannot choose it.

[04-Jul-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Ok . So far no rewards and I am deleting al the wallet.dat files. This is causing a new file to be generated.

[04-Jul-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Here is what I think happens when you try a 'import multiple priv keys' with the GUI wallet.  The wallet sees the keys and registers then as imported, but the transaction is not incorporated into the wallet FULLY and it does not show up.  However, the wallet THINKS that priv key has been imported so when you try to import it again as a SINGLE priv key... it just sort of says (I think) "Hey... we already did this - go away" and you cannot get that transaction into your wallet.

[04-Jul-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You will get new wallet.dat files when you run the wallet again.   Double check to make sure but I am certain this happens.

[04-Jul-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Once you get a reward... never delete again.  You can move, archive, rename... but never delete again unless there is a clear and expert reason to do so.

[04-Jul-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Thanks!

[04-Jul-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Again... I am not an expert.  I am an old fart a few years from retirement who has a hobby that might help him through the golden years of life.

[04-Jul-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If by golden, you understand that to mean aches, pains and the like... ðŸ˜‰

[04-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Confirmed running the wallet again generates a new file.

[04-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> As it should.   Now, get to mining...

[04-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> oh mygod

[04-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> My best one is 84874 - 59 days.  My worst...  1,040,233 - about 2 years.

[04-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But, keep this in mind.  That guy who bought the papa John's Pizza with 10,000 BitCoins in 2011 - Do you think he wishes now that those BTC would have been LOCKED?

[04-Jul-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> need I open the wallet so many days?

[04-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The process does not depend upon the wallet being open.  The transaction is programmed to mature on the blockchain.  You could shut the wallet down for 5 years and come back in 2023 and the coins will be yours and available.

[04-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> ok

[04-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> wow,seems the bestthing is mining from now

[04-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But, when you DO have coins unlocked, you will want to keep the wallet open so you can STAKE them.  You will get rewards from staking them too.

[04-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That is another topic and one that I need to learn more about komodo and the Agama wallet before feeling anywhere close to confident with it.

[04-Jul-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Good night people.  Good luck with you and your mining.

[04-Jul-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> thank you

[04-Jul-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> will it make a pool?

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> if some new guys john now ,they didn;t have a coin

[04-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> fyi to solve my current problem, I reinstalled windows and kept my personal files in place. Then the wallet and everything started working. Its crazy though that a power loos while mining with Agama wallet caused a windows corruption. Perhaps coincidence , but I've been building computers for 20+ years adnd thisis the first time such a corruption happened.

[04-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> @Gmoney I have the same problem with you

[04-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> but if you change a pc can solove this problem

[04-Jul-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> you can copy komodo folder to another pc

[04-Jul-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Jul-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> It's not for everybody, but I turn the directory containing wallet.dat into a git repo, and occasionally do a `git commit` of wallet.dat. This allows you to "roll back" to a previous version of wallet.dat, if it gets corrupted or whatever, pretty easily. I have used this also when I accidentally mined my own fork of VRSC and I thought it messed up my wallet. You can backup this directory/git repo like any other files
