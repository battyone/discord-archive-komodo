[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks oink

[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Actually try Teamviewer "for Personal use"... Set up quick access by making an account and then install on every rig you want to monitor. It will send confirmation e-mail to you and then you can monitor from anywhere. It also has task monitor features as well. Works for me!

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks üòÉ

[29-Mar-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> @SmeLLyArMpiTs No problem!! I had to go up north a few days and I was able to check in on my rigs real time even adjusted an overclock on Afterburner. Best thing tho is it is free! üí™

[29-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> ssh is also free

[29-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> And with it you can control multiple systems at the same time... if you've got more than a couple, using teamviewer to remote into each becomes tedious

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks. I was actually hoping for a dashboard style solution for the cpu usage / temps etc. So far no luck üò¶

[dscrdvrsc] <Dzimmy> Is it possible to claim KMD interest from Agama 0.5.6? Whenever, I input my wif and open the KMD wallet in lite mode, the button appears but nothing happens when I click it??

[dscrdvrsc] <thedawson13> Hey guys I stumbled upon this project due to a low key shill on Twitter. I'm wondering how veruspay works exactly when veruscoin has such low liquidity? Or is veruspay just a gateway by which you can use other currencies? I'm confused

[29-Mar-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @thedawson13 Veruspay is a brand new plug-in, which is developing continuously. Veruspay currently supports Veruscoin and Pirates payments, but the development continues. The plug-in connects to the coins chain using it‚Äôs own wallets and is therefore independent, just like any full wallet on the coins network.
The liquidity you are referring to is due to the fact that this project was launched without an Initial Coin Offering or pre-mining.
I hope this answers your questions, but if you want to know more, don‚Äôt hesitate.

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> the black areas are raised portions of the coin

[30-Mar-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> are you sure about the Latin? ^^

[30-Mar-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> personally I like the design.

[30-Mar-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> The Latin is based off the verus website

[30-Mar-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Also,  googling it produces the same result

[30-Mar-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok ... never seen that...

[30-Mar-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @draeth, very cool designs. I wonder if the motto "virtue cannot be bought" is a little...sentimental? Or wd that be moralizing? Either way, something more objective wd be more of my direction. Like "truth Can't be bought." A little more on topic also, since verus means truth...but either way- great work! üòÄ

[30-Mar-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Oh, if it's from the website, then of course it's perfect! Lol...it comes from the project creators, so no real argument there...

[30-Mar-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if I may jump in: verus means "true", not "truth"

[30-Mar-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and I'm missing the "non" in the Latin

[30-Mar-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, truth is still closely related enough to true to make it relevant, imo

[30-Mar-19 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Now that you mention it, I think veritas means truth

[30-Mar-19 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> üëç

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> As long as we use "Verus." üòÅ

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> True

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I mean..... verus

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> LOL

[30-Mar-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> still ... i can't wrap my head around "potest esse emit"

[30-Mar-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Why's that

[30-Mar-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> because, if it's not a special term, I can't find sense in it üòâ

[30-Mar-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout what do you think of the design?

[30-Mar-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Ah

[30-Mar-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well, it's the slogan used by the creators of verus

[30-Mar-19 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> It's in the white paper

[30-Mar-19 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> my Latin is quite a while back though

[30-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> üòè

[30-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol same here

[30-Mar-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, need to do some research, however, I would rather translate it "true virtue can be bought" ... roughly

[30-Mar-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> in any case I can't see a "not" in there üòâ

[30-Mar-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and "bought" might not even catch it

[30-Mar-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I like it. The current slogan is "truth and privacy for all". what do you think about putting that on the back?

[30-Mar-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> like truth and privacy on the top and for all on the bottom, or something

[30-Mar-19 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout the funny thing is, I had that originally, but changed it to what it looks like  now

[30-Mar-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Sorry, not to take us off topic, but if we dont start getting some more liquidity soon, is there a chance us early adopters cld inadvertently be grandfathered into an effective oligarchy that cld harm the coin's prospect of widespread adoption down the line? We're still scheduled to be getting 24 verus rewards per block for another 1.5 years, roughly, right?

[30-Mar-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa not sure of the question. the block rewards are that, but we are making good progress on PBaaS, so additional rewards will be possible soon, both of other chains and notarization rewards to secure PBaaS chains

[30-Mar-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The question is: if more ppl aren't introduced to the community sooner than later, a smaller number of early adopters might end up with a disproportionately large share of total circulating verus. I referenced 24 verus to say in the long run, that actually will seem like a large number, say in 10 yrs, with pbaas up and running, adoption picking up, etc...is the question valid in your opinion, @miketout miketout?

[30-Mar-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I'm effectively saying- much as I'd like to hoard as much verus early on, and continue to accumulate in these early days, a more objective side of me sees the harm in not getting more ppl involved in ownership/furthering distribution...

[30-Mar-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa two things... first, PBaaS is actually going to drive redistribution, as it will be used for creating other chains and cause existing Verus to get recycled to miners and stakers through use of PBaaS. that will hopefully make 24 coins a smaller and smaller part of why people mine through a sustainable economy. second, i need to run to eat dinner, but I can come back to discuss more a bit later.

[dscrdvrsc] <CoreyM - www.vidulum.app> hey is there a mod online I can spead to üòÉ

[30-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @miketout could you give a quick response on why you feel so strongly about pbaas? I am curious what in your mind differentiates it from something like Ardor?

[30-Mar-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Interesting question. They're really not the same thing. though there could be some overlap in larger projects. In fact, each of the PBaaS chains are not exactly children, and are actually started with transactions that make offers to the entire Verus community of miners and Verus owners to participate in, mine, and support their projects and applications through a scalable, decentralized cross-chain protocol. This will enable even transiently created and abandoned blockchains to operate on behalf of applications, or long term projects to start up with easy configuration and a scalable future, without requiring any immediate development or alternate infrastructure provisioning on the part of the person, organization, or application creating the blockchain for its use. PBaaS chains could even be fairly launched, expected to stay coupled to Verus or another Verus chain as part of a project or application, or even launched and separated at a later date. They can also have pre-mines, funding/conversion periods, and will be able to earn their own native rewards, Verus, or a combination of the two. All chains will be automatically merge-mineable, have support for 51% hash attack protection, cross chain transactions, and all basic features of Verus, as well as the ability to develop smart transactions to support applications.

[30-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Also, I should mention. The PBaaS upgrade will include a unique (to my knowledge) PoS proof in the header itself that enables a header to be much more trusted than on other PoS enabled chains, and is part of what makes the automated cross-chain system more secure as well. As far as I know, there is not another PoS system with such a header proof of the stake that won the block.

[30-Mar-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Is there any impact to staking with merge mining? Or is it strictly mining related

[30-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> merge mining of other chains can earn rewards from the other chains. staking on other chains can earn rewards on the other chains. mining and staking on either the other chains or Verus can earn cross chain notarization rewards.

[30-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and of course, some chains will have systems that enable transactions intended to capture value or information and exchange value

[30-Mar-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also expect some PBaaS chains to provide opportunity to participate in the chain by using Verus, which would enable Verus holders to earn by staking.

[dscrdvrsc] <apjh> Hi dear community and developers. I have one suggestion with the tipbot and staking.

I am also a member of another community where I see they run a similar tipbot that we have here. I also just see that the tipbot they use has a staking feature that I would like to have we had the opportunity here too.

I have now mined verus the last 3 months and have mined about 150 coins at that period, which I am very happy with as I only mine on a single pc that mostly only mining for 10 hours a day.

I have staked my coins ever since the start but have not yet received any staking reward, this may be because the pc must have a restart once in a while and i have so few coins still.

Such a function in the tipbot could result in smaller miners such myself being able to place coins in a staking pool to get faster reward.

I thought this might have been a good idea for this community as well?
sorry if i post this in wrong channel, i was trying to find a suitable place to post this.

HI guys, what algorithm is Versus I would like to get my hands on some, and wondered if it might be profitable to mine with GPU ?

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> VerusHash 2.0. Its their own algo designed to better balance hashrate across hardware types. CPUs tend to do the best and now FPGAs are doing well too. GPUs appear to be less efficient at the algo at this time but some are running both CPU and GPU together to get a decent hash

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Plus you can check out the CPU hashrate and GPU hashrate channel to get an idea of what other people are getting

[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @miketout Regarding the ability for any Verus autochain to develop smart contracts, will we be able to interact with them using z addresses? I could see huge benefits in providing anonymity with a smart contract, especially for businesses that may not want to reveal their finances.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dakgnosis smart transactions can interact with z-transactions, but it's a matter of being able to spend from and to smart transactions from z-transactions, which can be done.

[31-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for example, the stake guard smart transaction allows anyone who can prove double staking to spend the output to a z-address already. the proof of double staking is there, but no-one can see where the spend went

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @apjh - I will ping the bot dev about this.

[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> im getting a popup that i need to shield VRSC before sending. when i go to my receiving addresses i see a "zc..." address and a "zs..." address. 
does it matter which one i use to shield?

[31-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> zs (sapling) should be less resource consuming (faster) if I've understood correctly.
But both work for the purpose of shielding.

[31-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> ok thanks

[31-Mar-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> i was looking for a pinned message about shilelding but couldnt find one

[31-Mar-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> gui or cli? Or wait, you mentioned popup, I guess gui.
