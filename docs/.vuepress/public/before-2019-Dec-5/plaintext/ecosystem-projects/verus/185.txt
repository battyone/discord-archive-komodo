[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @IP Personally, I¬¥m waiting for CMC and mainnet PBaaS üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> DigitalPrice is supposed to be a CMC exchange soon is the rumour (where VerusCoin has it¬¥s greatest trade volume), and mainnet PBaaS is scheduled for July the last I heard.

[26-Jun-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I imagine with the Agama developments the Komodo Hack brought with it, Mike not being able to fully focus on PBaaS. Furthermore Mike never mentioned a scheduled release date, just a rough estimate. It'll be released when fully tested and approved worthy of release...

[26-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> What's disgusting is that garbage exchanges like BiteBTC which outright steal people's money are listed on CMC and other aggregators while DP which has been pretty decent for over a year are not

[26-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Patrick Crypto Read some recent experiences Pirate users have with DP. Check their discord for details...

[26-Jun-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It doesn't seem like those issues are unique to DP though

[26-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The problems aren't. They way it's dealt with is.

[26-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> BiteBTC deals with problems by closing accounts. It's outright theft, but they are still listed(let alone operating)

[26-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They'll get exposed...

*"10 (GFY)2019-06-19
Yeah FishyGuts  & I reviewed the requirements, a few weeks ago. We saw a possible issue, they might bring up. However, we have no solution for it.
We maintain the volume that they like to see, on one exchange, __not three of four__."*

[26-Jun-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good  quote, @zpajk

[26-Jun-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Mornin' Oink!
Yeah, thought I'd just level the expectations a bit, if that's how CMC's gonna play it.

[26-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> indeed...

[26-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Morning to you too...

[26-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And gotta say, volume on DP has been pretty swell lately, maybe not the current price at this moment, but volume. Nice to see.

[26-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Price is a matter of supply & demand. For now: the higher the price, the more supply from profit miners... If demand hits their mining capacity ceiling, the price can go up further.

[26-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Profit miners keeps VRSC acting as a stable coin pegged to valuta, at the moment... üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Mike T said PBaaS mainnet was scheduled for July a the video with Crypto Rich, but it was just a rough estimate, I think.

[26-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mox> can you give a real short summary of pirate and dp oink?

[26-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would need to revisit that video what he actually said. I remember being surprised he mentioned a timeframe, because he usually doesn‚Äôt commit to deadlines.

[26-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> DP has stuck Pirate transaction and is not able to 'unstuck' them. From Pirate devs suggestions were made how to go about that problem to solve this particular incident and how to prevent it from happening again... I believe this was somewhere around halfway May... Still not solved. But the details I don't have in my head, they are in Pirate discord.

[26-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mox> alright ty.. i hade an issue too one time due to a lag maybe

[26-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mox> but i profited 300vrsc üòê üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't know much about pirate, but how can someone prove they sent anything?

[26-Jun-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Issues will happen... It's how they are solved that show the dedication of the people running it. And that's what counts IMO.

[26-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Making a withdrawal, that never get's put on the chain.... Will keep showing in DP as unconfirmed...

[26-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti I just revisited the video and on minute 46 @Crypto Rich  asks: "*When Mainnet?*"
@miketout answers: "*I work my hardest to spend my time on actually building and creating and not trying to promise specific dates, because I care more that it's done right, than that it's done by a specific date.....*"
And in minute 48 Mike states: "*I do believe we are on the main net before the end of July, but I don't know that for sure and I really hesitate to give a specific date.*"

[26-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A lot more was said about this, but the bottom line is basically: It'll be released when it's ready to be released. Not sooner, not later.

[26-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (GFY)> @zpajk Why repost my quote about CMC?

[26-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @10 Because there was speculation about meeting the requirements by exchanges alone. My take on your post means CMC wants volume as well.

[26-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> $8k-$10k is what I was told

[26-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> not by cmc but from a good source

[26-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I never thought I'd say this, but at this point, I wouldn't worry about CMC

[26-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The coming months will bring changes in crypto, in general, and you never know how CMC will stand. I'm not a fan of how they list projects, and I'm not the only one. So we will see.

[26-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think a strategy of focusing on everything around CMC, and not it itself, would work best.

[26-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vmail> Is there something wrong? I'm having issues mining with the top 3 pools in 2 locations

[26-Jun-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> exactly, but I am working on much cooler capabilities than basic Bancor :)
right now, I have the code setup to enable a full solution to liquidity, high volume, friction free, decentralized exchanging of reserve currencies, also with a solution to front running. Miners and stakers will make blocks that can include conversions to and from a reserve currency. The reserve ratio is determined by a starting point, and then can be modified at every block by things like emission and burn transactions. The reserve ratio is then a function of the starting reserve and net emission. In any single block, all transactions, both buy and sell that can be processed, are, whether or not there are sellers when people want to buy or buyers when people want to sell. Market conversions will always get put into a block and processed as long as they can fit. Limit conversion orders will process if they can be added to the block and still meet the target limit price for conversion.
So, how do we solve front-running and eliminate the possibility of flash trading?
All conversions processed in a single block get exactly the same conversion price for both buys and sells (NO SPREAD!)
There will be a small fee that effectively beats all exchanges but will go only to miners and stakers of the PBaaS reserve chains, which is where the conversions take place, providing even more of a network effect for merge mining and profit opportunities for people who mine and stake chains well beyond block emissions.

[26-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We also expect to make this easy from the wallet across reserve chains, providing full liquidity sharing across the Verus ecosystem, meaning that if any PBaaS fractional reserve currency independently gets on exchanges, it is an option, not a requirement, since full liquidity will be built into the cross-chain protocol.

[26-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so is that like VRSC is used to create a reserve currency independent chain?
like putting for example 2 VRSC and defining the supply of 200 XCOIN, and that value to each unit of XCOIN a 0.01 VRSC as on its creation? and then when a part of these 200 XCOIN is converted back to VRSC, the value of the rest of the XCOIN is adjusted ?

[26-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> is my understanding correct?

[26-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Another question is, can these reserve currencies be only PBaaS chains only or can other independent blockchains from KMD ecosystem or even outside of ecosystem be used in reserve currencies system etc?

[26-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> like with bancor they basically supported ETH only tokens, and now they also support EOS tokens extend it outside it's core ecosystem, what it will look like with PBaaS reserve currencies ?

[26-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You understand the conversion correct.
Any PBaaS chain will have the Liquid reserve capabilities in addition to all the protocols already implemented in the Komodo ecosystem. So using CC etc, they can interact with any other chain, but not in the sense they interact with Verus, since the protocols Mike described only exist in the Verus Ecosystem.
If this mechanism was implemented in the Komodo ecosystem, basically every chain in the Komodo ecosystem chain could  use it, but for now, it's only the PBaaS chains.

[26-Jun-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It's kind of like that, but it's also a little more complex. For example, the Bancor equations used for converting from one fractional currency to its reserve, which are simplified forms of our equations look like this:
```
to convert reserve to fractional:
fractionalCurrencyOut = (supply * (pow((reservein / reserve + 1.0), ratio) - 1))
or to convert fractional to reserve:
reserveCurrencyOut = reserve * (pow((fractionalin / supply + 1.0), (1 / ratio)) - 1)```
These equations are solved together for all transactions in a block and all transactions in each block get the same price in either direction. That means that a 1 million Verus reserve could be used in a coin with a 10 million Verus market cap, and if people convert to the coin or use it more than convert from it, it will go up, if it is sold, the price will go down, but all coins, even to the last coin can be sold for Verus through the equations. The depth of the order book is always the entire money supply on the sell side and reserve on the buy side.

[26-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> When fractional reserve coins are emitted, the reserve ratio goes down. When they are officially burned, the reserve ratio goes up.

[26-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the closer the reserve ratio is to 1:1, the less volatile the currency can be relative to Verus. the further from it, the more volatile and subject to market forces.

[26-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you will be able to send Verus to reserve chains and to an address on that chain. As part of that send, you will be able to auto convert it to the native PBaaS currency or leave it as Verus tokens on the PBaaS chain and convert it when you want. You will be able to send Verus tokens without gas, because you can pay fees in Verus, which will convert automatically to the native currency. You can also convert any PBaaS reserve currency to Verus with these formulas and send it back to the Verus chain as well.

[26-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.

[26-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <IP> wow some huge stuff, great i came by to read it

[26-Jun-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Entire Komodo ecosystem should hardfork to PoP and Verushash 2.0!!! üòá

[26-Jun-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> Could we do some type of Medium/other resource write-up on this? It would be great to have elsewhere and able to link to!

[26-Jun-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That would be amazing! Bitcoin what?

[26-Jun-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well then that's it. That's the exchange killer. No more middlemen and any small fees go right back to the ones maintaining the network. Instant, safe, exchanges with easily convertible crypto coins. So cool thinking how much the landscape has been changing over the past year and where it could be thanks to innovations like this

[26-Jun-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So goodbye exit scams or dead key holders. What we have been dreaming about in a true decentralized exchange, it turns out, in reality it is going to be so much more! 
Exciting just thinking about it. This is such a neat, lean system that cuts out all the fat and gets right down to business so business can get done.

[26-Jun-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I try to put my energy into making it, and I'll do more writeups after that. These are all things I'm working on now, so I thought I'd share. If other people want to work on medium articles, I can certainly edit some amount, but until this is really finished, the making of it takes the energy that would go into more formal writing than here.

[26-Jun-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And since it's completely decentralized the FTAF regulations make an exemption for this kind of trading with respect to registration and reporting.

[26-Jun-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I recommend we not try to give legal advice unless we're lawyers (maybe you are). I've learned it's better not to. Instead, I am just working on protocols that I know will enable what people, including corporate partners, need

[26-Jun-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but I do believe you're right üòâ no one should depend on my opinion for legal advice though, since I am not an attorney

[26-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are absolutely correct... It was my interpretation and by no means legal advice.

[26-Jun-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can understand the excitement though. It is quite pretty in it's purely protocol presentation

[26-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The tools are there to be used. No one gains from this, all rewards are earned and all users are participants

[26-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Like Bitcoin itself

[26-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> These protocols are merely tools, but tools shared in a decentralized manner cannot be confiscated which is why Bitcoin persists and cannot be governed.

[26-Jun-19 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That's what I think once people realize will change perception to a public tool vs. a typical crypto project. That's when I think things will really change, though some corporate use might change things even before that. We will see. I'm definitely holding my Verus as BTC rises, not worried myself, but not giving any investment advice of course üòâ

[26-Jun-19 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I totally agree with the advice you're not giving, but that's just my opinion. üòá

[26-Jun-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Request: Verus wallet- send button removed üòÇ

[26-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm holding through the btc growing pains too. And staking too! Don't forget to stake y'all!

[26-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz Create paper wallet. Send it to that address..... No send button there

[26-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can honestly say though that I can't recall a time I've been so excited and optimistic about blockchain tech and what the future holds and that I can't think of a more ambitious and driven development team either! That has my vote any day!

[26-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ahhh clever @Oink haha you had a quick solution for that one

[26-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you want your paper wallets to stake, set up a dedicated staking wallet, (CLI ofcoarse) and import just the WIFs of your paper wallets.

[26-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I got paper wallets for all my staking addresses in my vault now.

[26-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hmm cool idea. I do have a little pc for staking but it's just the cli and I've backed up my WIFs to paper. So sorta a flipped version

[26-Jun-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @miketout wow! that's some great insight and exciting stuff! :)
Getting reserve currency a bit clearer now to understand. Thanks for the answering üôÇ üëç

[26-Jun-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I was reading some kmd blog with PBaaS details and it was pointing to some chat snippets `https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/350b2dbe91104858ef668a434ff85e49`

[26-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you mentioned some usecases like voting, poll, loyalty currency, liquid reserves and bancor style usecases.
I was thinking some possible use case... just trying to make sense if such use case will fit this type of blockchains which are create for specific purpose and retired/expred after use.

- I do understand the first use case of PBaaS is for example is like creating a blockchain for getting votes/polls and get results and once it solves it's purpose it gets delete/expired/archived etc.
- right now the limit is 15, but actually there can be no limit and there can by unlimited PBaaS independent blockchains made
- these PBaaS blockchains are not necessarily be just temporary but can be long term project usage too.

So, if above is correct I was thinking some other usecases.

[26-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you for posting the link and getting the discussion going. Nice break from a challenge I'm working on. Right now, I'm trying to determine if there is an algebraic way to solve a very difficult equation, which will allow perfect efficiency with partial fills on limit orders that can be included in a block and by being partially filled, still meet their limit requirements. My default approach is a numerical iteration, which will be able to handle partial fills, but not get a perfect answer to fill them all the way up to the maximum satoshi. The formula to solve is exceedingly complex, so if you know of some exceptional algebraic gurus, please send them my way ;). I've even thought about a small, pre-trained neural net in C++, which should be able to get very close. I know how I'd do that, but it wouldn't be my first choice üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> all correct from my understanding

[26-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> since the blockchains are proof of some event occurred and authenticity of validity, these can be used for some interesting use cases, also in mix of IoT devices used in homes and small to medium businesses. Whenever I get some raw idea I just write them, no matter how crapy it might be, but could possibly be turn out good if worked out or may be not, so just throw it later.
so the other possible use cases could be like:
- a personal blog blockchain or some official portal for important announcements, like for governments or corporates or for any purposes. From serious or non-serious. Blogs and medium.com etc are all basically text/html, the blockchain has the bytes space to hold that data and ideally it is possible today to make such applications use case on almost any blockchain, but with PBaaS this can be automated and be managed as well.

[26-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - the other can be medium to short term future kinda projects. Which are currently not so directly possible as that need bit of more work and innovation to add, more like some level of codec development in combination to blockchain integration. And if that solves, it'd be possible to add video and audio applications to it.

[26-Jun-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> -- that means a specific blockchain create and used to broadcast some audio/visual events. could be like sports or some other events. could be like podcast or radio type of events, but more specific to where the authenticity and history needs proof and preserved kind of ways.

[26-Jun-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> --- this actually was done by one dev in KMD already, a video broadcasting over blockchain, by blackjok3r.

[26-Jun-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> the idea with this use and throw kinda blockchain is very much like the use and throw communications mobile etc.

[26-Jun-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> github could very well track the changes on a blockchain for any project, for example

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> it's very much a choice for people then to what purpose these can be fit to use. like if I want to sign up to medium.com to create a quick easy and nice looking blogs or I want to host my own Wordpress and manage it all myself, or I want to build a full PHP based application to make my whole blogging and news platform.

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> That level of difference is all this PBaaS and Komodo's independent blockchains comparison comes to mind.

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> anytime I try to understand a tech, I try to imagine it's use cases, that excites me more when I get that understanding....

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm smiling because your ideas are all reasonable, and there are some people talking about each of them, though everyone has a different internal idea of the concepts, and I don't know if the people who have talked about these or similar ideas will do them or not. I do believe that some of those scenarios, especially blockchain government scenarios make more and more sense. Especially when you consider that the people staking and notarizing the chains could be citizens and earn money that would otherwise go to non-local companies to run and secure the systems. It also ties nicely into voting and registration, earning money by being involved in that process, etc.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i do suspect the biggest financial use may be corporate currencies though, especially with the fractional reserve capabilities.
