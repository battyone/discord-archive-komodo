[dscrd-chips] <jorian> weird. maybe something changed recently

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> but this is not really useful

[03-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Hmm maybe it's because CHIPS was not in sync when I started it, let me try to restart lighthing

[03-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yeaah

[03-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> it's the last resort, since it basically wipes your lightning node

[03-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Hmm, I'm getting same address now as I've shared to @sg777 
```./lightning-cli newaddr
{ "address" : "bQVgTMmfA46TWqhvmLjyY9TC5ncfPE2j3w" }```
https://explorer.chips.cash/tx/52ea8f55d807380ace15f1befbe894ae0f07d1027653ee6d2ee810abab779d91
And client seems to be in sync:
```./lightning-cli getinfo
{ "id" : "025e64bca3d6b217f1a71d8c1025fa5c465053849535c2e04b6434f633a52a96e7", "port" : 9735, "address" :

[03-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> But listfunds is empty:
```./lightning-cli listfunds
{ "outputs" : 
    [  ], "channels" : 
    [  ] }
```

[03-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> `./lightning-cli dev-rescan-outputs`?

[03-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```./lightning-cli dev-rescan-outputs
{ "outputs" : 
    [  ] }
```

[03-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> so `newaddr` got you the same address as before?

[03-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yes

[03-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh after rescan it's different

[03-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Got it

[03-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Thanks üëç Will try to connect to dealer now

[03-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> you don't have to

[03-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> if you play a game, it will be done automatically

[03-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> at least, it should. that's what we should test now üòÑ

[03-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```then run ./bet player 159.69.23.30
to start the playing node...since on that IP I just started to run the DCV..
how actually it works is there are two nodes DCV(Dealer) and BVV(Blinder) and the playing nodes connect to DCV where the table formation happens...then players, DCV and BVV involve in the process of deck shuffling..then card distribution with round betting happens
does your LN has any funds, initially the playing nodes sets up the channels of 0.05 CHIPS with DCV```

[03-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Should I do this part? üòÉ

[03-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> yes, but i'm not sure if sg is still around

[03-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Aha, I guess node is down atm

[03-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> yes i got the same

[03-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> thing is: we need 4 nodes to play a game

[03-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> maybe that can improved later

[03-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> although..

[03-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> let me try something

[03-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> So we need 1 more player now (somebody who will install whole stack) and then schedule a tournament?

[03-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I can install on more nodes if needed

[03-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> 185.62.58.27 try that ip

[03-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> a dealer should be able to play as well

[03-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```185.62.58.27``` - same error

[03-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i can start setting up a node soon

[03-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> yes i have errors too

[03-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @sg777

[03-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> he's probably asleep

[03-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> but yes, the more prepared nodes the better

[03-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> We can just schedule test on some time

[03-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> So people who want to play will prepare the nodes before this time
