[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> as the fund grows, I think we should start using multisig address

[05-Aug-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I agree. I will have a chat with jorian and discuss that idea.

[05-Aug-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> When he is back :P

[05-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Bitfinger> If there's an Anon on a Moose around here... DM me bro, it's Stan :D

[07-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> DP disabled deposits until they can generate R addresses instead of B addresses. Can someone contact them and tell them how to fix?

[07-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> don't know which branch is good now

[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @jl777c sorry to ping you. I am also interested in this fix

[07-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> ```
chips-cli getnewaddress "" "legacy"
RCz8vaHgskT2hHHjDsr1so1AoLdRWtZpCr
chips-cli getnewaddress "" "p2sh-segwit"
bWSvGDNnbfFtCpa3DYzANFn3RxpNZ1BAtY
```
for example @Oszy I don't have contact with DP though

[07-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> I'll forward it to them then, I'll be the contact üòÑ

[08-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> With all existing poker and casino projects. Chips have future?

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> yes, why not ?

[08-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> name another blockchain based poker game where you can mine the chips

[08-Aug-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> @helios where are there decentralized poker and casino projects. I see only hosted projects

[08-Aug-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> @Oszy   WINK

[08-Aug-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Users can create accounts with DAO.Casino‚Äôs TestNet 2.0, as well as deposit test tokens with Validators, and stake them against Blockchain‚Äôs resources. Users can become Validators, as long as they possess enough of the BET token, which is the native token for the DAO.Casino platform.
According to the company, some of the most important innovations in DAO.Casino‚Äôs TestNet 2.0 are:

-Dedicated staking resource type ‚Äúvote‚Äù used for Validator voting along with traditional CPU and
bandwidth;
-Dynamic number of Validator nodes based on the total stake amount (from 21 up to 100);
-Transaction sponsorship for providing a way to ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù resource reservation needed for
transactions made by other accounts. This feature will allow organizations to easily onboard new
users by performing actions on the blockchain without initial token deposits.

[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> ____
Not sure if that helps any.
But I've followed the project for a while, thought I'd post it.

[08-Aug-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> I need to try out KMDice

[08-Aug-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> WINK is tronbet right?

[08-Aug-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @Privatoshi

[08-Aug-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I dont think they are p2p, all the players interact on a centralized server with smart contracts

[08-Aug-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Yes wink is tronbet

[09-Aug-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Eth and Tron got some caisno games using daps, having millions $ monthly transfers (maybe fake?)

[09-Aug-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> but for end user does not matter much if this is centralized game or whatever

[09-Aug-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> what matters is user experience mostly - if nice = people come

[09-Aug-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> using that logic, just go to pokerstars.com

[09-Aug-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Cant it is blocked üòõ

[09-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> how do people in police states play online poker?

[09-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> VPN

[09-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Not when you have to KYC

[09-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> The world wants unhosted p2p games.  It's a giant step forward. Just like unhosted p2p crypto trading.

[09-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Yes let get gui working first

[09-Aug-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> we hope soon

[09-Aug-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> We have an idea for the GUI stable release ?

[10-Aug-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> @jl777c vpn wink

[10-Aug-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> using a tron dapp browser

[10-Aug-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> tronlink Android app

[10-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @helios @sg777 and @pixelshove are working on that. The GUI is basically done, now it is iterating the backend and the GUI as differences come up. Biggest one they are working on is actual multiplayer, up to this point it had been someone playing but have control over all nodes

[10-Aug-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @Privatoshi he was talking about pokerstars not tron bet

[10-Aug-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> I got u

[10-Aug-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> @hyperDEX what's the deal with KMDice?

[10-Aug-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Ever used it ?

[10-Aug-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> No idea, i am not working on that. Basically like tronbet

[10-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Why no dice game here?

[10-Aug-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Just poker, or?

[10-Aug-19 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Dice is the easiest

[10-Aug-19 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Poker then BJ then lots and lots of other games

[10-Aug-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Wen live?

[10-Aug-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> There is no specific date set. The team are working away trying to get all of the back/front integration sorted. Once that is done there will be a bunch of testing, cashier integration and maybe then a V1.0 release date can be thought about (along with website release). Anybody is free to use it in the current state if they so choose though.

[10-Aug-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> before public release, multisig lock/unlock of table bets would need to be implemented, the gui integration is first as that will allow gui level testing in parallel with removing this last exposure

[10-Aug-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Would @sg777 be able to work on the multisig when the gui integration is  complete, or will that require another dev?
I'll add it to the trello to do list tomorrow

[10-Aug-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 can do it

[10-Aug-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Well GUI is complete, backend and front ends being iterated as we find things that are missing to support multiplayer over 2 different players.

[11-Aug-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> I can help testing.

[11-Aug-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I received an email back from CMC, unfortunately they won't update our information until we get more trade volume on their recognised exchanges. Also, CoinGecko will only update their information once we have a website. So looks like i'm getting to work on the website üòÉ

[11-Aug-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @grewalsatinder there is a second and third account in here with your name @grewalsatinder & @grewalsatinder

[11-Aug-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> very strange! not mine at all.

[11-Aug-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> I remember early in days when I singed up on Discord, I did sign up with two different email addresses, but never used the other email signed up account.

[11-Aug-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> so, in case any other account is known to use my handle, feel free to block it, kick it or ban it.

[12-Aug-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> hi, someone from the team could be a escrow for a transaction? @jorian

[12-Aug-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> @PHBA2061 DP dones't seem to respond to me or solve the issue, could someone please open a ticket and let them know to use  `chips-cli getnewaddress "" "legacy"` to generate deposit addresses?

[12-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> They usually charge for code updates

[12-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> $200 per code update, was the last I heard

[12-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> @$tefano. I can do it if it's a KMD/CHIPS trade for 1% on both sides. (if no one else is around)

[12-Aug-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> @dukeleto it's $200 to add 7 letters to the command they currently use?

[12-Aug-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> which is by the way wrong

[12-Aug-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> they generate P2SH now..

[12-Aug-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> Welcome to the show

[12-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> This is why HUSH left DP

[12-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> not surprised

[12-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> They wanted to charge us to change anything or update anything

[12-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> So the listing fee is actually a lie

[12-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> @Oszy i will ask, thank you

[12-Aug-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> thanks @Oszy probably it's not necessary, i will confirm you in the next hours

[12-Aug-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> i'll be around for 1-2 hours then only tomorrow

[12-Aug-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> let me know

[13-Aug-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> It is possible to forward website chips ? Or need to wait ??

[13-Aug-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 @PHBA2061 controls the 4 nodes we have too. Can you let him know how much ram the machines should have so he can spin them up

[13-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @sg777 surely, I'll be waiting for the details üòÉ

[13-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @PHBA2061 can you spin up 4 nodes with 8gb ram on each?

[13-Aug-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> let me know if you are getting low on funds

[13-Aug-19 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> yes, but I'll be waiting for sg777  instructions first, I think 4Gb should be enough

[14-Aug-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Does CHIPS support nSPV?

[14-Aug-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> If not how much of work it might be?
