[11-Jul-19 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> there must be more others here who can come to your show and explain poker specific and this project specific things

[11-Jul-19 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <𝕃𝕠𝕠𝕋𝕫> well mainly about the coin chips and where its going, what its used for, then we can talk about some poker as well

[11-Jul-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @LootZ, you can also check with @NutellaLicka @PHBA2061 @jorian  they have good idea about what's going on..

[dscrd-chips] <𝕃𝕠𝕠𝕋𝕫> cool anyone thats down if you got the time ill do the crime

[11-Jul-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> sorry, I can't do a radio interview 😅

[11-Jul-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <𝕃𝕠𝕠𝕋𝕫> you can do it in your underwear and no one would know

[11-Jul-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Its good shit.
I may be able to do it in a week or so, need to do a bit more reading to fully grasp the ins and outs though before hand. Maybe @hyperDEX could join as well

[11-Jul-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 only in heads up matches does the steps change. If you have at least 3 players, first to act preflop is button, then SB then BB. But then on flop it is SB/BB/Button.

[11-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Take a look at that video i linked above.

[11-Jul-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Sorry lootz, my voice would frighten everyone away. NuttellaLicka seems like the best candidate 😄

Multiplayer poker is the latest game to fall to artificial intelligence—and the techniques used could be vital for trading, product pricing, and routing vehicles.

[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> basically the alphazero technique applied to poker

[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @cascrypto no ref links please

[dscrd-chips] <cascrypto> learn'd my leson, bitpanda being KMD community origine made me stay from the path, will behave now

[13-Jul-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> hey let me just throw out some random thought here - how about using IOTA Tangle instead if lightning for Poker backend messaging? not fast enough? tech too immature? probably both, right? Tangle can be pretty fast when in good marching order, but not quite as fast as LN I think 🌩

[13-Jul-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> backend messaging is done through tcp socket, not through lightning-network (the payment does, and it's almost instant, confirmations are only needed for the deposit & withdrawal transactions). I'm still waiting for IOTA to remove the COO.

[14-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Gui this week :)

[14-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @jorian are all exchagnes running updated CHIPS daemon?

[14-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> No idea

[14-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> Am not in contact with any exchange

[14-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> All exchanges need to update for S3 notaries

[14-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> Which exchanges is CHIPS on these days?

[14-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> coinexchange.io
https://digitalprice.io
Barterlly (I'll contact dwy)

[14-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  have already updated I think. i'll update my pool after next cigarette. I'll contact @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers  to be sure that he disabled CHIPS (or that he updated it) and Ondalf (just in case he is playing with CHIPS on his pool)

[14-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> I don't know how to contact exchanges (except by support ticket and wait 2 months)

[14-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i pinged Triplex of DP and Highlander, Stimpy of coinexchange.io and also created a support ticket there

[14-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> DP responded. they will update

[14-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i'll post as soon as they are updated

[14-Jul-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @SHossain  thank you very much

[14-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @Dwy  @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  Please update to jl777/chips3 repo, dev branch of CHIPS. It is a mandatory update related to the new NN. Please do it before the hardfork.

[dscrd-chips] <Dwy> will be done

[14-Jul-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Dwy> why do exchanges and pools have to run a dev branch ?

[14-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> I have no clues. For all coins that I played with outside of KMD ecosystem (more than 150), I used master without any issues. I don't know why it is ``dev`` here. I'll ask to merge dev to master

[14-Jul-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @phm87 please stop pinging me over this; I'm not feken retarded

[14-Jul-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> CG : I didn't know you updated, sorry. You are not retarded. But one exchange, bartelly and other pools were not updated, no message was sent to ask ppl to update

[14-Jul-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `You are not retarded. But one exchange, bartelly and other pools were not updated`
So you thought it prudent to ping *me* twice in an hr and a half? ffs

 There's no part of me that can fathom how that's even possible....

[dscrd-chips] <Dwy> can we please get the master branch updated...

[14-Jul-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> I'll ask @jl777c  after the hardfork

[14-Jul-19 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> what's a master branch?

[15-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> jl777 decides when to merge `dev` to `master`

[15-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @jl777c i think people want you to merge CHIPS dev to master

[15-Jul-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @miner707 it is coming

[15-Jul-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> i merged dev -> beta

[15-Jul-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but having problems doing a beta -> master PR. i asked blackjok3r for help

[15-Jul-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it is now in master

[15-Jul-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 plz make sure latest LN logic works with my master branch

[15-Jul-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, i'll test now and push any changes if needed.

[16-Jul-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> everyone  I made some changes to the `bet repo` in order to compatable with jl's latest `chips master branch`, please pull the changes to avoid any errors..

[16-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove

[16-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Thanks @sg777 , how is it coming with the multiplayer test?

[16-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> In bet repo I made changes in `poker branch for backedn play` and in `rest_dev branch for front end play` and in `poker_test branch for distributed gui play`...please let me know for any errors..

[16-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX multiplayer is much faster since I use the network sockets in the backend so that there is very minimal communication via websockets...it's playable now..

[16-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> with the new GUI which you & pixelshove is making if the code made avilable to public please let me know, I can help in resolving any backend errors that occur

[16-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in order to play the poker over distributed GUI please use `poker_branch` of bet and pangea-poker-frontend repos..

[16-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yes the code will be public once completed @pixelshove can you DM the repo to sg777 please

[17-Jul-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Pixelshove said we should be done with the GUI by the weekend. @sg777 can you please provide some assistance to him to get the new backend code integrated before then? Also for BJ, do we need to wait for you to do the backend first or can we start that?

@Mylo sorry to keep harassing you but did you get a chance to do a package for the backend and GUI?

[17-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure he  shared the code with me, I'll test it on today.

[17-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @PHBA2061 sorry to be a pain in the ass, how easy will it be for you to spin up more player nodes? If i remember correctly you can do a backup and then import it

[17-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I would like to get maybe 4-6 player nodes in total and to fund them all with some CHIPS for a test this Friday/Saturday

[17-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin> @ixuz welcome here

[17-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ixuz> Hi all, thanks for the invite.

[17-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin> if you need ask question, ask @hyperDEX @sg777 @jl777c

[17-Jul-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin> ✌

[17-Jul-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ixuz> Thanks! I'm a little busy right now but I'll get back here later. 👌

[17-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @hyperDEX can do that in a few clicks, currently all 4 nodes are using sg777 chips repo and not jl777's, probably need to switch to jl777's repo & the latest bet repo & test before cloning more nodes ?

[17-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> 2moro I'll spend cpl hrs on it

[17-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> @hyperDEX

[17-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> 14 hrs time

[17-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061  let me know when you plan to test more than 2 players, mean while I'll make changes to read the number of players from command line..

[17-Jul-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> hyperDEX said he would want to do some tests this Friday/Saturday with 4-6 players nodes. if I use jl777 chips/master insterad of yours, will it work properly with lightning now ?

[17-Jul-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes it will work..

[17-Jul-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for me adding support in the backend for number of players > 2 is easy but in the gui it require bit more changes...atleast we can try testing commnad line for more number of players..

[17-Jul-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> from what hyperDEX  said I assume that pixelshove is close to finish hismultiplayer GUI

[17-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> 2+ players requires a little more work on the front-end. 2 players is almost done.

[17-Jul-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Sorry @PHBA2061 we may need more dealer/BVV nodes. I guess we can try HU for now till @sg777 sorts out the backend for >2

[19-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @PHBA2061 can you give me the node IPs and ports?

[19-Jul-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Dealer - IP - Port etc

[19-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Might be ready to play some HU 😃

[19-Jul-19 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <helios> I want to kill fish

[20-Jul-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 with the GUI as is, it needs the IP of the 1st and 2nd player to start. If we have 2 different people connecting, 1 puts the 1st ip and the 2nd putting the 2nd ip, would they be able to play with each other?

[20-Jul-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove

[20-Jul-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes in the old gui there is no option to input the player IP from the gui directly..we need to hardcode it in the pangeapoker.js, the player just need to hardcode his IP in the `pangeapoker.js`, I guess pixelshove is providing a prompt to enter the IP from gui..

[20-Jul-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Cool do you know the ports used?

[20-Jul-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777

[20-Jul-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove can you give player2 as a option entry before you click start?

[20-Jul-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> The default ports are 9000, 9001, 9002, 9003. The new gui has a modal on startup that lets you input the IPs
