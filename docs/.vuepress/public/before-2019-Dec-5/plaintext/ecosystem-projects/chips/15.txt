[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Any documentation on how to use komodo wallet for chips transfer ?

[03-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> chips works in Agama exactly like any other Komodo ecosystem coin/token

[03-Nov-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> you can use it in light mode, so you don't have to sync the CHIPS blockchain @kpprabhu

[27-Dec-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I written the logic as per the rules mentioned above to built the side pots....

[27-Dec-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one more doubt is, isn't it the case that, the round betting always stops at the player who raised the last?

[27-Dec-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> that page looks like it covers everything if you look at all of the posts and I think the graphic makes a good visual aid
`the round betting always stops at the player who raised the last?`
the "round" *starts* with the player that raised last and ends with the player to their immediate right (if no one else re-raises)

[27-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, isn't it that the round always start with the player left to the dealer...

[27-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> apart from the pre flop round which start with the player left to big blind

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `isn't it that the round always start with the player left to the dealer...`
initially, yes; however, once someone raises a "new round" begins

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> there can be many "sub-rounds" (for lack of better wording) in each "round" of betting

[27-Dec-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in this once the flop  or turn or river cards are drawn, the betting is starting from the player left to the dealer..

[27-Dec-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> correct
I guess what I was saying would apply as a "sub-round"

[27-Dec-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay got it, so if a player A raises and all other players just perform the call, even in that case also player A won't be allowed to raise again right?

[27-Dec-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> correct, if all are calls then you cannot re-raise yourself

[27-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, one more doubt is, isn't the case we need to fix small_blind before start of the game?

[27-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> or we can allow dynamic bet on small_blind?

[27-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `if a player A raises and all other players just perform the call` then the betting will end with the active player to their immediate right

[27-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> agreed, it means for that round the betting is over, depending up on the state of the game, next community cards will be drawn...right?

[27-Dec-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `we need to fix small_blind before start of the game?
or we can allow dynamic bet on small_blind?`
the "standard" is set big and small; there are "house rules" that apply in some places, but generally blinds are fixed amount

[27-Dec-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> 1&2 5&10 3&6 etc

[27-Dec-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> got it thanks, so the maximum rounds of betting rounds is 4?

[27-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> 1) after hole cards are drawn 2) after flop cards 3) after turn card 4) after river card

[27-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Small is "generally" 1/2 of big
if you count a "round" as it relates to the card action then, yes, you have 4
preflop
post-flop
post-turn
post-river

[27-Dec-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, yes, we will fix small/big blinds to something like 1/2 satoshis for time being on LN..

[27-Dec-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> a question for the community is what games we want to see CHIPS supporting. we are working toward a table driven game definition, so once a specific type of game is implemented, then similar variants would be supported with the creation of a new set of data that describes the game rules.

[28-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> i estimate 100+ different games can be supported, but we want to support the games that people want to play

[28-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> anyone interested to test the poker game which uses pangea protocol, please take the code from the `poker` branch and test..
