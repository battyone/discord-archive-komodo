[discord] <jl777c> the LN will be used for the betting,so we need to get smart and experienced with all the LN aspects

[21-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> agree

[21-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> for CHIPS website me and @jorian decided that for the start we'll just make simple HTML static website and host it soon.
I'm just waiting for the website content data and then I'll create the website using that.

[21-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> we can for sure include the how to of LN stuff in there.

[21-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and all this can happen starting now so it is all in place when the games code is into testing. now we got momom working, we are down to the poker state machine completion and LN integrations with the final custom CC poker eval function and it will all be a fully working system. I realized that our LN experience is lacking, especially about the latest tools

[21-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it could be that a small amount of customization is needed to make it use CHIPS

[21-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> agree

[21-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> if ANY dev here can make any of these wallets and explorers work with CHIPS would be really great! üôÇ

[21-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> just choose your fav language supported code and try making it work with CHIPS

[21-Jun-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I wanna find the github for  HTLC.me

[21-Jun-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
That's a cool little web wallet

[21-Jun-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> I see a lot of the software connects with LND, but CHIPS will be using  c-lightning, right @jl777c ?

[21-Jun-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> some of the repos say its for  LND with support for  c-lightning coming soon

[21-Jun-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> I guess CHIPS can also use LND ü§î

[21-Jun-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> LND works with `bitcoind`

[21-Jun-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> if that's how it is then LND must work with CHIPS too

[21-Jun-18 01:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yea i guess you're right @grewalsatinder . I'm not sure its been tested at all though

[21-Jun-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> > `lnd` has several pluggable back-end chain services including `btcd` (a full-node), `bitcoind`, and `neutrino` (a new experimental light client).

[21-Jun-18 01:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i'm not sure the changes james made to c-lightnign, but they might need to be changed to LND as well

[21-Jun-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> out of all so far LN wallets I explored only this looked like will work with the combination of LND + `bitcoind`

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> what i mean is LTC must have LN wallets, etc. customized for LTC. you can see how they changed from BTC to LTC

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just do the same but instead of "LTC" use "CHIPS"

[21-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> run my lightningd from my lightning repo, no need to mess with the daemon, there is already a CHIPS customized version, in my repo

[21-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so in the above chart, the litcoind is chipsd, the lnd/c-lightning is my variant of lightning

[21-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the wallet and other apps are what we need converted to use CHIPS lightning, it could be automatically working as i think the rpc port is the same

We're In It for the Long Haul
Our faith in CoinPoker has less to do with market speculation and more to do with our team's passion for decentralized, fair, and innovative poker.
While cryptocurrency markets (and all financial markets for that matter) are in constant flux, our team's efforts to bring decentralized poker the mainstream player is a constant upward trend our community can always rely on.

Why We See a Big Future for CoinPoker
Stay tuned for more updates and news coming your way!

an email I just got, looks like you guys are in another race. lol

[22-Jun-18 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
Is CoinPoker still "semi-decentralized"? Fairly sure it's just an online poker site that uses their coin as betting chips

[22-Jun-18 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
ie, a central exchange

[22-Jun-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419

[22-Jun-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> practical use for CHIPS in games is ways out still, so patience is needed. crypto space is still pretty much in a protocol building stage. too early to expect user-friendly apps for everyday users

[25-Jun-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we just made a big advancement in the encryption security. In the past M players colluding could have cheated. We set M to N/2+1, so if the majority are colluding they could have compromised the deck. While this is decent, for really big stakes likely not good enough. So, we improved it

Now the MofN will be set to (N+2) and (N + N/2 + 2) where N is the number of players, N/2+1 notary nodes providing random blinding values and the dealer. So some combination of players dealer and notary nodes that is N+2 need to collude. If all N players are colluding, it seems to make no sense at all. in a 9 player game, 11 colluders would be needed.

notice if we can assume the notary nodes wont collude it is fully secure even if all the players and dealer collude

[25-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
