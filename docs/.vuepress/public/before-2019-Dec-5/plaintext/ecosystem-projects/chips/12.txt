[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> idk how they got off

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> they don't really help much :/

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> how much hash rate is it?

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I'll put the pool back up

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> like 3ghs. it's fine if not, just offering

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> might as well

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> couple minutes

[28-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> running to the bank, be back in a few

[28-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> just message me when you're back

[28-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> still stuck ;_;

[28-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I can un stall it for a day or so, but what then? :/

[28-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> it's like $30/day to make it have reasonable block times

[29-Aug-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> shossain has some miners, hopefully they can come back online. better would be to change to verushash

[29-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @blackjok3r said the VRSC guy wants to help out for 5000KMD

[29-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> he mentioned it to me that he would do it, as he taught the 5000 CHIPS bounty was 5000 KMD.

[29-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> but for 5000 CHIPS, he said he would help me with it, but I still wasn't able to do it.

[29-Aug-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i've setup a pool in case somebody wants to point hashrate over: http://136.243.227.136:8080/getting_started  - however i can't help with actual hashrate sadly.

[29-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> currently optimizing for NH, but it's generally working nice

[29-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i'd say for now it's properly un-stuck.

[29-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> will have to do some slight adjustments to the difficulty adaption i guess, but i'm OK 'for now'

[29-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i've added a 2nd port for lower diffs. if somebody has some asics and would like to help me out by connecting to see if the difficulties i've chosen make sense, i'd love that a lot

[29-Aug-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> btw pool address is     `"address": "RFhz3JK2Z54EEp5U8km3CrK19LVZ1KyE58",` and i've got a 2% fee set

[29-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> I can put 1000 KMD for 5000 KMD bounty to apply VRSC

[29-Aug-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> then still need 4000 KMD from community

[29-Aug-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> $70k at peak to switch to an algo that many of us *can't* mine?
Have you people lost your minds?

[29-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> it's not like you need a mars rover to mine verushash

[29-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> or any other very specialized hardware, that is

[29-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> no, but to do it with any usefulness you do need a CPU that takes a very specific instruction set (which many of us do not have)

[29-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> do you have a better solution?

[29-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> ummm

[29-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> mine the chain we have?

[29-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> are you mining?

[29-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> ü§£

[29-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I was

[29-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> why would I bother if the algo is going to change?

[29-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> yea that doesn't mean crap if the chain is slow _NOW_

[29-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> ehh brb

[29-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i need popcorn

[29-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> lol, no need for popcorn

[29-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> the chain being slow now is entirely meaningless

[29-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> then why do you make a fuzz üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> oh yes there is need for popcorn

[29-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> we're trying to fix this stalling of CHIPS and some had the idea that verushash could fix it

[29-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> CHIPS is stalling for 3 simple reasons:
it's summer
greedy miners left
why should anyone run a sustained setup when the plan is to change it by the time tx fees become a sustainable income?

[29-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> CHIPS is not really done and i don't see a lot of usage all of a sudden

[29-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> so tx fees will take a while

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think CHIPS is stalling because reward is too low

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> not that it's summer, that's just timing

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> and I was willing to mine it for that while until the plan became one which would cost me in excess of $10k to get the same results when tx fees are sustainable

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> miners mine to make profit. if they lose money on mining, yeah, can't blame them

[29-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `not that it's summer, that's just timing`
No, that's 100% of the reason my hash shut down for a month

[29-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> it's winter on the other side of the planet

[29-Aug-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> there was exactly 0 extended conversation about stalls and algo changes until summer (specifically 9 straight days of 100+F) hit this side of the planet.

[29-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> decreasing prices and lower rewards are more important, imo. anyways, whatever the reason is/was, we need it fixed. if people don't want to mine it because it is not worth it, we need to make it worth it to mine chips.

[29-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i remember blocks on demand was being talked about

[29-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> could also be a solution

[29-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> whatever may be the case, my pool is up and running and to what i've been told there has been measures taken to make sure it'll be mined "for a while" - whatever that may mean

[29-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> so, i'm still in need of somebody with some sha256 asics to help me test my low diff port on the pool

[29-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `we need to make it worth it to mine chips`
It was "worth it" to me until all of the talk about changing to verushash.
Now I'm at a point where there's no logic to buying more S9s, but instead buying more CPUs, bords, etc
In short, it's stalled because folks decided to change shit

[29-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> @un Haiduc can you help with that

[29-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @0x03 help with what, exactly?

[29-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> read above your last 'mini wall of text'

[29-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> right above, actually

[29-Aug-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> at the point that 3 sentences is a 'mini wall of text', I'm not sure that any rational conversation can be had ü§¶üèø 
That aside, all of my sha ASICs are currently in boxes awaiting move to our larger location since I no longer have a personal use for them

[29-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> have a nice day sir

[29-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> well if we can get a consistent hashrate, there is no need to change algo

[29-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we werent getting a consistent hashrate, so solutions were requested

[29-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I was told that it would require some unknown amount of SHA hashrate to keep the blocks consistent

[29-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> do we know how many miners are needed ?

[29-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> from what it looks like right now, theres one 'smaller' miner hopping on and off, and he seems to have just enough hashrate to provide a consistent (low) blocktime. if we only knew how much he had.

[29-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> nicehash is only so-and-so much useful because it's rather tailored to PH/s and requires a completetely insane mindiff

[29-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> but it'll keep the network going nevertheless

[29-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <CHMEX> I have about 80 dollars 0.01x btc there at nicehash if needed let me know what to do

[29-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `do we know how many miners are needed ?`
If you include the 1 miner that still has CHIPS in their profit switcher, then you're looking @ ~200-300TH
If they aren't a factor, then you're looking at ~ 20-50TH

[29-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> the minimum amount of hashrate you can buy on NH is 0.05 PH/s and the additional problem is that it requires a mindiff of 1 Mio at the pool, else it disconnects you... i made such an order on NH... minimum amount is 0.005 BTC and it last for around 3 days

[29-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> we could really just use a bunch of small usb asics on the pool, actually

[29-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> well, there are factors/issues with NH being NH that aren't a real factor in this

[29-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i _think_ right now this would make the biggest difference

[29-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i.e. https://www.amazon.de/Bitcoin-USB-Stick-bitshopper-GekkoScience-2Pac/dp/B0718WLSHV

[29-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @ $92 USD, I can't see how they'd be of any value

[29-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> value doesn't matter, the problem to be solved is getting blocks on CHIPS, not making money

[29-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> value **does** matter when it would take 30 of them ($2700 USD) to = 1 TH

[29-Aug-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> ok, i see what you mean... not sure if we need 1 TH

[29-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> probably not

[29-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> as a (probably not too meaningful) comparison, i'm running 12 'similar' scrypt asics which are usually enough to properly support small scrypt altcoins. and you can definitely say i'm doing if from an enthusiats point of view. but something like this pointed against chips would probably just be enough, judging by the current situation

[29-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> 'Moonlander 2' is what the scrypt ones are called

[29-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> also `[5:16 PM] cipi: value doesn't matter, the problem to be solved is getting blocks on CHIPS, not making money`

[29-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> yeah, they are great for certain chains
I was just meaning that for the same cost of 1TH of those one could buy 1 S9, produce 14.5TH, and have $2300USD left over towards the next 16-18 months of electric

[29-Aug-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> sure, that will work üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I've said it 100 times over the last couple months, the only real issue with the CHIPS chain is that no one *wants* to mine it
And I've said nearly as many times, I can't see how changing the algo isn't going to change that

[29-Aug-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> let me remark that 'saying' things alone wont bring any blocks still üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> let me remark, once again, that blocks come from miners and when you tell the miners they need to purchase new equipment to mine it, they shut down their "old" stuff and begin to prepare for the "new" üôÇ

[29-Aug-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> miners are so confusing üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> lol

[29-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> oh come on. of the 4 (or was it 5) people participating in the last hour of discussion, 3 did something against the stuck chain or at least wanted to. while theres still one who had a lot to say despite refusing to help (for personal reasons that are not overly important to me, tbh)

[29-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> so i kind of wonder why the fuck you still keep on talking mate... it's hilarious

[29-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> chain was stuck?

[29-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> people moved, chain is moving again.

[29-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> dammit
