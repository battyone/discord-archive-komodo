[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I ran a private pool, rented my equihash rig (which was tiny) then rented ASICS to mine chips.... Someone was DDOSing the chips pools at the time, so i cleaned up .  Got lucky I guess.

[24-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> If anyone has an ASIC they're willing to mine CHIPS, with please pm me. I have a pool ready to go

[24-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I've been renting ASICs out of pocket for the last week to keep the network running üòê

[24-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> cause:effect

[24-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Please explain

[24-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> the network would be entirely stuck if not

[24-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> as soon as your GPU finds a block, the diff would lower and the profit switcher will come back and fuck the diff

[24-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> then leave again and stall the chain

[24-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> and thus causing the effect of it being non/less-profitable to mine causing the effect of dropping the diff next round causing the effect of raising the diff next round

[24-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it's circular and the fact that current markets spec for shit adds to it

[24-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> What do you suggest we do?

[24-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Let the chain stall for >50% of the time?

[24-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'd suggest you buy CHIPS and increase the price so people can afford to mine it

[24-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> a pseudo of 11 cents was good when the block reward was 25; when reward <1, not so much

[24-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> can't buy CHIPS if the network is stalled

[24-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> shitexchange.io broken again?

[24-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> How can I withdraw them?

[24-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> How are you even arguing this point

[24-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> keep them in the CEX bank util you sell them üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Why would anyone buy a coin that's network continually stalls

[24-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> We're fixing it now, but christ it *definitely* is a problem

[24-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `Why would anyone buy a coin that's network continually stalls` I dunno, why *do* people buy BTC and BCH? ü§î

[24-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> how are you fixing it, @Alright ?

[24-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> he's mining it with a rental

[24-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> SHossain pointed his ASICs at my pool, Robes offered to also üôå

[24-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> network unstuck

[24-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> good, now I don't have to go across town and turn power on to the sha room üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Don't understand why you turn profitable miners off

[24-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> because at $6200 BTC and outside temps of 100+F it's not "profitable" to run all of that for $200-300 a week

[24-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> even at $8200, it's not much better

[24-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> sha overhead is like a bajillion x that of GPUs, so I shut the whole room down to increase margins for a month or so

[24-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> want to sell me an s9?

[24-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> for the 1.2 BTC that I paid for it üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I guess I could give you the "friend discount" and let it go for 1.1 BTC üòõ

[24-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'd even make sure it was one of the ones that has 3 fully working boards

[26-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> docker-chipsd https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-chipsd-lightning

will add lightning to it in coming day(s), first attempt just failed with a `error: pathspec 'external/libbacktrace' did not match any file(s) known to git.` error.

going to zzzz....this hooked up with docker will be fun - hopefully get a bunch of the kmd discord able to participate in whatever you wanna do with users/testers.

[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> chipsd works.

[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> `/bin/sh: 1: ../libbacktrace/configure: not found` other relevant error.
good night!

[26-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @Mylo(KomodoPioneers) do this:

[26-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> ```cd external
git clone https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace
```

[26-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> There's something missing as submodule or something

[26-Jul-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> ok thx will do at some stage today, thanks!!

in docker so it's cool, needs tidying up then all ppl here can test relatively easily - once i can connect and open a channel.

[27-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> very nice

[27-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think 3 or 6 are needed

[27-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> ok then i show up on lnexplorer?

[27-Jul-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> you should. but i must say that the node that hosts lnexplorer has been buggy
