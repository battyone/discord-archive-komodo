[dscrd-chips] <Alright> It's a really interesting coin. Didn't quite understand the purpose of the emission schedule until recently.

[03-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> my first reaction was "what were they smoking when they thought of this?" now it's "damn, that's genius"

[dscrd-chips] <Soldat> Can you tell me more about barterDEX  bridge LN atomic swaps with CLTV atomic swaps via CHIPS ? @Alright

[04-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Soldat CHIPS is the only komodo ecosystem coin that has LN, so let's say you had LN BTC and did a BTC/CHIPS LN atomic swap, you can then trade that CHIPS for anything on barterdex.

[04-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Soldat> All right! All right! Thanks

[15-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we are working on demonstrating CC capabilities and the idea is some sort of player vs player card game. Something simple but fun to play would be good. The game can encode whatever ruleset and looking for some time tested game. One minimal example would be where two players each get the same denomination cards. then each turn they play a card, the higher ranked card wins the other card. each card would have money attached to it

[15-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the CHIPS tech would be used for the game play. CC for the enforcement of the ruleset

[15-Jul-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we might do a CHIPS hardfork to activate CC mode once we can get more confidence in the CC

[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Exciting ðŸ˜€

[15-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> "Two players and a pack of 52 cards are needed. The first player offers the second player a game of 52 pick-up (or 52 card pickup). If the second player accepts, the first player scatters the 52 cards over the floor and says "52 - pick up!". The second player's job is then to reassemble the pack of cards by picking them all up."

[15-Jul-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> LOL

[15-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think the game you described actually can be a good game

[15-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> very simple, yet strategic and maybe you can fire some statistical analysis at it too

[15-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> 2 players, each player gets a set of 52 cards. then each turn, both players play a card and the one with the highest card wins. the combination of cards determine the monetary win of that hand (?), and the value of cards are predetermined at the start

[15-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Hi guys. Might I suggest "Go Fish" from the list. 

Go Fish is best for 3-6 players, but it is possible for 2 to play. A standard 52 card deck is used. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player (7 each for 2 players). The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock.

The player to dealer's left starts. A turn consists of asking a specific player for a specific rank. For example, if it is my turn I might say: 'Mary, please give me your jacks'. The player who asks must already hold at least one card of the requested rank, so I must hold at least one jack to say this. If the player who was asked (Mary) has cards of the named rank (jacks in this case), she must giveÂ allÂ her cards of this rank to the player who asked for them. That player then gets another turn and may again ask any player for any rank already held by the asker.

If the person asked does not have any cards of the named rank, they say 'Go fish!'. The asker must then draw the top card of the undealt stock. If the drawn card is the rank asked for, the asker shows it and gets another turn. If the drawn card is not the rank asked for, the asker keeps it, but the turn now passes to the next player to the left.

As soon as a player collects a book of 4 cards of the same rank, this must be shown and discarded face down. The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.

[15-Jul-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the idea is to make a demo of how to use CC

cartblowing, hi or lower

[15-Jul-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> tossing in a game with complex rules will just make it harder to see the CC parts

[15-Jul-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> so the game I think is where you have two players agree to use X amount of funds to create N cards. maybe they need to be strict denominations or maybe note. And the cards "battle" with the more valuable card winning. I think that is simple as can be

[15-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> you can make it as versatile as you want, it adds to the odds of each of the 'battles'. it is actually cool, because if you manage to 'steal' a couple of high cards from your opponent, you can win big.

[15-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> use X amount of funds to create N _decks_ of cards maybe?

[15-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I will let others expand on the baseline gameplay

[15-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I think @jorian â€˜s idea is probably the simplest. Both players just turn one card and the highest card wins. If itâ€™s a tie, you turn the next card.? All other games seem as if theyâ€™d have too many if x happens... do a b c d e f etc

why not roll 2 or 3 dice, highest number wins
