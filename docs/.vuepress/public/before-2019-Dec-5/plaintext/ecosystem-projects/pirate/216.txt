[24-Oct-18 02:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is it possible to check transaction in epxlorer using opid ?

[24-Oct-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[24-Oct-18 02:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or at least at what block transaction was added ? 😃

[24-Oct-18 02:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the magic of not knowing is pretty cool to stay anon, but not so cool when you trade and you dont know where your package is 😃

[24-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can check the confirmation (or lack of) of a tx, but never the details

[24-Oct-18 02:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

in "settings" you can use "cli"
use that opid like
`z_getoperationstatus '["opid-xxx"]'`
