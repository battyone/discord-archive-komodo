[16-Oct-18 08:14 PM] Zach#9973
Yeah it said 100%

[16-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Zach#9973
I’m gonna restart my wallet and try again after I give it plenty of time to sync

[16-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Zach#9973
It worked after I did that so I guess maybe it wasnt synced fully like i thought

[17-Oct-18 12:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Everyone should.  A) It's free pirate, B) The emails are easily deleted and can help add to pirate exposure which C) Helps drive up awareness and usually price (Since it's a quality product).

hip hop pirate sounds like a concertina.

[17-Oct-18 12:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Although concertinas were never originally associated with "pirates"  They weren't invented until after Pirates had been sailing the seas.

How does pirate intend to switch to sapling addresses in the future if sprout to sapling transactions aren’t possible?

[17-Oct-18 04:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fork to allow one time T address transfer in order to switch over?

we need to fork to enable sapling anyway

[17-Oct-18 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the plan is for there to be a special rpc call you do that will be like z_mergetoaddress, or maybe it is just built into it, where it would do the last oldz -> tmptaddr, and tmptaddr -> new zaddr

{Reactions}

[17-Oct-18 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so on the blockchain there will be this flurry of the onetime used taddr and then all back to sapling z

[17-Oct-18 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to not leak info (by whether you have or havent converted), we might make it an automatic and mandatory process to sync to the new fork

Ronyi, is there a reason youre not using a stratum?

[17-Oct-18 11:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Their logos is likely far enough away from ours that we can make it work.  I have sent it to an attorney to review.

I just see SSL

[17-Oct-18 11:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I was under the impression a stratum is more fitting for mining, especialy with asics or NH, yes?

[17-Oct-18 11:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I could be wrong.  It happens 😛

SSL is just a way of connecting

[17-Oct-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "stratum" is the "middle-man" code between the miners and the daemon
There's only a handful of people that can make it work without using the stratum protocol

[17-Oct-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all nomp forks are using stratum

The ship looks like it’s floating on a subtle digital skull which could be enhanced and it is an excellent design. As for a logo it is much more balanced. Just another Point of view.
