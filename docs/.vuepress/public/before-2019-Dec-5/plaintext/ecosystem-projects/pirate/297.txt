was it too much ARRR at once? 't'was only 5k

50 vins

[10-Nov-18 09:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
does that mean i can;t send 5k in one go?

[10-Nov-18 09:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've done a merge yesterday

[10-Nov-18 09:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
what's the max then?

[10-Nov-18 09:40 PM] s0ftmachine#0669
Has anyone tried larger trades on Digitalprice? Like >100k Arrr?

[10-Nov-18 09:41 PM] s0ftmachine#0669
Does anyone know the limits for DP?

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it all depends on how big your utxo are

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
biggest ask: 0.50000000    102,060.00000000    51,030.00000000    127,013.28928489

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are all 0.0001, the 0.0050 is the biggest you can make

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are all 10000 PIRATE utxo, then you can make a 500,000 utxo

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
50 inputs

[10-Nov-18 09:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
just trying to move my mining funds

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each input is the same size proof

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
avg of ~55 per transaction

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
so max in my case would be ~2,750

[10-Nov-18 09:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
right?

[10-Nov-18 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
are you asking me what 55 * 50 is?

[10-Nov-18 09:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
nope. just confirming that my math is correct as in -> average over 50 (or average of all transactions??) transactions * 50 (no of transactions) = ARRR send limit

[10-Nov-18 09:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
trying to figure out the math that's all üòÅ

[10-Nov-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it depends on the exact 50 that are selected

[10-Nov-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
use 80% of the ave and it should work most of the time

[10-Nov-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
or just use z_mergetoaddress and let it do it automatic

[10-Nov-18 09:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've done that yesterday

[10-Nov-18 09:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
thanks for the 80% tip

[10-Nov-18 09:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok. got my max. is there a way to stop a transaction? or do i have to wait for it to fail? my 2nd attempt is bigger than my limit üòÇ

@Zanzarismo It's actually a nice growth especially in a bear market

[10-Nov-18 10:12 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I'm well into my second page of 50 transactions per page, and DP has been flawless. Deposits, withdrawls all of them have been seamless  and quick transactions. Thanks guys for the KMD pariring across the board.

[10-Nov-18 10:13 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

[10-Nov-18 10:13 PM] KSanJuan#9608
And a big thank you for the dumpers, you're all the best!

[10-Nov-18 10:13 PM] mrlynch#5735

[10-Nov-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
prices below nicehash mining couldnt really last for so long

[10-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
certainly not

[10-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
BTC is due to rise sooner than later

[10-Nov-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as the nicehash miners find out it is cheaper to buy on the exchange, then they would just do that. seems we just had that happen

[10-Nov-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and almost 5BTC volume today!

This might be a question for @jl777c i'm trying to duplicate the mining calculator here: https://dexstats.info/piratecalc.php and the equation I used to use for finding mining rewards for equihash coins was: ((my_hashrate / (diff*8192)) * 86400) * BlockReward = coins in 24 hours. If I modify the equation to multiplying diff by around 19 I get somewhat close but if difficulty goes substantially up or down it loses precision. After researching, this number that is multiplied by diff is called the 'work size' for the network. Does anyone know the proper work size to be using for this equation?         EDIT: Looks like the calculator on dexstats doesn't even use difficulty. It uses the following equation: (myhashrate/nethash)*((86400/blocktime)*BlockReward).

LAst reddit post summary: as expected the reddit post with JL debunking sapling misunderstanding went to reddit/cryptocurrency/controversial (many negative votes). On the bright side - 1.5k people read it and no negative comment ! :pirate:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9vx9yu/debunking_zcash_sapling_myth_of_leaking_info/

You're not cloud mining anymore on NH & using your own equipment @yorktronic yo?

[11-Nov-18 06:25 AM] yorktronic#2703
Not right now, I might again depending on price of rentals vs nethash / diff

[11-Nov-18 06:26 AM] yorktronic#2703
I am still mining with my hardware though yeah

is it just polly?

[11-Nov-18 07:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
@CiPhEr 
BlockReward = 256
(yourSol / networkSol * BlockReward *1440) = CoinsMinedPerDay

[11-Nov-18 07:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
that's the calculation on the minercalculator

[11-Nov-18 07:27 AM] at#4177
polly had problems i switched to other pool it just went down

dont know,  pirate daemon crashed, no clue why,  tty and debug.log had no info

[11-Nov-18 07:38 AM] jeezy#3408
just restarted it  and after sync its fine

[11-Nov-18 07:38 AM] CiPhEr#2091
@CHMEX Thanks! Yeah I just edited my post a bit ago as I figured it out, but what i'd really like to know is the network work size (otherwise known as the sol/block modifier) to multiply difficulty with in order to just use the equation ((my_hashrate / (diff*WorkSize)) * 86400) * BlockReward = coins in 24 hours. For KMD it is roughly 16, for horizen it is 8192

[11-Nov-18 07:39 AM] at#4177
@jeezy so is it the whole network?

[11-Nov-18 07:40 AM] jeezy#3408
I dont think so

[11-Nov-18 07:40 AM] jeezy#3408
feel free to join https://polly.chainstrike.io/stats  again

[11-Nov-18 07:40 AM] jeezy#3408
maybe theres some unknown bug that makes the daemon crash randomly

[11-Nov-18 07:40 AM] jeezy#3408
if other pools are also effected

[11-Nov-18 07:42 AM] at#4177
hm

[11-Nov-18 07:42 AM] jeezy#3408
we already found a block and payments also just got sent

[11-Nov-18 07:42 AM] jeezy#3408
looks like its back to normal

[11-Nov-18 07:42 AM] jeezy#3408
I will keep on monitoring it closely in case it crashes again

[11-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jeezy#3408
maybe it was just a random hickup
