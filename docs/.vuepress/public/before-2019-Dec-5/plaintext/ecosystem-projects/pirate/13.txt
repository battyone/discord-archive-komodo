[02-Sep-18 12:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me know if you guys need pool.pirate.black dns, and I can set that up for you 🙂

[02-Sep-18 12:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need to setup github.io webpage and point pirate.black to it

[02-Sep-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need someone to make a new BTT ANN for pirate. I can lock mine for historical reasons. 🙂

[02-Sep-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[02-Sep-18 12:31 PM] SHossain#0007
probably, giving this to someone experienced is a good idea

[02-Sep-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[02-Sep-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[02-Sep-18 12:32 PM] SHossain#0007

[02-Sep-18 12:32 PM] jorian#4555

[02-Sep-18 12:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I logged in to BTT after so long, just to make that ANN thread 😄

[02-Sep-18 12:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn't realise I should be using a new login for that 😄

[02-Sep-18 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[02-Sep-18 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i am using knomp

[02-Sep-18 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like just have to use custom assetchains.json and thats it

[02-Sep-18 12:51 PM] scubapanda#2485

[02-Sep-18 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
please edit and when it's OK/Ready, let me know. I'll make a new thread with new user

[02-Sep-18 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and will also make a simple github.io webpage for it.

[02-Sep-18 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and then link it to http://pirate.black

[02-Sep-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Knomp atually works, There is a bug in z-nomp where it will make invalid blocks on AC.

[02-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jorian#4555
i'm figuring it out now

[02-Sep-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Sep-18 01:09 PM] jorian#4555
any config.json tips? 😅

[02-Sep-18 01:09 PM] jorian#4555
oh hehe 😄

[02-Sep-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
first one goes in coins dir

[02-Sep-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
second one in pool_configs

[02-Sep-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a script in my Knomp that builds configs for all AC, but it uses assetchains.jsona nd PIRATE is not in that. SO I added it manually here.

[02-Sep-18 01:10 PM] jorian#4555
yeah i already changed all that to make it use PIRATE

[02-Sep-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
put the address to mine to and disable everything, so it just mines to the address, solo mine only. Private key does not need to be importe don deamon.

[02-Sep-18 01:11 PM] jorian#4555
ok, did that

[02-Sep-18 01:14 PM] jorian#4555
for redis, any additional setup than installing and running it?

[02-Sep-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just needs to be running

[02-Sep-18 01:17 PM] jorian#4555
so for the portal config

[02-Sep-18 01:17 PM] jorian#4555
should i change something?

[02-Sep-18 01:21 PM] SHossain#0007
`cp config_example.json config.json` no change needed

[02-Sep-18 01:21 PM] SHossain#0007
unless you want to change anything

[02-Sep-18 01:21 PM] jorian#4555
should be a pool_config, i think

[02-Sep-18 01:21 PM] SHossain#0007
exit from the terminal and try again perhaps? or use nodejs 8

[02-Sep-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like it incorrect format in one of the files

[02-Sep-18 01:22 PM] jorian#4555
yeah i see

[02-Sep-18 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
npm start, that's it?

[02-Sep-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep

[02-Sep-18 01:26 PM] jorian#4555
ok, and i guess i now need to connect to it?

[02-Sep-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, point a miner at the port you used.

[02-Sep-18 01:40 PM] jorian#4555

Does someone want to sell 20k @ 0.002 KMD?

[02-Sep-18 04:40 PM] SHossain#0007
i can sell

[02-Sep-18 07:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
When I read "# To send mined coins to a z address:", I understand that if I find a block, reward goes to a t-address ?

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
But it is also said there's no PIRATE t-address

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] zatJUM#9924
So where do rewards go?

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
coinbase must be t-addrs

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
other than that all is z

[02-Sep-18 07:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
so if I find a block, it should increase the value returned by "komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getbalance", right?

[02-Sep-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Sep-18 07:16 PM] zatJUM#9924
