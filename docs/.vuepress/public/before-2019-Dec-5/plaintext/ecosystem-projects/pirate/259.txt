Balls for depositing that much

[03-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Chewy#0565
Just information.  just checked and deposits back off or were only turned on for a few people.

[03-Nov-18 02:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
No, seems off again for all

[03-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Chewy#0565
I get up to make breakfast for my daughter and miss the 30 min window.  lol

[03-Nov-18 02:19 PM] zatJUM#9924
I haven't 😉

[03-Nov-18 02:32 PM] Chewy#0565
Yeah, no worries.  I would rather they do it this way instead of opening the gates and find there is a major problem.  Then everyone would scream bloody murder.

[03-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Flexatron#8809
Deposits are safu

Who keeps dumping ARRR at low low prices?

[03-Nov-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
people who can't math and want to reup their rentals?

[03-Nov-18 03:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well... to those ppl, not cool bro!

[03-Nov-18 03:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
Driving the price down when it had a nice swing upwards

[03-Nov-18 03:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
I'll keep paying rentals & power for the asic from my own pocket and HODL

[03-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Chewy#0565
no thing that trades moves in a straight line there be ups and downs.  Good decisions and bad.

[03-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dump and reup rentals with hash going up

[03-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They will get less mining rewards for more expensive prices

[03-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So once dumpers are gone price inevitably goes up 😃

[03-Nov-18 03:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Chewy that is correct, however i'll wait until dumpers empty their stashes for pennies because that's when the real/proper trading begins

[03-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Chewy#0565
Yup.

[03-Nov-18 03:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
Now if i can only find more equihash asics for sale 😂  they're all gone

[03-Nov-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's a safe bet that anyone dumping now is the same people that couldn't sell in OTC for .15 so they went to .14 then .13 then .12 then .11 then .10 then .09 just praying they got *something* on a regular daily (not caring if it was a loss or even keeping it as a low loss)

[03-Nov-18 03:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
Yup. Econ/finance 101 is a wonderful thing :)) just needs a bit of 3rd grade math to cover the basics

[03-Nov-18 03:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
Damn, only overpriced z9 minis on ebay 😡

[03-Nov-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Found a never used z9 mini I'm my area for $600. Maybe I should grab it?`
4x would be 2400, why not just get a new Z9 for 1900?

[03-Nov-18 03:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Where would you find a new z9 for 1900?

[03-Nov-18 03:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Where i am there's only 1 z9 for sale at aprox equivalent of 4000 usd

Fair enough, thought that was just for KMD.  I was wrong.

[03-Nov-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Haha.   Genie is like that.   If he slaps you it means he likes you.

[03-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Chewy#0565

You mean like #talk-mining and #talk-other-topics ?

[03-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Chewy#0565
Of course, but they should be under the pirate sub section so they don't clutter up the rest of the community

[03-Nov-18 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
a full z9 for $1994! these asic prices are coming down fast

🆒 

[03-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Chewy#0565
My feelings only.

[03-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Chewy#0565
Or should I say so the Pirate mining posts dont clutter up the rest of the community.

[03-Nov-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If pirate conversation in #talk-other-topics feels like it's 'clutter[ing] up the rest of the community', might I suggest #safespace ....

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 made a good point a few weeks ago.    Talking about troubleshooting and helping new pirates only strengthens the community, and the pirates coming for help 😃

[03-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad to keep the conversations here for now.

[03-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also, the KMD mining and offtopic channels are happy to talk Pirate 😃

You can suggest all you want.  That is the great part.  We all can until we are muted or banned.  :trollface:

[03-Nov-18 03:57 PM] Chewy#0565
Here is some more fuel for the fire.  Man I hate the term safespace.........

[03-Nov-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
muting me never stops me, it just stops *you* from seeing it :trollface:

[03-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Chewy#0565
Oh, I would never mute you.  Serious!  Your comments are gold

[03-Nov-18 03:58 PM] mrlynch#5735

The z9 mini I was getting excited about.

[03-Nov-18 04:12 PM] iAmLedger#8530
Any word if deposits and withdrawals are back up on dp?

[03-Nov-18 04:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
They're back. Just sneaked a deposit in

[03-Nov-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you were excited about buying a used mini that would be $120 overpriced if it were nib?

[03-Nov-18 04:20 PM] iAmLedger#8530
Well first off I do not mine. If anything I'm plankton in this sea. The space interests me and I've realized I dont know much at all. So I am here to learn and with the guidance of this community I feel I can learn a great deal and someday I will be able to pay it forward.

Anyway that is why I posted "there is a z9 mini in my area for $600" hoping to get some input from people and evaluating the situation from there.

[03-Nov-18 04:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A 25% tariff if you live in the US coupled with shopping costs are things to consider when buying, among other things.

[03-Nov-18 04:33 PM] iAmLedger#8530
Thank you @FishyGuts  i will definitely do more research on it.
