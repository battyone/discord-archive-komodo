Zcash is big, but still according to some data it's down 220 Msol in the last 5 days. Asics are hashing other coins 😃

[06-Oct-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810

Can someone put that photo above in the ZEN one maybe as well as Bitcoin Private?

[06-Oct-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will have to wait 20 minutes to get them up (10 mins between posts)

No they went 144.5

[06-Oct-18 06:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If they (any CoinX) went the lemming route, then marketing to their miners is going to be a waste, imo

[06-Oct-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For privacy moreso... but yes you're correct.

[06-Oct-18 06:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I do want to wait to get the privacy comparison graphics done before shilling to their communities

`Looks like Bitcoin privates is asic compatible still? `
ASICs are 200,9 any other K&N is GPU

[06-Oct-18 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085

For 100 different reasons, I'm not the one to be posting "come check out this coin" in any community outside of this one

@bishop You're completely right, you are completely free to post any price that screws the community as a whole that you so choose; I'm just curious as to *why* you choose that

it is splitting the spread

for a quick sale, not a bad idea to increase velocity

Buy my coins CG and mark them up

[06-Oct-18 06:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
and PS if you cant handle taco bell... you have previously undiagnosed colon problems already.  TB aint that bad 😄

[06-Oct-18 06:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
CG does not buy coins

[06-Oct-18 06:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He mines

[06-Oct-18 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bishop Pay my mining fees and I'll buy your coins all day long at the price 😉

[06-Oct-18 06:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What youre talking about is trading and I don't think he plays that game much.

[06-Oct-18 06:58 PM] bishop#9773
fair enough, then anyone that is selling coins above my ask should buy them up and offer them higher, no?

[06-Oct-18 06:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Someone will come along.

_is almost literally allin on PIRATE_

[06-Oct-18 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bishop if 0.22 is wholesaling, then you need a new manufacturer :abusedsmily:

[06-Oct-18 07:00 PM] bishop#9773
it's still at a double digit discount to where you're offering 😃

[06-Oct-18 07:01 PM] bishop#9773
It goes for anyone: if you are having success selling above my offer, buy mine up and resell it

[06-Oct-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
competition is good for the market

Genie's math: I can buy X for Y and sell X for 1.18Y. How much additional money did I make with minimal effort? :trollface:

[06-Oct-18 07:08 PM] bishop#9773

I wish I made 1/10th of what everyone seems to think I'm making 🙄

[06-Oct-18 07:10 PM] bishop#9773
I don't know your situation. I'm just reiterating if you have success selling higher than what you can buy them at, a rationale person would buy the cheaper thing and mark it up. That's all.

[06-Oct-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just reiterating that I'm but a small bit in the larger picture 😉

@polycryptoblog True enough, but what I meant is that beyond being my normal vocal self (whereby shouting *everything* I say through a megaphone), I've no real contribution to PIRATE as a project, so there's no reason why I *would be*  "remembered" as a "contributor"

There's a massive shortage of hash available on US side of NH vs demands

[06-Oct-18 08:10 PM] scubapanda#2485
Hashrate is back online.

[06-Oct-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@scubapanda what I mean is that the max available is less than 74M and one third of that goes to "fixed" orders; so, there's no real hash to be had compared to 130M that is within close range of "going price"

[06-Oct-18 08:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
130 wanted 49 avaiable
