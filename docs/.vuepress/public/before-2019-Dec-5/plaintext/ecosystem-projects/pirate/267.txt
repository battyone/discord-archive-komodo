age and volume stop you from getting robbed? Ever heard of Bernard Madoff?

@#pirate Just got our Pirate pool ☠️ up and tested.   Http://pirate.bcmonster.com Looking for miners!

[05-Nov-18 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh ever think that they have no volume because people are refusing to use them because they have no volume?
Be part of the solution, not part of the problem

No, age and trading volume are not guaranteed to be protected against robbery. But the younger the exchange, the higher the chance that it was created specifically for scam. Because they have no reputation. And nowadays a lot of exchanges are created specifically for this.  Like https://altex.exchange

Because people refuse to use them @discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh

[05-Nov-18 12:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every exchange starts a a small exchange

[05-Nov-18 12:47 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
I remember MTGOX. But this is a very muddy story in which the FBI is involved. And where there is a FBI, you will never know the truth 😃

[05-Nov-18 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Once upon a time, there was this coin that was a fork of zcash, and no one ever heard of it, so no one should trust it; it's called "Komodo"

[05-Nov-18 12:48 AM] KSanJuan#9608
You're such a bad ass @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  this place just would be as lively with out you. From OTC to exchange, both will forever exist side by side. Both will always incur some element of risk.

[05-Nov-18 12:50 AM] Exile13#4458
Forever

[05-Nov-18 12:50 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
But before KOMODO, jl777 created other coins . That's the one of the reason why I participate in KOMODO ICO in the very beginning

[05-Nov-18 12:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But before KOMODO, jl777 created other coins `
And no one heard of them before, so they shouldn't have trusted them or him, ever; right?

[05-Nov-18 12:52 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
No one heard ? )

[05-Nov-18 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you're afraid, say "I'm afraid"; don't make up some horseshit excuse

[05-Nov-18 12:54 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Binance was young and had no volume 14 months ago.

[05-Nov-18 12:54 AM] twistedmind#1523
hey computer genie, talk tough? put your money where your ai gf is and go on the exchange and use your massive wealth...i mean dust

[05-Nov-18 12:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Salty sea dogs today jeez.

[05-Nov-18 12:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
DigPri is reputable as far as I have known.  In working with them I see no reason to worry as of now.

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They are young yes.

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] Draeth#3300
@FishyGuts We need more rum!

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They have added erc20 support.   Without Vrsc they’d be no volume so it’s cool they afforded Verus that chance.

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] twistedmind#1523
i hear all this bs about scammers so the otc channel gets closed down the same time dust exchange digit goes live...talk about bs.

[05-Nov-18 12:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They’re excited to work with us and build their reputation.  The lead there has been open, honest and has gone the extra mile for Pirate.

[05-Nov-18 12:58 AM] twistedmind#1523

Using my name and avatar fooling people.

[05-Nov-18 12:58 AM] akibebi#2853
@FishyGuts we need a channel for OTCandies, and one for arguments...

btw a good-working OTC channel is needed indeed.

[05-Nov-18 12:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The volume on dig pri seems to be about equal with what OTC has experienced.

[05-Nov-18 12:59 AM] Draeth#3300
you should make a channel called "Salty Sea Dogs" for arguments

[05-Nov-18 12:59 AM] twistedmind#1523
computer genie claims to have all these massive arrr trades, talks shit to people

[05-Nov-18 12:59 AM] twistedmind#1523

OTC takes time and energy away from team functions.

[05-Nov-18 01:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He is.

I’ve got .5 BTC in buy and sell orders.

[05-Nov-18 01:01 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
did anyone make contact with https://tradeogre.com/markets ? They don't need verification too

[05-Nov-18 01:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The only challenge we habebwith DigPri is their deposits and withdraws and with a brand new coin and system, I’d say they’ve done well so far.

[05-Nov-18 01:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No lost funds yet.

[05-Nov-18 01:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh I did.   Tradogre has not responded.

[05-Nov-18 01:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Crex24 is the next listing on the dock

[05-Nov-18 01:02 AM] Draeth#3300
Crex24 is solid, i've used them for quite a while

[05-Nov-18 01:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As have I.  Good UX.

[05-Nov-18 01:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And it will get us on CMC.

[05-Nov-18 01:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
50-100x the volume of DigPri too. 👍

[05-Nov-18 01:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Look just because OTC channel is gone does not mean you guys can’t OTC trade.

[05-Nov-18 01:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We just don’t want to have an environment for scammers to exploit.

[05-Nov-18 01:04 AM] twistedmind#1523
i agree that volume needs to be on an exchange,,,,where are all the arrr gini's at helping the market reach this

Genie can only play one side of the market.   Alice or bob.

[05-Nov-18 01:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pretty sure he’s a Bob right now.

[05-Nov-18 01:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m playing both.   Buying low and selling high 😜

[05-Nov-18 01:05 AM] twistedmind#1523
what, this is not my first rodeo.

[05-Nov-18 01:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Meaning genie is only putting sell orders.

[05-Nov-18 01:05 AM] twistedmind#1523
lol

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pretty sure he’s not buying. He’s got a lot.

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] twistedmind#1523
i agree, he looks out for himself

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] twistedmind#1523
what about "teamwork"

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yep.  Numero uno!  
I’m buying because I don’t have all I want but I’m also keeping low end sell orders up to work the market.

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] twistedmind#1523
no "i" in team

[05-Nov-18 01:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He is dry and doesn’t hold hands.

Look at every single coin out there, there are always going to be people who only look out for themselves

[05-Nov-18 01:07 AM] twistedmind#1523
he is one of them

[05-Nov-18 01:08 AM] twistedmind#1523
he rubs a lot of people the wrong way

[05-Nov-18 01:08 AM] house#8741
why you got your panties all twisted over genie @twistedmind

[05-Nov-18 01:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Contrary to popular belief. He’s actually very helpful and helps more than he hurts.

[05-Nov-18 01:08 AM] twistedmind#1523

[05-Nov-18 01:09 AM] twistedmind#1523

Hey I know I saw comments earlier about spreading the mining to other pools to help balance things out. I was about to switch to arrr.pool but noticed there are 0 miners on there now, what happened?

[05-Nov-18 01:10 AM] twistedmind#1523
and you know what they say about small fingers

[05-Nov-18 01:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Whoever is mining to the address `zcDvnVLLoCsmuDDsQEea8AM4vFFjHQAPUi` on http://minethepiratechain.black. You're mining to an invalid address. I suggest you change this immediately.

I never claim anything more than "some", "a bit", or "a few"and yet 6 months later, I'm still waiting for you to sign a message with the 1M+ KMD account you claim to have....
So, I'm not sure what delusions you have about who isn't backing what.....
