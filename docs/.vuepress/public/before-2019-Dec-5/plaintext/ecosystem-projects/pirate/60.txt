The BTCT thread should.  Who has the excel sheet for the coin emissions?  @magic could use that.

[27-Sep-18 08:15 AM] Talo#5450
hi all would like to buy 10k pirates offer 400 kmd

[27-Sep-18 08:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So.    Serious question....   
Who here would donate a z9 mining pirate for 24 hours for a rig giveaway exposure contest?

I am putting all 10 of my rigs up.  9 minis and a big.   
24 hours.  5 winners.

Any additional z9s will be distributed evenly amongst the winners or perhaps I will add more to the winners list.  

The last time I did this for KMD it garnered 77k interactions.

DM me with the number of rigs you would donate to this cause for 24 hours.   
Ayeaye thank you.

Pirate is a 100% private coin. It ONLY does Zk-Snark transactions, so all are invisible on blockchain but requires running a full node. It is a coin built from Komodo just like other project chains. And it also has dPoW through Komodo so its entire blockchain is protected and notarized by bitcoin. Which jl777 mentions makes it the most secure and private blockchain in the world. @Mische

[27-Sep-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but all at once

I could have never imagined that a community project started could get so serious in such short time and surpass @KomodoPlatform 
It's a good fact now that we seen $PIRATE secured by more mining power than @KomodoPlatform in last 24 hours.
