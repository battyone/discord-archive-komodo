[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> > there's money in staging that kind of thing?
since when to people need money as motivation to do something?

[14-Nov-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Since the invention of money?

[14-Nov-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> *as the sole motivation

[14-Nov-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Greed is a powerfull motivator. 99.9% of the miners are motivated by greed. People give up personal information for a chance of <fill in you vice>: greed.

[14-Nov-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> ` 99.9% of the miners are motivated by greed.`
more like 1%, the rest are more motivated by laziness (greed would actually have them solo mining)

[14-Nov-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> greed doesn't give away 1-3% of your total income just to save a small amount of time in setting up a miner

[14-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Indeed, laziness is an even more powerfull motivator... People like easy. Set-and-forget.

[14-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> _often uses his personal hash in public pools because he's too lazy to run a local one_

[14-Nov-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> my point is/was that no one needs getting paid as a sole motivator 
there's thousands of videos of people faking shit on youtube for no other reason than they can (or they want to see the reactions of people that don't know it's fake)

[14-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝕲𝖎𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖍 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝕻𝖔𝖜𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕸𝖔𝖓𝖐𝖊𝖞> money for women, money for power, money for drugs, money for time. it's still money. maybe not 100% of motivation but certainly enough for most. what is poker without a stake, what is life without a gamble? Money is the transfer of energy
