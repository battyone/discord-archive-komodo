@Hermes Vosk did a tear down on one because it stopped working after a week.

[28-Sep-18 01:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Customer Service wouldn't help....

[28-Sep-18 01:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And they actually sent him a miner that they had built for a customer too.... So ordering from them seems sketchy.,

[28-Sep-18 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
per hash, it's ~ $4300 more than buying 180k worth of minis

[28-Sep-18 01:47 AM] bishop#9773
43MSol?!

[28-Sep-18 01:49 AM] Hermes#6934
It was on 19K now is 15K went down with the price since last weekend after Vosks review lol

[28-Sep-18 01:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
19k wasn't a good price for 180k sols when minis were $100 higher 😕

[28-Sep-18 01:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Good evening everyone,
If you don't know me by now, well hello, my name is FishyGuts.   People call me Ryan but Fishy will work here.  
I was reached out to by a team member to get in touch with JL777 about directing a marketing effort.    
We initially talked about me doing this full time and I honestly believe that it's not a one man job and besides that, I have a fantastic day job.  
I have spent 20 years in mortgage finance and sales doing literally every job in the book from mailroom grunt to Owner.  
I currently market to brokers and do investment consulting for lenders.   
I don't think JL777 was looking to replace my current income and again, I don't think this is a one man, or a secret job.   
You all are my best resource for marketing material!!!
So yesterday morning JL and I came to an agreement and we want to see PIRATE at #50 on CMC so lets get going!!!

Introduction aside... lets get started.   
I've got the Twitter and reddit setup.   Telegram has been setup as well by who... @Acura ?   Can you forward the login details to Regnar?

[28-Sep-18 01:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have created a Trello board for Marketing and Social Media.   
I don't want to have this as just an inside job.  I think the hive mind of the people here will bring fantastic ideas to the table as well as fine tune existing ones.  
Community members will be able to view and comment here.   Developers and Ambassadors will be able to add and comment on cards.  

Just like PIRATE was born out of drive, time and effort, I do want the marketing to be in the same fashion.   

We can't stop the community from making great content about this.   
What we can do is provide media kits, information and reach.     
I have enlisted @Regnar which many of you know and @Senda to help with art and design for things like releases, infographics and banner ads.   I have other trusted helpers and advisors that I will also be bringing to help the PIRATE project as time goes on.   If you want to participate, just let me know.

That said, this can still be a 100% community effort, as I am only one man and we would be a fool to think one man can handle a task this monumental or a coin with this much momentum.   
Thanks for reading.

Just FYI 😃   Maybe I'll call it the Kraken instead.

I can get like 10-25 youtubers or i guess... "influnecers" to create content about it... Maybe.

yeah

[28-Sep-18 02:10 AM] Llama#1330
we've talked before

[28-Sep-18 02:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Cool.    

Do they want to create content or do they need direction?   We can provide both.

[28-Sep-18 02:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah about Commercium.

[28-Sep-18 02:10 AM] wookie#7663
@FishyGuts I'd like to chip in and help in whatever way I can. First off, if my logo submission doesn't get selected as a logo, I offer it up for use in any way of publicizing Pirate!

[28-Sep-18 02:10 AM] Llama#1330
I haven't talked to them yet, but I know a lot of them want to be paid :/

[28-Sep-18 02:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They had no budget for that stuff.

[28-Sep-18 02:11 AM] Llama#1330
I could do some convincing though for a few

[28-Sep-18 02:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a budget.

[28-Sep-18 02:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s not big but it’s there.

[28-Sep-18 02:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will dole out paid content based on the budget.

[28-Sep-18 02:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s really just the money JL is offering to do this that I’m going to be putting back into the marketing.   Site integration.  Reasonable Listing fees and such.

[28-Sep-18 02:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Like I said, I have a good day job. 😜🐙

[28-Sep-18 02:12 AM] Llama#1330
there are a lot of different approaches we could take on the marketing side

[28-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And honestly... we will take them all... with a homogenous message.

[28-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There are about 8 of us in a chat hammering that out.

[28-Sep-18 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Once we have a fluent homogenous message, the community is free to take it and do what they wish.

[28-Sep-18 02:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
A PIRATE code aka mission statement

[28-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Also for everyone here, if you are interested in helping with marketing, or have ideas for adoption, exchanges to list on, influencers to work with, logo designs, website designs, apps, whatever, come to the #deleted-channel  channel and help us out!

[28-Sep-18 02:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Voskcoin, SonofaTech, TheTechnicals are some good mining channels

[28-Sep-18 02:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will put your ideas on Trello.   We will also have a public board anyone can put ideas on.

[28-Sep-18 02:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ve already reached out to Vosk last night.  He and I talked about another project in the past and I think he would Love pirate.   I’ll add sonofatech and the technicals to the list.  I also have boxminkng and mineyourbiz I want to reach out to.  
Is anyone here friends with those mentioned?   Have them hit me up.

[28-Sep-18 02:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks for the submissions @wookie

[28-Sep-18 02:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@NutellaLicka are you able to send @Senda that red x used in your logo?

[28-Sep-18 02:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I want that imagery on a graphic I want to create.

[28-Sep-18 02:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
As soon as I get home in an hour or two, sure thing!

[28-Sep-18 02:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is it your image?   We may use it as a default for bulletpoints and infographics.

[28-Sep-18 02:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No rush.  Thanks.

[28-Sep-18 02:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there anyone here well versed in SEO?

[28-Sep-18 02:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We could use someone for insights and help with his.

Where can you get pirate? Is it mineable?

[28-Sep-18 02:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes piratepool.io or pirate.komodopool.xyz

[28-Sep-18 02:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
First thing to do is get a decent site up,  since GitHub is only static pages I'll look for a decent HTML template

[28-Sep-18 02:42 AM] Don King#8901
The PIRATE meme is incredibly powerful, everyone gets it, it's fun and can go viral very easily

[28-Sep-18 02:46 AM] jspook16#3059
Gpu?

[28-Sep-18 02:48 AM] bishop#9773
not really unless you have a massive farm

For marketing purposes

[28-Sep-18 03:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085

I went for a tavern name for the board.  😃

[28-Sep-18 03:20 AM] Redbeard#8343
So you are Robert Stroud? That’s a good pirate name.

[28-Sep-18 03:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
