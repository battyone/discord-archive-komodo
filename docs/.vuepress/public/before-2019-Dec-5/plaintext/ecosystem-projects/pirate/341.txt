To start mining i should just run ./komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT setgenerate true

[24-Nov-18 08:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
Right?

Hey guys, I really like ARRR and think that it is a great idea. I did have a couple of questions that I have been thinking about. Maybe someone has answered these already. Say you send ARRR to someone and they say that they never received it. How can you verify the TID if the addresses are hidden? Is that something that sapling will help with? And also, you have to give your address to someone to send them some. Now it is not private. I understand that the chain does not display addresses or balances, and you could just make another address. But will there ever be just a way to use a qr code, so that you never have to give out your address? This eliminates typos also, imo. Thanks guys. $ARRR ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüåõ

[25-Nov-18 11:00 AM] dokrates#8987
i only can mine pirate with asics?

[25-Nov-18 11:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
@dokrates you can mine with gpu rigs as well but the return won't be great

[25-Nov-18 11:03 AM] dokrates#8987
oh, what a pity

[25-Nov-18 11:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
A 1080ti will probably get you aprox 1.5 ARRR / day

[25-Nov-18 11:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
But you can always buy on digitalprice

[25-Nov-18 11:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
Use the ref link in the pinned messages. The proceeds from refs go towards the project

[25-Nov-18 11:09 AM] dokrates#8987
thanks, i bought a big amount weeks ago, and keep it stored

[25-Nov-18 11:09 AM] dokrates#8987
but just wanted to know if gpu mining if profitable

[25-Nov-18 11:10 AM] dokrates#8987
i see it isn't 1.5arrr each day is very low

[25-Nov-18 11:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
You might be better off buying asics

[25-Nov-18 11:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
Z9minis are cheaper than 1080ti's now

[25-Nov-18 11:19 AM] dokrates#8987
how much they cost?

[25-Nov-18 11:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
Depends where you are in the world. They're a bit more expensive in EU

[25-Nov-18 11:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
But you can still find good deals. Stay away from people that want payment in crypto though. High risk of being scammed.

[25-Nov-18 11:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
Unless you actually meet with them, see and test the asic before departing with your funds

[25-Nov-18 11:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ @KNOX @jl777c @Alright do we have an explorer for RKT? I get a 502 bad gw on rocket.explorer.dexstats.info

[25-Nov-18 11:25 AM] dokrates#8987
thanks

[25-Nov-18 11:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
No worries  @dokrates if you have ebay where you are have a look there first. Or if you have $$$ it might be better to buy directly from bitmain or innosilicon. Bitmain doesn't make z9m's anymore though so you'd have to get the big'uns

[25-Nov-18 11:29 AM] mrlynch#5735
Just checked, bitmain doesn't sell equihash asics anymore. Maybe they're bringing a new model ü§î

[25-Nov-18 12:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
Looks like the currwnt explorer can not deal with sapling activation. Also the vrsc is not working anymore.
I believe the indexes are not ok

Patch for VRSC's indexes (addressindex, spentindex, etc.) ... Just backport of commit https://github.com/jl777/komodo/commit/c38ce00f9c4db8ed22e2837bf0f131efb3eea07b from Komodo FSM branch. Maybe useful if somebody needs working indexes in VRSC right now.

a zmigrate dapp that automatically converts all sprout to sapling, capped at 1000 (for now) using onetime use taddr is in ~/komodo/src/cc/dapps

[25-Nov-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use the makedapps script in that dir to build it

[25-Nov-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you pass in the coin name and a sprout addr and it will migrate all the funds automatically. it will take a while
