[16-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if it starts with 'zs' it is a sapling address

[17-Dec-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[18-Dec-18 05:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have Pirate we can help you migrate your funds from a zc to a zs address.

[18-Dec-18 07:58 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074

 Paid: 3661.66881044

[18-Dec-18 07:59 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
this is what is paid to me according to the pool but i see only 500 in my wallet

[18-Dec-18 08:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is your wallet synced? Did you put the right zaddr in there?

[18-Dec-18 09:25 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
yeah

[18-Dec-18 09:25 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
now its ok

[18-Dec-18 09:26 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
i cant move my funds from a old address

[18-Dec-18 09:27 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074

[18-Dec-18 09:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have a read of this guide. You'll have to transfer the specific amount from your sprout address to a taddr than to a sapling address

[18-Dec-18 09:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You'll want to create a UTXO in your sprout wallet (send 1000 to yourself to do this) then send that exact amount through the wallets minus the transaction fee of 0.0001

[18-Dec-18 09:30 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
is there anyway to do this with in the wallet?

[18-Dec-18 09:30 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
or only cli?

[18-Dec-18 09:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe you can use the CLI functionality in the wallet, but you will need to make a taddr using CLI as well

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
yeah itried to do it

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe there is a zMigrate GUI coming out in the next week

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
with in the wallet

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
ok

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
i can wait for that

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074
its propably better

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you join the Official Pirate discord, they have a z-migrate help channel as well

https://discord.gg/uWxEn5j

[18-Dec-18 09:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, if you're mining, you can just create a new zS(sapling) address and start mining to it with a pool that supports it

[18-Dec-18 09:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
such as https://minethechains.com

[18-Dec-18 09:36 AM] AΛΛBLΛCK#4074

Hello, I just started mining pirate. The worker stats page shows I got paid 61 pirate.  How long does it take to transfer to Agama wallet? Thank you.

[30-Dec-18 05:53 PM] Friskerbiscuit#6036
installed new agama wallet, when tryin to sync it gave me a red triangle that when I clicked on it, it said pirate is down? am I missing something

[30-Dec-18 06:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If your balance is showing in the paid section of the pool, you'd expect to have the balance under 5 minutes, if that. It shouldnt be long at all. 
Also, have you tried restarting agama?

[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> Ahoy everyone !

Once again, the time has come to call for all hands on deck! We're looking to raise coin for  new exchange listings.  Starting with a * top 100* exchange with just over $6.5 Million daily adjusted USD volume. 

That exchange is Mercatox and is currently #68 on CMC
The listing fee is 3.0 BTC for the BTC trading pair,
3.5 BTC for BTC.+ ETH trading pairs.

There is currently 0.75 in hand to go toward the listing from the previous fund raising for Crex24. Thank you again to those donors, it's giving us a wonderful start towards this goal and opportunity.

We specifically would like to raise BTC and KMD (liquidity) and you can send your donations to the following addresses. 

Mercatox Fee Donation KMD 
 RTGzrgjXtZMgmqfvMYRiDSmn5ZT6XWVjuc 

Mercatox Fee Donation BTC: 
 3KSTg53WurhFUYTKVDstxCUfqzrRQ84i22 


Treasure  Benefits of listing with Mercatox
Liquidity + New Users
A much needed Exchange API for Plugins + Bots
Closer to CMC listing
Another Milestone as a project (maturity), important for the top 20 exchanges to see. 

Treasure Additional Funds
As before any additional funds that are raised will  go to the next exchange listing.  We also have the chance to list with Crypto-bridge for 2.5 BTC after Mercatox. 

Explorer Links to fundraiser accounts

KMD: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RTGzrgjXtZMgmqfvMYRiDSmn5ZT6XWVjuc

BTC: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3KSTg53WurhFUYTKVDstxCUfqzrRQ84i22

If anyone has additional questions please discuss in #exchanges in the official pirate discord!

We're looking forward to this step forward and hope you are too!

You can point your miners to https://minethechains.com to the kmd port (5000/5100)

Let's get listed, mateys! Arrr!

[08-Jan-19 12:59 AM] Billy Bob Bagholder#0049
Hey everyone. I’ve been very impressed with what I’ve seen so far researching ARRR. I’ve got the following questions that I’d be grateful for responses for:
1.    What are you most excited for on the roadmap?
2.    Is TORtuga still on track for Q1 this year?
3.    Are smart contracts possible since Crypto-Conditions required transparent transactions?
4.    What is the current block reward, and how/when does it reduce (halving every 100 days for example)?
Thanks a lot!

Hello all, I have just joined this group and read many older posts.
Going to ask this question possibly again..
New Agama install v0.32a-beta
I have a zs1 address.
I have been mining for a couple days and have 305.xxx in my wallet.
Q: do I need to migrate address?
Q: who buys ARRR coin here?
Q: Is Digital IO the only exchange online that supports ARRR coin?
Also
Thanks
This project looks really good and I can't wait to see where it goes ..

[09-Jan-19 12:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@JBOARD 
1. Nope, if you have a sapling (Zs) address, you're fine. If you had a zC address, you'd have to migrate. 
2. There is an otc channel over at the official pirate discord, also on the exchange.
3. It currently is, they were the first exchange to implement z-only transactions, which is a big deal. Many other exchanges refused to do it, or did not have the expertise to. 
You can find the official discord at https://discord.gg/PmW4Rh for more information!
