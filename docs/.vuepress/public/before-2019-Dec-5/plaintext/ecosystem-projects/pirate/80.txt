Anyone trying to sell Pirate to a trusted buyer? I'm looking to buy with USD through PayPal, if anyone is interested in dumping their bag for some cash...

I just found out that the 15 for 777 swap is over, so now I'm on the hunt

[28-Sep-18 06:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
In case you haven't stopped by #deleted-channel I posted this a little bit ago.  

:realpirate: VVV :realpirate: 
Good morning everyone (for me), 
The Captains are overwhelmed with the support and participation in the latest giveaway.   That fact that you trusted us with our "ETH BOT" style giveaway speaks volumes to the community and those who have setup this project.

Unfortunately, we are officially closing the entries for this contest.
If you have any deposits out there hanging, Nabob has been keeping a running list and will review the Discord history.
If you already have sent or this morning said you were syncing, we have your name.
Cryptoavenger will be processing the remaining exchanges once Nabob is done.


But fear not mateys... we are putting together a new raffle to be posted within 24 hours.
This raffle will be a chance for you to commandeer my mining rigs for 24 hours.   That's right, You're going to win 2 - Z9 minis hashing away to your wallet for 24 hours.    One lucky captain will get one mini and one big Z9.   Stay tuned for details on how to enter this contest later today.
 This giveaway will likely be anywhere from 500-1000 Pirate per winner depending on the Network Hash rate.

As a hint, you will want to have an active Youtube account and Twitter account to participate.

I will be back soon me heartys as soon as I finish wrangling this Kraken.

[28-Sep-18 08:01 PM] joe2x4#5987
Commandeering a mining rig is genius. Not sure about the YouTube Twitter requirement. Are you trying to exclude jl777 and other landlubbers from the contest?

[28-Sep-18 08:03 PM] joe2x4#5987
How could the pirate acquire the ship so cheaply? Because it was on sail.

[28-Sep-18 08:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
Agree for the youtube requirement, but I understand: it's marketing. Why not include peertube? It's decentralized (not like youtube 😉 ) https://peertube.social/about/peertube

When sending via the z_sendmany command, how long is it taking for people to send their coins?

[28-Sep-18 10:36 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
My CLI seems to hang up when I enter the command

[28-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Decker#3767
Depends of number of inputs ... one vin - ~1 min ...

[28-Sep-18 10:39 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Will that help?

[28-Sep-18 11:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Awesome, thanks. So having more UTXO's will increase the transaction time?
