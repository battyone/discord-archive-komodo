[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> hi, after doing
Linux

git clone https://github.com/PirateNetwork/pirate --branch beta --single-branch
cd pirate
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use; -j$(nproc) for all threads available
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
# This can take some time.

do i have to do autogen and then make, or what?

[22-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Nov-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> thanks, and does it have simplewallet or do i need to download a wallet seperately from the site like sevenseas?

[22-Nov-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> it runs like any other daemon, the wallet.dat will be in `~/.komodo/PIRATE`

[22-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> i only know CN coins so ima have to put on my big boy pants for this one

[22-Nov-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> other than adding `-ac_name=PIRATE` to your cli commands (because the daemon can run many runtime forks for different chains) it's the same type of cli and most of the same commands as most folks are used to
the `help` in cli works the same too

[22-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> > the help in cli works the same too
lmao. thanks again

[22-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> fwiw, I didn't mean that sarcastically, but that `help` lists all of the functions and then `help function` gives details and example

[22-Nov-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> @Chaloom yo man, I know you're fairly new to the markets and everything. But don't worry bro. This is totally normal behavior. Try not to let it get you too emotional. Logic will prevail. BTC just bounced from support. We have a multi-Generational bottom now finalized. ARRR simply retraced back to test the previously broken resistance, which is now support. TOTALLY NORMAL. Everything is fine.

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> ``either I need less Scotch or you need more, I see 2 yellow lines``
if you drink more Scotch, the 2 lines will either become 1 or 4

[22-Nov-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> could help, could make things worse. my bet is that it'll help lol

Optional privacy is like pulling out. In theory it works every time when done perfectly, but you probably aren't doing it perfectly.

[dscrd-prt] <SatoriNakamoto> hey, i couldn't find a support channel so i'll just drop this here- any help on this error on ubuntu 18.04? it's relatively fresh install and i followed the instructions on github:

EDIT: this was fixed with a fresh install of ubuntu. i had watched non-pirate porn on the previous installations which is probably why it didn't work.
