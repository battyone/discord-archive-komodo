[dscrd-prt] <𝕲𝖎𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖍 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝕻𝖔𝖜𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕸𝖔𝖓𝖐𝖊𝖞> ARRRtomicDEX is basically just the trading pairs tied to ARRR? It's not a different DEX, right?

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @kaks PO does not run on andriod 😛

[13-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> he asked wallet in general 😛

[13-Nov-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> So I know blockchain gaming is kind of a hit or miss, but is it out of the realm of possibility to create a blackjack game that runs on Pirate?

[13-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> My plan would be to operate a small casino essentially, but a physical casino, not online

[13-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> we are moooning!

[13-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> With crypto laws being in the grey area, it's not illegal

[13-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I've been to these cyber hubs where people gamble with crypto in the hood

[13-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Some of them are like bodegas or pop up shops

[13-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @BlackMarket see #cafe

[13-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> glad to be a kmd maximalist rn

[13-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @BlackMarket you could make a single player game, but without using viewing keys, I'm not sure how you could make multi-player auditable

[13-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> welcome back @Tek

[13-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Right so running of komodo would probably be a better idea, I was thinking bitcoin, but when you go to cash out, I want the computer to print a paper wallet, that can be redeemed at the ATM

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> The BTC block time is too high

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> check out bch too

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> BTC/BCH sux in 1000 ways

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Would take an hour to cash out your ticket and move to the next machine

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> much better tools to dev what you want than on BTC

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> btc is heading for the grave

[13-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> and they dont even realise

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> So yeah what I'm thinking is have it operate on komodo, then when your finally done gambling, an atomic swap will print you a BTC paper wallet

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> id rather get payouts in bch dash xmr than btc

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> but thats just me

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> "Final cashout" function that way you can hit the BTC atm and leave with cash

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> i guess

[13-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Well the end goal is for them to leave with 20s or 100s

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Like an actual casino

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> _will never play if it's BTC cashout_

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> same here tbh

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> The only ATMs that I have seen which support the cash function are bitcoin atms

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> im thinking using btc in your case is going to give trouble

[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> So unless you wanna design a new ATM

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> why care about fiat ATMs?

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> ive seen atm supporting many coins

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Because it's a casino

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> can you explain @Acura ?

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> up or down?

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> People dont want to leave with crypto they want to leave with cash

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> are you sure

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> i rather take crypto

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> support the use of a crypto you believe in as currency and fek fiat

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `i rather take crypto` i second that

[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> And the average person who knows nothing about crypto wants cold hard cash when they walk out the door

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> you should give the option for both

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> cause if its a fiat - walk out - casino

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> They dont care how the computer system works, or what currency it is, they want to gamble

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> im not interested

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Im talking about the general public

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `People dont want to leave with crypto they want to leave with cash`
then help the space by being be a vehicle for change

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> 😂😂😂😂

[13-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Ok the nightclub will accept crypto payments for drinks

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> That way they can gamble and drink eith BTC komodo pirate whatever 😂

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> as long as people keep cratering to fiat enslavement, crypto will remain lacking utility

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> if you go for fiat cash out you are just another casino

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> how will you compete?

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Acura> @mrlynch we are over the Ichi Cloud which is bullish.

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> if you focus on crypto cash out. you attract a crowd

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> if you focus on "just casino"

[13-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> you have competition

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> thats way ahead of ya

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Crypto casino

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> you said fiat cash out

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> thats not crypto casion

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> I'm trying to run a night club with like 4 blackjack machines

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Not re inventing the wheel here

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Just want to get around state laws

[13-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> ah

[13-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> How cool would if you had a chip that contained your crypto holdings that your gambling with

[13-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> You put money into the atm, and it spits out a chip, loaded with whatever denomination you put

[13-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> as long as you provide only fiat out options, its just another casino

[13-Nov-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> cause like you said the general public does not care how it works

[13-Nov-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `How cool would if you had a chip that contained your crypto holdings that your gambling with`
Much cooler than if I had to sync the how many GB now BTC chain to cash out

[13-Nov-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <BlackMarket> Well, if they can gamble with their chip wallet, and buy drinks with it, they dont need to cash out
