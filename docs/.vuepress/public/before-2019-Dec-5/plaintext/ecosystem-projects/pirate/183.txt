I just started mining pirate and have my first reward paid, but for some reason, I can't see the transaction in my wallet or from explorer

[19-Oct-18 02:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
do you have the coins @leecrypto

[19-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
most private chain means you wont ever see your coins on the explorer, neither will anybody else

[19-Oct-18 02:19 PM] leecrypto#1752
But I won't see them on agama

[19-Oct-18 02:20 PM] leecrypto#1752
@CryptoNinjaa I haven't seen them.

[19-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Zach#9973
It takes a little while for them to show up in your wallet after they are paid

[19-Oct-18 02:23 PM] leecrypto#1752
About how long @Zach ?

[19-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Zach#9973
45 min to an hour, it varies

[19-Oct-18 02:24 PM] penguin#0544

The z txs are quite intensive so as Zach says give it a bit of time and im sure yours is on its way from the pool etc. When you get the coins in your wallet it is correct to see no TX data at all thats just how private it is. 👍 @leecrypto

[19-Oct-18 02:29 PM] leecrypto#1752
Also, am curious, how many coins are guys averaging at 50k sol/s per day?

[19-Oct-18 02:29 PM] penguin#0544
a bit over 220

[19-Oct-18 02:30 PM] penguin#0544
22k = 110 approx

[19-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Yourhash/nethash) x 1440 x 256

[19-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Roughly

[19-Oct-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm unwavering in the belief that if any P2P network need to bootstrap the contents it carries, then there's something wrong with the network or the client (be it in this space or not)

[19-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Surprised anyone is OTC’ing with nicehash prices

[19-Oct-18 02:48 PM] 0x03#8822

Unless nicehash lies

[19-Oct-18 02:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then who knows

[19-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 by that logic, why does anyone buy BTC when they could spend $2M mining and make $30M?

[19-Oct-18 02:50 PM] 0x03#8822
are you bored rn, genie?

[19-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[19-Oct-18 02:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mining prices from nicehash works out to about .06kmd

If you order rock bottom and babysit your order 24/7

[19-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
NH concept is great, until some dick decides he's willing to pay 0.07 BTC for unlimited and eats all the hash and you get none

[19-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
Hi, has anybody setup Awesome Miner, so that the ARRR coin displays with ASIC mining?

[19-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never used it before, so you can have your hash taken from you at any time?

[19-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not locked in for what you pay for?

[19-Oct-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 only "guaranteed" if you pay "fixed" premium price, otherwise you're slave to an auction system

[19-Oct-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone is free to outbid you for x hash

[19-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What’s their typical fixed premium?

[19-Oct-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a funky setup for fixed base on 25% of total hash and x% of existing orders and size of your order

[19-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$33.24 for 0.1 MSol is what’s currently listed on their equihash price on the main page

[19-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do you rent out your rigs?

[19-Oct-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, too much opportunity for me doing solo mining

[19-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Show us your farm, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[19-Oct-18 02:58 PM] 0x03#8822

how many miners is considered a farm?

[19-Oct-18 03:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Grass-powered z9 megas

[19-Oct-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn 4units or 500 units or 5000 units, depends on who you ask

[19-Oct-18 03:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@snowdamn when the police start knocking your door down thinking you are growing something and not mining

@snowdamn imo, it depends on the user's perspective of operation, I know guys that have 20 rigs that I still consider "hobby miners" and ones that have 15 that I consider a "small farm"

[19-Oct-18 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto only 1? :trollface:

[19-Oct-18 03:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so, it's not what the hash can do for you, but what you can do with your hash? 😀

[19-Oct-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more what you *want* to do than *can*

[19-Oct-18 03:05 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@WeyezOD appreciate the support haha and welcome 😄 The negative pushback from my YT community when I cover anything that is not GPU mineable is certainly frustrating. Surprised at how many downvotes the video has received

@VoskCoin As soon as you say the word "Komodo" expect downvotes 😛

The heavens could open up, 4000 planets align to spell out "Komodo", and it still would be dismissed 😦

@VoskCoin then Verus should be rather agreeable I would think

I know im in the Pirate channel in komodos discord but @VoskCoin if you have not yet looked at Verus coin as an option for mining it would be cool for you tho check that out, I think majority of your subs that GPU mine would like it

@VoskCoin I realize I'm biased, in no small part, but if you look at any "rankings" or topics of conversation that Komodo fits in (from security, to PoS, to DEX) and count the percentage of times that Komodo even gets a mention, much less a "seat at the table", you'll see it's a very small number (even at things that Komodo is the first or best at)
