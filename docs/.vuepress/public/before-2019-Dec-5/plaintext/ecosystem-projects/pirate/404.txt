[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Its basically done from the original cryptonote 2.0 whitepaper and code base, but changed significantly. So its not a fork of any projects so to speak.

[19-Nov-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> It has mixings from start, flat fees, dynamic block size, cold streaking directly on the chain with time locked contracts, encrypted messages etc...

[19-Nov-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> But I am not here to shill, really, so if you want specifics ask. I just came to say hi, nothing more

[19-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i was interested in how it works, so thank you

[19-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Np.

[19-Nov-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Its little sad many still think we are a monero fork 🙂

[19-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763

Well - That's a landslide victory for $ARRR taking 76% of the votes. The passion from both these communities are more than enough for me to know these are 2 very good projects with a lot of growth potential. I'm going to run 1 last poll for 4 hours due to sceptical voting ...

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `You can check, the inflation is way lower then almost any coin out there`
I'm not aware of any coin that in year 32 is pumping nearly double the inflation as year 2

[19-Nov-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> `Amway I think privacy projects should stick and work together` as do i, don't be a stranger

[19-Nov-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 Well you need to look at the actual inflation not compare year 2 to 32. Also we will probably change to dromedary model

[19-Nov-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> So once max block reward is reached it will start to deflate

[19-Nov-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Also our PoW will go on for more then 30 years, thats more then most projects, thus low inflation. The coin emission is quite low

[19-Nov-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @mrlynch I won't be 🙂

[19-Nov-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Btw I was reading about your privacy oriented OS. Got me really interested. Is this going to be like a custom distro of Linux bootable from USB with some custom apps like privacy browser, wallet etc?

[19-Nov-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CryptoMaster> I hope your privacy coins will find their true value in the future.

[19-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> I bet on it. People will realize how important privacy is and how traceable BTC is. I am only worried that the governments will hinder us at every step.

[19-Nov-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <FlyingDutchman> if its truly a decentralized, private coin, all the government can do is talk.

[19-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Yes true, but our goal is adoption and that can get really delayed. You will have a hard time to convince normal people to use something that is deemed illegal or frowned upon. Even today many think BTC is only used for illegal activities.

[19-Nov-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Our goal is to get people away from the banks and give them back their financial freedom and privacy

[19-Nov-19 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Anyway no matter what happens i will stick to the end

[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> ask me, I know firsthand! I've lost my license for 3 years for driving 81mph in a 55mph ON THE HIGHWAY...

[20-Nov-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @+dreamTim Thank you, glad to be here.

[20-Nov-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @house I maybe used the "normal" word wrong. I meant normies that don't have tech skills. It also depends on how you see crypto. There was a huge hype around it after 2017 pump and some wanted to put everything on the blockchain which is just stupid. In 99% of use cases you do not need the blockchain. Monetary system is one of the most legitimate cases and the first one that was set up by BTC. Thats kind of my goal to get away from bank that do nothing but steal and leech. And away from government control. But that to happen it need to be gradual and if crypto seems a threat to them they will fight back hard. So its better if we enter through the back door and silently convert the people 🙂

[20-Nov-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <house> Indeed *"normal"* is a very subjective word and very ambiguous in the sense of general population. With privacy issues coming to a head I feel that there will be more people gravitating to financial and data privacy from this general population than ever before over the coming year which bodes well for all privacy focused projects and thus, it will not be such a difficult leap of faith for many who are considered *"normal"* today.

[20-Nov-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <house> Further, I applaud your efforts in this respect and hope that both projects can maintain a healthy dialogue as we focus on that which serves us all

[20-Nov-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> For what it's worth: replace 'normal people' with 'the general public' and I fully agree, Taegus.

[20-Nov-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @salmonskinrolI Thank, you formulation is way better then mine.

[20-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> @house Thank you for the warm reception. I totally agree, we fight for the same values so we should support each other.

[20-Nov-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Personally I have issues with calling something *normal*. I prefer the phrase 'socially accepted'. To explain that: there is behavior in our society that seems to be 'socially accepted', but is absoluty not 'normal' in my eyes.

[20-Nov-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Taegus> Very good point, I agree, that is a good definition. I get hampered by English not being my mother language.

[20-Nov-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠> Me too, but the concept seems universal to me.

[20-Nov-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> ```A crime is an act committed or omitted, in violation of a public law, either forbidding or commanding it; a breach or violation of some public right or duty due to a whole community, considered as a community. In its social aggregate capacity, as distinguished from a civil injury. Wilkins v. U. S```

[dscrd-prt] <𝕲𝖎𝖌𝖆𝖒𝖊𝖘𝖍 𝖙𝖍𝖊 𝕻𝖔𝖜𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕸𝖔𝖓𝖐𝖊𝖞> trying to come up with ideas for how to continue to pursue The Pirate Bay. At first i thought it'd be cool to upload ARRR wallets, but that has too many pitfalls. So instead I thought perhaps we could have a treasure hunt, and upload the map/instructions/clues in a text file that we upload to TPB. any thoughts?
