@Llama roger that.

[19-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Emotionless#4424
noted.  Thanks.

[19-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Emotionless#4424
Did you guys do an ICO to develop this coin/chain?

[19-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Llama#1330
no

[19-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Llama#1330
we were launched by community members and developers

[19-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Llama#1330
and the coin is fundamentally complete.

[19-Oct-18 02:11 AM] fccs#7657
why does piratecoin not have their own discord?

[19-Oct-18 02:12 AM] fccs#7657
like im in a komodo discord for a coin that is a new coinsupposed to be something new.  but doesn't have it's own discord?

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] Llama#1330
In a way it was sort of incubated by the Komodo ecosystem, although, it is a separate project.  I'm sure we will make our own discord in the future.

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] Emotionless#4424
I guess I see the value in the multi-privacy capabilities, but aren't there wat too many privacy coins out there already.  Why would this one in particular have a chance to take off like already established projects.

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] fccs#7657
interesting true

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] fccs#7657
any clue on what exchange this coin will be heading on?

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] fccs#7657
even cryptopia?

[19-Oct-18 02:13 AM] fccs#7657
I've been debating mining it but not too sure on it yet

Says Tortuga Exchange in Q1.

[19-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Llama#1330
@fccs There is one possibly coming in the next weeks.

[19-Oct-18 02:15 AM] fccs#7657
im not sure what that exchange is, never heard of it.  What about when it hits coinmarketcap? to log

[19-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Llama#1330
@fccs Tortuga is an exchange that they are creating from the ground up because the forced ztransactions make it hard for other exchanges to implement deposits.

[19-Oct-18 02:16 AM] fccs#7657

[19-Oct-18 04:50 AM] burbank#1598
I've been mining in the arrr.pool-mining.xyz for the past couple of days but I am wondering if this is a mistake as piratepool.io dominates so much. I am likely confused but doesn't that expose ARRR to the 51% attack when so much is in one pool? (To be honest I don't really understand the 51% attack but I thought it related to one pool having too much) . It seems without Msol types the likelihood of block reward seems to vanish.

[19-Oct-18 04:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@burbank The answer is "no, because dPoW"

[19-Oct-18 04:52 AM] burbank#1598
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I need to research dPoW. Thanks.

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[19-Oct-18 04:53 AM] burbank#1598
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not sure how dilated pore of Winer affects crypto but maybe I need to keep researching. Hahahahaha

[19-Oct-18 04:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There is a certain extent that pool %age matters, but it has more to do with block propagation than anything else

[19-Oct-18 05:00 AM] burbank#1598
Am I saying this correctly:  the dPoW adds in a notary cross check (to Komodo where other implementations cross check to BTC) to prevent an attack on ARRR

[19-Oct-18 05:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in a single sentence, yes, that's about the sum of it

[19-Oct-18 05:03 AM] burbank#1598
Can one compare pools at a moment in time and make any kind of calculation mathematically of which pool to mine in? I guess this could apply to any coins pools.

[19-Oct-18 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
choosing a pool is like choosing a car, you find the brand you like and go with it

[19-Oct-18 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most days I like all 3 guys that run a PIRATE pool, so I can't really be any "help" in picking one

[19-Oct-18 05:07 AM] burbank#1598
I guess it is like solo mining vs pools in a way. A smaller pool pays less frequently but you get a larger share.  It does seem to be something that could have a mathematical probability attached to it though and then you just decide if you can hand;e the risk vs reward

[19-Oct-18 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from that aspect, if you only plan to mine for a day or 2, then go with the largest; for any long-term mining all odds are equal (aside from luck)

[19-Oct-18 05:11 AM] burbank#1598
Yes I thought about what I said and I realized that over the long term it has to level out.

[19-Oct-18 05:12 AM] burbank#1598
If the 296Mh cranking on flypool for ZEC all came to any of the three pirate pools at the same time would that be a good thing or not for ARRR?

[19-Oct-18 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
good thing if you're holding a bunch 😎

[19-Oct-18 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bad thing if you have 1 GPU and want some

[19-Oct-18 05:14 AM] burbank#1598

I am enjoying all the new concepts and I am also enjoying not having my miner at home. (Hosted)

[19-Oct-18 05:20 AM] burbank#1598
@FishyGuts Thanks for your efforts and continued contributions on this chat. That chart showing Pirate vs ZCash and Monero is very interesting. Seems better than ZCash in every way. If you aren't using ZCash for privacy why even use ZCash? What's odd is you can't mine ZCash with your Z address so it seems the miners can't be private. Makes you think....

[19-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Llama#1330
Omg I made that

[19-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Llama#1330
❤

[19-Oct-18 05:24 AM] burbank#1598
@Llama Yes nice one. I read that JP Morgan was looking at ZCash for privacy. The analysts over there need to see your kind of chart to help them understand what a higher level of capacity and privacy means.

[19-Oct-18 05:27 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Is the pool down or just hashrate drop low?
