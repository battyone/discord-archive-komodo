All privacy coins are held together with duct tape + paperclips, in particular all $XMR and $ZEC forks. Epic work by @florian_tramer , @kennyog + @danboneh rocked our industry https://t.co/8pMVrNNnAo

We need drastically better privacy coin tech.

[dscrd-prt] <criptobear> What the fuck is he talking about?

[17-Nov-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> he doesn't know

[17-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> HUSH is also a runtime fork of a fork of zcash 🤷🏽

[17-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> but I'm sure he'll make it all better

[17-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <criptobear> Of course

[17-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <criptobear> So he is crapping on himself too

[17-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> yes, and he knows that but I guess is hoping no one notices

[17-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <criptobear> But is he right?

[17-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> on the level that it's not built "from the ground up", he could be in the ball-park of "right", but not really

[17-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <criptobear> So nothing to worry about?

[17-Nov-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> that a fork (in our case Komodo) is "made to fit" doesn't make it a bad thing or anywhere near the level of "duct tape + paperclips"

[17-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> obviously there are thing that would/could be "better" if it was all from scratch, but we live in the real world

[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> the articles says "Users who have updated their client to the latest release are no longer vulnerable to the attacks described here.
Since the attacks require active monitoring and participation in the Zcash or Monero peer-to-peer networks, they cannot be applied retroactively to earlier transactions."

[17-Nov-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I thought it was also dukeleto himself finding and analyzing these vulnerabilities? 🤷‍♂️

[dscrd-prt] <Tek> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 : D

[17-Nov-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> As far as I can tell kennyog and others have identified the vulnerabilities, disclosed them responsibly to the zcash team which fixed them. Dukeleto saw the commits which led him to find them aswell and he decided it would be a good idea to shout about them publicly and also implying he found them. And on top of that by doing so he also pretty much shit on the responsible disclosure of the other folks. Eww :/

[17-Nov-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> so dukeleto went full pirate.

[17-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> atleat hes not pretending

[17-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> he did what a pirate would do.

[17-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> atleast he's true to himself instead of being a kiss ass follow the rules of zcash company bullshite.

[17-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> AHOIIIII

[17-Nov-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Tek would you prefer that someone shout about a vulnerability before it's fixed,  and draw more attention from people who wish to do harm to projects?

[17-Nov-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @Diablo_ No, he "discovered" that ZEC had already said and did something and that was his "independent" finding 🤦🏽

[17-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> AHOI

[17-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `would you prefer that someone shout about a vulnerability before it's fixed, and draw more attention from people who wish to do harm to projects?`
But, that's literally what duke **did** do 🤷🏽

[17-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👴🏼📢 that's my point

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> shouting about a vuln is good right. else it might go unnoticed

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> what duke did could have negatively impacted a LOT of people

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> the vuln was already fixed, people just had to upgrade the software @Tek

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> at that point, shouting publicly serves no good reason

[17-Nov-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `shouting about a vuln is good right.`
not when you're part of an ecosystem and your first shout is about how PIRATE didn't fix the thing you didn't tell the devs about because you don't like them on a personal level

[17-Nov-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `the vuln was already fixed, people just had to upgrade the software`
only it wasn't though
Zec wasn't completely patch and the rest of us were struggling to find out the details of wtf it even was

[17-Nov-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> Duke started on a rant before *anything* was fully patched by *anyone*

[17-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> _goes to take a bath before rehashing this gives him a literal heart attack_

[17-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I think the way that the Zcash counterfeiting vulnerability was handled (that **was** handled poorly) shows that there is a potential problem with how zcash et al handles things, so I can't blame Duke at all.

[17-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] i'm not saying i agree with how Zcash handles things, however, if there is a vulnerability that's not well known, it's best not to announce it to the world and shine a direct light on it for hackers/people who intend to do ill will to take notice and take advantage of said vulnerability which would make the scale of the damages potentially catastrophic

[17-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Yes, there is a fine line.

[17-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> agreed

[17-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> imo, duke jumped way over that line
