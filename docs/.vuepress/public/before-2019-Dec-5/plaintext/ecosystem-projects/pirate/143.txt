with an even application of x and y PIRATE comes out on top

[08-Oct-18 08:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yup, I see

[08-Oct-18 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone know a watts/USD calc that works with large numbers? so far every one Ive found calculates that nh miners (assuming z9 numbers) are only making 28% of their own power costs

[08-Oct-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only at like $0.01/kWh would they make anything 🤔

[08-Oct-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meh, I guess it would help if I had the right watts calc 😛

[08-Oct-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
should be ~1200000 and not 750000000

[08-Oct-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if you fiddled with the cost per kw at much higher numbers until the costs match what nicehash charges, it woiuld end up being pretty accurate

[08-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Flexatron#8809
Arrright, so horizen 208 msol, pirate 116

[08-Oct-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

1000 z9s!?

[08-Oct-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bhteam does your calc subtract the tax certain chains have (eg "founders fee", "dev fund fee", etc)?

[08-Oct-18 08:50 PM] bhteam#7725
yes, the miners BR is what is used

[08-Oct-18 08:50 PM] bhteam#7725
isn't the PIRATE miner BR 256?

[08-Oct-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[08-Oct-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty cool site

[08-Oct-18 08:51 PM] bhteam#7725
thanks

[08-Oct-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I like that you've got real-world results for the br, pisses me off that most sites don't include the taxes and new folks are like "why can I never get anywhere near that?"

[08-Oct-18 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>because you're making the devs rich by mining for them

Any webgame devs here?   Looking for a simple webgame to interface with a faucet.

[09-Oct-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Dm me if you have the skill to create something simple.   Like a simple shooting gallery game where you fire cannons at passing ships.

[09-Oct-18 03:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a couple art guys I could tap if you’re not skilled there.

Hi guys, In my pirate wallet on agama it has mining enabled icon. Is pirate like verus where you can mine with agama? just curious

[09-Oct-18 06:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can, if you use cli in advanced;however, you'll maybe find 1 block in the next 3 years (if you're that lucky)

What is this an application for? Binance listing or the startup thing?

[09-Oct-18 07:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I gotta go to bed now, waking up early tomorrow.

[09-Oct-18 07:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It's an application for a listing... but it's a startup thing, it's new for binance or anyone.

[09-Oct-18 07:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Hoping to get some eager eyes on the project.

[09-Oct-18 07:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So any ideas, edits or additional things to add would be much appreciated.  
I am going to bed so I will catch up on the critiques in the am.  

Also, please feel free to take any of this info and go write articles about it.

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I am reaching out today to discuss finding a way to make something happen that has yet to be done.  You are the only team I want to reach out to first because time is valuable and I feel like I would waste a lot of it contacting inferior and inexperienced exchanges .

The issue:
There is no Z coin support on any exchange that I know of.  Z coin being the privacy portion of the zcash protocol.
I don’t think that AML compliance would be an issue for as being a central entity with users who login and have accounts.  You would simply need to build a database for tracking the order books as to the specific user and not rely on the blockchain explorer.  I honestly do not see it as a monumental task, just one that hasn’t been completed.  
We are not reaching out for funding.
We have a fair amount of funding to donate to a privacy foundation as per the new philanthropic move by Binance, and if what we don’t have is enough, we could get the community to put more in.  They are very supportive.  
What I really want is to find out what we can do to get listed on a central exchange, preferably Binance, as this will open the doors for you guys to list other z addr coins.   


With that out of the way, 
We are a privacy coin on zcash parameters with a unique twist in that all transactions are z transactions… Private send only.
We have completed our protocol, and our blockchain is up and running on our new privacy coin for about 7 weeks now.  We are an asset chain on Komodo, using zk-snarks for privacy and dPoW for security.  The main feature of our chain is that 100% of the send transactions on the chain are forced z tx (private).  This creates a pool of shielded funds.  
There is no option for public sends on the blockchain.  
The reason for this is simple.  
Financial privacy is pivotal to us as humans, for so many reasons, and none of them nefarious.
Why should a health care provider be allowed to turn you down or charge you more for coverage because of spending habits?

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Why should you feel at risk when travelling knowing a vendor could know how much money you have?
Why does any one need to know how much money you have just because it’s on the blockchain?
It’s not about hiding from governments or taxes, as onboarding and offboarding will still be subject to scrutiny and reporting. 

Privacy:
The strength in the zcash privacy protocol lies in the amount of shielded coins and transactions.   Currently ZEC is at 3.5% shielded.  Not very strong at all.   *link to zec explorer showing minimal shielded transactions* 
By forcing all sends on our chain to be private sends, the entire pool of funds is shielded creating unrivaled privacy for users.
Since we truly believe that all other protocols are inferior in many ways…we will only talk about our strongest competitor, Monero.
In one sentence, Yes, we feel this is stronger than Monero.   
-    First, Zero knowledge proofs have been around for over 30 years.  In 1993 the Godel prize for outstanding papers in theoretical science was awarded to the protocol paving the way for Zcash 20 years later to start working on the blockchain equivalent.   Monero uses Ring Signatures, a protocol developed nearly 16 years after the first zero knowledge proof studies.  And Ring CT has not even been around for 2 years. 
-    Second, zcash is a complete protocol.  It is done.  Monero is constantly reconfiguring and manipulating their code to try for increased privacy, but as the power of computers grow, the obfuscation protocol of Monero will weaken, always requiring constant upgrades.
-    Third, Sapling for Zcash has released.  Komodo is integrating it which will provide all the functionality to our coin, that means mobile wallets and transactions are now going to be possible because previously, they were too processor intense. Monero is constantly trying to do the same for their processor intense transactions.

[09-Oct-18 07:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
-    Fourth, Monero wallet support is difficult and likely will remain so due to the limited options available.  We are supported by Komodos Agama multicoin wallet which has a very friendly and easy to use interface.  

In short, Monero plays the ball under the cup game with privacy.  The game where you figure out which cup the ball is under out of 3 cups after they are jumbled around.  Pirate funds are more like the disappearing coin trick where you make a coin disappear into thin air.   The coin is still there, it’s just that nothing is known about it.

Security:
We all know that new coins are susceptible to 51% attacks and double spends.  So we have countered this by using Komodo’s dPoW, dedicated proof of work, which secures a backup copy of our blockchain to every bitcoin block.  If you are not familiar with how that works, here is some material from the Komodo website.   * Link to KMD dPoW page*
On top of that, after only 7 weeks of launch, we are the 3rd highest hash rate of all equihash coins.  At 120 MS/s, that is pretty much unheard of for hash growth that quickly.  So we are already at more than half the hashrate of ZEN and more than 5% of ZEC hashrates… which is great, but almost irrelevant with Komodo’s dPoW. 
The coin itself provides security when interacting with vendors or other parties by providing you financial anonymity. 

Development:
All in all, I can’t see how this coin and protocol would not be a competitor as a top privacy coin and I really want to try to get it listed on exchanges to help with adoption and useage in the marketplace.

[09-Oct-18 07:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
-    We are in the process of coding an onboarding program for new pirates to the chain, which in an of it self is pretty revolutionary and proprietary for now.  
We are working to gamify the interface portal, giving users a chance to earn crypto without buying in with FIAT.  Once that happens, these users will need exchanges to trade into BTC and other coins if they want.  
-    We have 2 webshop plugins being developed for our coin, but exchange support is a big missing piece… otherwise we have to use an OTC price estimate which is possibly open to manipulation.
-    We have just been added to our first mining calculator and should be on 2 more in the next week or two and then bigger ones once we have exchange support. 
-    We will be running a $10,000 advertisement campaign monthly over the next few months.  
-    A trading promo would be fantastic and we would be able to discuss providing a prize for this.
-    The biggest plus we feel, The Komodo team is 100% on board with helping our development.  They are helping us build a centralized exchange based on the peatio code.  I would rather have them not waste time with that and get us on a real and reputable exchange.


All in all I think this is a great project and I am willing to work with you and your team in WHATEVER fashion is needed to get this launched. 
I cannot tell you how excited I am to hear from your team.  
JL777 the Komodo founder suggested I reach out to Binance and ONLY binance first, but I think the BinanceLabs are what we need.
Thank you for your time,

Ryan aka FishyGuts
