Yup. There used to be an implementation of nomp that had zstratum built in but IDK now.

[09-Sep-18 07:53 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I am trying to figure out what exactly the proxy does and why it works. Which nomp repo did you fork from?

[09-Sep-18 08:07 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Yeah, I am trying to understand its connection to zstratum though.

[09-Sep-18 08:22 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Ah, I see what happened. The zstratum protocol was put into ZCash Improvement Proposal (ZIP) 301 and was eventually accepted as the standard stratum protocol for all ZCash pools.

Because it was standard for ZCash, they just went back to calling it stratum.

[09-Sep-18 08:23 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
In other words, any fork of z-nomp should already use it.

So, in about 100 days there will be 30M pirate and in 40 something days 20 M right

[10-Sep-18 11:36 AM] abcd#1803
Sounds right

[10-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
wow, just realized just how lopsided the emissions are o.o

[10-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
only ~5 years of block rewards?

[10-Sep-18 11:52 AM] scubapanda#2485
Around day 325 roughly 39 200 000 will be mined. After that the next two years will only bring around 600k more coins.

[10-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
Am I seeing that correctly?

[10-Sep-18 11:54 AM] jorian#4555
yes, 5 years

[10-Sep-18 11:58 AM] scubapanda#2485
If you don't care for the last 40 coins it's 1080 days.

[10-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Mylo#8306
can you hard fork and make the tx fees higher to encourage mining after 1000 days?

[10-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
miners can just set the minimum they'll accept

[10-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
get everyone to do that?

[10-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
Have to consider what's happening to CHIPS right now

[10-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
and avoid that with PIRATE

[10-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah exactly.

[10-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Mylo#8306
well i'm gonna make a new chain then, called PIRIGHT with the correct emission schedule and mining fee :trollface:

[10-Sep-18 12:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
So the visible part of the chain contains mining rewards and public addresses they went to? If that info was notarized, and checked for by miners of new blocks, would that be enough to stop high hashpower takeover?

[10-Sep-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
dpow is viable

Ok, good 😃

[10-Sep-18 02:56 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
But what if we don't pass emissions testing and the government impounds our PIRATE? :trollface:

[10-Sep-18 05:49 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Huh, very interesting, my average sols/second has dropped when I added CPU mining on top of my GPU. My max is higher but my average dropped significantly.

I wonder if that has to do with the machine getting closer to the max temp and slowing down the GPU because the CPU is adding extra heat.

[10-Sep-18 06:13 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Odd, the GPU was running super cool. Like at 68C.

[10-Sep-18 06:16 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
While it was GPU only, the GPU was running around 78C. Seems stuck there even after closing the CPU miner. And after closing reopening the GPU miner. Gonna try to restart my PC and see if that makes a difference.

[10-Sep-18 06:57 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I have a GTX 1060 which is safe up to 83C

[10-Sep-18 07:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Don't hesitate to slightly underclock/undervolt the GPU.
You will gain ~10C and loose a little percentage of your hashrate

Giggity

[10-Sep-18 08:37 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@webworker01, I am not too worried about power consumption at the moment.

I am more of an investor than a miner and I am willing to take a small loss now to maximize the amount of PIRATE in my wallet later.

I already have my GTX 1060 and mostly use it for streaming. Mining part time seems like a good way to get some extra PIRATE.

I am basically only paying for the wear and tear on the card and since I didn't buy it for this purpose, I don't consider it an up front cost.

I am expecting PIRATE to be worth much more a year or two from now and make up for the extra electricity costs. However, some clocking changes may help.

[10-Sep-18 08:41 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Considering just buying some as well.

[10-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
Who's selling?

[10-Sep-18 09:40 PM] Don King#8901
Not many sellers, if dPoW becomes possible PIRATE would be most secure, most private asset in the cryptosphere. Big 'if' but komodo community has repeatedly  shown it is capable of these tech breakthrough

[10-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Flexatron#8809
Rebrand-> moon

[10-Sep-18 10:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
Ive only seen 0.0035 kmd as an offer

[10-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
Maybe nice to get a centralized exchange early on

[10-Sep-18 10:55 PM] Don King#8901
We need an exchange for proper price discovery, or an OTC market run by recognised community member like ydx

[10-Sep-18 11:50 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Because of the anonymity, it would be hard to get on a centralized exchange with the current political climate. Perhaps an underground .onion exchange would work but I would always be worried about getting Goxed with anything like that.

[11-Sep-18 01:31 AM] Don King#8901
A problem for centralised exchange is also user trust, I don't know if I would trust a CEX with anon Z transactions unless run by komodo community members.
What I'd love to see would be a Z only asset chain pegged to another crypto like Bitcoin, like an anon version of a stable coin like tether, with a gateway like the old mgw , so you could store Bitcoins anonymously. I wonder if that is possible with crypto conditions stuff jl777 is developing.

[11-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Don King#8901
@Emmanuel exactly, any exchange needs to be automated, like the MGW, or run OTC by trusted community  members

[11-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Don King#8901
Pirate exchange needs to be setup by komodo ecosystem

[11-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Don King#8901
Good side project for someone

[11-Sep-18 01:41 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, this tech could attract some negative attention, there is risk is running an exchange for whoever did it, would need to be anon person, or automated ... Send the exchange bot to jail lol

[11-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Don King#8901
I see pirate as a storage token, not a transaction token. Ok, so CC is not possible, so automated gateway is out

[11-Sep-18 01:43 AM] Don King#8901
There are quicker ways to spend anonymously,  but probably no better tech for anon hodl

[11-Sep-18 01:44 AM] Don King#8901
That's why a pegged z only coin would be cool, if possible

[11-Sep-18 01:47 AM] Don King#8901
I agree, full OTC run by trusted person, maybe with escrow from a third party

[11-Sep-18 01:50 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, there is some trade-off,  increased anon does require more trust

[11-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Don King#8901
But for some purposes the trade-off is worth it, once the trade is done you have perfect anon asset

[11-Sep-18 01:52 AM] Don King#8901
That's why this tech is best suited to hodl, so some peg would be fantadtic

[11-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand why you would want this escrow system

[11-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Alright#0419
when compared to a normal CEX setup

[11-Sep-18 01:54 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I can only really see one kind of peg being possible: mirrored supply.

[11-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, mirrored supply like old MGW used afaik

CEX uses one z address for all deposits, posts viewing key publicly?

[11-Sep-18 02:03 AM] Don King#8901
Asset chains are so amazing, now the z only genie is out of the bottle people can experiment

[11-Sep-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so the problem is CEX could say "we paid you" and user can say "no, you didn't"?

[11-Sep-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
can't they do that already?

[11-Sep-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
"you gave us this address, here's a tx of us sending coins to it"

[11-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Alright#0419
There is inherent trust required for a CEX to begin with

Makes the news every year where I am

[11-Sep-18 02:12 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
The CEX could implement mantissa association to prove they sent funds. If someone says "you never sent the funds to me," then, if the CEX has their viewing key published, they can say "we received this much on this date, publish your viewing key to prove we didn't send it." Then they can say "see, you received this exact amount down to the 8th decimal place."

[11-Sep-18 02:14 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
That would make sense.

[11-Sep-18 02:14 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I like it.

[11-Sep-18 02:14 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
If you complain and we did nothing wrong, we publish your viewing key.

[11-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Alright#0419

[11-Sep-18 02:22 AM] Don King#8901
Or just make hay while the sun shines, tech isn't illegal, and running exchanges without kyc is legal in some countries still afaik

[11-Sep-18 02:22 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Yeah, it is still an escrow, but at least if there are two viewing keys, you can see all exchanges between the two addresses and prove if something was or was not sent.

[11-Sep-18 02:24 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
The viewing key corresponds to the recipient address. The exchange would need to publish their own viewing key as well to show their own address.

[11-Sep-18 02:25 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Yes. It reveals the recipient as it is published by the recipient and is derived from the recipient's private key.

[11-Sep-18 02:26 AM] Don King#8901
@Emmanuel, so running this exchange would be legal in many countries, like where binance operates from, as long as no kyc hassles this could be a great business

[11-Sep-18 02:26 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Can you prove a file corresponds to a given hash? Yes.

[11-Sep-18 02:27 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
That is why both viewing keys are needed.

Are you saying the z-cash devs are lying about their tech? Because that has more profound consequences than this.

[11-Sep-18 02:36 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I am saying it corresponds to a single z-address as described in the article.

[11-Sep-18 02:38 AM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
The only way it wouldn't prove that is if it corresponded to multiple z-addresses.
