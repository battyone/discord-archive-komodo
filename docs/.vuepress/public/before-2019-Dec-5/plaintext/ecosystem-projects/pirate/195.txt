What adress is better for mining transparent or z private?tnx in advance

[20-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Llama#1330
@Maat you might get banned from the pool if you use a transparent address

[20-Oct-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is zaddr only, cant mine to transparent unless you run a pool yourself

[20-Oct-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@blubbi @And1_89 The problem is that he can only pay out 50 miners at a time and despite repeated requests from almost everyone here, no one wants to join a different pool and lighten the payout load
You jam the server, you get a jammed server
