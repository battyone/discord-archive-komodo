[09-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think it'll take all of us til the tipping point occurs.

[09-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
that wonderful point when everyone decides to finally look into it and it takes over twitter for a couple of days.

[09-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
like what happened with RVN recently.

[09-Nov-18 03:08 PM] LooTz#2749
I have foot soldiers that are going out and spreading the flyers to schools, cafes, libraries, etc

[09-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Oszy#5734

[09-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I may have hung out there talking crypto too often over the last two years. haha

[09-Nov-18 03:10 PM] LooTz#2749
yea you know I used to be big on press releases and other techniques but at the end of the day giving somebody something by hand or in person is better

[09-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Oszy#5734

[09-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Oszy#5734

@IsekiSolari just read the answers in the thread. If you always use z-tx you are secure. Since Arrr allows only z-tx then you know...

@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã  You were right: 

 "The only effective mitigation for the form of transaction linking described in the Meiklejohn et al paper ("An Empirical Analysis of Anonymity in Zcash", https://smeiklej.com/files/usenix18.pdf ‚Ä¶ ), is to use fully shielded transactions consistently"

Lol yup seen that many times

[09-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Awesome I can listen to the video .üòÄ

[09-Nov-18 03:34 PM] LooTz#2749
That yellow part is the hard work, you can add more then what's there

[09-Nov-18 03:34 PM] LooTz#2749
Ex. Flyers, direct chats, memes, etc all that stuuf

[09-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm excited to look at this. I have always been decent at promoting things so it'll be great to add some more perspective on what to do.

[09-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I booked and promoted concerts for 12 years.

[09-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I love flyers. üòÅ

[09-Nov-18 03:37 PM] LooTz#2749
Flyers are used for more then just handouts you can reuse them in social media posts, memes, image submission sites like pinterest  etc.

[09-Nov-18 03:38 PM] LooTz#2749
Going back to the old school

[09-Nov-18 03:38 PM] LooTz#2749
Use the old in the new

[09-Nov-18 03:40 PM] LooTz#2749
Once you have pirate radio up you can do better advertising through invitations on the show and reaching more people

[09-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep, nowadays most bands only do the digital flyers , I can't understand why not both.

[09-Nov-18 03:40 PM] LooTz#2749
Foot soldiers are a must

[09-Nov-18 03:41 PM] LooTz#2749
I always take flyers from people when I go to a conference for upcoming events, why not for educational material

[09-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Seko#7408
At this point I would like to thank our captain @FishyGuts. 
 
I am proud to have @Flexatron, @Oszy, @Mixic and the others in my crew.

We'll sail on together!!!

[09-Nov-18 05:05 PM] nackmaster#2726
dunno, but is anyone else nervous that value of ARRR relative to either KMD or BTC is crapping on itself?

[09-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Oszy#5734
Nothing to be nervous about this is normal

[09-Nov-18 05:12 PM] jansako#3330
Normal or not, it is expected at this point. Until the project gains more visibility.

[09-Nov-18 05:16 PM] nackmaster#2726
roger that

[09-Nov-18 05:17 PM] nackmaster#2726
hodl hodl hodl

[09-Nov-18 05:18 PM] BlockTech#6895
Yup, HODL as much as you can and fill your bag now, this won't last more than a months in my opinion.

[09-Nov-18 05:30 PM] nackmaster#2726
now the question is, do I mine ZEC or ARRR....

[09-Nov-18 05:31 PM] BlockTech#6895
@nackmaster  the decision is yours but would you mine to HODL or to sell right away ?

[09-Nov-18 05:32 PM] nackmaster#2726
probably HODL either way

[09-Nov-18 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Switch back and forth depending on profitability of hash rate of either

[09-Nov-18 05:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get the most for your electricity

[09-Nov-18 05:33 PM] BlockTech#6895
Then i would recommand $ARRR, but we never know =D. 
And if it's for instant profit you can calculate it here : https://www.crypto-coinz.net/crypto-calculator-asic/

[09-Nov-18 05:34 PM] BlockTech#6895
actually mining ARRR is around 40% more profitable than mining ZEC.

[09-Nov-18 05:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Liquidity concerns

[09-Nov-18 05:35 PM] tahoeminer#4362
@BlockTech  yes... if you mine ARRR then turn around and sell it for KMD the you can exchange that to ZEC and get a little more ZEC then you would mining it directly

[09-Nov-18 05:36 PM] nackmaster#2726
never even though of that, interesting

[09-Nov-18 05:37 PM] tahoeminer#4362
anybody wondering why piratepool.io hasn't confirmed past block 61216

[09-Nov-18 05:37 PM] tahoeminer#4362

[09-Nov-18 05:37 PM] tahoeminer#4362
actually hours

[09-Nov-18 05:37 PM] tahoeminer#4362
feels like days

[09-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Draeth#3300
@tahoeminer yea I noticed that too, not sure what's up

[09-Nov-18 05:38 PM] tahoeminer#4362
I wonder how big that block is ü§î

[09-Nov-18 05:39 PM] tahoeminer#4362
I see my shares still piling up

[09-Nov-18 05:40 PM] nackmaster#2726
dunno, I moved over to polly after I noticed they upped the min payout to 77

[09-Nov-18 05:40 PM] nackmaster#2726
on piratepool that is

[09-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Draeth#3300
When did they change it to 77? I never noticed

[09-Nov-18 05:40 PM] tahoeminer#4362
I don't mind the payout at 77...I just don't see any confirmations on the blocks, which is concerning to me

[09-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Exile13#4458
Phew

[09-Nov-18 05:42 PM] nackmaster#2726
how many shares /min would i expect to be submitting

[09-Nov-18 05:43 PM] tahoeminer#4362
depends on your hashrate

[09-Nov-18 05:43 PM] nackmaster#2726
10-15 ksol/sec

[09-Nov-18 05:44 PM] nackmaster#2726
when I was on pirate pool it was just under 4/min

[09-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Exile13#4458
40 to 60 arrr per day

[09-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Exile13#4458
Depending on network difficulty

[09-Nov-18 05:45 PM] nackmaster#2726
on polly th ey had two ports, just not described very well, I think I got it now, way too fast on the lower port lol

[09-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Exile13#4458

[09-Nov-18 05:54 PM] nackmaster#2726
from KMD to ARRR

[09-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
yes, it's called onboarding

[09-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
if you want to get on board the PIRATE ship, you can go there

[09-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
for disembarking, use digitalprice

[09-Nov-18 05:56 PM] nackmaster#2726
ah

[09-Nov-18 05:57 PM] BlockTech#6895
You can also embark on digitalprice of course ^^. But onboarding is an easier way to get your first little bag of pirate.
