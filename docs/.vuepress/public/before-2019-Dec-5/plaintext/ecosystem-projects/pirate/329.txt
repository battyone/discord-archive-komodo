I was being serious, all I can find is some medium posts and vids that haven't really changed much since like June

@dustblaze I think your message looks like spam. 🤓  This is where Pirate is discussed.

[22-Nov-18 11:32 PM] dustblaze#1349
Now it feels like I’m shilling XLR in here which isn’t my intention. If this information is not enough and you don’t believe in the exchange, simply don’t vote

[22-Nov-18 11:32 PM] dustblaze#1349
Agree @Mixic was not my intention. Only wanted to give background on txbit

[22-Nov-18 11:33 PM] Mixic#3188
Background and links ... 😁  Lol

[22-Nov-18 11:34 PM] Mixic#3188
I'm not a moderator. But I think I need to be a little more careful with such links.

[22-Nov-18 11:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mixic Not sure how you get "spam" out of him linking to info that I specifically asked for (albeit that it's just claims and not actual evidence of claims being true)

[22-Nov-18 11:40 PM] Mixic#3188
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Not. This is not a claim. Pirate is voting now. But Solaris is advertised. I guess I do not understand something 😉

[22-Nov-18 11:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The guys behind Solaris are part of the exchange

[22-Nov-18 11:53 PM] Mixic#3188
On the ship, the pirates vote. Vote for the island TXBIT. But the ship sails to the ship. On the yacht sail Solaris. The guys on the yacht are screaming - vote for Solaris! 😁

[22-Nov-18 11:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_votes for the island of "Ifitdoesntexistyetdontcountityet"_

[22-Nov-18 11:59 PM] Mixic#3188
Good. Another situation. Dietrich has a birthday. Everybody celebrates and congratulates him. But Klaus comes and shouts: I have a birthday too, let's celebrate my holiday. 😉

[23-Nov-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dafuq are "Dietrich" and "Klaus"? And why do we care about them?

[23-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Mixic#3188
A ship with sails and a birthday are two different situations. They simply need to be presented and compared with the vote of the Pirate.

pretty funny someone keeps making teeny tiny buys at digitalprice just so (i guess) they can see some green on the board

[23-Nov-18 08:54 AM] luckylucky#3724
Tradeogre should be looked into for $ARRR

[23-Nov-18 08:54 AM] luckylucky#3724
Simply message their twitter account. I don’t think their owner even charges a fee if he likes the project im sure he’d love this one!

are there some stats like coin usage for Pirate? like daily tx count ?

[23-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to get sapling mining pools in place

[23-Nov-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling is in testing now, but we need to be able to mine it

[23-Nov-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@webworker01 not sure what exactly is needed to support sapling, but the coinbase would need to be a tx version 4

[23-Nov-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
I know VRSC has sapling pools setup, hopefully it wont cause problems to update

[23-Nov-18 10:30 AM] ronyi#5719
@jl777c how can I help?

[23-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
a sapling enabled pool for PIRATE

[23-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jorian#4555
@0x03 maybe?

[23-Nov-18 10:32 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay i trying create one.

[23-Nov-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont work until sapling activates, but you can test it ahead of time

[23-Nov-18 10:46 AM] Flexatron#8809

I've received that as well. At least they're making good on it

@FishyGuts check your email you may get it back too

[23-Nov-18 12:44 PM] deepwaterH2O#3114
So does that mean they (Crex24) can't ever integrate ARRR wallet or just not at this time?

[23-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
Not "can't" but they won't

[23-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
Too much for them 😂

[23-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Flexatron#8809

[23-Nov-18 12:49 PM] deepwaterH2O#3114
Well, even though it would've been nice to have a 2nd xchge for ARRR, Crex24 only allows "whole numbers" to be traded on most coins. Are there any more prospective exchanges in the works?

[23-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Oszy#5734

[23-Nov-18 01:00 PM] CryptoInvestorAU#8199
Was just thinking; maybe we should have a #memes channel? 😄

[23-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Oszy#5734
#safespace  😄

The Safespace is for safe memes.

Thanks @Oszy  I didn’t know that existed.
Still would like a pirate memes specific channel though. 😁🙏

[23-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
do we want to do one collectively?

[23-Nov-18 02:23 PM] ronyi#5719
I created one

[23-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
so we aren't each doing our own

[23-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
did you push the changes needed to a repo?

[23-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
we could all use the same chain

[23-Nov-18 02:24 PM] ronyi#5719
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATESAPLINGTEST -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=212.37.71.42 or 212.37.71.41

[23-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
@ronyi what did you set timestamp to

[23-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
I'll make a branch of komodod that will let us sync that

[23-Nov-18 02:26 PM] ronyi#5719
1542986000

[23-Nov-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
well, that chain wont be sapling enabled

[23-Nov-18 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
will be shortly

[23-Nov-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[23-Nov-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
Most have misunderstood something then

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
That timestamp is in ~30 minutes

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i have some tricky timestamp based activation code in FSM branch and unless you change the activation timestamp  it wont actually activate

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Alright#0419
I told ronyi to create the chain prior to the timestamp triggering activation

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i just added code to actually activate

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
Right now, I'm changing it in my own branch of komodod that we can use to test

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but only if the #define KOMODO_SAPLING_ACTIVATION has changed

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo_setactivation() needs to be called and until now that call was commented out, unless you manually changed it

[23-Nov-18 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
ok, let me look at it

[23-Nov-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if you pull the latest and just change the #define value, it should activate for real
