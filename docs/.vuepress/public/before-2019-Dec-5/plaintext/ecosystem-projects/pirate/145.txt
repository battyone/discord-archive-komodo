`BTCH_airdrop` LOL I think I need to do some bookmark updating 😛

Thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 . I shut down all wallet to get a screenshot and you posted

As I was trying to say before, it would be really nice not to have to open up 2 separate instances of the Agama wallet if you wanted to go and look at your Pirate coin and Verus coin balances.

[09-Oct-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, bringing 2 decentralized projects together inside a 3rd project can take time and PIRATE is quite new

[09-Oct-18 07:57 PM] OliverDay#5571
Hang on.... I actually see that Verus is listed in the list of coins in this Agama Wallet version!

[09-Oct-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for balance it works, but not for in-wallet mining

[09-Oct-18 07:58 PM] OliverDay#5571
Oh no, that’s fine.

[09-Oct-18 07:58 PM] OliverDay#5571
Cli miner is faster in any case.

[09-Oct-18 07:58 PM] OliverDay#5571
Actually, GPU mining is now vastly superior.

[09-Oct-18 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah I need to try that in my rigs, just been too lazy to install cuda

[09-Oct-18 07:59 PM] SHossain#0007
VRSC staking wouldn't work on Lite (SPV) mode

[09-Oct-18 07:59 PM] OliverDay#5571
Ccminer cuda 8 flies!!!

[09-Oct-18 08:00 PM] OliverDay#5571
Another question... Pirate coin is pure Equihash, right?

[09-Oct-18 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[09-Oct-18 08:00 PM] OliverDay#5571
It’s not Equi 144.5 or something?

[09-Oct-18 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for mining it's the same as KMD (200,9)

[09-Oct-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like nature intended

[09-Oct-18 08:01 PM] OliverDay#5571
So nothing can prevent Asics from jumping in as well?

[09-Oct-18 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[09-Oct-18 08:02 PM] OliverDay#5571
Anybody here have asics on it already?

[09-Oct-18 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fact, a good portion of hash is ASICs

[09-Oct-18 08:02 PM] SHossain#0007
there has been 10,000 ASIC (Z9 mini) mining PIRATE

[09-Oct-18 08:02 PM] OliverDay#5571
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

[09-Oct-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders what unicorn @SHossain pulled that number out of_

[09-Oct-18 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
135 MSol = ~10,000 z9 mini equivalent

[09-Oct-18 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
not 100% accurate data though

[09-Oct-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'equivalent of' != 'has been' 😉

[09-Oct-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
you are right

[09-Oct-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wouldn't mind getting my hands on 10k of them in less than 1k shipments

[09-Oct-18 08:06 PM] OliverDay#5571
Recommendations for a pool?

[09-Oct-18 08:07 PM] OliverDay#5571
I know there are mainly 2 pools that dominate...

[09-Oct-18 08:07 PM] SHossain#0007
use 1 of them

[09-Oct-18 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

We are now at 75Msol.

[09-Oct-18 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is still waiting on UPS to get their slow asses here and hopes they get here before he goes bowling

[09-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
So that's actually 150 msol?:trollface:

[09-Oct-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, I only burn 40M

[09-Oct-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or you mean the mini estimate?

[09-Oct-18 08:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What is the correct komodod-ac code?

[09-Oct-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as mini hash, the result is like US cars in the 70s where quality can be linked to day of the week it was made

[09-Oct-18 08:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't know what I am talking about but I know what someone is asking for.   It's about running the daemon.

[09-Oct-18 08:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They're wondering if it's a forked komodod but I want to say its not correct?

[09-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
its a runtime fork

[09-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Oct-18 08:17 PM] OliverDay#5571
Can you only mine to a private Z address?

[09-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in a pool, yes

[09-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the chain is z txes only

[09-Oct-18 08:19 PM] OliverDay#5571
👌🏻

[09-Oct-18 08:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there a "bootstrap" for the tip bot developer to use?  (And what is he asking for when he asks that?  Electrum connections?)

[09-Oct-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As small as the chain is, that seems pointless

[09-Oct-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bootstrap is akin to zipfile of the chain

[09-Oct-18 08:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For KMD.

[09-Oct-18 08:21 PM] wookie#7663
@FishyGuts Thanks for posting the logo contest results! (i'll dm you my z address shortly)

[09-Oct-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know about for KMd though

[09-Oct-18 08:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks for your work Wook.   Lets get more of those people serious about crypto!

[09-Oct-18 08:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The chain will take a few hours to sync, that's it yeah?

[09-Oct-18 08:22 PM] wookie#7663
@Flexatron no worries, I have versions of the saber in silver and in gold too! 😀 @FishyGuts I'll send along all variations of the logo, you guys can choose to use them in any way that works

When pirate will be listed on a real exchange ?

[09-Oct-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depending on connected nodes, from 3-20 hrs

[09-Oct-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FatgroW define "real"

[09-Oct-18 08:23 PM] FatgroW#4364
humm , not a discord

[09-Oct-18 08:23 PM] FatgroW#4364
😄

[09-Oct-18 08:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A tor CEX is in progress; as far as your CEX of choice, you'll have to ask them

[09-Oct-18 08:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
About 12 hours ago I posted a draft of what I will be sending to exchanges @FatgroW

[09-Oct-18 08:27 PM] FatgroW#4364
cex.io ?

[09-Oct-18 08:27 PM] FatgroW#4364
Oo

[09-Oct-18 08:28 PM] scubapanda#2485
Seriously, are we sending multiple logos out?

[09-Oct-18 08:31 PM] mato121#5963
FishyGuts posted this: We will use the Sabre and Eyepatch logos to represent the coin until we get an entire design deck completed for the project.
We really appreciate all the hard work everyone put in and we don't want you to spend all your booty in one place....  Unless that place is Tortuga... then feel free to make it rain.

[09-Oct-18 08:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Question... who manages the discord administration?   Who would I contact about tipbot integration?

I must have missed the other z<->z only total transaction privacy coin that he knows about @Gordon Komodo

[09-Oct-18 08:36 PM] scubapanda#2485
Use dogedice if you can't decide. Good or bad, I would just choose ONE logo for the time being (and give the rewards out as a draw if that was the thing). Or do we want to have different logos out on different exchanges, calculators and web pages?

[09-Oct-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
zcoin?

[09-Oct-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it doesnt hide values though

[09-Oct-18 08:38 PM] mato121#5963
I would also choose 1 logo for the time being. The one that is on crypto-coinz looks good to me

[09-Oct-18 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
better? 😛

[09-Oct-18 08:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to logos - We will probably use the simpler more definitive logo for integration publicly for now.   The other will be used for announcements and releases until the final deck is complete.

[09-Oct-18 08:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
<- I'm keeping this one no mater what you publicly use :trollface:

What is the current going rate for Pirate coin? I presume there is already private selling taking place?

[09-Oct-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.2-0.25 KMD per

[09-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Zach#9973
#deleted-channel

[09-Oct-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
may have slipped to 0.19

[09-Oct-18 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't selling under 0.25 either way_

[09-Oct-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_would buy the panic sells if UPS would just show dafuq up already_

Would appreciate corrections or cross posts.

[09-Oct-18 08:51 PM] OliverDay#5571
One big problem this coin certainly solves is that it’s helping to spread the hash away from the other Equihash coins little bit for all the thousands of miners who got themselves Z9’s and Z9 minis the past few months.  😂😂

[09-Oct-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has been mining KMD the whole time and never had any such "big problem"_

[09-Oct-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, I can't truly say "whole time", I did mine HUSH for a day and ZCL for 2 days

[09-Oct-18 09:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The Mining Rig time contest is over.  It was a success and brought a lot of eyes in.   I will hold another one next week.  

As of 2 PM PST all of your mining time has started and I will switch them off tomorrow at 2PM.

1st and 2nd place winners responded but the 3rd place winner did not come forward for 72 hours so we have donated his winnings to the onboarding pool.  

Onboarding donation miners.

My buddy living in the same house was upvoting the post as well. He also got banned for 3 days. 😄

Miketout and Mike junior were also banned for 3 days, I heard.
