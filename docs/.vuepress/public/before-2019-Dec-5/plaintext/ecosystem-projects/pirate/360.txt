[03-Dec-18 06:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@scubapanda that means your komodo does not have z_listunspent. it just came in the latest sapling merge

[03-Dec-18 06:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you probably did not recompile and/or stop/restart if you did recompile

[03-Dec-18 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
z_listunspent is one of my favorite new RPCs

[03-Dec-18 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
Duke 💕 z_listunspent

[03-Dec-18 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@scubapanda i notice you are using a sprout zaddr, as well

@dukeleto does that mean we can start updating komodod?

[03-Dec-18 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch @scubapanda it means that you need to be running the latest KMD code to use `z_listunspent`

[03-Dec-18 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a good time anyway, since you need to upgrade my Dec15th anyway

No.
No.

In light of #SEC news,
Pirate has not paid for positive reviews or articles.

We have already decided against it.
That said, we have offered $ARRR or $KMD to people for their efforts and work, or as appreciation, usually post production.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Got it compiled and running. Even ./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_listunspent works as long as I put zero additional parameters there.. Anything after z_listunspent returns: error code: -3
error message:
Expected type number, got string

[03-Dec-18 10:56 PM] dokrates#8987
am i right if i say with sapling, piratechain will be "more" implemented into new exchanges, because with less computational needs, more exchanges will be "more" positives in terms of add into their servers?

Ok, but now z_listunspent exists. Tell me which to compile to get z_listunspent working on PIRATE. Or is it still impossible on the main chain?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Solved that one.. ./zcutil/build-mac.sh 😉 This is the branch I had already compiled. If someone else is using MacOS here I'd like to hear if you can pass parameters to ./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_listunspent (and how you do it).

you need to escape the " differently

For me  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_listunspent 1 will already give an error.

seems like mac build is missing something

That's what I'm thinking..

[04-Dec-18 12:08 AM] scubapanda#2485
I would think that someone else would have compiled and tried z_listunspent with parameters on MacOS. Oh well, might be Linux time for Panda soon.

On page 8 where it’s breaking down the monero and z cash strategies, it may be clearer to go into more detail and show the illustration on monero before mentioning zcash.  So it would read monero summary > more detail > diagram, then zcash summary > more detail > diagram.
