you still working on that weekly payouts for whomever doesn't reach the minimum?

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
my hashrate on the pool is actually higher than what my miner is telling me

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
@webworker01 anything else that needs testing? just checked and we're all in sync

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
stopped mining though, using the power for Verus üòÑ

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Maat#9515
I have less 10-15%

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe switch to a pool with a better ping ü§î

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
just ping the pools and see which one replies quicker

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Maat#9515
I will turn off at morning

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
less than 200ms is ok, ideal is 1-10ms

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
back to testing... we're in sync, zmigrate works

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
explorer works, we testing pools yet?

Are the prices listed for ARRR on Blockfolio completely random, or is it just me?

[27-Nov-18 12:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It may just be me looking at it in $ rather than in KMD actually

[27-Nov-18 12:54 AM] Flexatron#8809
no idea, im back to using delta

[27-Nov-18 12:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It was because it was in USD I think. I can't figure out how to keep it in KMD aha
