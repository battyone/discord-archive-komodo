proposal: new consensus rule to force a new address for each block reward

[08-Sep-18 10:50 PM] Alright#0419
realized that PIRATE mining is not so private

[08-Sep-18 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
Do we want forced anonymity or not?

[08-Sep-18 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
when they started mining, how often they mine, their mining habits

[08-Sep-18 10:58 PM] Alright#0419
how much they mined to that address

[08-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
only need to correlate one thing to a person, and you'll have some idea of how much PIRATE they have

[08-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Alright#0419
once you know their mining habits and their address goes dead, you look for their new address with the same habits

[08-Sep-18 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
still it'd be better forced anonymity

[08-Sep-18 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
and I thought that was the entire point

[08-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hmm you are never sure

[08-Sep-18 11:19 PM] Flexatron#8809
But good idea

[08-Sep-18 11:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright idea is similar to zcash‚Äôs default mining behaviour

[08-Sep-18 11:24 PM] wookie#7663
I vote for what @Alright recommends, forced anonymity

[08-Sep-18 11:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
bbuuuttt .... then the richlist would be broken

[08-Sep-18 11:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how as i supposed to be on top of rich list ... if I have millions of address :trollface:

Hello everyone. Is it possible to encrypt the pirate wallet?

[09-Sep-18 01:51 AM] abcd#1803
I get ‚Äúwallet encryption disabled‚Äù when using encryptwallet command. How do you add a password? Cant you import the privkey to Agama when the time comes?

I was going to try to get that logo contest up on reddit @webworker01. Do you have specfic rules? I thought a brand style guide (inc font, color palette etc as well as logos) may be the way to do it. Put it on reddit while the infographic bounty is going. Leave it open for 30 days?

Is anyone pursuing an exchange to get listed on? Or is that on the to do list?

[09-Sep-18 03:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
A wish list actually üòÖ

[09-Sep-18 03:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In case an exchange can support z tx only withdraw and deposit

[09-Sep-18 03:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, who is running the mining pool?

[09-Sep-18 04:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It seems as though my wallet has been "Paid" but when I `getwalletinfo` it shows a 0 balance

[09-Sep-18 04:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
also, could you explain how people have `R...` addresses? I.E, the richlist

[09-Sep-18 04:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Rrrr there equivalent R addresses for a said Z address?

[09-Sep-18 04:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh, so you have an R address that then sends to our Z addresses

[09-Sep-18 04:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
so you can still make an R address on this chain

[09-Sep-18 04:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
and send transactions to a Z address

[09-Sep-18 04:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
üòâ I would but I'm fairly busy with work. So i'll have to add my 2 cents to the coin via throwing my miners at it!

[09-Sep-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think sapling will change the size of ztx

[09-Sep-18 07:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I know it's not a help, but doesn't `z_mergetoaddress` output the number up utxos?  Suppose it calcs that after the fact rather than checking before.

[09-Sep-18 07:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Haha that sounds a lot like testing cross chain transfers, try something and then wait an hour yo find out if it worked

[09-Sep-18 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181

108!? maybe it tried to do it in parallel, using up GB per instance and required virtual memory, which leads to thrashing is 1000x slower performance

[09-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Flexatron#8809
Good work

[09-Sep-18 01:17 PM] Flexatron#8809
What is that?

[09-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
Ah so it makes the mining more "anonymous"

[09-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Flexatron#8809
There are 4 million pirate now

[09-Sep-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
z-tx at much bigger than normal ones

[09-Sep-18 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c in sapling, there is no more "max of 54 recipients to a shielded transaction", the size of a z transaction will only be limited by block size

[09-Sep-18 02:27 PM] zatJUM#9924
If you have 50 utxo of 1 PIRATE (on 1 or more z-addresses) and you send 50 PIRATE (in 1 tx) to one z-address, doesn't it result the same as using z_mergetoaddress?

[09-Sep-18 02:38 PM] zatJUM#9924
how do you know how many "notes" (=utxos ?) you have ? With transparent utxos I use "listunspent", but with Z I don't know!

[09-Sep-18 02:43 PM] zatJUM#9924
I will try that after my rig rental is ended üòâ

[09-Sep-18 05:07 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@webworker01, have you considered linking people to ZecProxy and giving instructions on how to use it?

It is a great way for people to boost their mining speed and it can only help the pool overall if people know how to use it.

Also, may want to consider native zstratum addresses for the pool.

Anyway, here is a link to the GitHub repo:

never seen that, looks pretty interesting

[09-Sep-18 05:21 PM] Alright#0419
don't understand how a proxy will increase shares

[09-Sep-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
I used a different proxy for a while and didn't notice a difference

[09-Sep-18 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
only with like 1.5ksol though

[09-Sep-18 05:23 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
It is a local host proxy so not a real proxy. However, it also uses zstratum (which is optimized for equihash) rather than the standard stratum protocol.

[09-Sep-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it probably prevents stale shares by having one persistent connection that instantly syncs with peers on a local network, would be my guess

[09-Sep-18 05:26 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I suppose it is more about latency. It reduces the connections and feeds your mining software packets optimized for equihash rather than a standard hashing algo.

[09-Sep-18 05:26 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
The proxy or the protocol?

[09-Sep-18 05:36 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I am already using the proxy successfully but it may be cross compatible with standard stratum. Either way, here is the zstratum changes:

https://github.com/slushpool/poclbm-zcash/wiki/Stratum-protocol-changes-for-ZCash

As you can see, slushpool implements it.

I believe optiminer has native support for zstratum and zstratum over TLS.

I believe the proxy converts a standard stratum pool to zstratum.

[09-Sep-18 05:37 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Which is why I can use it.

[09-Sep-18 05:39 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
The proxy supports TLS in the options.

[09-Sep-18 05:44 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
Also going to disconnect my miner for a bit so I can actually use my computer. As I don't have a dedicated mining device and Pirate is still quite young, I am able to mine like $0.40 worth overnight, which for me is fine because I long term hodl my crap so a super young coin like this can make bank for me. :P
