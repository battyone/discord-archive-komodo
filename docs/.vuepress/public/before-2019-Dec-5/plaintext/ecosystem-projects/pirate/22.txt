@Paul  please send me another Z address @miles  if you can please send us a screen of that zaddress it would be better, the address you sent is too big to be a z address.

[07-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Hermes#6934
this address you sent is not being validated it's too long ...

[07-Sep-18 04:52 PM] Paul#0981
@Hermes is it ok tomorrow?

[07-Sep-18 04:54 PM] Hermes#6934
First 50 users to provide validate address will get it üòé  I think you can make it

A pirate, with a peg leg, a hook for a hand, and an eye patch, is sitting at a bar and a guy walks up and asks him how he lost his leg.  The pirate responds: ‚ÄúArrr I went into the swamps to bury me treasure and a damn crock attacked me from the bushes and bit me leg off before I could fight him off with me sword.‚Äù
The guy thinks this is a pretty entertaining story, so a couple rums later asks the pirate how he ended up with a hook for a hand.  To which the pirate responded: ‚ÄúI went back to get me treasure, but this time I thought I was ready for the crock so when I got close to me treasure and he jumped out to attack me I suck my sword down his throat and he bit me hand off!‚Äù
By this point the guy can‚Äôt wait to hear the next story so he asks the pirate if the crock took his eye too.  The pirate again responded: ‚ÄúI wish!  It was my first day with this here hook,‚Äù as he waved the hook in the mans face, ‚Äúand I was on my ship looking up at the clouds and a seagull shat in me eye!‚Äù

OK.  I hadn't synched in a while so it's going to take a few.

[07-Sep-18 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to have the privkey of the z addr to access the funds

[07-Sep-18 10:19 PM] SHossain#0007
ü§î

[07-Sep-18 10:20 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe by running any native wallet üòÉ

[07-Sep-18 10:20 PM] SHossain#0007
or directly using the PIRATE chain

[07-Sep-18 10:20 PM] c2k#4915
oh has to be native. ive only been running electrum

[07-Sep-18 10:20 PM] SHossain#0007
z_addr and z_tx only works with native (for now)

[07-Sep-18 10:21 PM] c2k#4915
ok nevermind then. i guess im gonna have to miss out on some free pirate booty

[07-Sep-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
you still have chance. 50 lucky users didn't apply yet. üòÉ

[07-Sep-18 10:23 PM] c2k#4915
i hear ya. but with a bunch of different coins in agama im comfortable keeping it in electrum. have never done it any other way

[07-Sep-18 10:24 PM] c2k#4915
i do have a verus Agama wallet running native on another pc tho. will that help?

[07-Sep-18 10:24 PM] c2k#4915
@SHossain

[07-Sep-18 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. all these z addresses are ok. as long as you have the privkey for the address

[07-Sep-18 10:30 PM] SHossain#0007
future Agama version will have PIRATE integrated for native mode

@c2k  you could use a chain that doesn't take so much to load as Zilla or EQL and select get new address, then select Private (z) address

[07-Sep-18 10:50 PM] wookie#7663
Since there's no wallet yet and I'm just working off a z address generated from kmd, is there anyway that I can "see" the pirate transactions that are going into my z address? @SHossain @webworker01

Two pirates drink. Drank few. One only reached for the snack, the second to him:
- What are you doing?!
- And what?
- We do not eat after six  remember ?!
- And what, six already?
"Six - look yourself!"
He (counting bottles of rum):
- One, two, three, four, five, six .... Aaaaa, well then we do not eat!
And puts a snack in place.

[07-Sep-18 11:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL please post your z address

Thanks for helping guys. I can just wait for the lite wallet in Agama?

[08-Sep-18 02:15 AM] SHossain#0007
Lite wallet wouldn't help with z address. you need native mode.

[08-Sep-18 02:16 AM] wookie#7663
ok, will there be a native pirate wallet upcoming soon?

[08-Sep-18 02:16 AM] SHossain#0007
currently Agama doesn't supprot PIRTAE chain. Future version will have it

[08-Sep-18 02:18 AM] xoso#1057
why wait for pirate wallet, when you can just use agama bundled komodod
