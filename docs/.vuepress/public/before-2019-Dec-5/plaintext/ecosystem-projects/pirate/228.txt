Verus has a lot of aspects that are hard to sum up here.   @miketout and his team can help you get answers here.

it will all start after we get the first exchange - there will be place to "create" and direct buyers

[26-Oct-18 04:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
right now attracting buyers does not make much sense as OTC is quite limited tool

[26-Oct-18 04:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
CG how can aI put angry face next to my name ?

[26-Oct-18 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as OTC is quite limited tool`
It's kinda sad how many people just don't realize how wrong their prices are based on nothing more than the fact that they "can't sell" to 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of 1% of the population

[26-Oct-18 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as for the face: https://emojipedia.org/people/ <- paste the character just like as if it were ©,ª,«,¬, or anything else

[26-Oct-18 04:25 PM] Oszy#5734

any pirate got mercy ?

[26-Oct-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've thought about it, but I feel that it would only encourage the cycle in the short-term

[26-Oct-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
several times, I've thought about buying them all out until they can't afford to mine anymore :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 04:38 PM] Flexatron#8809
Do it

[26-Oct-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Flexatron When I get my new batch of miners, I'm likely to 😝

[26-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Jaki#9826
Do I need Komodo Agama address or just Z-address in Agama Native modo to start mining? Thx

[26-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
Z

[26-Oct-18 04:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Think they only sell what they can afford to sell tho(if they are smart)

[26-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`(if they are smart)` 🤐

[26-Oct-18 04:54 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I do not know your $$ situation, and obviously it would be a coup of a lifetime if/when it works out & Pirate takes off.That said if in the opposite case they were to find you dangling someplace, I would rather you did not buy everyone out...

[26-Oct-18 04:54 PM] Jaki#9826
One beginner question. What is better to start mining VerusCoin or ARRR? Thx

[26-Oct-18 04:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
Verus is on a cex

[26-Oct-18 04:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
Arrr is a hodl

[26-Oct-18 04:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
Pick your choice

[26-Oct-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako It's a matter of simple math - worst case is I sell it all to james and take a $900 loss :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jansako#3330
More like 900/day, even if you are personally mining 2/3 of the blocks (estimate)

[26-Oct-18 05:02 PM] jansako#3330
I know, some of the others would not sell either etc

[26-Oct-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure which unicorn's ass you pulled "a day" from, but I need 🍽 bbl

[26-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
256 blck reward * 60 *24 = 368k Pirate per day.

[26-Oct-18 05:04 PM] jansako#3330
If you assume (yes, I know) that 100k you must buy /day
The price would not dip below 0.11, and you would get 0.1 back from James as worst case... I was actually low... because math...
