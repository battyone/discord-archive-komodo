[12-Oct-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At the point that HUSH has dropped to 1/40th its value and PIRATE is 2.1x more profitable than HUSH, it's not really a 🍾 moment, imo

[12-Oct-18 02:02 PM] abcdelweb#0752
we report your currency to the site and we will delete it from the site. because you do not have money to change

[12-Oct-18 02:03 PM] abcdelweb#0752
we tried to change several times at bargain prices without results

@abcdelweb you are every reason that I never want server privileges

[12-Oct-18 02:06 PM] abcdelweb#0752
the same is not the possibility to change and as a result there is never a sufficient volume of coins to stay in the market

[12-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
are there no higher buy offers than my 0.1?

[12-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
did the 0.14 offer sell?

[12-Oct-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we need actual buy prices for the calculator

[12-Oct-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Oct-18 02:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
so we agree on 0.18?

[12-Oct-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe price should be 0.15

[12-Oct-18 02:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
0.15 it is

@abcdelweb dafuq are you on about?

[12-Oct-18 02:18 PM] abcdelweb#0752
0.5 kmd of gain on each pirate are sufficient the rest must be returned

[12-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Acura#2748
OMG

[12-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
write whatever you're talking about in your native language and let me find a translator, because you're making no sense

[12-Oct-18 02:20 PM] abcdelweb#0752
ok

[12-Oct-18 02:20 PM] abcdelweb#0752
0,5KMD di guadagno su 1ARRR è sufficente per i titolari

[12-Oct-18 02:20 PM] abcdelweb#0752
il resto deve essere commerciabile

[12-Oct-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
1 ARR price on the calculator was 0.19, which was indeed the price it was trading at before the hashrate fell recently

[12-Oct-18 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
to expect 2.5x the gain seems quite ridiculous

[12-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I sold at 0.145

@jl777c  ridiculous is not to change the coins

[12-Oct-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
why would anybody pay you 0.5 KMD for PIRATE today?

lmao that was funny...

[12-Oct-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if hashrate was 300Msols, then ok

[12-Oct-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I will buy you 180 PIRATE for 90 KMD, but only if PIRATE hashrate goes to 300Msols with 24hours

is the calculator showing PIRATE at 3x more profitable than any other equihash now?

what's the link, I'm too lazy to scroll back 3 days

[12-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is is only 2x more profitable, then we should just go with that as I will buy PIRATE at 0.1 KMD in bulk

If you can sell 300k per day, then yes it's about right

[12-Oct-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
I would imagine others can buy above my floor price and have been as I am not getting any sellers

[12-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I meant that if the buyers will buy 300k per day at 0.15, then that calc is about right based on 33 minis putting out 500ksol/s

[12-Oct-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we probably dont have enough buyers without more pirates

[12-Oct-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if buyers only buy 150k, then profitability halves
