Only in 'Murica can a fast-food place wrap 2 tacos inside 2 barritos and sell it faster than they can make it 😂

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you should see a typical german 'grillbude' (bratwurst, chicken, fries and the likes)

[29-Sep-18 08:49 AM] 0x03#8822
thats our version of 'we sell faster than we can prepare'

[29-Sep-18 08:50 AM] 0x03#8822
currywurst is very popular (bratwurst in a curry-ketchup mixture)

[29-Sep-18 08:50 AM] 0x03#8822
oh, curry powder.

[29-Sep-18 08:50 AM] Hot#2427

[29-Sep-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
how comes an american spells 'whisky' without `e`

[29-Sep-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
capsicum is the latin name yes

[29-Sep-18 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I didn't remember or knew many english names of foods/veges before I came to NZ 😄

[29-Sep-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky#Names_and_spellings`

[29-Sep-18 08:55 AM] 0x03#8822
for example, scotch bonnet would be called 'capsicum chinense'

[29-Sep-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822
albeit the jamaican variant

[29-Sep-18 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how comes an american spells 'whisky' without e`
We don't 😛

[29-Sep-18 08:57 AM] 0x03#8822
true, you say 'burbon' instead 😄

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, that's a different creature

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
and spelt 'whiskey' 😄

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
i need a new keyboard.

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
burbon = whiskey made by rednecks

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
hah

[29-Sep-18 08:58 AM] 0x03#8822
wild turkey is an awesome redneck whiskey btw

[29-Sep-18 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Got kicked out of my favorite bar the last time I drank that

[29-Sep-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
here it would be 'premium' level

[29-Sep-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
we're sadly tortured with mr. beam and mr jack a lot

[29-Sep-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
and not the proper olden variants

[29-Sep-18 08:59 AM] 0x03#8822
but all sorts of 'honey oat' crap or apple-something flavour

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if Wild turkey =  'premium' level, then you people don't know good alcohol :trollface:

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
*shivers*

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
hah

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
well, you should try blutwurz

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wild turkey- shit tastes like lighter fluid

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822
we have a different take at spirits 😄

[29-Sep-18 09:00 AM] 0x03#8822

meh, what do I know, I drink my espresso so strong that my wife calls it "coffee bean juice" 😛

[29-Sep-18 09:03 AM] 0x03#8822

💯 

[29-Sep-18 09:03 AM] 0x03#8822

[29-Sep-18 09:04 AM] 0x03#8822
an italian friend recenly gave me a 2-cup espresso cooker

[29-Sep-18 09:04 AM] 0x03#8822
this thing is lovely

[29-Sep-18 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I got lazy and bought one of those new automatic makers
press a button twice, come back in 2 minutes, and you have 4oz of tar syrup 😃

[29-Sep-18 09:06 AM] 0x03#8822
i removed them in favour of the cooker and my french presses

[29-Sep-18 09:06 AM] ch6ris#5240
I love your black beans.

[29-Sep-18 09:06 AM] 0x03#8822
i had one of these capsule machines. decent product

[29-Sep-18 09:07 AM] 0x03#8822
but too expensive plus waste-intensive too

[29-Sep-18 09:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, a french press is over-rated and makes coffee taste like it was strained through granny's old pantyhose

[29-Sep-18 09:08 AM] ch6ris#5240
I like instant moccona. but nobody asked what you like.

[29-Sep-18 09:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ch6ris no one ever asks waht I like, but that never stops me from saying how I feel 😉

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-Sep-18 09:09 AM] 0x03#8822
i found the french press secret to be 3 things: 
- coarsely ground coffee
- at 80 deg. celcius
- 4 min

[29-Sep-18 09:10 AM] 0x03#8822
and yes you can make ugly beverages that should've been coffee with it too

[29-Sep-18 09:10 AM] 0x03#8822
but with a bit of playing around i'll easily match the automatic machines

[29-Sep-18 09:10 AM] 0x03#8822
in terms of taste

[29-Sep-18 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I spend 9000 hrs a day in front of a PC, dafuq makes you think I have time to "play around" with making coffee? 😛

[29-Sep-18 09:11 AM] 0x03#8822
then it's not your fuel 😛

[29-Sep-18 09:12 AM] 0x03#8822
or atleast not enough haha

[29-Sep-18 09:12 AM] 0x03#8822

[29-Sep-18 09:12 AM] ch6ris#5240
Hey, a question History Transaction is blank by default right? Only had incoming transactions. It's not my wallet.
