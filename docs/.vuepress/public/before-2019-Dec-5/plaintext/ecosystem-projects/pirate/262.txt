@LoPhatMelk coinbase would be up to the KMD team.  I’m not a part of that but I am certain @Steve Lee has at least opened the discussion with them.   
That’s probably a real tough nut to crack.

You will have UTXO issues I imagine so please use a native walllet to mine or buy from dexstats.

Hello all.  Earlier I sent some ARRR to digitialprice and the transaction in my wallet said successful, the coins are gone but they are not in my wallet on DP.  Anyone have any insight into this somehow being normal or a known hiccup?

[04-Nov-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
How long ago?

[04-Nov-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Send dig pri a ticket if it was more than an hour.

[04-Nov-18 05:15 AM] TwoChiefs#3167
it was about 12hrs ago

[04-Nov-18 05:15 AM] TwoChiefs#3167
also, when using the Agama wallet, do I have to activate the coin everytime i want to use the wallet?  or is there a way to save the coin as activated?

[04-Nov-18 05:17 AM] house#8741
Activate the coin of your choice each time you open the wallet @TwoChiefs

[04-Nov-18 05:19 AM] TwoChiefs#3167

ok, digging deeper into this transfer problem:  i re-opened the wallet and i can't find the transaction listed.  I only see input transactions.  BUT the coins are definitely gone.... am I missing something in the UI?

indeed matey, i reckoned as much.  but this here landlubber didn't record the transaction info from the ol' log records.  yee be thinkin' if i just be giving them the sending address they can rustle up my coins from the lower decks?

[04-Nov-18 05:32 AM] blackbeard#8888
Aye, they be shorely havin' an accord

[04-Nov-18 05:32 AM] TwoChiefs#3167
or i suppose in the spirit of privacy they don't be having the sender's address?

[04-Nov-18 05:34 AM] blackbeard#8888

I mentor @Cpollo_  and help them list on exchanges. I work with only the best companies, turning down 9 out of every 10 offers to partner up, and CPOLLO is one of the best. Today, CPOLLO is being listed on IDAX. More will soon be coming. Congratulations partner.

If i understand this correct, there are guys that are buying on the Onboardingsite and send the Pirates directly for the deposit & sell on Digitalprice? 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️

[04-Nov-18 07:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is there article which explains how exactly Pirates did that there is no transparent tx allowed? some tech detailes behind it ?

[04-Nov-18 07:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They can but the sell orders are not likely to get filled.  
Never fear.... In the next few weeks @CHMEX will be hopefully putting some final touches on the evolved onboarding program.

[04-Nov-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
any non-notary taddr destination makes a tx invalid

[04-Nov-18 07:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it requires notary nodes ?

[04-Nov-18 07:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It will no longer be a vending machine and isntead be an incentivized program.

[04-Nov-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW requires notaries

[04-Nov-18 07:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Still in dev / testing so don't hold us to any dates.

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
@FishyGuts I already saw the first bot /script which I assumed tried to do exactly that it bought small volumes.
So if the onboarding is cheaper than the CEX they will buy there and try to sell instantly
It increased the trx count so not that bad

🐙 

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This is true.

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
regarding onboarding - why to keep it while we have digiprice?

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
we should motivate people to use official CEX to boost officla volumes , right?

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
people can also buy small volumes there

[04-Nov-18 07:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
My concern only lies with replenishing the ARRR for better uses than people who want to game the system.

[04-Nov-18 07:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I know that you and James are on top of that and trust your math 😛

[04-Nov-18 07:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but this is exactly all about - such entires like onboarding fixed price allways attracts gamers

[04-Nov-18 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you can really be sure one person is not buying to many addresses

[04-Nov-18 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and if it pays off you can actually assume son

[04-Nov-18 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
only good thing with that is the crypto calculator was using that price

[04-Nov-18 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but now it's not necessary ?

[04-Nov-18 07:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as long as digiprice report to that calculator ?

[04-Nov-18 07:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As of right now Pass... if they buy at onboarding, they are losing money market selling.... and margin is less than 5% on quick gains.

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So in terms of price or someone gaining an advantage,   not concerned.

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but things changes

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And so does the onboarding price 😃

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what is right now can be not valid 10min later

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
onboarding price will be changed to ask price

[04-Nov-18 07:56 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if the price is taken from digiprice then whatever 😃

[04-Nov-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
until we had an external reference price, we didnt have an external reference price

[04-Nov-18 07:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Again, my only concern is having a sustainable program for the future onbaoridng program.

[04-Nov-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
now that we do, we can incorporate it

[04-Nov-18 07:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
SO to reitarate for all... 
About onboarding... 
 if they buy at onboarding, they are losing money market selling.... and margin is less than 5% on "quick" gains.
So in terms of price or someone gaining an advantage,  noone should be too concerned.  
This onboarding also increases the shielded pool in addition to other things we are doing to create an utterly unstoppable privacy protocol.

[04-Nov-18 07:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
