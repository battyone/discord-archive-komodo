we need active pirates

[07-Oct-18 07:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Horizen maintains the shielded activity artificially - a 'staked' node is required to send a shielded transaction once every three days, in exchange for a daily payout.

[07-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Flexatron#8809
Lol

[07-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
20,500 nodes don't think it's such a bad idea.

[07-Oct-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
run by how many different "stakers"?

[07-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
harder to estimate - I think the highest individual is around 200

[07-Oct-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the payout? is it more than AWS instance

[07-Oct-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then it could be one guy running 20,000 instances

[07-Oct-18 07:31 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you need to lock 42 zen for each stake

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
seems cheaper just to spam the network with thousands of ztransactions

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] furshure123#1929
not sure if this is correct channel but im trying to generate a pirate addy and have the PIRATE chain fully syncd via komodod

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so a whale could have a few million ZEN and get thousands of such nodes

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] furshure123#1929
and im getting the following error

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
#deleted-channel if you are new

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
payments running at 0.045 ish per day

[07-Oct-18 07:32 PM] furshure123#1929
error: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)

[07-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@jl777c bunch of other criteria also - single IP addresses, less than 300seconds  compute time

[07-Oct-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so about $20 per month, that a $5/mo VPS can easily do. free $15/mo, no wonder there are 20,000

[07-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
exactly

[07-Oct-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a big waste of $400,000 per month

[07-Oct-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
get a bank of ip addresses, a single decent server that can run virtual instances. and it is once per 3 days so a single CPU can do this for a LOT of different nodes

[07-Oct-18 07:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s just part of their masternode sales pitch.   I personally did not see the upside to runnning a zen node and sold all of my zen recently.

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
lost the point though - pirate needs to beat the tx's to brag

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I was only showing about $10 a month profit when I calculated so I passed.

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
20% interest gain on holdings is not appealing to me with a volatile asset like crypto.

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] furshure123#1929
@webworker01 komodod shows running and im watching log file and chain is activly syncing

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to get a large number of ip addresses and use a single server to be 1024 nodes

[07-Oct-18 07:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would rather put it in my existing product at 11%

[07-Oct-18 07:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If the product doesn’t perform I get a house not a wallet.dat win useless coins

[07-Oct-18 07:38 PM] furshure123#1929
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 is the command im using to start the daemon

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Are artificially created shielded transactions something we should even be concerned with?

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Can we find out how many P2P shielded transactions there are?

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
well any ztx is a ztx and increases the anon set

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That’s true I guess.

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
chmex would have a count of ztx

[07-Oct-18 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We’re not taking throughout or use... we’re taking shielding.

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] furshure123#1929
@furshure123 i dont need to have KMD chain fully synced do i?

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So I see your point

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] furshure123#1929
if so i dont have that fully synced yet

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if we wanted to achieve a big count, we should just send a bunch out

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not needed for PIRATE chain

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Like I did yesterday with the contest. 
We will just have contests daily with 7.77 as the prize or .777 as the prize and slam up the transaction counts. 😂

[07-Oct-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as encrypted ztx goes, it can be a spam ztx or for 1 million PIRATE, all looks the same

[07-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
True

[07-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I get ya.

[07-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so lets get this metric (total and daily) for the ZEN, ZEC and PIRATE

[07-Oct-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and make it something we are #1 in

[07-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Can CHMEX or someone compile this to a dexstats site?

[07-Oct-18 07:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@FishyGuts  maybe the contest could be "come to test and see how pritate works - test conditions is you will get some Arrr change free"

[07-Oct-18 07:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So we as a community can all keep track and use it as motivation?

[07-Oct-18 07:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it would be like a payout for testing Agama wallet or sth

[07-Oct-18 07:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Can I run a eth style scam contest?   Send me .777 pirate and you can be entered to win 777 pirate?  😆

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Oct-18 07:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It should be static.    Send me .777 pirate and I will send you 7.77 back or

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Send me .777 Shielded KMD and receive 7.77 pirate

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
lets not do that

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
how will you know who has sent you .777 ARRR?

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don’t want it to be a raffle.   Not cool to make people pay to enter.

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if we need to send 10,000 ztx, just send 10,000 ztx

[07-Oct-18 07:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
More about getting people comfortable with sending a transactions.

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I could encourage Komodo ztx use with it too.

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyone with a prediction of the hashrate in the new week?

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
220

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ath

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Dr Debt#0891
There should be a walkthrough on consolidating utxos, so people don't get frustrated with send times and errors due to lack thereof.

[07-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I say 231 ath after vosk vid

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Dr Debt#0891
new weeks starts tomorrow?

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ll do a howto on that in the mining video. @Dr Debt

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Monday first day of the week

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I'll say 150 mSol

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Didnt we already hit 150?

[07-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or 140 🤔

[07-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891
rentals have since expired and rate has gone down.

[07-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Dr Debt#0891
104 right now

[07-Oct-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we hit 150+

[07-Oct-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810

*Posts picture of 100mh/s hashrate*

[07-Oct-18 07:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@FishyGuts  @Dr Debt  maybe add notification in Agama : detecting there is more then X (>10?) utxo's and that user should send to himself?

[07-Oct-18 07:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to speed up the wallet

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
LOL that's cute.  You think I am a dev.  😃

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe you know one 😃

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
j/k - JL has someone working on adding a merge button to agama which could help solve this.

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ah ok

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't know about the warning thing

[07-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That seems more like a @blackjok3r thing to do.

[07-Oct-18 08:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But on a script on his own system for his own use.

[07-Oct-18 08:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
warning / notifications is good - if you do it some people will see it when needed and will not come ask same questions over and over again here

[07-Oct-18 08:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
some % will still come, but hopefully some will not

[07-Oct-18 08:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
some will read 😃

[07-Oct-18 08:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
regarding bigger count of utxo's idk the cost, but one knowing how to loop could send transaction of 1 pirate back and forth all day long to generate more utxo's - but this is just a marketing trick, maybe just cheaper then what ZEN doing ?

[07-Oct-18 08:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
cost of z transaction is 0 ?

[07-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
limited number of zero transactions allowed per block - not sure of the PIRATE setting - so most likely 0.0002 per tx

[07-Oct-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 txfee

[07-Oct-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe 0.00011 per tx

[07-Oct-18 08:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so cost of 10000 trans daily is 1 pirate

[07-Oct-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
each one increases the anon set
