@CrisF I will not be managing giveaways if it happens. Someone else will.

[05-Sep-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I don't think restarting the chain after this much no ey was spent is a great idea. I still have 260k in a t address, willing to distributite that if needed?

[05-Sep-18 12:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just let me know what community decides

[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
M giving 250,000 PIRATE

[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If giveaways happen

[05-Sep-18 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
T-Z in one big send many to who ever is complaining the most seems quite easy we should just make announcement and collect Z address from these whiners.

[05-Sep-18 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can always mine some more than that, with sending from T its transparent that the transaction was indeed honoured.

[05-Sep-18 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To me seems like easiest solution, fine to help here if required

[05-Sep-18 12:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r cool! If u do t to z for ppl, then I can send those 250k to u in z.

[05-Sep-18 12:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
U can take care of the z address sending

[05-Sep-18 12:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Is that okay?

[05-Sep-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes fine with me

[05-Sep-18 12:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Great! üôÇüôèüèºüëç

[05-Sep-18 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Let me know how u want to proceed with it

[05-Sep-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I say we make the pool well known, and also announce an airdrop, and some reasonable instructions on how to get a zaddress.

[05-Sep-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then give people 2 weeks to provide address in BCT Ann. That should be easy enough.

[05-Sep-18 12:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also plz sort out the rules for this giveaway

[05-Sep-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK will work on something today and post here. Seems most were put forward here while I was asleep so will put that together.

[05-Sep-18 12:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Appreciate ur help mate üëçüôÇ

[05-Sep-18 12:29 AM] Don King#8901
I posted wtb 500kmd worth of PIRATE a couple of days ago, still interested if anyone is selling

[05-Sep-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```--------------
PIRATE Airdrop
--------------
We will be airdropping 250,000 PIRATE to people who missed out on early mining.
There is now a public pool with working payouts to Z-address, if you want to mine it easily thanks to Webworker01: https://pirate.komodostats.com
To qualify for the air drop all you need to do is supply a Z-address in this BCT ANN.
The airdrop will happen on: 19th of September 2018 cut off for supplying Z address is the day before 18th September at 0 UTC, any Z-address submitted after this time will not be included in the airdrop. The PIRATE will be divided evenly over the address's supplied. If 250,000 people apply you will each get 1.
Any accounts made after 1st September 2018 will not be included in the airdrop!```

[05-Sep-18 02:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@blackjok3r need another rule. Accounts registered after certain time/date will not be valid.

[05-Sep-18 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Something like that

[05-Sep-18 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a good idea... otherwise some ppl may make heaps of acounts and make my job very difficult

[05-Sep-18 02:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep

[05-Sep-18 02:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just refine James‚Äô idea further

BTT guy saying do airdrop to kmd holders

[05-Sep-18 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just cross passing msg

[05-Sep-18 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
Can there even be a 100% POS zksnark chain?

[05-Sep-18 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Doubt it

[05-Sep-18 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
That's my thinking

[05-Sep-18 02:35 AM] bishop#9773
need a taddr but you only get that from the initial mined coins prior to shielding.

[05-Sep-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cannot PoS a Z chain like this at all, unless you soemhow staked only UTXO of 0 in size... the less coins you ahve the more blocks you get üòÇ

[05-Sep-18 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Airdrop to KMD holders is too far over my head. I can send a/or some sendmany/s from my T address given a list of Z address ut thats about all I could manage.

[05-Sep-18 06:40 AM] CrisF#3405
@grewalsatinder Hi, sorry, I didn't realize you were upset before when I saw your offer.
Unfortunate situation but don't take it too personally.  I don't see you doing any wrong, just the opposite.
I'm willing to help out sending coins or whatever I can do.
Let me know if there is anything.
Pirate is a great idea and there will be some very interesting uses that come up I'm sure.

[05-Sep-18 06:43 AM] CrisF#3405
üíÄ üó° ü§∫

[05-Sep-18 06:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
No problem üôÇüëç

[05-Sep-18 06:53 AM] CrisF#3405
What part of the Z transaction prevents its use on Barterdex?

[05-Sep-18 06:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Barterdex doesn‚Äôt support z tx
It‚Äôs designed around t tx only

[05-Sep-18 06:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It must be possible to dex it, but further experiment will be needed. I can‚Äôt say how hard or difficult it might be, coz it definitely won‚Äôt be easy.

[05-Sep-18 07:00 AM] CrisF#3405
I was impressed with how quickly the guys came up with solutions to new problems so far.
Wasn't sure how hard it would be to make a pirate room on BD.

[05-Sep-18 07:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Z transaction BD room/ability has marketing potential, if not too much practicality advantage.

[05-Sep-18 07:03 AM] CrisF#3405
I like the idea of turning this misunderstanding into an opportunity to promote the chain, and KMD as a whole.

[05-Sep-18 07:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Many products, JUMBLR, BD, asset chains etc are connected.

[05-Sep-18 07:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe a ```treasure hunt``` or something by marketing.

[05-Sep-18 07:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Easy to explain this misunderstanding clearly and offer a solution.

[05-Sep-18 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
I'm fine with a restart too (though i mined a couple of precious PIRATE myself)

[05-Sep-18 07:16 AM] jorian#4555
but airdrop would be nice too

[05-Sep-18 07:16 AM] jorian#4555
lesson for grewal: always make alter ego üòÑ

[05-Sep-18 07:45 AM] CrisF#3405
The way I see it everyone here did the the perfectly understandable thing at the right time.
Pirate took on a life of its own thanks to the hard work and skills of those contributing.

Here's what I saw:

-  @Deleted User  came up with a 'why didn't I think of that' idea (Z-only chain)
-  People want to experiment with the idea and test it
-  This idea move from #private-staked   (open-to-all discord channel)
-  No way, apart from OTC, to out funds
-  Interesting idea shared outside, and to this new, open to anyone, discord ( #pirate  ) channel
-  Suggestion to call it experimental so people don't loose time, money or resources by investing the same with no way out
-  A way to do t-transaction is found (?)
-  People with new asics to play with test them out
-  Satinder and others offer to and buy coins for KMD
-  People start suggesting to promote the chain and make it something more that than an experiment
-  Community is interested
-  People not participating in this open-to-all channel complain (I didn't read any of this so just inference)
-  Mining pool built
-  Satinder offers to give up his PIRATE that he purchased from his own KMD
-  People in this community come up with ideas to rectify bad feelings and find a proper and fair course of action

There are probably things I have forgotten or messed up in the above (feel free to add), but for anyone who cares to, everything is in the üëÜ  channel above and can be found originating in #ask-jl777 .  Check it out.

I've got to say, you guys in this community are pretty fucking awesome.   That will be clear to anyone who bothers to look into this.

For those who don't, well, you are really missing out.

@grewalsatinder  You have had a great idea and acted upon it.  Much respect üí™   Please keep up the great work.  And enjoy your day!!

[05-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jorian#4555

@CrisF thanks for kind words. yes your description sums up pretty fine

[05-Sep-18 07:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

anyone selling?

[05-Sep-18 07:59 AM] xoso#1057
wat price pirate?

[05-Sep-18 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CrisF to start with, I only came to conversation in #ask-jl777 channel

[05-Sep-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then I guess, the next day I found it's mined for last 20+ hrs, so I joined late

[05-Sep-18 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then mined some blocks and did try to confirm if the t-t is possible or partial amount of mined coins is possible to send to t-z and I have been publically pasting my test commands and results in #private-staked channel

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that was kinda taking over that channel. guys over there might have felt a little üòÑ

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks to @jl777c we got #pirate channel that day

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and BTT thread

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
before #ask-jl777 what happened, I don't know

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Deleted User might have started the conversation... which I'm not aware of

[05-Sep-18 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just came across anon z tx only assetchain and I followed from there

[05-Sep-18 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and @jorian just launched the chain

[05-Sep-18 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
üòÑ

[05-Sep-18 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was too excited to not realise this which I was excited about could have fired back on me. Just because I made BTT thread to let ppl know that they can mine it
