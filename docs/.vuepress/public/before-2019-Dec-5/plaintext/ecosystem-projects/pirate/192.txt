And then redo it all after sapling?

[19-Oct-18 11:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"redo"

[19-Oct-18 11:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You want to wait to April to make all these moves?

People still havent worked out how to check balance privately with the tip bots. DM the bots with !tip balance

[20-Oct-18 12:07 AM] sclear#0274
Prefix has been properly configured to !arrrtip

[20-Oct-18 12:10 AM] Zach#9973
It’s !arrrtip in public and just !tip in DM right?

[20-Oct-18 12:12 AM] sclear#0274
actually it should be arrrtip in both channels

[20-Oct-18 12:12 AM] sclear#0274
I will probably reconfigure kmdtip for the same behaviour. It's more consistent

[20-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Zach#9973
Good to know

[20-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Dr Debt#0891

it's chewing non stop, I am monitoring the progress 😃

[20-Oct-18 01:58 AM] crumb#2550
the first two 500 round by Fishy are going to take a while i guess. they were sent couple of hours ago already

[20-Oct-18 01:59 AM] sclear#0274
Actually, those rounds were not sent correctly due to some protocol limitations. This has been fixed in the meantime.

[20-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Zach#9973
I think I got the ARRR from those though

[20-Oct-18 02:07 AM] sclear#0274
Some users did yeah

[20-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Exile13#4458
N()()b question, when mining on piratepool is there a way to view confirmed shares? Or just wait for a payout? Thank you!

[20-Oct-18 04:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
look up your worker

[20-Oct-18 04:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://piratepool.io/workers

[20-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Exile13#4458
Yes, I see shares being reset when blocks are found, just saw the tipbot option

[20-Oct-18 04:21 AM] Exile13#4458
But the confirmed shares from that bot don’t change when we find blocks

[20-Oct-18 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what "bot" are you on about?

[20-Oct-18 04:24 AM] Exile13#4458
Nvm I was confusing two things, the kmd tipbot

[20-Oct-18 04:25 AM] Exile13#4458
Balance is still 0 on the worker page

[20-Oct-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
balance is not shares

[20-Oct-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
balance is what your shares have earned out of total shares

[20-Oct-18 04:27 AM] CombatWombat#0279
