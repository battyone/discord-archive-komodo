The bottom one is the smallest possible visible version (Which is smaller than is should be my sizing was off).

looks foggy the small ones?

[05-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Flexatron#8809
other than that awesome AF!

[05-Nov-18 05:57 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
I see what you did there...

[05-Nov-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
My format is bad....

[05-Nov-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The right sized version has it show up better but its just to show as SMALL as possible.

[05-Nov-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
16 x 16 - Gotcha üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
don't mean to be funny but the stem seems a bit short

[05-Nov-18 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
sort of like a reversed Q or squashed P

[05-Nov-18 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
just my 0.02 ARRR üòÑ

[05-Nov-18 06:10 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
Would be cool to some how incorporate a lock symbol to it, something showing off the privacy aspect.

[05-Nov-18 06:12 PM] TorJado#3802

It is a nice logo.

[05-Nov-18 06:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We need more than a logo though.  We need an entire image.

[05-Nov-18 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù for Pirate, if youbwill.

[05-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Flexatron#8809
Mine's warm and fuzzy:rum: :rum:

[05-Nov-18 06:53 PM] crumb#2550
simple 'P' with a little longer stem like suggested above would be a great logo. looks good big and small

[05-Nov-18 06:54 PM] crumb#2550
all kinds of additional details would be a distraction and invisible when used on 16x16 pixel sized logo

[05-Nov-18 06:54 PM] crumb#2550
less is more, when it comes to logos

I think the conception of the P with the eyepatch is totally great. I just love it.

[05-Nov-18 08:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I agree.   Web was right, it's a community fave.

[05-Nov-18 08:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Minus the spelling error

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Bikob2#4549
Good, but can be better

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Bikob2#4549
I still have a felling that someone with lack of design experience do it.

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Bikob2#4549
it's good but not pixel perfect

[05-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Oszy#5734
I am not so sure about the colors

[05-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Bikob2#4549
I mentioned before. Let's hire someone for 2k.

[05-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Bikob2#4549
We need someone really cool. Great site will moon our coin

[05-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
;p

[05-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
but yea..weird look

[05-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Flexatron#8809
the pattern reminds me of DNA

[05-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
should that be the sea?

[05-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Flexatron#8809
üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's just a template background.   
I like the dna / trading / digital idea.   Needs to be a different texture.

[05-Nov-18 08:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And yes sort of like the sea

[05-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
ah okay

[05-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Flexatron#8809
thought it was designed already

[05-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Llama#1330
i could make a better one than that

[05-Nov-18 08:59 PM] Bikob2#4549
Pirate is the only one truly private coin, it's really unique.  Let's give it out through the design.

[05-Nov-18 08:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The guy was just sending me ideas for website backgrounds.

[05-Nov-18 08:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Still open to ideas honestly.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you guys have templates send em.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The Perlin one someone sent last week was on our radar.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It looked nice.

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] Bikob2#4549
yes, that was me

[05-Nov-18 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes.   I would like to mix the digital / DNA/ Trading candles type look with that perlin fluidity

[05-Nov-18 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
An homage to the OG pirate.black site.

[05-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Bikob2#4549
Our DNA is privacy

[05-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Bikob2#4549
let's play with it

[05-Nov-18 09:02 PM] akibebi#2853
Common guys...
Mostly of us agree with the P with eyepatch.
The is something I can call a logo and can built content on/with it. 
This one can‚Äôt be compared with The Logo.
I can‚Äôt see anything in it, this is mostly a template of a flyer or something... 
DNA patterns? Yes, it looks like but how to connect Dezoxiribonucleid-acid with being Pirate? lol
If there are waves on it, and the main thing is being Pirate, then a ship is needed at least. I can continue, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone, of course. 
Sorry, but this is my opinion. ü§ó

[05-Nov-18 09:03 PM] akibebi#2853
DNA is Privacy???!!!

[05-Nov-18 09:04 PM] akibebi#2853
Ok. I got it. point of view...

[05-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Bikob2#4549
DNA of the coin I mean

[05-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Bikob2#4549
Let's nail it guys. Good design is not good enough for us. We need perfect design!

[05-Nov-18 09:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@akibebi The P is staying üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its the coin logo

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] akibebi#2853
Yeah... I got it... after seconds...

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The face of Pirate like the Bitcoin B

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The DNA wave thing would be a website background idea.

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] AndrewK#3947
We can put a bounty on the best voted design

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad to look at more options.  If you guys have shutterstock we can use any of those images.

[05-Nov-18 09:07 PM] jorian#4555
so first we let the community pick the ugliest logo ever made, and now we're going to ask the community for advice again? :abusedsmily:

@FishyGuts YESS!!!
DNA: maybe yess, but it need to be serious work (lol)
I understand that DNA is private and privacy but I can‚Äôt connect it to being Pirate in the usual term....

[05-Nov-18 09:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Doesnt have to be DNA..

[05-Nov-18 09:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would prefre more of a matrix style look or trading candles.

[05-Nov-18 09:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
DNA look does work too though.

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Flexatron#8809
hehe @jorian

[05-Nov-18 09:15 PM] akibebi#2853
If PirateChain would be a medical coin, or something what is connected to (AI-based) peptide-synthesized molecular research... or the human genom of us would be coded into blockchain...
My opinion is that this DNA-stuff is not a piratish enough, nor in usual terms neither in a figurative sense.

[05-Nov-18 09:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Definitely not going for a dna look.   We like DL the wave and digital look it presents.

[05-Nov-18 09:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Still up for review though.  Thank you for the input.

[05-Nov-18 09:24 PM] akibebi#2853
Being pirate ~ being white/black hacker ~ working with ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù stuff and/or in environment ~ doing something bad/good for ~ knowing the unknown/what others don‚Äôt ~ shipping on dark waters...

ohh and drinking rum and sing drunk songs that nobody knows of course!!! üòÄ

yeah, the matrix style is is a good idea for me
