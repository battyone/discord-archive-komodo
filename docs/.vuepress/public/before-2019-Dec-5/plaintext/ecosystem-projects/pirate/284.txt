I’ve asked him to download a wallet and send me a z addy, but I have no influence.

Who the f is Redbeard?

[09-Nov-18 01:13 AM] Redbeard#8343
Hit him up on twatter. Let him know that donations may be available if he provides a z-addy

We need to remind people what freedom really means...

many have no idea.

[09-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Redbeard#8343
I will start a twatter poll.(once I figure that) McAffe, Dotcom, who else? Would be the person you would pick as “celebrity” shill for $ARRR?

Assange would be awesome. Twatter polls are typically 4, one more. Satoshi doesn’t count, unless you know how to reach him.

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] IsekiSolari#2059
Maybe a silly question but...

Why PirateChain doesn’t start a GOFUNDME or KICKSTARTER to get money rolling for the project ?

I’m sure many people would be happy to give.

Just an update. minethepiratechain.black has paid out all outstanding payments. I am continuing to work on pool optimisation and will let you all know when we are back online. I have been time poor recently and haven't been able to get as much work done as I'd like.

@FishyGuts The ARRRtwitter event reward I have not received yet.

[09-Nov-18 03:58 AM] 花果山#5224
@Deleted User It is the previous reward for forwarding activities.

[09-Nov-18 04:00 AM] 花果山#5224
@Deleted User Forward once, reward 25ARRR.

@Deleted User The last time I said it was rewarded on Tuesday, and the result is Friday.

Don’t know how to @花果山 , hey!  It’s not paid out yet because fishyguts took it on personally to do it. He has a lot of tweets and pirates to sort. Give him a little time.
