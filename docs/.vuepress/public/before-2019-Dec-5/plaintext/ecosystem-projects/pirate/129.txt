Yep, now 10h average is 100,273,567 sols.

[06-Oct-18 11:52 AM] Flexatron#8809
Great

[06-Oct-18 11:55 AM] scubapanda#2485
Waiting for Coindesk etc. to learn about Pirate.. 100Msol can't go unnoticed much longer.

[06-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yea

[06-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I never knew ZEN had 200 Msol

[06-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
why does it have so much hashrate?

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Flexatron#8809
Or 100 is not a lot?

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Flexatron#8809
Dunno

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
5% of ZEC

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think until PIRATE is #2, it isnt really noticeable, this could just be some rum induced frenzy

[06-Oct-18 11:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
:rum:

[06-Oct-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
to be an XMR competitor, PIRATE needs take significant hash away from ZEC

[06-Oct-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
would be quite the news if PIRATE becomes the #1 equihashrate coin

[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
seems another 50% hashrate growth and PIRATE is #2, assuming historical 10%/day continues it seems next week

[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, maybe the hashrate will drop back to 30Msols

[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] 0x03#8822

maybe all z9 just explode

maybe it's all just chuck testa

[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
they have no warranty against lightning strikes

[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
or steamrollers

[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe a bunch of steamrollers crunches all z9 and there are no more ASIC

[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
Never say next week, right @scubapanda ?:trollface:

while i reckon that it may not have been fun to you, from the 'outside' it looked hilarious

[06-Oct-18 12:13 PM] 0x03#8822
it made for great entertainment, that much for sure

[06-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there were height activated rules changes so the old chain is still valid and chain splits avoided

[06-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
they just left all the height activations in, so until those heights it was the original testnet rules

[06-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
without proper validation

[06-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but its our fault they missed all this

[06-Oct-18 12:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
Zcash has roughly doubled its hashate in a month. Must be lots of asics shipping out. If zec price is not increasing soon, many miners might be looking for other coins, so in that sense we might see substantial hashrate growth too.

[06-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why being #2 is important

[06-Oct-18 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
if all z9 or z9 mini explodes, i'll mine with alien tech :treasure:

20% jump from when I went to sleep. Wow!

[06-Oct-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
53365 seems to be the last time below 100 Msol

[06-Oct-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is almost sustained for 10 hrs?

[06-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
It dipped down to 60 about 5 hrs ago

[06-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yup

[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Flexatron#8809
6-7 hr ago

[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
strange doesnt show on https://dexstats.info/piratehash.php

[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Dr Debt#0891
But was back at 100 when I called it a night

[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
oh sorry off by 300 blocks!

[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so 5hrs above 100 Msol

[06-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
53600 or so is the last time it crossed above 100

[06-Oct-18 01:01 PM] Dr Debt#0891
This is craaaaazzzyyyyy

[06-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Flexatron#8809
Yes this makes for a great story

[06-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Flexatron#8809

Oh wrong channel sorry. This q should be in newbies room

Would really like to start mining, but dont have any knowledge about mining:/Is it still profitible?

To some entity, somewhere, yes. You need to know your power usage, your rates, and your hash

Msol at 6hour low!

[06-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Flexatron#8809
Still 103 lmao

[06-Oct-18 02:51 PM] scubapanda#2485
Here are some calculations. Might be right or wrong.. 10h average is 105Msol. Last 24h 95Msol, 48h 88Msol, 72h 81 Msol, 5 days 66Msol and last 10 days average 47 Msol. So the trend is clearly up. For example 24 hours ago the average hashrate for  the preceding 10h was 85 Msol. Mining is getting roughly 10-20% more expensive by the day.

[06-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Flexatron#8809
Still under the radar

[06-Oct-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Flexatron I've never calculated cost per nh hash per coin per USD; mostly because I care not about USD

[06-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Flexatron#8809
Kmd is basically 1 usd so

[06-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Flexatron#8809
Atm

[06-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Flexatron#8809
I use these interchangeably ;p

[06-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but to me, it's not
my daily use KMD is x BTC value
my bill-pay KMD/USD value is whatever KMD/BTC/USD valu is on the 10th of a given month 
and my personal KMD/USD value will never be under $5 because I'll hold it until then

[06-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Flexatron#8809
So what's the cost in kmd:trollface:

[06-Oct-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
atm ~ 10k KMD per day üòõ
