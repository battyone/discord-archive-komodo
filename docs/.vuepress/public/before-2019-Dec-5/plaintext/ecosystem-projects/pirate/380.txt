[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and as we saw with CB, getting on the wrong exchange can be very damaging

[29-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> i rather get on a single top 10 real exchange than on 100 fake volume exchanges

[29-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <cryptoclueless> i never heard of dp, cryptobridge, graviex, until I found arrr

[29-Oct-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <cryptoclueless> finding arrr led to an exchange that could be used to purchase

[29-Oct-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> so the exchange didnt bring you to arrr, arrr brought you to the exchange

[29-Oct-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <cryptoclueless> yes

[29-Oct-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> If we build a larger community and raise volume on the exchanges that we are already on then real exchanges will be more inclined to list us

[29-Oct-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> how many people will lbank bring to arrr. likely less than 3

[29-Oct-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> we are already on CMC exchanges, there is no desperate need for any more, unless they are in the list of the 10 real volume exchanges

[29-Oct-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> get on the reputable media sites, start getting the bitcoin mixing crowd excited about ZatomicDEX

[29-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> PIRATE has limited resources, use it to dominate the trustless mixing market

[29-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i have contacted artem to get the ball rolling on arrr integration (or at least see what else is needed) in atomicdex

[29-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> So perhaps Pirate won't be a store of value but 'just' a means to use atomicdex?

[29-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> he is already aware of the tech side

[29-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> i've been testing lightwalletd (hacky zSPV) and cli lite wallet for the past few days and the rustlang code for the lite wallet could be ported if i understood the process correctly

[29-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> I've been leaning towards a bounty program but it's hard to get enough funds for that

[29-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> (i could be very wrong though)

[29-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @scubapanda assuming we succeed in making ARRR the most used coin for trustless mixing, what is the natural outcome of that

[29-Oct-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> when people understand that ARRR has the largest privacy set and can be atomic swapped to basically any other coin, then some percentage of the BTC mixing crowd will decide to keep some ARRR around

[29-Oct-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> where does the BTC mixing crowd reside?

[29-Oct-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> no idea

[29-Oct-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> find them, communicate how ARRR will have the best mixing, and it is trustless

[29-Oct-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> once its implemented, bitcointalk could be a good place to get a thread going

[29-Oct-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> back it up with an infographic that explains how it is much more private

[29-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> yes bitcointalk used to be a good place for this, not sure anymore as it has changed over the years

[29-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> maybe a signature campaign there might be worth exploring

[29-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> @Llama they reside in the Wasabi vs Samourai wallet beefs on twitter

[29-Oct-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> those are the main mixers in the btc community, and they fight constantly

[29-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> both of those have pathetically small anon sets

[29-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> ZatomicDEX donations accepted here 
`zs1zcvuz4gf826yp8trncj9l86a6xracrf2jk8lwz5v6xz7zntgmgahwrxw9rxu9jtthscex4aanpe`

[29-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> someone should research the size of wasabi and samurai anon sets, compare it to ARRR

[29-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Oszy> ^^ this is what we should raise money for not some crap exchange

[29-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> @jl777c If ARRR very much more volatile than lets say BTC then people could just use ARRR to go through the atomicdex? Like BTC-ARRR-ETH with two swaps on the atomicdex, without actually holding it.

[29-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> ARRR price is volatile, but over a span of an hour it wont change that much and on average will go up as much as down

[29-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> but yes, you can do a BTC -> ARRR -> ETH and basically get a private BTC/ETH trade

[29-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> or private BTC/ANYCOIN trade

[29-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> Good point üôÇ

[29-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> whoever finds the size of the anon sets let me know in DM and I'll make an infographic of sorts

[29-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> and if you have a stockpile of ARRR,  it is even more private as the timing of the swap isnt correlated to a small window in tme

`So perhaps Pirate won't be a store of value ` ``` What is a Store Of Value

A store of value is an asset that maintains its value without depreciating.```

[29-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> also, in regards to marketing, i have reached out to an experienced PR manager that is currently making a plan for us to tackle marketing, social media awareness, etc - it's a 2 stage approach spanning over a few months.
i didn't want to make this public until we had some results, but justin has taken over me

[29-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Hahaha

[29-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> Channel your inner Justin to make more pumpy announcements

[29-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> !kmdtip @mrlynch 1.777

[29-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> note: the PR manager is NOT justin

[29-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Cryptoon> To pump arrr that wouldnt completely be a bad thing offcourse

[29-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> Hi all

[29-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> I've been lurking in here for a while now and reading this conversation made me rethink a business approach.
I've been building a device for the past few months with input from some Pirate and Kmd community members and we have now decided to sell it for ARRR only for a limited period of time.

[29-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Llama> justin sun?

[29-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> It is still in testing phase and we're waiting on feedback and have a security audit in mind as well, but basically the device, Cerberus, is a UTM (unified threat management) that is easy to use by anyone. With an integrated firewall, intrusion detection system, network wide ad/tracker blocking, 1 year free VPN and a TOR port it is as easy to use as connecting it to your internet cable and then connect your devices via LAN or WiFi.

[29-Oct-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> I'm sorry, I'm not that familiar with crypto slang. I have an information security background

[29-Oct-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> hi @subjectX

[29-Oct-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> Hi

[29-Oct-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> @Llama lol, no, he's been cooking something really cool

[29-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <scubapanda> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢ Missed the point your educational quote again. I can stop participating in these discussions if it makes you feel strong.

[29-Oct-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> don't

[29-Oct-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> My point is that the term is overused and misapplied

[29-Oct-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> Hello @subjectX. Welcome!

[29-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> Hi. Glad to be here.

[29-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> Nice to see you finally posted üôÇ

[29-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> yes, we need new community members

[29-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> subjectX been here for a while now

[29-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> the thing he is cooking is really nice. i'm waiting to use that soon.

[29-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> It's almost ready and I was thinking long and hard on a way to give back to this community and I believe the best way at this point is to sell Cerberus only for ARRR for a period of time and then open the other payment processors.

[29-Oct-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> "new" meaning new to conversations
I'm tired of having the same 3 conversations with the same 9 people :trollface:

[29-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> @SHossain hey there, how is goin

[29-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <subjectX> Waiting to hear back from legal on order information retention as I don't want to keep that any longer than necessary, which is order processing and shipping.

[29-Oct-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> I'm good. Thanks @Zafer

[29-Oct-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Oct-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> raise funds, help developing ZatomicDEX. i believe you don't need anything else. when that is ready, i guess ARRR can be the highest liquidity on Z/atomicDEX

[29-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _longs for Z/atomicDEX_

[29-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> donation address for that is pinned

[29-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> we only accept ARRR, so if you have BTC feel free to exchange on tradeogre

[29-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> how about we use the ARRR we raised for the exchange airdrop that got cancelled?

[29-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> is't better altsbit?

[29-Oct-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> as far as hot wallets, my WLC wallet holds more value than my BTC wallet

[29-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> @mrlynch as the Z bounty grows, please post the total when it gains some significant amounts, i think if we can get it to 300,000 ARRR we could see a version in testing early next year, or maybe a bit sooner

[29-Oct-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> of course. i can post weekly/daily updates regardless of amount

[29-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <jl777c> we can make it a 150000 bounty on completion, with all amounts above that a bonus if it is completed by Q1 2020

[29-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <mrlynch> wow.. looks like we already have close to 80k ARRR.. thank you, whoever donated!

[29-Oct-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> nice

[29-Oct-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Flint> What about TradeOgre?

[29-Oct-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <SHossain> is that a top 10 exchange with real volume?
