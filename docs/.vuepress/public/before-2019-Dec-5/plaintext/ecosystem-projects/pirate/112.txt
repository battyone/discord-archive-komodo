agree... but I'm happy with English. Might like to learn Chinese or French may be.... 🤔 It's in my bucket list....

[04-Oct-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was mostly too lazy to learn English as a first language, much less try for 2+

[04-Oct-18 05:17 PM] groundhog#0062

[04-Oct-18 05:17 PM] groundhog#0062
i have version 0.2.41 or so do i need to update?

[04-Oct-18 05:17 PM] Llama#1330
@Flexatron does that auto update?

[04-Oct-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the latest Agama is set up for PIRATE use and yes you need latest

[04-Oct-18 05:18 PM] groundhog#0062

[04-Oct-18 05:18 PM] Flexatron#8809

[04-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Llama#1330

[04-Oct-18 05:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
only 42c will have PIRATE GUI

[04-Oct-18 05:44 PM] groundhog#0062
ok i did 😄

[04-Oct-18 05:47 PM] groundhog#0062
So how do i get started mining on a mac? 😄 tbh i have never mined a single coin b4 but if there is an explaination i will try 😄

[04-Oct-18 05:48 PM] 0x03#8822
PIRATE isn't for cpu mining

[04-Oct-18 05:48 PM] 0x03#8822
you're a bunch of weeks late for that 😉

@groundhog you may want to check out VerusCoin tho

[04-Oct-18 05:48 PM] groundhog#0062
nvm

[04-Oct-18 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
you can mine in a pool using GPU though

[04-Oct-18 05:49 PM] 0x03#8822
and what @SHossain said

[04-Oct-18 05:49 PM] groundhog#0062
i only have 1 x 1070 wanted to try it but not sure if its worth it

[04-Oct-18 05:50 PM] 0x03#8822
running some nheqminer on it wont hurt

[04-Oct-18 05:50 PM] 0x03#8822
but i've got 0 clue if that works on OSX

[04-Oct-18 05:51 PM] groundhog#0062
man it looks like rocket science 😄 maybe im better off buying some ARRR 😄

[04-Oct-18 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007
that's the easiest option

[04-Oct-18 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007
checkout #otc-project for that

[04-Oct-18 05:53 PM] groundhog#0062

@0x03  have a link to educate my self a bit?

[04-Oct-18 05:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will be sending out the 77.7 ARRR for all the voting and retweets over the next day or two.

[04-Oct-18 05:56 PM] 0x03#8822
@groundhog what do you want to educate yourself on? mining on osx?

[04-Oct-18 05:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to the logo comp, it was live for just under 48 hours.  We wanted to get it done fast.

[04-Oct-18 05:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have to go to go through the votes.   Looks like there might have been an attempt at manipulation.   
A few logos have the majority (90%) of their votes coming from a single region.

[04-Oct-18 05:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Some votes were counted invalid due to IP reuse.

[04-Oct-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Surprise Surprise there right?  Hahaha.

[04-Oct-18 05:58 PM] groundhog#0062
😦

[04-Oct-18 05:59 PM] scubapanda#2485
Why not have the vote here for 24h and count it manually?

[04-Oct-18 05:59 PM] 0x03#8822
@twitler, i am unsure what sort of info you want. there is an nheqminer for osx i've just found, even with cuda: https://github.com/kozyilmaz/nheqminer-macos

[04-Oct-18 06:00 PM] groundhog#0062
