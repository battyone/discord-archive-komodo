[27-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
No official tagline or motto , yet.

[27-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Def seen some ideas thrown around here though.

[27-Nov-18 04:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*Something something privacy*

[27-Nov-18 04:33 PM] Cassius#9158
Steve Jobs had a sign by the lab for I think Apple Mac when it was still a minor side project: 'Rather be a pirate than join the navy'. I got a friend who did their degree in Classics to translate it into Latin for me when I was making a pirate flag for my son's birthday. 'Malo pirata quam nauta reginae esse'. Could be useful.

[27-Nov-18 04:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm wouldnt that go the wrong way with a lot of people that served or have loved ones that served?

[27-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Cassius#9158
Or maybe something like 'Rum, Privacy and the Lash' after Winston Churchill's quote: "Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy, and the lash."

"In an honest service there is thin commons, low wages, and hard labor; in this, plenty and satiety, pleasure and ease, liberty and power; and who would not balance creditor on this side, when all the hazard that is run for it, at worst, is only a sour look or two at choking. No, a merry life and a short one, shall be my motto." (Johnson, 244)

One of the best parts of Pirate being an assetchain on Komodo is the camaraderie and collaboration that comes from being a part of the community. Opportunities present themselves daily to work together and make the best projects we possibly can.

We applaud and are highly grateful for VERUS and their team for doing the heavy lifting with sapling, and again thanks to the Komodo team for providing the delivery to our chain.

Hows about a rebrand. The project is amazing been in from the start but the pirate name  just sounds like a dodgy chain that is going to rob you at first chance. Sorry if this seems rude but got to get my opinion out there. I have one suggestion RaydARR  given the fact that it is untraceable off the radar so to speak. This could also keep the ARRR ticker. I believe this could help the project gain more momentum and gain more public support. Any thoughts on this. 👍
