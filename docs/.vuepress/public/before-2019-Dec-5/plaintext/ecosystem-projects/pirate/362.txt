[04-Dec-18 05:59 PM] crumb#2550
probably it would be a good idea to connect the Pirate channels on Komodo discord with corresponding channels in Pirate discord

[04-Dec-18 05:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We will have a bridge to the single Pirate channel that will remaind @crumb  :realpirate:

[04-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Flexatron#8809

[04-Dec-18 05:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This will be the only remaining pirate channel.

Dear silly feks,
stop DMing me invites to PIRATE discord. 
Do you really think no one told me?
Sincerely,
Me

[04-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Flexatron#8809
I got one for chainzilla

[04-Dec-18 06:07 PM] Flexatron#8809
was probably a mistake

[04-Dec-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wouldn't have said anything about **1** or even 5 😣_

[04-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I just realized (of course after I bought them already) that I could have bought about 10% more if I traded on BTC 😅 :rum: instead of KMD

[04-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
oh well, price is going up

[04-Dec-18 06:10 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I guess I can't cry about buying right around the bottom, instead of AT THE VERY F**KING BOTTOM

[04-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

invite contest rule 1 should be that if you spam regulars with an invite then you get auto-disqualified

[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Join their link then leave.   Rack up their leave numbers 😛

[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If only there was a person who wants to track that 😛

[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[04-Dec-18 07:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I WANT YOU ALL TO USE YOUR OWN LINKS!

move a decimal point and it's worth mentioning

[04-Dec-18 07:26 PM] Flexatron#8809
someone dumped a shitload of ARRR

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Reel Em In#1495
I think .02 being highest bid is pretty low and worth mentioning

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] kp#3190
Not really

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] kp#3190
Not a big dump

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] kp#3190
Just that support was pulled

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Reel Em In#1495

KMD should be a trading pair across all exchanges.   I'm asking each time I apply with Pirate to plant the seeds.

The fact the major exchanges can't withdraw is drawing people to digital price

Great, now even more people can mine on piratepool instead of spreading the hash. 😛

[05-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Flexatron#8809
yea I first wanted to link to the other bigger one but piratepool had fewer ports which makes it less confusing

[05-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Flexatron#8809
ah well

[05-Dec-18 01:28 PM] bishop#9773
I hear you. I would expect most reading that to just follow your images. Might be worthwhile to list the other 3-5 pools with ports, maybe payout and fee information and let the reader decide which pool they want to input
