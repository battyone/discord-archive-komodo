The problem with a "buried treasure idea" is that you can't use buried treasure and it still be buried

[26-Sep-18 04:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a half buried treasure chest with pirate's accessories lying on it??

[26-Sep-18 04:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, I leave this conversion to you guys.... keep it up 🙂

[26-Sep-18 04:29 AM] gt#2812
that's a bit literal

only 6,806,458 sol's different between KMD and PIRATE 😱

[26-Sep-18 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has only mined 12k PIRATE out out the last 763 blocks 😭_

[26-Sep-18 04:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 selling ? 🙂

[26-Sep-18 04:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

OK, this conversation has been very helpful. You guys have given me a good idea for another submission. A bit hard to explain so I will just have to draw up the concept. I have a real job though so it will be in 15 hours or so.

[26-Sep-18 04:34 AM] mountaindrifter#4595

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 best I can offer is @ 0.03 KMD  🙂

[26-Sep-18 04:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I'm scared to sell right now - I think this might become something

[26-Sep-18 04:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@mountaindrifter will be looking forward for your work mate 🙂 👍

[26-Sep-18 04:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 fair enough

[26-Sep-18 04:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[26-Sep-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jeasus.... I am so galb I got drunk and decided to mine all of the PIRATE wit Z9s when it was still being CPU mined.... in true pirate fasion it was.... walked away with a massive haul of treasure.

[26-Sep-18 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`hoped diff would go down during sleep`
The more rentals you guys pay for is the higher diff will go

[26-Sep-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I figured out with chips, hire long time of hash, not lots of hash.... always get more coins.

Yup, because with higher hash, at a certain point you start competing against yourself

We're all in pre-1M diff 😉

[26-Sep-18 04:56 AM] Don King#8901
The hash tsunami will get noticed, then some people ask 'what's this PIRATE thing?', and then they begin to understand, see a privacy coin, and many will spot the obvious , PIRATE is best attributes of monero and Zcash combined, and there is a battle hardened komodo community behind it. I think flipirateing with xmr is possible, at minimum PIRATE is seen as a genuine competitor, which it is right now!

[26-Sep-18 04:58 AM] Don King#8901
FOMO is the wave PIRATE can surf into top 50

[26-Sep-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[26-Sep-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its a it of a step to create a darknet market with PIRATE but if it was done.... top 50 is no problem.

[26-Sep-18 05:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When AlphaBay announched Zcash being added, before it was, they exit scammed.... so It seems to be quite a difficult job to do something like that.

[26-Sep-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however with PEX .... I guess it could be easily adapted to a marketplace, instead of exchange.

[26-Sep-18 05:02 AM] Flexatron#8809

Is Pirate compatible with BarterDEX or other exchanges, will it be ?

[26-Sep-18 06:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
not with barterDEX as it's z transactions only

[26-Sep-18 06:02 AM] djay#5234

[26-Sep-18 06:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

a possible exchange will need to support z (shielded) deposits and withdrawls

@djay have you previously solo-mined any other assetchains?

maybe it has something to do with that as well, maybe that happens to others, too 😄

that made the order go half as long, what completely sux when you're ordering NH for 'stamina'

over power

[26-Sep-18 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wasn't being diplomatic, I think it sux but their answer is a bunch of bullshit about total hash equaling the same amount (as if a burst is the same as sustained) 😖
