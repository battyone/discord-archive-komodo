@RNI nowhere on there do I see the 25 a day thing (is that one of the "to be uncovered" things?)

[23-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Oszy#5734
@RNI  I think you have to retweet every day for 7 days then post the link to @FishyGuts

[23-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Louis#8450
Many thanks indeed @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Oszy#5734
"Post a screenshot of your retweet and get 25 Pirate each day by submitting the link in Discord #pirate-marketing and DMing FishyGuts in Discord your Z address.  Images will be checked and invalid entries will be removed.  Retweets must remain for the curation of the raffle to count and will be checked at the end of the raffle."

[23-Oct-18 04:40 PM] RNI#2666
@Oszy hello. everyday every new piratechain tweet? and post screenshot of every re-tweet? 25pirates per retweet? this confuses me..probably my english isn't the best

[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Might be the same tweet might be another one i don't know Fishy will come and explain later today

[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
can somone post a ss of this "25pirates " thing?.....

[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] RNI#2666

[23-Oct-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so that reads to me that each day you have to retwat and post a ss of the retwat in marketing to get 25 ARRR

[23-Oct-18 04:43 PM] RNI#2666
as far as i understand, i have to screenshot my retweet and submit the screenshot at the #deleted-channel channel .. an send my z-adress to @FishyGuts .. but what is meant by "each day"?

[23-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Oszy#5734
contest last 7 days

[23-Oct-18 04:43 PM] RNI#2666
ok thank you @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in my reading:
Since it says "each day" you get individual reward for individual actions; whereas "every day" would indicate that you only get reward if you did it for *all* 7 days

[23-Oct-18 04:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thank you for clarifying Genie 😃

[23-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes everyone post your tweets in Marketing so others can follow you, retweet and like your posts. 
Be sure to DM me your address.  At the end of the contest, I will send out all the accumulated Pirate for these actions.

[23-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You can post Twitter links too instead of screenshots.

[23-Oct-18 04:48 PM] RNI#2666
ok thank you @FishyGuts  .. now i finally understand :pirate:

there is some kind of glitch with gleam. i can only do two actions and then it says: "Connect your Twitter Account"
i think i'm not the only one with this problem

[23-Oct-18 05:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[23-Oct-18 05:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
More people need to see that lol

[23-Oct-18 05:33 PM] crumb#2550
if there is not even an option to use transparent addresses, then everything works like it should. full privacy

[23-Oct-18 05:34 PM] crumb#2550
ahoy Pirate mateys! :pirate:

[23-Oct-18 05:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So zcash needs to encourage users to z and not t when pirate is way ahead of that

[23-Oct-18 05:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Having that t option means you will never be fully private chain.

[23-Oct-18 05:36 PM] crumb#2550
the key seems to be to not even give the t-addr option

[23-Oct-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is very easy to contaminate private funds if you are able to use taddr

[23-Oct-18 05:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Pirate longtime hashrate seems to climb at a fairly stable pace. Currently the 10h average is 118.744.045, 3 day average is 98.282.550 and 10 days average is 87.169.958 hash/sec. The rolling 10 day average is up about 10% in the last five days.

Crypto rich wants to do a miner video on Pirate.   I've got a Z9 mini and a Z9 big pointed at his wallet for the next 24 hours for data collection. 
We will do a rig setup for an ASIC and GPU rig.

[23-Oct-18 05:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If someone wants to volunteer to do this, that would be fantastic.  I have a lot on my plate.

[23-Oct-18 05:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He would like to do it next Monday but Thursday is the earliest I could set aside the 90 minutes for it.

[23-Oct-18 06:14 PM] wookie#7663
@crumb I have the same problem as you with gleam. I can do the follow pirate on twitter, I can do the join discord, but cannot retweet. I've tried different 3 different browsers, tried on pc and on mac and on phone. I've tried clearing the cache and entire history. I went into twitter settings and allowed everything. But still no dice. Let me know if you figure it out.

[23-Oct-18 06:17 PM] IsekiSolari#2059
I can do the tweet, and the retweet but the join discord doesn't work for me 😦

[23-Oct-18 06:17 PM] crumb#2550
i cleared all caches and still that didn't work. but like 10 min after that it just "magically" started working.
no idea how that happened

If the price doesnt start to scale upward it will turn into a labor of love

[23-Oct-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As long as price is OTC *and* the majority of OTC is people that think $10k is "a lot of money" to invest in mining, the price will not scale
We just have to wait a while longer

I’m still working my way up.  All my equipment now though has been bought with BTC.

[23-Oct-18 06:43 PM] BlockTech#6895
10k is lot that's it, i'm not born in a rich family, neither invested in BTC in 2011 ... so 10k, is more than my car + my bank account.

[23-Oct-18 06:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well I’m just being silly Block - But if you’re an addict like me, all those earnings turn back into equipment usually.

[23-Oct-18 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I agree that 10k is a lot for mining if you’re not employed by it

[23-Oct-18 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If it’s your job then you NEED to go much harder.

[23-Oct-18 06:45 PM] BlockTech#6895
But i sure understand, we need big fish to enter here, and i probably won't be "rich" with my little investment ^^

[23-Oct-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Even at today's prices and the 2080s making them about pointless, it would cost over $9k to build *one* of my GPU rigs

But others do this for work and a living so I can understand their position.   Talked to someone last night with 1M personal hash on Equihash.  That’s a job.

I don’t think I’ll ever full time mine.  And I am good with where my setup is at.  TBH I don’t see myself continuing with new equipment after these Z9 minis become unprofitable.   I’ve sunk a lot of hours into mining.

[23-Oct-18 06:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ive learned a ton tho so I am grateful that it was my entry into the crypto market.
