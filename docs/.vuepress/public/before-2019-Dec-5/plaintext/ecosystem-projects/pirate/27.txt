@jl777c May I ask if can we send Pirate to an unshieded address or does it not apply to Pirate/KMD? "Users will be required to send funds held in old Sprout shielded addresses to transparent addresses before sending to new Sapling shielded addresses. There will be no way to send ZEC directly between Sprout and Sapling shielded addresses."

[11-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
Pirate may have to be restarted after then with new adresses?

[11-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
But sprout adresses will still be supported no

[11-Sep-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems PIRATE stays with sprout

[11-Sep-18 08:10 PM] scubapanda#2485
Sad Panda.

[11-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
Anyone wants to buy pirate?😂

[11-Sep-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking the number of PIRATE tx is not so big, having it take a bit of time to send out I dont think really affects it much, other than for the pool node

[11-Sep-18 08:21 PM] scubapanda#2485
I don't know if we are talking of the same thing but I though you couldn't send Pirate to a transparent address?

[11-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Flexatron#8809
Jl777c l think means that sprout adresses for pirate are not necessarily bad until it gets popular?

[11-Sep-18 08:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
So Komodod would support different versions of zk-SNARKS.

[11-Sep-18 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
we can simply just keep a fork of current komodod before any other update

[11-Sep-18 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder @jorian @webworker01 should we fork it already to PirateNetwork repo and also post the release binaries there?

👍 

[11-Sep-18 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE is already feature complete. We can have static builds for who needs it and no need to update until necessary

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] scubapanda#2485
I was thinking of ways to transfer/airdrop these balances to a new Sapling Pirate. Can one start a KMD Sapling chain with a public premine at the current height of the Pirate chain? Balances on the old chain could then be sent to one transfer/airdrop z-address and credited on the other chain by the premine account. The destination Sapling address could be in the message field of the sent transfer? All done in Pirate zk-SNARK way 😉

[11-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Alright#0419
Could work, yes

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Alright#0419
If we did that, could we consider dragging out the emission schedule?

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] scubapanda#2485
I would be happy with that.

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
emission schedule doesn't make any sense IMO

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] scubapanda#2485
I agree.

[11-Sep-18 09:14 PM] scubapanda#2485
The sooner the better.

[11-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
Based on the "sapling turnstile" zcash post, it seems to me like it may just be a consensus rule imposed by the ZEC devs to audit the chain

[11-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
Maybe we can just not include that rule? No idea how viable that is. I'm not that adept when it comes to zkSNARKs

[11-Sep-18 09:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Me neither and I would think there would be a substantial risk for a fork.

[11-Sep-18 09:42 PM] scubapanda#2485
Reading the sapling turnstile post again feels bizarre. First you create this crypto with zero knowledge zk-SNARKS and the you ask everyone to unshield their coins. Have the devs, after all, lost their faith in the 'protocol'? "Zcash engineers have gone through great lengths to protect the network from any deviation in the expected ZEC in circulation. We recommend reading about Zcash’s public parameters to understand counterfeiting risks and mitigation techniques. Regardless of how low the probability might be, taking the extra step to detect counterfeit coins is a valuable reassurance."

[11-Sep-18 09:48 PM] scubapanda#2485
If this is really done to check for counterfeit coins should we consider zk-SNARKS Pirated already 😃

[12-Sep-18 02:50 AM] wookie#7663
does anyone know if the username Pirate_Arr on the bitcointalk announcement page is here on discord?

[12-Sep-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian  I beleive

[12-Sep-18 03:27 AM] wookie#7663
thanks!

[12-Sep-18 04:16 AM] wookie#7663
@Alright could you explain to me how you mean that the emission schedule doesn't make sense? I'm genuinely trying to learn. Thanks.

[12-Sep-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
Basically all PIRATE that will ever exist will be mined within 3 years

[12-Sep-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
after that, the block reward is close to 0 or 0

[12-Sep-18 04:18 AM] wookie#7663
isn't kinda fast, relative to other coins? Is there an advantage of doing it this way?

[12-Sep-18 04:18 AM] Alright#0419
It halves to quickly imo. People mining now will have *significantly* more coins than someone starting in a couple months

[12-Sep-18 04:20 AM] wookie#7663
so, in 3 years, when it's not worth the time/$ to mine PIRATE and no one mines PIRATE. Where will the PoW happen for transactions?

[12-Sep-18 05:52 AM] Don King#8901
I think we're all hoping dPoW might be added later, if not maybe a reboot with better mining parameters is possible, and a swap for existing PIRATE holders onto an optimized z only chain. There's uncertainty and risk with PIRATE,  but could become something special too

[12-Sep-18 06:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain if community sentiments are important go for it 😄

[12-Sep-18 06:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I would have wished for a fresh start with sapling 🙂

[12-Sep-18 06:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but that's just me

[12-Sep-18 06:45 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm with community

[12-Sep-18 06:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, help them

[12-Sep-18 06:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in my opinion, if sapling addresses are different and it can cause issue with the pirate ? it's better to go with fresh start

[12-Sep-18 06:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
would you like to use BTCD codebase today?

[12-Sep-18 06:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess no

[12-Sep-18 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there can be possibilities of solutions tied to new upgrade

[12-Sep-18 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
should better chose that compatibility

[12-Sep-18 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it'd be a less of your loss if you lose the so far work on pirate and go with a fresh start

[12-Sep-18 06:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also, if community agrees, we can think of better params this time

[12-Sep-18 06:54 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm up for a fresh start if that is better for the chain and community

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is no sapling in KMD yet

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and wont be for months

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are jumping the horse here

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
zcash is adding a lot of "defense" things in their code to make it more difficult for forks

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and the only benefit of sapling is faster performance of making z transaction

[12-Sep-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for a PIRATE I dont see that as being such a big deal requiring a fork to fix it

[12-Sep-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
sprout->sprout z transactions work, today, right now,  without any changes

[12-Sep-18 06:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but when sapling will be implimented, wouldn't that make pirate faster if have sapling?

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in some months from now, sure. but PIRATE cant do transparent, so it cant migrate to sapling

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] SHossain#0007
i also agree with jl777 on this. we don't have sapling yet on Komodo source.

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and just how many z transactions are people doing with PIRATE that makes having sapling so important?

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
asking wrong person I guess.

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
asking me?

[12-Sep-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if you arent doing any PIRATE z transactions, there is NO benefit for sapling over sprout

[12-Sep-18 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
asking satinder

[12-Sep-18 07:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
how do I know?

[12-Sep-18 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
you dont know how many z transactions you are doing?

[12-Sep-18 07:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh only mine? sure.... none 😄

[12-Sep-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so why make it an emergency "we must update" to get a feature nobody is using?

[12-Sep-18 07:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you summarised my comments as an "emergency" ???

[12-Sep-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the explorer, I only see pool payouts and the occasional transaction

[12-Sep-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the general reaction was that we have to update PIRATE

[12-Sep-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
that was your sentiment too

[12-Sep-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
I disagree

[12-Sep-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is ok with sprout indefinitely

[12-Sep-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[12-Sep-18 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
all this talk about airdrops and there is no way to do a snapshot, so there wont be any airdrops

[12-Sep-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
adding dPoW will require changing the consensus rules and it is not clear it will happen anytime soon

[12-Sep-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ZEC also only updated to allow sapling update, the true sapling isnt here yet

[12-Sep-18 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so, for the foreseeable future PIRATE will be as it is and it has enough of a hashrate to be securing itself for now, but as with CHIPS when the mining rewards get too small, there wont be and there will be a problem in 2 to 3 years

[12-Sep-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
at that point it can change to a verushash or maybe some other solution, 2 years is a very long time

[12-Sep-18 07:25 AM] jorian#4555
KMD isn't even 2 years old

[12-Sep-18 07:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
clearer now. I should not speak in PIRATE 😄

[12-Sep-18 07:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🤐

[12-Sep-18 07:36 AM] jorian#4555
What we need is pirate usage

[12-Sep-18 07:45 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, PIRATE needs some apps that drive usage, that is what we should be doing now, brainstorming ideas that take advantage of the z only enforced privacy.

[12-Sep-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
hushlist for privatemessaging

[12-Sep-18 07:48 AM] Don King#8901
You mean using PIRATE with hushlist, sending anon value over anon messaging?

[12-Sep-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[12-Sep-18 07:59 AM] Don King#8901
That sounds like a match made in heaven! 😀

[12-Sep-18 08:00 AM] Don King#8901
Reminds me of your original telepods idea jl777, could be a killer app for PIRATE

[12-Sep-18 08:01 AM] Don King#8901
Just need one good app to raise awareness

[12-Sep-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
dukeleto did the hushlist, i think it has gui

{Reactions}
Hush (2) 

[12-Sep-18 08:16 AM] Don King#8901
Definitely worth brainstorming a PIRATE/hushlist collaboration,  'message in a bottle' service, lots of great swashbuckling imagery to help with marketing too,

[12-Sep-18 08:19 AM] Don King#8901
I need to read up more on hushlist, what features

[12-Sep-18 08:32 AM] scubapanda#2485
I'm happy with PIRATE not needing an update.

[12-Sep-18 08:53 AM] scubapanda#2485
Regarding the block rewards, in a year (325 days from genesis) daily PIRATE rewards will be 5761. A year after that they will be 90 per day.

[12-Sep-18 08:59 AM] Flexatron#8809
Cool

[12-Sep-18 10:21 AM] Flexatron#8809
Sounds good

[12-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Don King#8901
PIRATE community has 12 months to come up with a solution for when block reward becomes low enough to cause problems, a lot can happen in that time, right now we need to spread adoption, and continue the experimentation

[12-Sep-18 11:34 AM] Flexatron#8809
Darkweb adoption can help with tx fees

[12-Sep-18 11:34 AM] Flexatron#8809
