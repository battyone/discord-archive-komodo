[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> This is based on 15 minutes of research though

[28-Oct-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> What happened with the previous crowdfunding btc ?

[28-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> Priority must be a tradingview supported exchange first. No need to pay for others

[28-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> After seeing a bunch of pricing and looking at what exchanges are charging, I'm starting to form the conclusion that we get what we pay for.  if we want to list on a shady/ low level exchange,  then it'll be cheaper (in most cases). If we want to list on a solid exchange,  it's going to be pricey.

That being said, I think we need to do a BTC fundraising round so that ehen the time comes for a solid exchange listing, we have the funds

[28-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> So we need to figure out why tradingview is not supporting them

[28-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Keppie nothing happened,  no btc was donated

[28-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> but the wallet with the btc is owned by the team

[28-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> for this purpose. marketing & exchange listings

[28-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Correct, I generated the wallet for fund raising purposes

[28-Oct-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Priority must be a tradingview supported exchange first.`
Do you own tradingview stock or donated some of it to PIRATE?

[28-Oct-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> Why do you have twitter account?

[28-Oct-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> If not the latter, then priority must go to utility (always)

[28-Oct-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `Why do you have twitter account?`
because 5 people here harassed me until I created one

[28-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> No I mean Piratechain

[28-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> that does't mean pirate have twitter stock right?

[28-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> people using

[28-Oct-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> There's more to twatter than exchanges and centralized sites that generate revenue by ranking them

[28-Oct-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> PIRATE is foremost a currency, not a commodity

[28-Oct-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> As with any currency, utility is paramount

[28-Oct-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> I couldn't find relation what you says with tw supported exchange. Technical analysts are using there, people can see the chart of arrr

[28-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I couldn't find relation what you says with tw supported exchange.`
Because I abhor the fact that people focus on 1 or 2 sites who get rich by driving traffic and we (the community and/or the coin) literally get nothing out of it
Can you show a direct, causal link between paying to be on some exchange that tradingview has deemed worthy and the ability to use any currency as a currency?

[28-Oct-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _goes back to his cave_

[28-Oct-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> You don't have a professional vision, I respect it but according to this idea should not be listed in any exchange. Let's just use the coin only with each other

[28-Oct-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `You don't have a professional vision` ü§£

[28-Oct-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> emotional, and also talking emotional

[28-Oct-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `according to this idea should not be listed in any exchange`
never did I say any such thing, or even imply it
My stance is simple: that people need to accept that currencies are currencies and that is what matters most
That you can go to a bank on the corner and get money, but you'd rather get it one block over is not a valid argument that a given company should open a bank on every corner that some random 4th party prefers the amount of sunshine per week on

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hollowman9000> Dafuq is hubi

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hollowman9000> Huobi?

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <PeLe ‚öì> nope

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <PeLe ‚öì> just hubi

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> If ARRR were listed on 4000 exchanges and tradingview didn't like any of them, you'd still be making the same claim @Zafer

[28-Oct-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> because, "tradingview"

[28-Oct-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I oppose any claim that any coin/exchange should give in to the whims of any random 4th party site (be it tradingview, cmc, or the next fad to come along)

[dscrd-prt] <Zafer> @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ üë¥üèºüì¢  I respect it as personal, also I am against to banks and c-exchanges as faithfully, they all butcher mafias. Bu this market is not utopia, total fucked up and that's why people trying to get listed on binance or smilar activities they want to get in somehow. If you want to reach more people or get attention, you have to use "medium" like twitter, youtube, etc. I'm just thinking different way from you on usage of the capital instruments

[28-Oct-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> if you want people to buy arrr. get on a decent exchange, not these near scam tier lowest pajeet changes on the internet

[28-Oct-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I'm just thinking different way from you on usage of the capital instruments`
But, you're really not though
You're following the same patterns that enslaved us all to fiat in the first place: "It's only good is some entity said so"
If you want a currency to be a currency, then it needs utility above all else
If you want a currency to be a commodity, then it needs centralized trading above all else

[28-Oct-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> PS- `Legally, capital instruments are debt ...`

[28-Oct-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> Hubi surely looks like the best offer from the paid listing offers to me, by far even.

[28-Oct-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> @Draeth do you mean Huobi?

[28-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> No Hubi Phil; 2 different exchanges

[28-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> My wife has a "hubby", does that count?

[28-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Philtr> Ok. Huobi will be great, too.

[28-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Keppie> Think i prefer Hubi at this point üòÑ

[28-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> Very clever name Hubi, it makes me wish we had a dedicated pirate exchange. We could call it 'Pirate Bae'

[28-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <KOSIUS> Was looking at applying to Huobi aswell yesterday

ADMISSION
Is Pirate Fest free?

Many of the major events are free, such as the Fireworks Show, the Pirate Landing, the Float Parades, the three harbour-side Street Dances, the Teen Dance and the Children's Fun Day. Heritage Day functions are free during the day but some night-time events begin at CI$5/US$6. For most sporting events, participation fees begin at CI$25/US$30
```

[28-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Zanzarismo> so could we get him like a free pass to the sporting events or something?

[28-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> guys, is there any cryptocurrency besides ARRR and CLOAK that are mandatory anon?

[28-Oct-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> although honestly I don't know how CLOAK compares to ARRR, thoughts?

[28-Oct-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Acura> @Mantrack Cloak is optional privacy ,
explorers that display amounts is bad privacy
explorers that display addresses and privacy... that means no privacy

[28-Oct-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Mantrack> lol in other words Cloak is a joke @Acura ? I know about them since a while but I never actually looked into it much

[28-Oct-19 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> here it seems like we have 2/3s of the vote for listing so far.  For those who voted no, could you post your reasoning? I'd like to get an idea of why (or dm me if you feel more comfortable doing that)

[29-Oct-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> üö´ because not free

[29-Oct-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> @Draeth I haven't voted, specifically because I have the feeling that something is going to get dug up about this exchange, that would either cause us to pull out, or that we are going to spend all this to get a slot, and it isn't going to be worth the cost to be listed

[29-Oct-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `I have the feeling that something is going to get dug up about this exchange`
It's not like they opened last week ü§∑üèΩ
What do you imagine that wouldn't apply to *any* exchange?

[29-Oct-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ectocooler I hear ya. Keep in mind that so far, every single exchange that has replied to us is asking for 6-8 BTC, said no because there is no company behind us, or don't have the capability to add us

[29-Oct-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> beter ask the voter for money now as they want to list there I have nothing against - but if they vote - they better vote with their BTC üòõ

[dscrd-prt] <ectocooler> I imagine something like LBank or CryptoExchange

[29-Oct-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Lbank wanted to much imo, though I have some updates on that front

[29-Oct-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We didn't have any safeguards in place with CB

[29-Oct-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> IMO opinion ARRR is a currency, not a store of value. In order to get more people to use ARRR, the first priority is not to be available at as many exchanges as possible (thus spreading the volume thinly accross all those exchanges), but spendability of ARRR. not just store privately in your wallet, but buy stuff in a private manner.

[29-Oct-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> I don't recall any valid issues with lbank other than amount of cost and the same "fake volume" claim folks go on about for *every* exchange ü§î

[29-Oct-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @ùôäùôûùô£ùô† I agree, however, having an exchange in a completely different market (in this case Hong Kong) gives us more visibility, and can drive interest. The more people that recognize us, the more likely we're able to be used as a currency in more places

[29-Oct-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> avg Hubi user = wale

[29-Oct-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> in reality we can estimate more like twitter users devided by 100 is more or less reasonable user base

[29-Oct-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so Hubi got 50 users, Binance got 10 k users
