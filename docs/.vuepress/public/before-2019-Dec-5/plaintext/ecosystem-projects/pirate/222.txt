[25-Oct-18 07:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
Sapling

[25-Oct-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
SHould I add - first full z addr support excahnge in development, Tortuga.

[25-Oct-18 07:36 AM] house#8741
Wondering ... would it be better to use ‘anonymous’ rather than ‘z tx’ to ensure people can understand coherently what it means ?

[25-Oct-18 07:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Good call.

[25-Oct-18 07:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
For the exchange listings, z tx it stays, but for the public, anonymous she blows.

[25-Oct-18 07:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess sapling should be “mobile ready” something anonymous transactions

[25-Oct-18 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
currently ony z tx allowed? so currently (new transactions) are only 100% z right ?

[25-Oct-18 07:45 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so we can forget past no matter so much ?

[25-Oct-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
- first fully completed crypto project 😃

[25-Oct-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no more code development needed ?

[25-Oct-18 07:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at least JL said these words

[25-Oct-18 07:47 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
of course sapling is kind of upgrade but not development
