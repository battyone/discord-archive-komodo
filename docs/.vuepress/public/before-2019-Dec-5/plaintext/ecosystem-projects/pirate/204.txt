thank you!

[22-Oct-18 01:12 PM] 0x03#8822
actually if that was possible and you could use the 8k of op_return for lets say audio

[22-Oct-18 01:12 PM] 0x03#8822
you can just cram video into the other places

but... my mind is blown still

[22-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every thing is already in the op return

[22-Oct-18 01:21 PM] blackbeard#8888

I just passed hexstring from RPC

[22-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
endoded it into hex so its half the size

[22-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then split it into chunks

[22-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that fit inot opreturn, put the txid of the last chunk at thestart

[22-Oct-18 01:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like 100 lines of code aded to marketmaker and a few mods to make it have 2 RPC threads

[22-Oct-18 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the modifications on komodod side are a bit more though ..

Thanks for the rain blackbeard, and indeed i was wondering where this skill come from, i found a pirate translator, but it was not as effective as a real pirate like blackbeard.

I just bought a bunch of ARRR from @jeezy  [Thanks pal]
we had some kind of a hitch in the TX he sent to me - after 90 minutes he had to stop and send again, and then it took another 1500 seconds-
also, I had similar time when CowbyCrypto sent me some- 
we speculated that this may be due to many inputs into the z-address, can this be possible?
like when trying to send from a regular address that has lost of inputs and cant bcs the block is full?

[22-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jeezy#3408
its probably just Z-magic load intensive

[22-Oct-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If folks run `z_mergetoaddress` every so often, it will consolidate the inputs and make sending **much** faster

[22-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jeezy#3408
hm, hadnt considered that, will try next time thanks

[22-Oct-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
beyond that, you just have to wait for sender's CPU to process all the info

[22-Oct-18 02:15 PM] Karl#7466
can anyone explain how I would use onboarding if for example i wanted to use my KMD on binance to buy ARRR?

[22-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'd have to precalculate binance fees and add them to tx amount to get the right amount
you're waaaaaaaaaaay better off doing from a personal wallet once the KMD is actually yours

[22-Oct-18 02:18 PM] Karl#7466
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so would I just transfer all my KMD to an agama KMD wallet first?

[22-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that way they are actually under your control and you can send the exact amount properly

[22-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one should ever keep amounts of any coin on a CEX that they don't plan on specifically using for only trades on that CEX

[22-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Karl#7466
right, i agree, just trying to wrap my head around onboarding lol

[22-Oct-18 02:21 PM] bowienetter⚡#8902

[22-Oct-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
onboarding, itself, is simple
You pick an amount you want to buy, type the pirate z addy you want it sent to, then send the required amount to the addy the site tells you to send to

[22-Oct-18 02:23 PM] bowienetter⚡#8902

fellow pirates,  I would like to announce that @blackbeard has paid me a 100,000 ARRR security deposit to ensure that any escrow deal he does is backed 100% by these ARRR. you can feel safe to use him as escrow and also for direct trades, if anything goes wrong post here and if your claim is valid, I will pay it from the deposit. I am sure @blackbeard can translate this more proper in pirate language

there are various "locks" in a wallet, and sometimes things are "locked" and an operation can temporarily fail
