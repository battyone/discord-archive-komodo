PIRATE is a perfect crypto for storing wealth, or as Satis group say, 

Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢ We estimate the amount of cryptoasset market 
value needed to support economic activities to 
expand from ~$500B next year to $3.6T in 2028
‚Ä¢ 90%+ of cryptoasset value will be derived from 
penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade
‚Ä¢ Currency and Privacy networks will be the largest 
beneficiaries, as most fundamental value will stem 
from store of value use cases
‚Ä¢ Upside (5-yr) In BTC ($96k), XMR ($18k)

PIRATE is better privacy than monero, so it's perfect for offshore alternative market, which as Satis group analysts say, is where much of crypto upside will come from. The whole valuation report is worth reading too

I like the idea of PIRATE. I've always believe in privacy right from day 1 of being in crypto. PIRATE is better than both Monero and ZCash, which according to the article are #2 and #3 in line after BTC. I'm not a programmer, but I hope that the there is enough drive with the dev team to figure out the technical difficulties.

The biggest lesson to learn in crypto is patience,  it is taking a long time for komodo to get the respect it deserves,  but in the last 6 months I am seeing greater awareness about kmd, especially the Chinese gov ratings, and binance CEO CZ giving a thumbs up. As the komodo ecosystem  grows and matures, PIRATE can become a very useful tool as the deep hodl 'offshore' account, and if the community started using it for this purpose, it might eventually approach a stable value against kmd, without any formal peg.

[19-Sep-18 03:44 AM] BigCat45#4982
@Deleted User Exactly (if you can give a good rate please PM)

[19-Sep-18 03:45 AM] Don King#8901
PIRATE doesn't need any cool features, it doesn't need to be a Swiss army knife, it already has a killer feature as a perfect anon coin, and it will grow in adoption as kmd does,

[19-Sep-18 04:08 AM] wookie#7663
I'm guessing that since PIRATE is so new, other's like myself have been just watching this and allowing the devs time to their work and update us. Like I said, I'm not a coder, but I'd like to contribute what I can. Hence my submission for a logo above.

[19-Sep-18 04:40 AM] Don King#8901
I like both big privacy coins, monero and Zcash, and PIRATE is the best parts of both - anon by default like xmr, but with stronger privacy set of Zcash, and without the founders tax. PIRATE is a the perfect compliment to kmd as it adds a super private token to the whole ecosystem, which lets kmd be the transactional coin.

[19-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Don King#8901
The only criticism monero community has over PIRATE will be trusted setup, on every other point PIRATE is superior to monero.

[19-Sep-18 04:43 AM] Don King#8901
Trusted setup is accepted by most users, so eventually people will see PIRATE as the best privacy coin in the cryptosphere

[19-Sep-18 04:52 AM] Flexatron#8809
Are there devs on this?

[19-Sep-18 05:38 AM] Don King#8901
It's  feature complete as an anon store of value now, PIRATE is to kmd what z is to t, just on an ecosystem level,  if  komodo users start using PIRATE for their 'offshore' accounts I'm sure there'll be enough guys with dev talent around to maintain things.

[19-Sep-18 05:41 AM] Don King#8901
The only problems I see are 1-2 years down the road, when mining reward drops off , and in the short term getting on an exchange

[19-Sep-18 05:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The major problem I see, is converting to anf from PIRATE without losing the privacy aspects, and the fact it takes so much processing power to do transactions, if using as a store of vaule, TX is not so much an issue, but getting the value back out, would be hard... Yeah I just found this 1 million dolalls worth of BTC in a treasure chest. üòÇ

[19-Sep-18 06:38 AM] Don King#8901
If PIRATE achieves a stable value relative to kmd it has huge utility,  my belief is privacy coins will come under increasing attack soon, and probably some big exchanges start removing monero. If pirate stays legal, store some of your  after tax wealth in PIRATE for security against theft, if anon coins become  illegal then you probably need the best privacy coin to hide from the gov agents. Either way, PIRATE has great utility as long as it achieves a stable value against kmd.

[19-Sep-18 06:39 AM] Don King#8901
My plan is to keep 10-20% of my komodo ecosystem wealth in PIRATE,  assuming it achieves some level of adoption in the next 6 months

[19-Sep-18 06:43 AM] wookie#7663
Can Pirate ever work independently outside of the KMD ecosystem? Is it an issue of figuring out coding or an issue of it's design?

[19-Sep-18 06:51 AM] wookie#7663
Sorry, maybe I misunderstood or I'm not phrasing my question correctly. Why do you say that pirate can't be paired with btc or anything else? @Deleted User

[19-Sep-18 07:00 AM] wookie#7663
Is there anybody working on such a wallet?

[19-Sep-18 07:01 AM] scubapanda#2485
I would guess the hashrate would have to change drastically before any exchange could list Pirate. Now it costs perhaps 200 USD for a 24h rewrite?

[19-Sep-18 07:05 AM] wookie#7663
@Deleted User Sounds to me like this is a technical issue (albeit a rather hard one)? And could potentially be solved if someone worked at it?

[19-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
all that is needed is for an exchange to support z transactions for deposit and withdraw

[19-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is needed

[19-Sep-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
people trust the exchange to track the tokens deposited and traded anyway

[19-Sep-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so you send a z-tx to the exchange, trade it and withdraw to z-address

[19-Sep-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is feature complete, just has some 2 year out issues due to the fast emission rate

[19-Sep-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but people can always just CPU mine it to keep the chain going

[19-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
adding dPoW is the one thing that would really help PIRATE, by letting notaries do transaparent tx, it would allow notarizations. that wont be a difficult thing to do. but without a central exchange that does z-transactions, OTC is the only practical way

[19-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
strangely enough a central exchange becomes the best solution to trade PIRATE!?

[19-Sep-18 08:04 AM] scubapanda#2485
Might be the best way to get an 'established' market price for Pirate. Large transactions can always be done OTC too.

[19-Sep-18 08:06 AM] scubapanda#2485
So the exchange would just publish the viewing keys for deposits & withdraw accounts?

[19-Sep-18 08:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are there any exchanges that currently trade with z addresses?

[19-Sep-18 08:12 AM] Don King#8901
I think there is enough talent in komodo ecosystem to setup an exchange for doing z-tx deposits and withdrawals. If someone is planning to setup such an exchange I would love to invest in some revenue shares!

As a centralised trust is needed to verify the transactions?

[19-Sep-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the only way to trade PIRATE is via OTC (which requires trust) or a central exchange

[19-Sep-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
by handling things at the z level, once out of the exchange there is still the privacy

[19-Sep-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
of course funds in the exchange are subject to all the central exchange things

[19-Sep-18 08:32 AM] Don King#8901
The operator could raise some PIRATE,  e.g. 1M from current community, then that 1M becomes a % of the profits (25%), and the operator keeps the other 75% of profits plus the 1M PIRATE. A good way for a talented dev without much capital to get a start. Just a suggestion.

[19-Sep-18 08:34 AM] Don King#8901
Numbers are just for example, could be very different

[19-Sep-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810

What about a non custodial exchange like shapeshift, is that possible with z-tx only? I don't like using CEX now either, especially if they have heavy handed kyc, but we need a functioning market.
