We have decided to run for 3 regions in the 2019 Notary Node Elections:
- Europe [EU]
- North America [NA]
- Asia Russia [AR]

After running in an unofficial testnet for the past week with good results I believe 2 or 3 nodes will be manageable at high performance for the Pirate Notary Team and will help our project tremendously.

Please see our election details and promises at https://notary.pirate.black
Official election page: https://komodoelection.com/proposals/pirate/
Testnet stats: https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

We need your votes mateys! ARRR
Thank you for your attention.

Was pirate able to migrate to sprout from my understanding the difference between sprout and it's predecessor is sprout is a whole new style of address that is more energy efficient but achieves the same style or anonymity of the original zk-snarks transaction. Which is why it's possible to deprecate the old style.

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We are fully Sapling only now.  Sprout has been deprecated.   1st chain in crypto to do so. üëç

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
HUSH3 is also sapling only

[16-Apr-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and is claiming to be the only purely sapling chain, untainted by any sprout

[16-Apr-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but i guess they do taddrs, so not really a privacy contender

[16-Apr-19 04:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ahh awesome.  Nice to hear @dukeleto üëç

[16-Apr-19 04:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thank goodness no one cared about Pirate when all that was going on üòú

[16-Apr-19 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c @FishyGuts we only claim that we have no Spout UTXOs, which what I meant by "pure sapling", I admit it's a fuzzy term

[16-Apr-19 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
ARRR has stricter privacy than HUSH3 by dis-allowing normal taddr xtns, no question to that

[16-Apr-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, plenty of room for all chains to be unique

[16-Apr-19 08:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
HushList protocol uses taddrs, so this suits us just fine

[16-Apr-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
just need to word it so it isnt confusing

[16-Apr-19 08:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
We actually need and want some taddrs, outside of coinbase/notary

[16-Apr-19 08:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c yes, I plan to mention ARRR in the HUSH3 wp or I think I already did, I consider HUSH+ARRR sailing in the same seas

[16-Apr-19 08:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Theres no such thing as one type of anything really.   How many single mfg cellphones/cars/computers do we know of?  Beverages/food/socks.  
There's room for ecosystem growth everywhere and working together strengthens that.

hey guys, any mining pool operators here?

[24-Apr-19 09:34 PM] NickH#5815
How come komodod doesn't respect the `-mineraddress=XXX`

[24-Apr-19 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@jl777c

[24-Apr-19 09:46 PM] NickH#5815
We (Luxor) run nodes in multiple regions and provide the address of the wallet in the payment processor node.  We weren't seeing the blocks found in other regions showing up in the payment processor's wallet, and found that the coinbase is being sent to a different wallet address

[24-Apr-19 09:48 PM] phm87#7395
I think that you can use the same wallet.dat in each node (or import privkey)

[24-Apr-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@NickH you can use `-pubkey=xxxxxx` and use the pub key for that address

[24-Apr-19 09:50 PM] NickH#5815
is a new address generated for each template? some daemons do that, which wouldn't work

[24-Apr-19 09:50 PM] NickH#5815
bc the payment processor node wouldn't know which addresses have been generated from it's pubkey

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`is a new address generated for each template? ` by default, yes
if, however, you have the priv key imported and use `-pubkey=xxxxxx` it will do what you expected from  mineraddress

[24-Apr-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
or you could just force your stratum to make vout[0] whatever addy you choose

[24-Apr-19 09:54 PM] NickH#5815
we use the GBT generated by the daemon.

[24-Apr-19 09:54 PM] NickH#5815
I supposed we could modify it

[24-Apr-19 09:55 PM] NickH#5815
ok.  well, if we went with the pubkey method, I guess we have to give up some security there, then?  Most of our coins have the payment processor behind a firewall so they aren't exposed to the web.

[24-Apr-19 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I guess we have to give up some security there, then? `
I'm not sure what security you're giving up by your daemon owing the key you mine to

[24-Apr-19 09:59 PM] NickH#5815
well, peers would be able to figure out the IP of a server containing a crypto wallet.

[24-Apr-19 10:00 PM] NickH#5815
Currently, if any of our servers are compromised (for whatever reason), there's no keys on any of them.

[25-Apr-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
we implemented -pubkey= before -mineraddress was implemented, i think there were some conflicts to merge in the -mineraddress, but since it is essentially the same function, there didnt seem much point to add.

[25-Apr-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand how there is any difference in security using -pubkey vs. -mineraddress

[25-Apr-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the -pubkey can even be to a cold wallet, so it is not divulging the ip of any node

[25-Apr-19 06:30 AM] NickH#5815
yeah, pubkey is fine, i experimented with it and got what I needed

[25-Apr-19 06:31 AM] NickH#5815
i read Genie's comments as needing to import the privkey into the remote node

[25-Apr-19 06:31 AM] NickH#5815
All good now, we're mining blocks üëç

[25-Apr-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, no need to do that. I made the -pubkey especially for remote mining, i couldnt stand the zillions of addresses being generated for some false sense of privacy

[25-Apr-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810

hey all! wondering if someone can help me with figuring out why my pool doesn't want to start paying out to miners? the only thing i see in logs related to payments is:
`[Payments]    [pirate] Running z_operationresult for privateChain - TEST`
which happens fairly occasionally...

[26-May-19 12:47 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
relevant part of `pool_configs/pirate.json`:
```"paymentProcessing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "payOnStart": true,
    "minConf": 50,
    "paymentMode": "pplnt",
    "paymentInterval": 240,
    "minimumPayment": 0.1,
    "maxBlocksPerPayment": 20,
    "daemon": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 45453,
        "user": "usr",
        "password": "p"
    }
},```

[26-May-19 12:48 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and this is the output of `./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_gettotalbalance`:

[26-May-19 12:48 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
```{

  "total": "253.4399"
}```

[26-May-19 12:49 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
if i run `z_operationresult` myself, i see only empty list in response, same as with `z_getoperationstatus`
