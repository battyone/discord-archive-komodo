No I'm not a whale

[28-Sep-18 07:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yet

[28-Sep-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is true, but when there are people who have a million PIRATE who brought like 100x less than that ... seems fishy

[28-Sep-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess being pirate, that will get forgotten pretty soon though

[28-Sep-18 07:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hopefully they use some to help market,  it's in their best interest

[28-Sep-18 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not buying more.

[28-Sep-18 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did sell a LOT of cheap pirate üò¶

[28-Sep-18 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not selling either.

[28-Sep-18 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ok... just like he said the price is moving a bit too fast is all I am trying to say, without sellers, people are charging whatevery they like.

[28-Sep-18 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't forget that I freely gave 350,000 PIRATE, if you or someone says I got in for cheap

[28-Sep-18 07:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
WTS 1 pirate =1 BTC

[28-Sep-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you didt get in for free... just very cheap.

[28-Sep-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you have done more than anyone else to get this coin out there

[28-Sep-18 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, corrected the line....

[28-Sep-18 07:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have donated even more off the chat, which are undisclosed and uncredited.

[28-Sep-18 07:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

You dont need to this is pirate

[28-Sep-18 07:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
me holding big chunk won't do any good to me if I'm the only one.

[28-Sep-18 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
instead of selling, I'd give it for a good thing for free

[28-Sep-18 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's why I donated much

[28-Sep-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bounties and such?

[28-Sep-18 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Its a novel idea from a solid team, even looking at it from the outside  around 10 cents a coin seems like a bargain.

[28-Sep-18 07:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
sapling and dex will make it much more accesible.    That's always abig challenge for adoption.

[28-Sep-18 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't keep hopes of pirate on dex....

[28-Sep-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah very unlikey

[28-Sep-18 07:12 AM] jorian#4555
it will at least take a while

[28-Sep-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the technical challenge on that is massive

[28-Sep-18 07:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I didn't mean DEX I meant exchange, sorry... but did you see that tweet linked that Zooko made?

btw with all this imagery. what is considered an 'official' logo?

[28-Sep-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We do not have one yet.

[28-Sep-18 07:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Once the contest for the logo is over, we will homogenize the branding.

makes u look like the 'official' pool

[28-Sep-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay... if anyone wants to start a pool, and wants to have it setup with pool.pirate.black, I can setup the dns record.
