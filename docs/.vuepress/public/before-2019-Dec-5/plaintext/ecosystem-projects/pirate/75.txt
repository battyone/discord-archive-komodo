i'll offer assistance in setting up the pool if needed - but whomever steps up should probably have done this before / have an idea of the implications of running a pool

Send me the git page.  I have someone who can set one up.   Are the server requirements listed there too?  

OMG this project has me losing sleep. üòÇ

theres no github for lazyness reasons, but take a good peek at the bottom of my pool page

[28-Sep-18 09:40 AM] 0x03#8822
(mainly because i have another s-nomp fork in my github already and i'm just too fekin lazy to bother with stuff)

[28-Sep-18 09:42 AM] 0x03#8822
i'm a bit bothered about the "i have someone" part tho

[28-Sep-18 09:42 AM] 0x03#8822

[28-Sep-18 09:43 AM] jorian#4555
ok

[28-Sep-18 09:44 AM] jorian#4555

git seems magical sometimes.

[28-Sep-18 09:45 AM] 0x03#8822
especially when i change one file and it wants me to 'merge to master' afterwards. i'll just go back to cvs soon üòõ

[28-Sep-18 10:01 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Can I mine $Pirate from my laptop if I join this pool http://piratepool.io/ . Already have my 777 but wish to mine more of this  diamond $Pirate. Read all of Satinder‚Äôs medium post on it. Amazing stuff to read  even went through the conversations . Only connected to the internet in 2010 by then you guys were on it like bonnet. Seems to me that you lot are at the top of your game. Well done and thanks for all your effort. üëç

[28-Sep-18 10:02 AM] 0x03#8822
when you say 'my laptop' that probably means cpu mining?

[28-Sep-18 10:03 AM] 0x03#8822
that would be a waste of time.

[28-Sep-18 10:05 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Yes cpu mining. Any other suggestion I am new to mining only do stellite on CPU.

[28-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Oszy#5734
your laptop can't really compete with gpu and asic miners.

[28-Sep-18 10:07 AM] Oszy#5734
your best shot is to rent hash

[28-Sep-18 10:07 AM] Buddz1993#5380
guys so this happened my computer shut down and I had my z address already completed with my 777 KMD in it ,  what do I need to do go get that address again?

[28-Sep-18 10:07 AM] Buddz1993#5380
kind weird because I have always used lite mode..

[28-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Oszy#5734
if you have the WIF you can import back. in native it should stay anyway. how did you use lite ? i can only start native

[28-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ye I used native but it didint ask me for any WIF

[28-Sep-18 10:08 AM] Buddz1993#5380
when I started it

[28-Sep-18 10:09 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Cheap home set up then , I am new to mining any suggestions on what I can do. How do I rent  hash.

[28-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Oszy#5734
@Buddz1993  no it won't but when you have an address generated you can export WIF private key

[28-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380
wheres the WIF located?

[28-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380
so if I didint export it I lost the coins? lol

[28-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I was about to do it and then my computer completly shut off lol

[28-Sep-18 10:10 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Is it not just the pirate coin that needs activated again to get the z address.

[28-Sep-18 10:10 AM] Oszy#5734
it shouldn't disappear in native O.o

[28-Sep-18 10:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
so the seed its the same as my lite mode?

[28-Sep-18 10:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
because when I started native it didin't ask me for any seed

[28-Sep-18 10:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I only started native for pirate

[28-Sep-18 10:11 AM] BitDaddy#1453
I have to activate my coins each time I log into agama to see any other coins that are not $KMD.

[28-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Buddz1993#5380
so where was the seed  then

[28-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Oszy#5734
native doesn't ask for a seed

[28-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Buddz1993#5380
when I crated the new Z address I had my seed there is that what you are saying?

[28-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Buddz1993#5380
created*

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Oszy#5734
next to the Z adrress there is the 3 dot button ... you click that you can export private key there next time

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] BitDaddy#1453
You can still  view your $Pirate balance and z address in Agama lite mode .

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380
how?

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Oszy#5734
i guess he wants to access it not just view it üòõ

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I cant gain acess to it

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380
is there anything I can back up in data

[28-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380
or something

[28-Sep-18 10:13 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Activate the $Pirate coin in lite mode and you will see your z address and private balance.

[28-Sep-18 10:14 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Re- install wallet with seed if no other option.

[28-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Buddz1993#5380
cant just pirate run on native?

[28-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Oszy#5734
I just started agama now, activated $Pirate in native, then Go to RECEIVE and when it's synced you will see the z address and balance

[28-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Buddz1993#5380
and its the same adress as before?

[28-Sep-18 10:14 AM] Buddz1993#5380
address*

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Oszy#5734
it won't change itself, only you can request to generate another. if you had balance it will be next to it.

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
privkey for zaddr is only in the wallet.dat

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Yes it can only be sent/received  on native I think but I can also view my balance and z address in lite mode.

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the seed wont have anything to do with it

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ahh So I need to make a backup of that

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
so i dont lose my privtkey

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
lite mode cant view zaddr until sapling

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and zSPV servers

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
the wallet.dat is located where?

[28-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810

awesome infographic dude üëÜ

[28-Sep-18 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
what is that exactly? a pool website?

[28-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Mylo#8306
piratepool.io

[28-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
is piratepool.io not pirate.komodostats.com?  thought it was the same?

[28-Sep-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be more fair to list all pools on pool.pirate.black

[28-Sep-18 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@webworker01 now I think that yes, it doesn't really sounds good to make a pool on that domain üòÑ

[28-Sep-18 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I cancel that thought of making that sub domain
