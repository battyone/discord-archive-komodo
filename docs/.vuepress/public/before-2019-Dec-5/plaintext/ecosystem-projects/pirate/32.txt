ah private transactions no good for atomic swaps... ok so cex only option... what about proxy tokens could exchange private chain ?

[23-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
cant do CC

[23-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the one case where a CEX actually makes technical sense

[23-Sep-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c how can we fund the notary nodes with PIRATE? They can't mine any coin themselves at current diff.

[23-Sep-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
mm withdraw

[23-Sep-18 09:02 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. we go full way with mm for PIRATE

[23-Sep-18 09:03 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll put together a guide to split and notarize PIRATE

Below are the submissions I could find within this discord chat. I thought I'd group them together so we can pin this post and either get more submissions, or vote on a logo. What are everyone's thoughts?

Logo submitted by @Hermes
"One of their concepts for the Pirate Logo"
https://ibb.co/fr7GnU

Logo submitted by @NutellaLicka
"My take on the Pirate Coin logo. The X, used by pirates on maps, is inspired by the treasure that's secret and hidden away from onlookers"
https://ibb.co/iUip7U

Logo's submitted by @wookie
"I created a tricorn style Pirate Hat, with a Komodo logo. Under the hat is a bandana and eye patch, all being nods to the PIRATE name. There are 2 versions, one with and one without a face to emphasize on anonymity and privacy. The logo pack comes with KMD colors or a grayscale. It also includes options with a shadow tone."

macOS. using the commandline wallet. I've been running it like from my terminal with this:

@wookie use 
```
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE stop
cd ~/komodo
git reset --hard
git checkout FSM
git pull
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j4
```

[24-Sep-18 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
