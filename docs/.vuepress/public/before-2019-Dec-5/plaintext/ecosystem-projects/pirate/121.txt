yes anybody can "clone" PIRATE by: ./komodod -ac_name=CLONE -ac_private=1 ...

[05-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but such a chain wont have any notarization

[05-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course I would not support any ac_private chain that has no unique value added

[05-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I am a bit biased as I did by some PIRATE as soon as dPoW was working on it

[05-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it just wont do any good to dilute the PIRATE zaddr pool with a clone chain

[05-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and if technically it is not good, I will be against it

[05-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a lot of benefit in being the first

[05-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and any non-notarized ac_pirate chain... it would be able to be reorged at will, we have people here that are quite good at that

We have a ac_private chain on STAKED for testin, that has notarizations etc... how ever its worthless as it has no use case.

[05-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
a side effect of offering 51% protection services is we need to be very good at doing 51% attacks during the tests

[05-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I would say that the combined skillset of the KMD ecosystem is very close to third in the entire crypto

for the CPU miners it was a windfall. mining economics

[05-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
just like 0.3 will be considered a windfall when it is 10x higher

[05-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but that assumes tortuga.exchange comes online smoothly

[05-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can also get the lite wallet and painless onboarding along with zpayments...

[05-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
I think XMR will get a worthy challenge for the top spot

[05-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but this assumes a rational and sane market and with the usual ups and downs

[05-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE has the meme power, even if XMR added pirate language to their gui

[05-Oct-18 01:15 PM] house#8741
Jeez ... ya think ?

[05-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC will be for taddr usage

[05-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE for zaddr usage

[05-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess corporations could use PIRATE as it doesnt disclose to competitors any info

[05-Oct-18 01:17 PM] 0x03#8822

_will still only have $16.43 worth of BTC when that time comes_

[05-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we could be debating activating CC on BTC mainnet, instead of blocksize

Given that he said 6 years ago that they were going to abandon bdb "soon", I'd say they're not interested in "inside" ideas either

4MB blocks only work if they are segwit data, if it is normal transactions then it wouldnt work

[05-Oct-18 01:27 PM] 0x03#8822
so kneejerk reactions seem 'expected' to me

[05-Oct-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason given was the N*N signature attack. I asked why not to limit the total number of sigs in a tx

[05-Oct-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so that N is contained, regarless of blocksize

[05-Oct-18 01:27 PM] 0x03#8822
(@xRobeSx no side hit into your direction when i say 'so called experts' - dont get me wrong)

[05-Oct-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
there was no coherent answer, something about breaking the installed base, which is only ok if done by breaking all the long time rpc calls

[05-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`4MB blocks only work if they are segwit data, if it is normal transactions then it wouldnt work`
So you're saying that you disapprove of the shell-game method?

[05-Oct-18 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[05-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess if the limit to the signatures was changed, then it would break some existing tx?

[05-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
I asked how many such tx actually existed

[05-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810

Personally, my favorite claim in all of it was that segwit was needed because storage is expensive (despite being less than 1/1000th the cost per bit that it was when BTC started)

[05-Oct-18 01:31 PM] 0x03#8822
well. as long as i have to wait about 2 hours from 'send payment' to 'nh shows balance' (eventho that partially is NHs fault as well) i dont see any use for bitcoin other than 'being the first'

[05-Oct-18 01:31 PM] 0x03#8822

Core in no way wants BTC to be a currency, they've said for years that they want it to be a commodity (or as marketing calls it, "store of value")

[05-Oct-18 01:33 PM] house#8741
fact remains that it is at the top of the crypto pyramid ... and while most people are not skilled devs or even partially hobbist technology reserchers, we will see the adoption quotient measured by btc for some time yet

[05-Oct-18 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"store of value" = Ponzi-esque concept where your only goal is to sell it to the next jackwagon coming down the pike for more than you paid for it

[05-Oct-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
channels CC will allow sending BTC equivalent token whose payment is dPoW secured as soon as it hits the mempool

[05-Oct-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then everybody can accept 0conf that is secured by BTC notarizations
