I used user/pass of simple string too, had same effect

[06-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
What do you get when you run the nicehash pool verifier

[06-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
do you have the ports open?

[06-Sep-18 03:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this:
```Pool host: [POOL IP HERE]
Pool port: 3062
Pool user: pirate
Pool pass: pirate

Resolving pool host [POOL IP HERE]... OK

[06-Sep-18 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I need to sort this pool soon. testing using nicehash. I hope to get z9 soon

[06-Sep-18 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
have plenty of time to test and set this up until then

[06-Sep-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
would rather burn the coins

[06-Sep-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
I don't like the idea of us setting a price for new users to enter at

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
or give small bounty for performing tasks

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
whichever you guys like. üòÉ

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
I'll be mostly busy offline, doing some tests with ca333

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
dev fund could be useful, but that's not what we were talking about

[06-Sep-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
just airdrop it, without charge

[06-Sep-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
we are talking a pretty small amount total

[06-Sep-18 08:32 AM] SHossain#0007
Please let me know the z addr and i'll send the funds there. And, the other total 20k reserved for the next 4 public pool (5000 PIRATE each pool)

Right.

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
Only the number of tx's going in

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] scubapanda#2485
Only your own.

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
Okay, cause I still get 0 balance using getwalletinfo

[06-Sep-18 03:10 PM] Flexatron#8809
I got paid through the pool to the z-adress
