@0x03 Every time I see the word "triggered" and it doesn't refer to firearms, I think of this pic:

I suspect selling to Genie is having a negative impact on KMD price ... I may be wrong but I may be right

No, I'm the moron that takes 5 hrs to trade 15 coins so's to not move the price 😛

[03-Oct-18 07:42 AM] house#8741
just sayin' ... since has taken quite a hit since his 100k sells

[03-Oct-18 07:43 AM] house#8741
ok, sure, Id like toi beleive that

[03-Oct-18 07:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

lol its all good, Im not mad at all. Just wish I had jumped in earlier and leveraged the move.

[03-Oct-18 07:44 AM] house#8741
all that being said ... it is presenting nice buying op 😋

[03-Oct-18 07:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
besides, if 10k over 4 days is dropping the price, then there really isn't any liquidity in the market

[03-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to be fair... when i started ASIC mining pirate it was a "test coin"

[03-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181

what was the website repo of pirate.black again? you could PR your pool URL to it

[03-Oct-18 07:55 AM] house#8741
come to think of it ... is not a bad idea to market Pirate (ARRR) out to the Spanish and Portuguese (Pirata = Pirate in espanol) considering from whence they originated

[03-Oct-18 07:58 AM] 0x03#8822
i wonder how webworker came to help you setup a pool when he wouldn't give me his changes for `licensing issues`

[03-Oct-18 07:58 AM] 0x03#8822
sorry, i could not resist this side hit

[03-Oct-18 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because he had not released the code back then 😕

[03-Oct-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the license Genie used in Knomp means that if you share it with 1 person, you need to share it with everyone

[03-Oct-18 08:01 AM] 0x03#8822
theres a slight difference: he told me due to licensing issues he couldn't pass it on or what not

[03-Oct-18 08:01 AM] 0x03#8822

`the license Genie used in Knomp` stopped existing months ago

[03-Oct-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
me I usually put all my conde on git anyway, if people are stupid enough to use it thats their problem, 99% of the time I have no idea what I am doing and just guess

[03-Oct-18 08:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I deleted the entire repo when you pissed me off over CHIPS, you can do whatever you want to/with it

[03-Oct-18 08:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In fact, the knomp that I started never even ran, so if you shared a running version then you violated any license that sharing a patch to said version would violate :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[03-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well the non working version of Knomp was enough to force mine every single AC on the KMD notary nodes, and cause all kinds of crazy issues,... nealrly all of which have now been fixed.

[03-Oct-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So thank you 😄

[03-Oct-18 08:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since you guys violated that part, any other violation is moot 😛

I cloned this: https://github.com/webworker01/knomp and all the rest of my work.  I asked for help where I got stuck, but all informacion in readme and in the code.  Sorry, if anyone has a problem.

@ronyi no problems at all, i wanted a 3rd pool anyways. my `releasing the changes` wasnt enough, so thank you and make sure you PR your pool url into the website repo!

[03-Oct-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
smk762 cloned mine, what is a slone of webs, which was a clone of genies.... for staked. That pool will run and sutomatically add any staked chains added to the cluster, very cool.

You were right, up to the end. It was MGNX we were on when I started it and the intention was to make it specifically for the Komodo ecosystem and strip out all of the ZCL and ZEC bullshit 😉

99.99999999% of all licenses are violated in one form or fashion 🤣

[03-Oct-18 10:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One could argue that a link or instruction to find the license should appear before, with, or after:
`[PoolWorker][Thread 0][10/02 10:12:37] Stratum Pool Server Started for pirate [PIRATE] {equihash}
                        Network Connected:    Mainnet
                        Detected Reward Type:    POW
....`
Not that I or any of us really cares, other than for the sake of conversation

[03-Oct-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It might mean though that the website requires link to license file as well?`
If you mean the frontend, I'm not sure a case could be made for the enduser to be shown

[03-Oct-18 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`does a config file make something interactive?`
that'd be up to a judge if any license were ever contested, I'd imagine
