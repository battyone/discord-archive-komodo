They’re the only one who could do it

[05-Oct-18 03:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If an anon sends me this and a zaddress I will pay them 😃

[05-Oct-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... when it was deiced to allow notarisations by simply allowing notary adress to do T transaction.... I was going to just send all my PRIATE to my notary address

[05-Oct-18 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I decided against it

[05-Oct-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still might do that though

[05-Oct-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it sure would look stupid

[05-Oct-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having a notary address sitting on no 2 rick list sending the entire balance to itself every few hours 😄

[05-Oct-18 03:08 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Fishy, the principle thing is a tough argument considering that address is actinig EXACTLY in accordance with the parameters set by the rules of the chain. That is, we mine to transaprent addresses.

but it clearly works better without it there 😕

[05-Oct-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just merged the entire staked iguana into a-team on mainnet will see what happens

[05-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it started and added all coins without issue

[05-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still ahvent seen a notarisation..

[05-Oct-18 03:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're in last place anyway, so no loss 😝

[05-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not last 😛

[05-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
libscott is last, because he siad that he could mine without notarising so deiced not to bother notarising

[05-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[05-Oct-18 03:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I'd known the results of who was going to do what, or more precisely not doing what, I think I would have ran for election 😦

[05-Oct-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Next election will be good, only 3 nodes allowed per operator

You need to do a deal to make sure you cant lose although it was very stressful until that person actually voted.

[05-Oct-18 03:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, at the time we were expanding, all I had was wrapped up in the expansion, and I figured I'd be useless trying to run a NN from home

[05-Oct-18 03:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, how was I to know that some would literally do nothing 😛

[05-Oct-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
heaps of them do nothing

[05-Oct-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why we need a testnet just of active operators

a-team is notarising with staked version of iguana ... and its not END RATIFY all the darn time any more... only time will tell if thats a good or bad thing.

[05-Oct-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry i was just in this channel lol

[05-Oct-18 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User why? PIRATE is dPoW, so it's on-topic-ish

[05-Oct-18 03:39 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@mountaindrifter moral and maximizing privacy principle.   


Obey the intention of the law as well as the letter of it.   That’s the idea I’m getting at.  


I could care less but it’s something that has been brought up.   If it never leaves that address, no big deal.

[05-Oct-18 03:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Obey the intention of the law as well as the letter of it.`
Seems to me that if the intention is a chain where it's none of anyone else's business what you do with your coinage, then it shouldn't matter if minerx *never* shields it

[05-Oct-18 03:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And I do feel this way.  

I also feel like it would be nice to have them shielded for everyone’s sake but to each his own.  👍

[05-Oct-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And I do feel this way`
If you did, you wouldn't know or care about how much is in any address(es) except your own 😛

[05-Oct-18 03:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think my intentions are being misconstrued.   I don’t care how much.     


As marketing, I do care about being the best and it looks better when it’s 99% shielded not 85%.  
At any rate it’s still 12x the shielding of zcash so I’m not worried but it would help my marketing material a lot.

[05-Oct-18 03:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there a way to code mining rewards as shielded?

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I hope that clarifies my intention.

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Y’all can have 1 or 1 million pirate and y’all can spend it on hookers and blow and I don’t care

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You could make it so that mining rewards if not in Z address after X time cannot be sent and are lost

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
99% private just looks better than 85%.  That’s all. 😘

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that could make the situation worse if someone forgets to sheild them though

[05-Oct-18 03:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`As marketing, I do care about being the best and it looks better when it’s 99% shielded not 85%.`
So, solve both problems: stop marketing it as x%
😉

[05-Oct-18 03:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah I don’t know about nullifying time locked mining rewards.  That’s probably playing with fire.

[05-Oct-18 03:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I havent started marketing it as anything yet @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 💙

[05-Oct-18 03:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You could make it so that mining rewards if not in Z address after X time cannot be sent and are lost`
And you'd likely lose 99% of all interested peoples

[05-Oct-18 03:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Deleted User I know.  The strength of that shielding lies in the amount of coins shielded.

[05-Oct-18 03:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But you know that.

[05-Oct-18 03:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So does every other well heeled dev. 😃

[05-Oct-18 03:54 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It’s really a trivial point but I am glad everyone is open to this kind of discussion.

[05-Oct-18 03:54 AM] FishyGuts#5085
True emm... I’m simply talking about the size of the shielded pool. 😃

[05-Oct-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not 100% sure of much @blackjok3r, but I am 100% sure that making miners lose funds because of some random  timescale that makes marketing punch up prettier numbers for stats is a guaranteed way to drop a ton of the current hashrate

[05-Oct-18 03:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 he acknowledged it and that is why I said it’s playing with fire.  I would never ask that to happen and would be against it

[05-Oct-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just suggested a possible solution,... i didnt say it was a good idea... for the record all my coins are and have always been unsheilded

[05-Oct-18 03:55 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Fishy, I certainly see your attention. In fact, I agree with you that it would be great  if everybody shielded their balances. The thing is this is how the parameters of this chain are written. It is exactly how it is suppose to work. Mining to a zaddr is not a goo idea because it adds some protection  to know everytime a coinbase is created. So the current setup is good. If we do not want people to keep coinbase rewards in the  transparent mining address we should create a rule that all coinbase rewards must be moved to a z addr within XX blocks or the balance is sent to me :P. My point is, I agree with you, but the owner of that address is using it in the EXACT way that the parameters of the chain dictate and creating a bounty to discover the owner seems to go against the principles of pirate, IMHO.

[05-Oct-18 03:55 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
So I am saying dont hate the player, hate the game. If we do not like them using the coin as the code dicates, lets change the code, not change the persons mind

[05-Oct-18 03:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@mountaindrifter the Monty is only for the one person to claim.   Noine will be able to hunt them down.

[05-Oct-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I concede that it's a good % chuck as far as "looks", but the reality is that it's less and less meaningful every day

[05-Oct-18 03:59 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
just fyi, I agree the time lock is a bad idea as other have said. I think the current method of mining coinbase to T-addr and 100% transactions be z-addr is a solid setup as it is

[05-Oct-18 04:00 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
Fishy, you can still say 100%  shielded annon transactions required. Only coinbase rewards and notarisation is transaprent for resons

[05-Oct-18 04:00 AM] mountaindrifter#4595
seems fair that 100% of transactions are infact sheilded

[05-Oct-18 04:00 AM] mountaindrifter#4595

there was another solution to the problem but its 1000x harder to implement

Probbaly easier to just find the account holder and convince them to change then to come up with accurate wording 😉  lol

Fishy, no worries. I think everybody agrees you are doing tremendous work. It is always good to share discussions on opinons. They are never easy and people get toes stepped on, but ultimately it is what forms the community behind the tech. thanks for all you do!
