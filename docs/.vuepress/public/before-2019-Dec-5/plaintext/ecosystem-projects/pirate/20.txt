How would Pirate get added/accepted on Agama?

[06-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Don King#8901
Can I use my regular komodo address for PIRATE also?

[06-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Don King#8901
Still wtb 500kmd worth

[06-Sep-18 09:05 PM] scubapanda#2485
How much Pirate are you hoping to get?

[06-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Don King#8901
@scubapanda hopefully 250k, 
@webworker01 , thanks I will use paperwallet

[06-Sep-18 10:10 PM] Don King#8901
Happy to pay the going rate, whatever it is now

[06-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Don King#8901
Have approx 1k kmd to spend now

[06-Sep-18 10:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto nice 👍

[06-Sep-18 11:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@scubapanda agama can easily support PIRATE in full node mode, there is no way to do light/electrum mode with PIRATE

[06-Sep-18 11:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Pirates request @pbca26 to add it to Agama Wallet ☠️💀😁🙏🏼

[06-Sep-18 11:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I think once we have multigateway CC, we can use that to trade PIRATE using that?

[06-Sep-18 11:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If correct, then we have a possible DEX for PIRATE after MGW CC 🙂

[07-Sep-18 12:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't either, my guess is a CC that can send/unlock funds to multiple blockchains via -ac_cc=2, not just 1 chain

[07-Sep-18 12:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

They got it from multigateway

[07-Sep-18 01:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It’s better than CEX at least

[07-Sep-18 01:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Oh there is issue 
Z address are not multisig

[07-Sep-18 01:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or they are?

[07-Sep-18 01:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Multisig is important in multigateway

[07-Sep-18 06:24 AM] scubapanda#2485
@dukeleto I think having PIRATE full node supported on Agama would be very helpful!

[07-Sep-18 08:01 AM] pbca26#5430
>Pirates request @pbca26 to add it to Agama Wallet 
aye, captain!

[07-Sep-18 08:28 AM] jorian#4555
should have added staking. real pirates hold on dearly to their treasure

[07-Sep-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically its not impossible to make a z-gateway, but do not expect this for many moons

OK, Listen up @benohanlon and @SHossain  - You Syphilitic Stinky pegged, pig footed button mashers.   I only be havin one good eye and I don't be needed to be wasting time reading yer notifications.  Let's hope this deck fpr discussion isn't as useless as an invisible eye patch or a hinged pegleg.   

If there be any booty coming my way, It best be going to Regnar and his treasure hunt.   I love me a good booty search.

[07-Sep-18 12:32 PM] FPOEVP#2320
hello, how can I create a Z-address ? I only have a standard komodo address?

[07-Sep-18 12:32 PM] benohanlon#1119
@FPOEVP you just need any chain that's got a z address in native. Might be quicker to load verus, equihash or zilliqa etc.. if you don't have komodo ready.

[07-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Hello altough I dont use JUMBLR and dont have a z Address only use lite mode here it comes ! why Don't Pirates Go To Strip Clubs? they already have all the booty!

[07-Sep-18 12:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
😛

[07-Sep-18 12:34 PM] benohanlon#1119
@FPOEVP @Buddz1993 very quick way to do this is download the custom verus wallet (keep it sep from komodo).

[07-Sep-18 12:35 PM] benohanlon#1119
then load verus in naitive and once it's loaded go to 'receive' and create a private address

[07-Sep-18 12:35 PM] benohanlon#1119
then copy that private address

[07-Sep-18 12:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
huum sounds easy enough

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
ideally you'd use Komodo

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Verus coin wallet its called agama win v0.3.13a

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
but if you're on windows that could be slow

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye..

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] FPOEVP#2320
thanks

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
you could use equihash or zilliqa too

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
also shossain prob wants you to work it out lol - so ill get told off now for telling you

[07-Sep-18 12:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
you just need a Z address which = private address

[07-Sep-18 12:37 PM] benohanlon#1119
and you can only get that in naitive

[07-Sep-18 12:37 PM] Regnar#6164
z addresses for KMD work for PIRATE? 🤔

[07-Sep-18 12:37 PM] benohanlon#1119
exactly

[07-Sep-18 12:37 PM] benohanlon#1119
as long as you have private key too

[07-Sep-18 12:37 PM] benohanlon#1119
which you will in agama

[07-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be best to get komodod, sync PIRATE and then generate a z-address

[07-Sep-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you need to export the zaddress and import it into PIRATE

[07-Sep-18 12:39 PM] FPOEVP#2320
I  just download agama for creating my z-address. But I can give you my joke now. I hope you like it :P

Why Does It Take Pirates So Long To Learn The Alphabet?
Because they can spend years at C.

Kinda ruins the joke :abusedsmily:

[07-Sep-18 12:48 PM] FPOEVP#2320
There once was pirate captain who, whenever it looked like a battle would be imminent would change into a red shirt. 
After observing this behavior for a few months, one of the crew members asked him what it meant.
"It's in case I get shot. I don't want your crew members to see blood and freak out."
"That's very sensible, sir." 
At that moment, the crew member spotted eight hostile ships on the horizon. 
The captain all of a sudden looked very concerned.
"Get my brown pants."

😛

@SHossain A pirate walks into a bar with a ship's steering wheel stuck in the front of his pants. The bartender says, "Why do you have that thing in your pants? Isn't it uncomfortable?" The pirate replies, "Arrr... It's drivin' me nuts!"          Hope it gets you to laugh! zcCQRFdKRuD2NBHgcvPsk4NhKkY53g6zC3sb7N2sEqPpNcRkUBvuHTZ7wZYUc485VDnqt5VVtDSWfsRVumnBZYSHCPExGJN
