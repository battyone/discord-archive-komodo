[01-Nov-18 01:08 AM] Flexatron#8809
just when you think you have the chance at 80 Msol, you are back at 176 Msol

[01-Nov-18 01:09 AM] yorktronic#2703
yeah

[01-Nov-18 01:10 AM] yorktronic#2703
the blockchain is only reporting 47 Msol

[01-Nov-18 01:11 AM] yorktronic#2703
but it keeps going up

[01-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Flexatron#8809
getnetworkhasps returns 104 Msol

[01-Nov-18 01:18 AM] yorktronic#2703

[01-Nov-18 11:53 AM] Oszy#5734
about 3 mil

[01-Nov-18 11:57 AM] ronyi#5719
piratechain.org perfetly working, but now 0 miner.  I donated some miners (77,7PIRATE*x, 256PIRATE my first miner), but it did not help. I used tipbot(KMD, ARRR) without result. I have no idea. 0fee?  I do not think is help. Sorry guys i trying to help, but this will not work. I am not complaining, but there is no sense. My total 1%fee reward: ~20PIRATE.  What's wrong with piratechain.org? Tell me. Thank you.

[01-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Oszy#5734
all i can think is people want more regular payouts and want it fast so they choose a pool with a lot miners. this won't change unless a couple people with decent hashrate decides to switch to your pool.

[01-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Oszy#5734
Try different kind of promotions, donate to a block founder is a nice way of promoting, but then be upfront with it, so people will have a motive to join your pool for an upcoming reward.

[01-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Oszy#5734
at least i would do it that way

[01-Nov-18 12:02 PM] ronyi#5719
I donated block founder multiple times, and I wrote about it....

[01-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Oszy#5734
yes but you have done if afterwards so no one had an idea that you will do it. announce it that you will give a bonus at X block or something and people will join to get  it

[01-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Oszy#5734
Gotta try. Advertise more. I don't know i don't have a pool or a Z9 to help you out.  Wish you the best.

[01-Nov-18 12:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@ronyi maybe rent ad space and in other pool and advertise nice promotion? (just a thought, may not be ideal)

[01-Nov-18 12:07 PM] Oszy#5734
and check if your pool is working fine, i just checked it with nicehash pool tester and didn't work.

[01-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Oszy#5734
`SSL_connect failed r:2 error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure

[01-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
offer something different than the other pools + you need a base hash level

[01-Nov-18 12:08 PM] ronyi#5719
I do not need it to do this... Sorry, I feel unnecessary. Nicehash only stratum....: stratum+tcp://pool.piratechain.org:3033.... I rented hashrate yesterday (2msol....)

[01-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Oszy#5734
this is with DTSM

[01-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Oszy#5734
I can't connect to your pool

[01-Nov-18 12:11 PM] ronyi#5719
I tested, previos DTSM version and Claymore and EWBF... there is only trouble with SSL and most do not even understand. I remove SSL my pool.

[01-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think the ssl is causing problems for many people

[01-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
without ssl, it will work much smoother

[01-Nov-18 12:19 PM] ronyi#5719
Done. I removed SSL.

[01-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Oszy#5734
double check that or restart i am still getting ssl error

[01-Nov-18 12:20 PM] ronyi#5719
pls read... i removed ssl. try: stratum+tcp://pool.piratechain.org:3031

[01-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Oszy#5734
pls read. i removed ssl too.

and nicehash... ‚úÖ

[01-Nov-18 01:01 PM] Microbeguy86#3447
@ronyi ill be back mining on your pool tonight. Just cleaning up balance i have in other pools. It is usually difficult when a pool is small and blocks are far in between

Hello!

[01-Nov-18 01:15 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Why my Agama wallet always "reset" when i close it ?

[01-Nov-18 01:15 PM] TheGemologist#6023
All activated coins disappear and i have to sync again and import wallet via WIF key

[01-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
Click stop before you close agama

[01-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
And yes its multicoin

[01-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Flexatron#8809
So need to activate and sync after reopening
