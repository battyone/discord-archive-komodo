[27-Sep-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE hashrate is 2% of ZEC's

meh. the queue on the pool will increase for a bit until ...the other queue has ran out

[27-Sep-18 08:11 PM] 0x03#8822
dont worry, all is safe

[27-Sep-18 08:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
so PIRATE should be valued at 2.88 USD or is zcash overvalued 😃

dont see anything there either lol

[27-Sep-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
7200 ZEC per day at 50x the hashrate

[27-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so on a hashrate basis it seems PIRATE is still quite bargain.

[27-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes I guess a $3 price is implied by the hashrate. seems we have very generous miners selling at so close to cost

[27-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thank you.

[27-Sep-18 08:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
at this rate it will be $30 next week

[27-Sep-18 08:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
soon 100 onboardings

[27-Sep-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
only if the hashrate doubles 3 times from here

[27-Sep-18 08:18 PM] crumb#2550

[27-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Jonathan#3687
I'd watch that movie 😉

[27-Sep-18 08:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is additional 88 M sol/sec to rent at NH

[27-Sep-18 08:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
that might be the limit for PIRATE at the moment

EU has additional 33

[27-Sep-18 08:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
and cheaper

[27-Sep-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so PIRATE is now some big percentage of nicehash's equihash?

[27-Sep-18 08:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
assuming  PIRATE miners use NH yes

[27-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
who bought at .0777 when I'm selling at .07 😐

[27-Sep-18 08:38 PM] jorian#4555
it's in the number

[27-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
PIRATE has been driving up NH prices *a lot*

[27-Sep-18 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX at any sizable rate, eu is only nominally cheaper than us

[27-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
ok, WTS at .0777 :trollface:

[27-Sep-18 08:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
ah they are small

[27-Sep-18 08:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
remove the 0 😃

[27-Sep-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually, now that I let my order go, eu is more than us

86% shielded

[27-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
whoever has http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RPir4tes9Yq2DgQLDZgEcX2iQeTR5mE7z2 please donate to the communuty funds: zcREpt45Mj2oCvXnb6bJ2iuGqnPXEmV6QrMzXrTCPd81ACLqtd2wShpwSe5iwGeUP8ByFoZfeJxDqNf7cKG98V7c8L2yuKi
that subsidizes the onboarding and the more we onboard the more PIRATE will be worth. suggested donation level of 10%

At the very least, please shield it.

[27-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
also http://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RTPWYij66peBpQzg7wHxrZM7qsE7pAGzrK

[27-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if those two are shielded, we would be 99% shielded

[27-Sep-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
that alone will increase the value

[27-Sep-18 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
what's your opinion on forcing miners to use a new address for each block?

[27-Sep-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt much matter, as long as it ends up shielded

[27-Sep-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
Well it can matter

[27-Sep-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
I know that person has >1M PIRATE

[27-Sep-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
if you did a bit of digging, you'd find exactly how much I mined

[27-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380

Ahahah I think exactly the same everyday

[27-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont use -pubkey= and it would mine to a different address each block

[27-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but i guess using knomp, it is a different story

[27-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Yassin#3685

better privacy than ZEC since zaddr is required, even newbies wont be able to lose their privacy

[27-Sep-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
better than XMR as the total number of PIRATE tx is much bigger than 10

f-in noobies

[27-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
XMR uses a mixin of 10, PIRATE's anon set is all zaddr tx, ever

[27-Sep-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so the PIRATE privacy keeps growing

[27-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Yassin#3685
