@ph03nix He and I have spoken before.  
I am wondering if there is a community member who wants to do it and put their name on it instead 😃

I decided to mine in polly - should I be mining else where?

[14-Nov-18 04:15 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i wonder what the possibility would be in the future with coin projects that might add code that revolves around decentralizing hashrate, such as having community voted parameters that prevent potential solutions from pools that have over x % of hash and or blocks found per time period. Would be interesting, at the very least to ponder how that might be coded / accomplished

I can't wait to get the z9m that I won, I'll be testing it on another pool and comparing it to my current z9m

[14-Nov-18 04:19 AM] CiPhEr#2091
by the way, is there a page somewhere that compares the various pirate pools? I can't even find what payout structure they have from visiting their sites. I know piratepool.io is pps, just from digging through the discord

[14-Nov-18 04:20 AM] wolfgang#3508
only 40 pirate in 24 hours on 2x z9m .  Is itjust me or is that a little low?

[14-Nov-18 04:20 AM] Steve10#5203
@wolfgang my rewards for 1 mini has been very low today too

[14-Nov-18 04:21 AM] wolfgang#3508

i've been getting over 60 a day with my z9mini but has dropped lately to mid 50's

[14-Nov-18 04:22 AM] Steve10#5203
@CiPhEr what pool

[14-Nov-18 04:23 AM] wolfgang#3508
polly

[14-Nov-18 04:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@wolfgang It depends what you are looking for in a pool. 

The things I would look for in a pool are the following:
Minimum payout (in ARRR): Does my hash rate mean I need a higher/lower payout so I am getting regular payouts, rather than waiting a day or so to be paid.
Pool fee %: What do they do with that %, do they contribute a % to the project or contribute personally? Am I happy to pay that % for the quality of service they offer.
The website design and layout: Is it is an eyesore or does it appeal to me personally? Is it easy to use? Does it provide me with the information I require easily? 
Pool stability: Is the pool reliable? Do the offer backup ports to set my miner too? Have they had a period of downtime lately, has this been rectified? Are they proactive with informing everyone about the reasons why?
Pool features: Does the pool offer any special features you would be interested in?

And finally, hash rate:
For new miners, the other thing I would educate myself on is pool hash rates. It is important to know that a high hash rate pool means that you will receive smaller, more frequent payouts. Compared to a low hash rate pool that will provide higher payouts, at a lower frequency. Over time, theoretically they will both average out to the same. A higher hash rate pool will provide payouts closer to the average, a lower hash rate pool could provide payouts outside the average on a day to day basis (both higher and lower).

These are just my thoughts when coming to choosing a pool, I'd be happy to take feedback.

Whilst i'm here, I may as well advertise my mining pool. http://minethepiratechain.black. We are looking for new miners and offer low payout and 0% fee.

The links below will provide information about mining ARRR as well as a list of pools.

[14-Nov-18 04:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@CiPhEr I believe all the Pirate pools are PPS

[14-Nov-18 04:24 AM] CiPhEr#2091
Thanks for the info @NutellaLicka

[14-Nov-18 04:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Another thing miners should be considering (as investors in the coin itself), is whether having all of the hash on one pool is the most secure thing to do. The affects of having 100% of the coins hashrate on 1 pool are a problem and need to be thought about. What if that 1 pool was to go down? What if that pool's operator was to decide to abuse the trust of the miners and misuse their hash?

[14-Nov-18 04:45 AM] CiPhEr#2091
I agree @NutellaLicka i think for me at this point I really only have two choices in pools, the two that use a % of their proceeds to help pirate project. Wish there were more pools doing that

[14-Nov-18 05:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is a good thing. I will say, I have opted for a 0% fee to attract miners to my pool. I am however, going to reintroduce a 1% fee in December(and being open and honest about doing so), and a portion of this will be going to the project. I would say that the pools that offer a 0% fee are doing so to attract miners to their pool. It costs time and money to run these things. But if that is the deciding factor on why you choose pool A over B, than that is great.

[14-Nov-18 05:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
In 18 months of mining, never have I chosen a 0% pool over a 1% pool because of the fee. 
Hell I used to donate 2% to Suprnova because they ran such a great pool

[14-Nov-18 05:29 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m on piratechain.org because @ronyi was the third pool op to sign up, he’s had low hash for a long time but still runs the pool.  

Today he agreed to donate a portion of his pool fees to the marketing and onboarding.    I’m sold.  Pushed my hash there a few hours ago.   Thanks @ronyi

That's a fair point. Maybe I am misguided in my attempts :P

[14-Nov-18 05:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I mean... if I am mining thousands of coins per day maybe but I feel pool ops earn their fee.

[14-Nov-18 05:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Even then.   What’s 10 coins out of 1000.    I’m fine with. It if 8 hours a month I mind for the pool op.

[14-Nov-18 05:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
Of course half the stuff pirate is doing will probably soon be illegal for those of us in the land of the free. When privacy is outlawed, only pirates will have privacy.

[14-Nov-18 05:49 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah i just hopped on piratechain.org a few hours ago, noticed a massive infusion of hash just about an hour ago holy crap maybe that was @FishyGuts lol

[14-Nov-18 07:59 AM] ronyi#5719
@jansako @kaks i think it doesn't work well.

[14-Nov-18 08:02 AM] jansako#3330
could be... I have had such in my pool back in the day, restarting usually fixes it. This does not mean there is any issue with the coins or payouts, just the display.

[14-Nov-18 08:03 AM] jansako#3330
Without seeing the backend, there is no way to know for sure, but if the pool shows as active, accepts shares etc then it should be fine

[14-Nov-18 08:03 AM] kaks#6612
It may be fixed if find any blocks

[14-Nov-18 08:07 AM] ronyi#5719
@kaks I do not think so.

[14-Nov-18 08:13 AM] kaks#6612
The payout must be get paid

[14-Nov-18 08:14 AM] ronyi#5719
once for sure

Just a heads up ya wave weary windbags...
Crex24 received my ARRR test deposit this morning.  They will be using it to test the functions over the next few days.  
Be sure to sign up using our ref link if you have not yet.   There will be no KMD pairs there, only BTC and ETH. 
DigitalPrice took about 3 days from this point when they received my test deposit.
