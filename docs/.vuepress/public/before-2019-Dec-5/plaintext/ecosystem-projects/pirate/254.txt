This procedure has to be performed inside the Pirate folder located in %appdata%Roaming/Komodo

[02-Nov-18 03:43 PM] Hermes#6934
you need to erase the blocks and chainstate...and try running the blocks from 0 again...If the address of the pool that you are seeing is the same as the one you are seeing in the wallet then the balance should be reflected.

[02-Nov-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jl777c  good if they make more notifications - like after accepting withdrawal (notify: how long it will take estimation) or after sending email (that actually the email with code was sent and what to do next) - ***missing feedback will convert to some % users making unnecessary tickets***

[02-Nov-18 03:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but maybe they like to get more tickets idk :pirate:

[02-Nov-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes put all feedback into tickets, they are reading and responding to them

[02-Nov-18 03:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
@Hermes yes i’m doing it now

[02-Nov-18 03:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
gonna take a while but that’s it

[02-Nov-18 03:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yes, it’s the same adress...

[02-Nov-18 03:48 PM] TheGemologist#6023
do i need to import wif key again after ?

[02-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Hermes#6934
If it's already imported then there is no need...let me know how it ends...

[02-Nov-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@TheGemologist a WIF key as far as I know only covers one wallet address.  If the coins were split between addresses, you will need the WIF for each address....

[02-Nov-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think

[02-Nov-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but with zaddr, unless you create a new one you only have one

[02-Nov-18 03:52 PM] jansako#3330
I am a bit puzzled how he says he sees 'history' of transactions...

[02-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Hermes#6934
If he used one single zaddress and that address is the one he imported to his wallet .in the new PC ..and that's also his pool address then there shouldn't be no problem...

[02-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Hermes#6934
He  will need to verify the previous PC to make sure that there is no other address that had funds previously

[02-Nov-18 03:56 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually it will be usefull to see history of incoming z tx - amount and time

[02-Nov-18 03:56 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
even if it is only local file it's useful

[02-Nov-18 03:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in Agama would be nice to see

[02-Nov-18 03:57 PM] jansako#3330
agree

[02-Nov-18 03:57 PM] jansako#3330
both sent and received

[02-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jansako#3330
of course then you have a possible privacy risk if someone would grab one of these form an exchange... or ask for it by a court order to prove that someone who is under investigation received funds from the exchange

[02-Nov-18 04:00 PM] jansako#3330
or you could prove two people sent Pirate to each other by grabbing their 'local log'...

[02-Nov-18 04:00 PM] jansako#3330
maybe not so good to implement after all 😃

[02-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
once the operationresult is cleared, not sure how easy it is to prove who the sender was, even with access to the sender privkey

[02-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
probably some info is leaked in such a case, but nothing in the rpc call level is easily available to show you sent it

[02-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jansako#3330
I thought @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 was asking for a permanent 'log' of transactions

[02-Nov-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
incoming tx can be seen locally

[02-Nov-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I ment the wallet see when balance changes - so the balance chance can be logged

[02-Nov-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
useful info

[02-Nov-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you dont have it - and someone sends you some small amount you may not notice anything happened

[02-Nov-18 04:53 PM] kaveh#0913
Is there any way to agama save or privet key 🔑 so don’t force us to import key any time we open it?

[02-Nov-18 04:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are but I wouldn’t consider them secure.

[02-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Hermes#6934
What do you mean importing key each time you open it?

[02-Nov-18 05:08 PM] Hermes#6934
If the key is imported once you won't need to import it again ...

[02-Nov-18 05:10 PM] iAmLedger#8530
I only have to input one WIF address and it opens up all of my wallets even though every wallet has their own add and wif. Does this sound correct?

Just made a deposit - executing

[02-Nov-18 05:26 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i think i won’t be able to resync blocks from scratch now cause i’m away from home and no wifi, only 3g.. Let me be more clear.. I ve been mining for 3 days using the same Z-Address. My wallet is installed on my desktop computer at home and i’m traveling but i bring one notebook with me cause i have to do some OTC sells. So i installed Agama wallet, activated Pirate chain and waited it to sync. After syncing i wrote down my WIF key from the address i’m mining to and nothing appeared in my balance, i couldn’t click on send buttom and i couldn’t see any of my incoming transactions from the pool neither the ones i sent to the buyers... Than i wrote here and someone asked me to Rescan the wallet, I did and appeared some balance and only the transaction history from 14 hours ago until now, but i vê been using this address for more than 2 days and there are plenty more transactions than it’s showing there... Like it’s showing only data from the time i installed the wallet on this other computer.. As i already said, when i left home i check wallet balance and paid balance on pool, and it was like 1800 on wallet and 6.8k on pool. Now it’s 13K on pool and 2.5k on wallet..

[02-Nov-18 05:27 PM] TheGemologist#6023
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 That’s what i’m talking about missing Tx on the “Transaction History” ... it’s missing a lot of transactions i did

[02-Nov-18 05:29 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i don’t if this is possible but maybe my wallet is missing blocks from before

[02-Nov-18 05:29 PM] TheGemologist#6023
because the transactions received by me from the pool before yesterday night isn’t showing up anymore

[02-Nov-18 05:31 PM] miles#6381

[02-Nov-18 05:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
the same address bro. The address i’m using to mine and the one i’m checking my balance is the same i use since day 1 in this mining play

[02-Nov-18 05:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
It’s the one i sent here

[02-Nov-18 05:44 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Kind of. I had X balance, than i set up a big order of Hash on nicehash and went for a trip. When my order ended and i checked the amount mined via this link above for my worker i went to install the wallet on this new device to send it to a buyer and the balance is different from the one i had when i left home and it’s also different from the total it should be considering the coins i mined when i was traveling plus the ones i had before on wallet

[02-Nov-18 05:44 PM] TheGemologist#6023
understand ?

[02-Nov-18 05:45 PM] sc38#1156
any exchange soon. I know one was testing

[02-Nov-18 05:45 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i didn’t see the balance i mined from yersterday  until today

[02-Nov-18 05:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i hope it is the problem

[02-Nov-18 05:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
is there any way i can check the balance on my address outside from wallet ?

[02-Nov-18 05:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
like from block explorer

[02-Nov-18 05:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023

[02-Nov-18 05:50 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i’ll try to do it here.. What i found really strange is that i left it syncing through the night, when i woke balance was 0. Than i used rescan command from wallet and showed up this balance now

[02-Nov-18 05:50 PM] TheGemologist#6023
i erased the blocks and will try to sync from scratch again

[02-Nov-18 05:51 PM] TheGemologist#6023
Yeah, at the time i came here first time my wallet was at same height from network
