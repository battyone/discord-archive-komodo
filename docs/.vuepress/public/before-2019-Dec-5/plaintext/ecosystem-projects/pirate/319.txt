[17-Nov-18 04:53 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so if Crex ends up not being motivated to get the zaddr transactions working to support ARRR, would cryptobridge work? Or maybe their listing fee is high? I'm not sure. I wonder if they would be willing to take on the challenge.

[17-Nov-18 04:56 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298

I think crex will pull through and get it all going soon, they do have support from some devs here. @CiPhEr  @discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh

[17-Nov-18 06:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Crex24 we have @jl777c and myself willing to figure this out.  
We know it's new and not easy but trailblazing never is.  
If Digital Price can get this done, surely you have the resources to do it.

[17-Nov-18 06:21 AM] dustblaze#1349
Is ARRR trying to get listed on txbit? I know they were having a community vote

[17-Nov-18 06:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
In just a few words we had no plans for more listings after crex for a while save for top 10 exchanges.  
Now that crex is delayed as of this morning I may make more moves....

[17-Nov-18 06:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Then again just because a coin is on an exchange doesn‚Äôt mean volume.  We need to be methodical about our actions.

[17-Nov-18 06:25 AM] dustblaze#1349
Of course, I agree

[17-Nov-18 06:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I didn‚Äôt know txbit was having a contest.

[17-Nov-18 06:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Probably would have joined it if I knew about it. Or has it not started yet?

[17-Nov-18 06:26 AM] dustblaze#1349
Was only mentioning it because I think it‚Äôs a free listing with community vote

[17-Nov-18 06:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I do have a couple other exchanges community members have talked to.  

I‚Äôll be working on it tonight. 

I appreciate that @dustblaze

Rum would often be the downfall of many pirate crews. Unlike military and merchant ships where some kind of authority measured out the rum being consumed, a democratically run pirate ship, with its weakened code of discipline, sometimes led to a complete disregard for sobriety.

is there a better way to find estimated daily earnings? the block explorer shows this huge number of 200 mil for network difficulty. but that would be an earning of .68 coins a day, not the 250 or so im estimating by the time run so far. closer to 500,000 dif
