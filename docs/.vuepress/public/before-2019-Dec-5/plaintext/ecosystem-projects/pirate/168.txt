Criticism is fine.   As long as it's constructive and productive.

[14-Oct-18 03:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe he like to help care of 1 thread on reddit or elsewhere

[14-Oct-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Don't make fun of my balding head.... I can't do anything about that 😃

[14-Oct-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have a preferred site, then take your pick!

[14-Oct-18 03:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[14-Oct-18 03:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes.    Still in process... so I just shave it now to tease Mother Nature.

maybe possible to ann there's a new pirate ship we need crew - few pirates having <1h daily to take care of assigned forum threads. But first plan how it could ba a coordinated action ... Im just thinking

[14-Oct-18 03:12 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
strategy first, then actions, not to waste much time

[14-Oct-18 03:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just need people comfortable in each format to step up and offer their time.  
I will work something up in the next few days.

[14-Oct-18 03:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you have one you want to frequent @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 and stake claim to?   We can have 2 ambassadors per forum I think.

[14-Oct-18 03:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I just drop open idea, I can contribut too, we may select threads and forums that are important

[14-Oct-18 03:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I have account on reddit, bitcointalk

[14-Oct-18 03:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
threads to be selected

[14-Oct-18 03:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe miners could also join that "shilling" as they have interest :pirate:

[14-Oct-18 03:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone can join this is for sure.  If we have ambassadors.... they can start posts, or link posts that will get eyes.   We can have the ambassadors link the threads in Pirate-Marketinmg

[14-Oct-18 03:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
good to have people with sense of humor not to be to serious

[14-Oct-18 03:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and have fun

[14-Oct-18 03:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then we can all go in and discuss on those threads as we see fit.

@webworker01 i guess the source was never made public

[14-Oct-18 03:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes, Fun and dioplomacy are actually the biggest and best parts about this.  You don't havee to be mean to get your point across, and the less people we put off, the more interest we will have in the coin.

[14-Oct-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
😮 @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 - Just your understanding and ability to relay why something is the way it is, is a great tool to have in our arsenal.

[14-Oct-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not being "mean" requires considerable pause and forethought on my behalf 😝

[14-Oct-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyway; you have a pass to be mean and condescending.

[14-Oct-18 03:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Because you can back it up 😃

`Because you can back it up`
*usually

[14-Oct-18 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
so the ARRR TreasureChest wallet has a way to look up price on CMC, but ARRR don't have that

[14-Oct-18 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
is there any API I can hit to grab some kind of ARRR price?

[14-Oct-18 03:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
https://dexstats.info/api/pirateprice.php

[14-Oct-18 03:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For now

[14-Oct-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
awesome, that's perfect

[14-Oct-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the onboarding price, not otc market. That is fine for now, having some data looks better than none 😃

[14-Oct-18 03:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Aye.,    It's what Crypto-Coinz uses for their calculator.

Anyone who is active in media outlets for crypto, like Twitter, Reddit, BTT or 4chan,  please DM me if you think you can help with linking threads back here to discord and commenting on behalf of pirate.  
We're looking for 7 people with various forums they prefer.   Not trying to push people to formats they aren't comfortable with.

_so wishes he kept mining back then_

[14-Oct-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
i gotta go back to working on pipes, but a TreasureChest alpha release is not too far off. I found some bugz

[14-Oct-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly just little tweaks to change, like open up the ARRR explorer instead of Hush explorer when you click a txid, stuff like that

[14-Oct-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts if you can get a nice graphics/CSS person to work with me, we can make TreasureChest very pretty

[14-Oct-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
i make it work, somebody else makes it pretty

[14-Oct-18 04:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Easy @dukeleto

[14-Oct-18 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
very basic ARRR GUI wallet stuff works, as I expected, with only a few changes

[14-Oct-18 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
most of the rest is graphics, text, and Pirate specific stuff

[14-Oct-18 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
like a good error message for "you can't send to a taddr" instead of what it has now, which is probably a scary RPC error message rendered in a pop up, stuff like that

[14-Oct-18 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
educate people, why ARRR is more secure, because it only allows zaddrs for most xtns

[14-Oct-18 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can link to any ARRR websites, so if you give me "official" links, I can add those

[14-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’ll get with you on sizes and parameters.

[14-Oct-18 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We have a good list of pirate error messages started.

[14-Oct-18 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
the sizes/etc can be changed, it's all just html/css

[14-Oct-18 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
it requires a good design person to make it look pretty, i can make it look bearable

[14-Oct-18 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we keep same exact size/ratios as current GUI, it's easier

[14-Oct-18 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
because less CSS needs to be changed

[14-Oct-18 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
CSS, me no likey it

[14-Oct-18 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
I need a different scurvy dog to deal with CSS

[14-Oct-18 04:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m sure my design guy can do it.  If not we will figure it out with the community.

[14-Oct-18 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
my deep knowledge of CSS is about the same as how many oranges you will find on a pirate ship in the middle of the sea

[14-Oct-18 04:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is there a webpage for him to view the existing format to start getting ideas?  I sent him those screenshots.

[14-Oct-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts this uses the same tech stack as Agama (basically) so any agama-clued dev can help work on TreasureChest

[14-Oct-18 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts it basically needs to be run locally on your computer via source, to see what it looks like: https://github.com/leto/TreasureChest

@FishyGuts i would really love to try to help get *you* to run it from source, if you are up for it. I am sure lots of people in here can help too

[14-Oct-18 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you can run it, then you can project manage the scurvy out of it, and show people screenshots

[14-Oct-18 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
suggest improvements/etc

[14-Oct-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
it needs to run on the same computer as the Pirate komodod, it can be win/mac/linux

[14-Oct-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is a full node GUI wallet, not a light wallet, just to clarify
