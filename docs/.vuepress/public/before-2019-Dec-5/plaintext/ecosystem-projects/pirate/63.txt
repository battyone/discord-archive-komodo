@Decker @kolo you know who manages KMD .onion peer nodes ?

[27-Sep-18 12:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think cipi is the TOR guy
if I have instructions on how to build I can setup some nodes

[27-Sep-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi you have some help instructions on that mate?

[27-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Cabey#3299
Is the 15 KMD for PIRATE offer still available? If so what's involved?

[27-Sep-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me try this setup in my local vm... let me you guys know my results and notes.

i guess we need a `Treasure` emoji

[27-Sep-18 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me find one 😄

[27-Sep-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@grewalsatinder did you get the address thing sorted that you tagged me about?

[27-Sep-18 12:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 no, I think it won't be possible as I thought of it.

[27-Sep-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in current code, a viewing key of an address can show you only the tx send to that node... If I'm not incorrect.
in sapling, this viewing key can act similar to watch address only, which isn't possible in current version.

[27-Sep-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think @dukeleto and @jl777c knows better on such limitation

[27-Sep-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the other option is to have the address imported, but that means sharing the access to donation funds on a public server....

[27-Sep-18 12:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to my opinion, not so good secure way to do it

[27-Sep-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I hadn't looked into the showing/sharing part yet, so I wasn't sure how it could be done

[27-Sep-18 12:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙂 no problem. it's good to know, learn and experiment now we have z tx only chain 😉

[27-Sep-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, I'm still getting into it with nh on how they keep tripling my order 😛

[27-Sep-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
NH... I stopped mining since pirate mining skyrocketed already 😄

[27-Sep-18 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I use nh for a few things (mostly to test more hash than I have)

@grewalsatinder @CHMEX yes, i configured the wallets on the electrum servers to listen to .onion, so almost every coin on the electrums also offers .onion
i used this config for KMD
```server=1
txindex=1
disablewallet=1
rpcuser=eleckmd
rpcpassword=whatever
onion=127.0.0.1:9050
listen=1
listenonion=1
bind=127.0.0.1```
i used the `onion`-option instead of `proxy`, so that the nodes can connect to other onions, but also directly to normal nodes, out of performance reasons (tor is simply much slower then normal internet)
listenonion=1 can only be used when listen is also 1 (if you set listen to 0, listenonion=1 has no effect), but because i don't wanted to let this nodes listen to normal connections (only to onions) i set both to 1 and also used bind=127.0.0.1
tor must be installed (`sudo apt-get install tor`) and the torrc file must contain the parameter `ControlPort 9051` and the user that runs the wallet must be in the group `debian-tor` (`usermod -G debian-tor -a username`)

when everything is running `komodo-cli getnetworkinfo` will show you under `localaddresses` the onion-address that was created at first start... it should be the last parameter in the output

@cipi perfect! thanks for share that info mate :realpirate:

[27-Sep-18 12:59 PM] wookie#7663
Pirate ticker suggestions so far: PRT (currently in use by some real estate token), ARR ( in use by 2 other tokens), ARRR (not in use). Other suggestions: RUM, LOOT (both are also in use), PIR (not in use)

[27-Sep-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then ARRR is left

[27-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810

[27-Sep-18 01:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I don't think PIR is in use, the closest to it is PIRL.

[27-Sep-18 01:06 PM] wookie#7663
PIR could be another idea

[27-Sep-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[27-Sep-18 01:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
We are now over 1% of Zcash hashrate.

and none of the mining calculator sites even know about PIRATE yet

[27-Sep-18 01:39 PM] Hot#2427
only true believers are mining right now 😉

[27-Sep-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In the order of full disclosure, there's a good chuck of hashrate that is due to NH's order limit failing to properly work

[27-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Hot#2427
oh hehe

[27-Sep-18 01:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i know you don't enjoy my company lately (lol), but do you have a way to track, prove, and be reimbursed?

[27-Sep-18 01:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
or do they do it on their own?

[27-Sep-18 01:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
curious

[27-Sep-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From a user perspective, all we get is some shitty graph that they literally say, in bold letters, `Chart data cannot be used as a base to request any sort of refunds. `; so, the only option is file a ticket while order is still ongoing and hope that they police themselves properly. My experience with them, so far, is that they will eventually make it right. ymmv

arrr

[27-Sep-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn They do keep the specifics "on file". Specifically the "while ongoing" part refers to you being able to provide data for the ticket

[27-Sep-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've filed tickets days later, in the past

[27-Sep-18 01:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
i like this business model, make the customer do the work!
reminds me of how i tried to get someone else to do the OTC bidding for me here yesterday 😂

[27-Sep-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bidding? why are you doing any bidding on a "pointless joke"?

[27-Sep-18 01:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
sorry, you lost me

[27-Sep-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
oh, joke as in PIRATE

[27-Sep-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
thought the joke i just made

[27-Sep-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
trust me, i feel same about everything, just hoping for best

[27-Sep-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
especially with tortuga

[27-Sep-18 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just hoping for best`
Isn't that what most of us are doing with most of the space?

[27-Sep-18 01:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
hoping for best because of tortuga being announced
without it i would be totally neutral
but now i want it to kick ass and not blow up in anyone's face

[27-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Flexatron#8809
