In what context?
You saw if before but not now?
Someone sent but you didn't get?
You mined in a pool and don't see in wallet?

[19-Oct-18 07:26 AM] naiox#1515
how can i make a pirate wallet?

[19-Oct-18 07:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Seems to be a lot new folks showing up.

[19-Oct-18 07:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
We viral now

[19-Oct-18 07:29 AM] naiox#1515
yes, seems an interesting project

[19-Oct-18 07:29 AM] naiox#1515
i would like to mine some

[19-Oct-18 07:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
In the pirate marketing channel...

[19-Oct-18 07:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There is a pin for all the kind a new pirate would need.

[19-Oct-18 07:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It is also in new pirates.

[19-Oct-18 07:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@naiox you will need the Agama wallet 0.42c in that pinned post

[19-Oct-18 07:31 AM] naiox#1515
ok thanks

[19-Oct-18 07:32 AM] naiox#1515
i was using 0.41, that's why üòõ

[19-Oct-18 07:32 AM] naiox#1515
sorry

[19-Oct-18 07:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Our YouTube channel has a how to video if you have trouble adding pirate.

[19-Oct-18 07:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Be sure to use the native pirate mode and generate a new private address before mining.  You can only use a zc address if mining from a pool.

[19-Oct-18 07:36 AM] naiox#1515
thanks üòÉ

[19-Oct-18 07:41 AM] WeyezOD#1176
@actionslacks You can blame Voskcoin. that's how I found out about this

[19-Oct-18 07:42 AM] WeyezOD#1176
BTW, I think Vosk needs some 'luv'. I feel bad for him bc his GPU's are turning into paper weights.

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
Hehe

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
"sellout"

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] WeyezOD#1176
Sellout??

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] naiox#1515
i've also seen the video on voskcoin

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] WeyezOD#1176
No ... not a sellout. Simple economics

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
YouTube comments..

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] naiox#1515
but i've been noticed about this project one month ago

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] naiox#1515
just didn't get into it

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Flexatron#8809
Shortsighted comments

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] WeyezOD#1176
Maybe more naivety?

[19-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Oszy#5734
butthurt ppl who got scammed many times before probably, like the zcl fanboys üòÑ

[19-Oct-18 07:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@naiox Me too.. I wish I had started mining it then with a 10MS hashrate üòõ

[19-Oct-18 07:53 AM] BlockTech#6895
Network hashrate is back down, wondering if a should rent rigs again to mine it with that much of a low hashrate :)

[19-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Oszy#5734

[19-Oct-18 07:53 AM] Oszy#5734
still not too late

[19-Oct-18 07:55 AM] naiox#1515
@FishyGuts yes, but it still comes down good for now

@0x03 "another bounty for pool #3; and the bounty is the DNS record
makes u look like the 'official' pool" i created  3."official" pool.  What is the reward?

[19-Oct-18 08:39 AM] WeyezOD#1176
@webworker01 Do you want me to move my A9 over to one of the two pools you listed above?

[19-Oct-18 08:41 AM] ronyi#5719
In piratechain.org possible to use stratum+tcp://pool.piratechain.org:3033 or use SSL, some hours and I'll fix the description.

[19-Oct-18 08:46 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I'm new to the pool. Been mining for about 1.5 hours. Shares go up and then back to 0 then back up. No payouts yet. Is that normal? Not sure how the pool works.

[19-Oct-18 08:47 AM] WeyezOD#1176
OK. I wasn't too worried but thought I'd ask

[19-Oct-18 08:47 AM] WeyezOD#1176
OK. that's what I was thinkig

[19-Oct-18 08:49 AM] WeyezOD#1176
OK. I'll keep an eye on it

[19-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
Hi, can anybody help me with a question on the wallet setup Agama?

[19-Oct-18 08:58 AM] Oszy#5734

[19-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Flexatron#8809
komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getnetworkhashps 0

[19-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Flexatron#8809
is that the correct command for current hash?

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Flexatron#8809
0 is last block right

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Oszy#5734
getnetworkhashps ( blocks height )

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Flexatron#8809
hmm

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] WeyezOD#1176
@webworker01 So, my current immature value is 23.24482279. that means that I'm owed that many ARRR and will receive them when the blocks are completed? do i have that right?

[19-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Flexatron#8809
wil probably see in in 1 hr in your wallet

[19-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Flexatron#8809

not sure but i say you design your own and wear it with pride

[19-Oct-18 11:56 AM] AndrewK#3947
Since pirate pool  only pays out 50 blocks at a time, will payouts be extra delayed if there's a backlog of blocks from hours ago that need to be paid out?

[19-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
thanks @tahoeminer

[19-Oct-18 01:13 PM] penguin#0544
What's the ETA on the Paper Wallet?

[19-Oct-18 01:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Just print the private key?

[19-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
never understood the fuzz about paper wallets lol

[19-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
qr code is nice I guess

[19-Oct-18 01:27 PM] Flexatron#8809
for mobile

[19-Oct-18 01:30 PM] penguin#0544
its nice not to have to download and sync anything until a lite wallet is available and such things.

[19-Oct-18 01:30 PM] penguin#0544
Haven't run the wallet yet, do I need to sync to the chain at the moment ?

[19-Oct-18 01:31 PM] scubapanda#2485
Paper wallets are great, as gifts for example, but all they really hold is the private key.

[19-Oct-18 01:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@penguin yeah you need to download the chain, Currenlty Z txs need native chain- Luckily the chain is rather small atm

[19-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Oszy#5734
doesn't take that long to sync tbh

[19-Oct-18 02:03 PM] 0x03#8822
if you are too impatient to wait for the initial sync anyways, use https://bootstrap.0x03.services/pirate/ARRR.html
