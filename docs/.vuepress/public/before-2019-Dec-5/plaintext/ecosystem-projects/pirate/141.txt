anyone knows what block payment is and when halving time will accour ?

Whats the likelihood of finding a block with my little dell laptop with an i7?

[08-Oct-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
about 90000000:1

[08-Oct-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you might find 1 block every 3 years

QUESTION: 
Pirate pool.io shows 48.30 Msol/s
Pirate Pool xyz shows 61.09 MSol/s 
But Network Hash shows only 80 Msol/s .... ?

[08-Oct-18 02:28 PM] house#8741
been weird like this for few hours

@hoouse the Poolinformation about network hashes was not allways correct on different pools i used allreday

[08-Oct-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@house net hash is always nothing more than an estimate based on block diffs and block times

[08-Oct-18 02:31 PM] house#8741
ahh ok, thanks

[08-Oct-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
along the lines of: if diff is w and the last x blocks took y time, then it would have taken z hash to do so

[08-Oct-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, math :trollface:

I see, the lag is major discrepency and not reliable (ballpark)

[08-Oct-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's reliable-ish

[08-Oct-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to make it even more complicated, pool rates are based on sharediffs which use last share and not long averages, so if multiple shares are returned quickly can over-exaggerate realtime hash too

[08-Oct-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
real hashrate is always an unknown and can only ever be guessed at

[08-Oct-18 02:37 PM] house#8741
mmmkay ...

_stops over-complicating the answer and goes to get ☕_

[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if realtime monitors were installed in all the active miners' systems and reported to a central location, then you could get an accurate overall nethash

[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but I think there would be some objections to this

[08-Oct-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the pool can get a pretty good estimate of the realtime hashrate based on the sum of each workers results

[08-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the sum of all pools realtime hashrate is therefore knowable and it is consistently above the 120 block average hashrate that is the Msols, when the estimated solo mining is added. I have a feeling it isnt a 1:1 and that it takes more hashrate to get the 120 block average to register it

[08-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
this is likely approx a 10% increased cost over what the instantaneous estimate would create

[08-Oct-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why

[08-Oct-18 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr it likely costs 10% more to mine PIRATE than any Msols based estimate would calculate

[08-Oct-18 02:49 PM] crumb#2550
are there any problems with NH today or has the mining interest stabilized? and is at  current levels a more-or-less accurate picture of current interest in PIRATE amongst miners

[08-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what time is it in china?

[08-Oct-18 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
atm there's 1 less big miner using nh and that impacts the balance there

[08-Oct-18 02:50 PM] crumb#2550
22:50 in Beijing

[08-Oct-18 02:52 PM] crumb#2550
ok, so it's just that some of the FOMO miners have left

[08-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, not a fomo miner

[08-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since sales are down and I'm going to be mining out-of-pocket for a bit, I'm moving some stuff around to have the liquidity to do so

[08-Oct-18 02:54 PM] crumb#2550
the diff stats on the onboarding page have been in a lower range of last couple of days

[08-Oct-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$17-20k per day adds up quick

[08-Oct-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe its over. sell to me at 0.1 KMD! I buy in bulk

Studying other coin protocols and breaking them down as to why pirate is better.
