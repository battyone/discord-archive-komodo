grandma + grandpa + indian relatives giving us money = staying afloat

[11-Oct-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Far be it for me to tell people how to run their lives, but if you're "staying afloat" with financial aid from family, then maybe don't spend $100k+ on mining rentals....

I'm just reinvesting my money

[11-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Llama#1330

17 + no job + <35k family income + relatives giving money to stay afloat, but has resources for 12Msols for 2 weeks? something doesn't compute....but not my business...

[11-Oct-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wookie I'm assuming that by `just reinvesting my money` he's rolling it all back over. Since he tends to undercut prices, chances are he's getting the sales to do that if he puts 100% back in.

[11-Oct-18 01:12 PM] wookie#7663
thanks genie, I'm going to go back to my morning ☕ now

I was planning on not selling this lot though

[11-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Zach#9973
And he has been mining off and on for 2 weeks, not at 12 Msols the whole time

[11-Oct-18 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏼 that's what I said to begin with `If you've been mining at 12M for 2 weeks, I want your job`

[11-Oct-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 1st 5 days of that 2 weeks, 12M would have been self-defeating

[11-Oct-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*4 days

[11-Oct-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

send payments more often 😛

[11-Oct-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you've got that many unique miners, then definitely add a factional send loop

[11-Oct-18 01:51 PM] 0x03#8822
everybody on my old pool (that is https://pirate.komodopool.xyz/) please reconnect your miner to the new pool (which is https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz - just change hostname for miner to `stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz
`, ports are the same)

[11-Oct-18 01:51 PM] 0x03#8822
one miner switched already

@0x03 i have rental will it still be alright in the next couple hours?

[11-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
permanent fix - `if ($total > 49); then do $loop`

So $DAPS clearly won the last poll over $TRX $XRP and $XVG in regards to who has the strongest community!! Lets match them up with some other strong communal projects like $ICX $NEO and $KMD - this should be interesting!!!

Im going to advise 99% of you to stop mining ARRR, I need about 6 days being the only miner on it to guarantee the success of this project  😂

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 That comment wasn't even about revenue in multiples of x
If CoinX is valued at ten cents and CoinY is at $1 (10:1), when CoinY drops to 85 cents it defies logic to trade at 14:1 or 18:1 (you want 9:1 or 8:1) 😕

please, everybody currently mining on https://pirate.komodopool.xyz/ - switch to the new pool infrastructure at https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/ - just change your miner stratum host to `stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz` (ports are the same, `8888` for low diff and `18888` for hi-diff/nh) - thank you.

closer to 0.27 or 0.28 if you account for today's KMD hit
