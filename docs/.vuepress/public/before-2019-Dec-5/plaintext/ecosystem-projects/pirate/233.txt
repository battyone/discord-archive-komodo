guys let's gather some money to hire a web designer (my friend)
😄

Don't hire friends :trollface:

[27-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Bikob2#4549
ok

[27-Oct-18 07:26 PM] penguin#0544
14 dorra maybe for pirate varentine

[27-Oct-18 07:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Bikob2 - We had a general website which was nice for 5-6 weeks.

[27-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Bikob2#4549
yea

[27-Oct-18 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We only discussed the  rework since Oct 1 - and art/ media kit/ textures/ fonts/ backgrounds are all being laid out.

[27-Oct-18 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So we're getting all the art, click through icons backgrounds and all that completed now.

[27-Oct-18 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would say in the next week or so, the website should be great.

[27-Oct-18 07:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's functional now and fairly standard in it's layout.

[27-Oct-18 07:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We  also didn't ICO like all those guys above.  
If we had a multi million dollar warchest, then we would have had a website done 5 weeks ago 😛

[27-Oct-18 07:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad to hear any ideas and discussions on it.  

@SHossain is the old site and graphics layout still on Github?

[27-Oct-18 07:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The important thing about the site is that it is secure.

[27-Oct-18 07:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And we have further development coming for it down the road to engage pirates more.

[27-Oct-18 07:31 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, the old one is in github

@FishyGuts  dont believe anyone saying website cost is millions :trollface:  😛

[27-Oct-18 07:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you build big website, a platform or marketplace or youtube - it could be 10k$-100k$ depending on specific requirements

[27-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Bikob2#4549
we don't need front end and backend developer. Community  have ones.

[27-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Bikob2#4549
we only need world class designer.

black stile, spacing, fonts... all cool and professional.

[27-Oct-18 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes such "website building" (there is no building needed) cost would be estimated around 1-2k$

[27-Oct-18 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
framework is probably free, "just" selecting font, colors, background and spacing

@FishyGuts  maybe make another contest for pirate website design? :pirate:

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
CMS based (Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla)

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 
I just meant in terms of resources availability and so forth.

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If we ICO'd wed have outsourced and ye s paid, 10-20K.

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] Bikob2#4549
we don't need to pay 20k

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no need for 10k$ !! c'mon

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We arent

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
10k for landing page ?

[27-Oct-18 07:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its a point of reference people.

[27-Oct-18 07:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ive seen now dead projects pay 8 K for websites.

[27-Oct-18 07:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I know agency would do one for eve 500$

[27-Oct-18 07:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@SHossain I shouldn't have said to go live with it until it was done 😛

[27-Oct-18 07:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We're working on it already.

[27-Oct-18 07:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
When its done, if it still sucks, then we will find a way to improve 😃

[27-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Bikob2#4549
ok, let's wait

[27-Oct-18 07:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Do I want it ready now?  Of course 😃

[27-Oct-18 07:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Without a doubt.

[27-Oct-18 07:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's been whirlwind month around here and the people helping on the site have been very gracious to donate 100% of their time building it to be fundtional.

[27-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They are watching and if you hvae any specific ideas, changes or tweaks, let us know and we will review the suggestions 👍

[27-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Bikob2#4549
if it sucks, as I promise I'll send my $200 to the cool freelance designer to hire.

[27-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
HAha...Love it!

[27-Oct-18 07:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If it sucks, we will handle it, trust 😃  As a community, as a team, don't worry.    We want to be repp'd well.

[27-Oct-18 07:47 PM] Bikob2#4549

[27-Oct-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
If it's going to take more then 5 days I would go for collecting 10k Arrr and make twitter contest for Pirates website design... IT's really not more needed to bulid website. Skilled guy makes such 1 day. And by the way we will have another twitter promotion 😛

[27-Oct-18 07:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm dropping 1k Arrr to such contest

[27-Oct-18 07:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
In 5 days we would (hopefully get) a nice website and twitter promotion same time.

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Bikob2#4549
10k Arrr - yea, good!  but contests don't have access to the best people. The best designers get paid a lot and don't have need to participate in contests. we'll have ok designers after contest but not great ones.

[27-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Bikob2#4549
if the goal to build an OK site then cool.

[27-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Bikob2#4549
if we want a GREAT site, then we need to find other ways to approach cool people.

[27-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Bikob2#4549
I mean professionally cool, of course

[27-Oct-18 07:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
You dont need the best designer, just pro one - and there is plenty of them. If the contests website would be weak - you may set a reule there can be no winner if we do not use any.

[27-Oct-18 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
@FishyGuts we understand you. we can wait. you have been doing amazing job

[27-Oct-18 07:58 PM] penguin#0544
As a designer. Keep it simple & concise - don't over-use empty space

[27-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Bikob2#4549
did you disigned the current? @penguin

[27-Oct-18 07:59 PM] penguin#0544
Limit large white space to promotional content

[27-Oct-18 07:59 PM] penguin#0544
nope

[27-Oct-18 08:00 PM] penguin#0544
white space = emphasis = less is more

[27-Oct-18 08:32 PM] yorktronic#2703
does KMD (and thus PIRATE) have the same or similar RPC interface that ZEC does?

[27-Oct-18 08:32 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'd like to be able to get nethash and diff directly from the chain -- I currently maintain a database of chaindata for a ton of coins

[27-Oct-18 08:33 PM] yorktronic#2703
so I can do some analysis

[27-Oct-18 08:33 PM] yorktronic#2703
in particular I'm interested in modeling the pirate nethash against other equihash coins to see where some of the hashrate is coming from

[27-Oct-18 08:34 PM] yorktronic#2703
I think I can accomplish this by running a kmd node on linux and activating the PIRATE chain in the command line

[27-Oct-18 08:34 PM] yorktronic#2703
or use the command line thing in Agama, but i need to be able to dump to text file to get in to my postgres db

[27-Oct-18 08:34 PM] yorktronic#2703
anyway, any advice would be appreciated

[27-Oct-18 08:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Passcombo - a permanent and legacy art design and style is needed.   
If we wanted to slap any website together there are 10 people here who can do it.  
As @Bikob2  stayed, any well heeled designer isn’t going to work for free or enter a design contest.

[27-Oct-18 08:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
In a week or less I think @Hoffenbrau will have the main art done and we can begin to deploy it in the site and for our announcements, social media pages, so forth and so on.

[27-Oct-18 08:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I love that you all want to be so helpful and proactive!

Let’s give it one more week and see what we end up with. 

@scubapanda or @jl777c can you help @yorktronic

[27-Oct-18 08:38 PM] Oszy#5734
@yorktronic  you can call getnetworkhasps in CLI for any asset chain

[27-Oct-18 08:38 PM] yorktronic#2703
okay that's what I needed to know

[27-Oct-18 08:38 PM] yorktronic#2703
thanks @Oszy

[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
just use the relevant ac-name in komodod, i guess you know this already 😄

[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
yw

[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] yorktronic#2703
yeah I'm familiar with the bitcoin (and thus ZEC) RPC and was just wondering if it was the same, and it sounds like it is

[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
you can echo the result from cmd using > filename

[27-Oct-18 08:40 PM] yorktronic#2703
yep got it -- I dump all this stuff to postgres so I can query it and compare

[27-Oct-18 08:40 PM] Oszy#5734
good stuff

[27-Oct-18 08:40 PM] yorktronic#2703
