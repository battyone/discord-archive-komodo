Trading halted I think.   
They’re on blast now so they’ll have to fix it fast.

[02-Nov-18 08:28 PM] Flexatron#8809
Shit

[02-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Flexatron#8809
I am waiting a few more days I think

[02-Nov-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
trade just went through, why do you say it is halted?

[02-Nov-18 08:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

That was the message he sent.  Looks like trading hasn’t been halted.  I’ll double check.

[02-Nov-18 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Nov-18 08:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then looks like they are.  He stated this 30 mins ago.   Following up.

[02-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Chewy#0565
Just information:  For me, I just checked now and it is still showing as deposit disabled for this coin.  Not in any hurry, as I said, information only.

@iAmLedger my guess is too many deposits bogged their CPU(s)

[02-Nov-18 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or a few too many withdraws, maybe (since withdraws would be more intensive)

[02-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Bradbury#7249
I tried a deposit a couple of hours ago. It's still pending.........
