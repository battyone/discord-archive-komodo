`Blackjoker - "[...] all my cons have beein in T since the start unless I sold them.
but amrketing really wanted to say 99% of all coins are sheilded"`

Stoopid question #2 ... Is there something that needs to be done in order to ensure coins are shielded if they have been mined ?

[06-Oct-18 06:43 AM] house#8741
direct to my wallet

[06-Oct-18 06:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Are you solo mining?

[06-Oct-18 06:43 AM] jspook16#3059
i thought you had to mine to shielded address?

[06-Oct-18 06:43 AM] house#8741
on the pool

[06-Oct-18 06:44 AM] house#8741
ah ... I see, if solo mining is different

[06-Oct-18 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
your pool op does that already

Yes in my case I solo mined all the pirate supply for 2 entire days to a T address and just left them there 😄

[06-Oct-18 06:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jspook16 when you mine a block, the 1st transaction in that block is called the "coinbase". The coinbase transaction is to a t address and must then be manually "shielded" into a z before it can be spent

[06-Oct-18 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you solo mine, you do this
if you mine a public pool, the pool owner does it

Onboarding was .24 yesterday, it’s following hash movement I think. Not sure who is bankrolling the onboarding but it only seems fair.

[06-Oct-18 06:58 AM] house#8741
*Wonders why we even have this competitive OTC channel if the market is provided by onboarding at 0.25kmd and  gangster pirates have issue with selling at less than Onboarding price*

[06-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Dr Debt#0891
its a sound strategy.

[06-Oct-18 07:02 AM] jspook16#3059
even a 2x is reasonable

[06-Oct-18 07:02 AM] house#8741

[06-Oct-18 09:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@mato121  That comparison is certainly on the radar.  We're going to compare privacy and security.  I've been reaching out to people and learning about our protocol heavily in order to make the argument.  I spent a while reading XMR academic research papers but that was tough.  I am not geared to absorb that stuff easy.   
Any input from community members would be appreciated as I don't know XMR intimately, yet.  

Mining tutorial would be easy.
