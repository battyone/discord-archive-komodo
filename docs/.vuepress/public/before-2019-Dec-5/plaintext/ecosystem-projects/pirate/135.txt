realistically, mining I think is only illegal in bolivia?

[07-Oct-18 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so if funds are mined into a publicly known zaddr, then send to a private zaddr in a different wallet. dont do criminal things that gets your wallet.dat confiscated in police raids. that is the best defense

@jl777c  got confused about about your statement '  yes, it is 100% privacy if nobody knows your zaddr '. Coz people will know your zaddr as you trade like through OTC WHICH you have to provide your zaddr to receive, so does this mean it's not 100% privacy ?

[07-Oct-18 10:06 AM] Flexatron#8809
Just make a new adress then lmao

[07-Oct-18 10:06 AM] Oszy#5734

[07-Oct-18 10:07 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@rrrj288  there is huge difference when somebody you make transaction with knows your info, and when it is public on the network, agree ?

[07-Oct-18 10:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
of course when you do transaction with someone - to that person the transaction cannot be anonymous, how you imagine different ? 😃

[07-Oct-18 10:08 AM] Flexatron#8809
Uptrend is real

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋  noob Q what does ' public on the network ' mean here ?  Using  tortuga instead of trade direct with someone ?

[07-Oct-18 10:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you understand that blockchain like BTC is public  ?

[07-Oct-18 10:13 AM] rrrj288#7865

Is anyone having problems sending funds from CLI. I keep getting `"status": "executing",` and it's been like that for an hour.

[07-Oct-18 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when was the last time you ran `z_mergetoaddress`?

[07-Oct-18 11:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not in awhile. Can I do that with an executing tx?

[07-Oct-18 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not likely, but you could kill the app then merge then resend

[07-Oct-18 11:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
yeah okay thanks ill try that

Many people must have misunderstanding that the Z (private) address show on blockchain/explorers just like T (transparent) addresses.

What I'm wondering from your tweet:
If somebody manages to saturate the network with z trx will that affect each network node ( because it scans) or is it so optimized that it has no effect like a t transaction?

[07-Oct-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek me; my vm is **still** trying to process `coinsupply`

[07-Oct-18 11:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
takes about 15 to 20 mins

[07-Oct-18 11:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CHMEX @jl777c can answer better I think 🙂

[07-Oct-18 11:18 AM] mato121#5963
nice post @grewalsatinder

[07-Oct-18 11:18 AM] mato121#5963
$PIRATE is ~99.82% just shielded transactions. In @PirateChain it is just not possible to send Z (shielded) address transactions to T (transparent) address. Once it's shielded, it's gonna be in shielded transactions

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] mato121#5963
so you cant send coins from z to t if i understand correctly

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yes

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] mato121#5963
but ofc the only transaction

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] mato121#5963
that is on exlorer

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] mato121#5963
is from t to z

[07-Oct-18 11:19 AM] mato121#5963
but the z adress is not visible

[07-Oct-18 11:20 AM] mato121#5963
?

[07-Oct-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct

[07-Oct-18 11:21 AM] mato121#5963
i think that for noobs like me, this should be stated more plastically

[07-Oct-18 11:21 AM] mato121#5963
people belive only what they see

[07-Oct-18 11:21 AM] mato121#5963
sadlly

[07-Oct-18 11:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
also the amount is not visible
You only know that something happened but not what

[07-Oct-18 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually the explorer will show z to z; that some tx did occur, but not info

[07-Oct-18 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[07-Oct-18 11:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
that could be a 10000 PIRATE transaction or a 0 PIRATE transaction no way to tell for non wallet owners

[07-Oct-18 11:24 AM] mato121#5963
Got it!

[07-Oct-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ komodo-cli coinsupply
error: couldn't connect to server: timeout reached (code 0)`
Seems 2 core vm is too weak for that 😛

[07-Oct-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And in mining news:
`[PoolWorker][Thread 0][10/07 06:29:25] Current diff: 1206452.315011298`
9.575x higher than KMD diff

yeh got the same on my system too after long wait 😄

[07-Oct-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
trying with my alien server. seems the daemon is using only 1 thread

[07-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven had need for such a thing, but with all the trades of PIRATE thus far being OTC I wondered....
Is there a tutorial somewhere to show folks *how* to intentionally show a 3rd party the details of a tx should a dispute arise?

[07-Oct-18 11:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
you can go in steps:
komodo-cli coinsupply 100000
komodo-cli coinsupply 200000
komodo-cli coinsupply 300000
...
komodo-cli coinsupply 1000000
komodo-cli coinsupply

[07-Oct-18 11:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
that works

(178288.41671214 / 110008351.13349421) * 100 = 0.16206807472%

[07-Oct-18 11:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so Komodo has only 0.16206807472% shielded transactions ? 🤔

[07-Oct-18 11:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
funds yes.
somebody shielded 50k in the last few weeks it was at 128k for a long time
