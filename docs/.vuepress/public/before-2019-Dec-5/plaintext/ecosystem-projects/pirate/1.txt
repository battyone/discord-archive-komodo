TL;DR @KomodoPlatform is playing with an actual independent blockchain which does zk-SNARKS Transactions Only. You CAN NOT do transparent transactions on this blockchain!
If want to join the others please come to #staked channel in Komodo Discrod.

no airdrop possible, a redeem process only. maybe it is used for tipping?

Oh well! things has escalated quickly and the community now has a dedicated #pirate channel in $KMD discord! üòÖ
As community requested there is now a @bitcointalk Annoucement thread:
[ANN][PIRATE] A zk-SNARSK transactions only blockchain
https://t.co/786K7Pw6m4

[30-Aug-18 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577 (pinned)
Chain start:
```./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &
```
@grewalsatinder notes list:
```
- Komodo Assetchain
- Independent blockchain
- Privacy/Shielded/z tx only chain. No Transparent transactions possible on PIRATE chain.
- Block time aprox 60 seconds.
- Block halving every 77777 blocks.
    - aprox every 54.01180556 days
- Block reward of 1 satoshi will reach in about 5.179214231 years.
- Total supply of around 40 million. Exactly to be 39,821,823.99884100 by year 2023
- CryptoConditions contracts not possible on this chain, as it's z tx only chain.
- Can't notarize without special exemptions.
- Equihash PoW algo blockchain.
- Alternatively can use Verushash PoW, but has to be used for a 100% PoW chain.

@satindergrewal by removing the ability to have transparent addresses as outputs (-ac_private),  many ways to potentially leak metadata about transactions have been removed. This has some super interesting implications with $KMD cryptoconditions and cross-chain operations ...

[30-Aug-18 08:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
PIRATE is really fascinating from a metadata leakage perspective, which I have

glaring error in your title: it's zk-SNARKS instead of zk-SNARSK

[30-Aug-18 08:56 AM] jorian#4555
in dutch, SNARS is when you don't understand something very well...

`-ac_private=1`   A couple of questions...
`getaddressesbyaccount` returns a t-address (not unexpected).  Is this only usable for mining?

[30-Aug-18 09:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it possible to mine to a z-address?

[30-Aug-18 09:14 AM] CrisF#3405
That what I was thinking.

[30-Aug-18 09:14 AM] CrisF#3405
But t-transactions are impossible... (?)

[30-Aug-18 09:16 AM] jorian#4555
yes, mine to t-address, but from there it has to go to a z-address

[30-Aug-18 09:16 AM] CrisF#3405
blackjok3rs's script will be especially useful.

[30-Aug-18 09:16 AM] jorian#4555
there is a `z_shieldcoinbase` call to collect them

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah my script is mor complicated than it needs to be for this chain, simply make a zaddress and call z_shelidconbase on blocknotify

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
y'all mine with pubkey?

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
man... I am too busy to mine this lol

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
what if i don't?

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
collect for each t-address?

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
or use a script :p

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine to pubkey and call z_sheildcoinbase on blocknotify.

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
keep it simple.

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
much... but if someone finds your T address, they know how many coins you have

[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
exactly

[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe change it ever 24H or something

[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a verus script in one of their repos, that iterates though all addressin the wallet

[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jorian#4555
well if it can be scripted, no need for pubkey

[30-Aug-18 09:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
`z_shieldcoinbase "*", zaddr`

[30-Aug-18 09:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
that will shield everything at once

[30-Aug-18 09:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, see my faq for verus on shielding immature blocks, I use it there

[30-Aug-18 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
oh that is nice! no need for scripts now

[30-Aug-18 09:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is really nice is z_shieldcoinbase returns JSON

[30-Aug-18 09:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
so you know how much you are shielding, and can use that amount if you want to send to a taddr, in the case of maturing a Verus block

doing a `z_shieldcoinbase` transaction while running the miner causes the miner to terminate

@jorian shielding probably requires a wallet lock

[30-Aug-18 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
it can't have new z funds coming in as it calculates what to do and then does various async operations

[30-Aug-18 09:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
Just got my first PIRATE block, it's almost 3am, I might have an addiction to mining

[30-Aug-18 09:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian i guess it's best to z_shieldcoinbase infrequently if you care about mining, and maybe we should add a note about mining pausing if shieldcoinbase is running

[30-Aug-18 09:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
z_shieldcoinbase is a very new RPC and zcash core wasn't thinking of the impacts it had on CPU mining, most likely

[30-Aug-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I get some time I will open my stratum pool to mine this in a few hours.

[30-Aug-18 09:47 AM] jorian#4555
