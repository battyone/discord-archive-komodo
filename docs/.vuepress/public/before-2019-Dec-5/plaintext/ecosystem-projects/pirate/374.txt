[dscrd-prt] <digital bullion> Did everyone read the full article above before making a unanimous decision to not go ahead with the proposed idea?

[20-Oct-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <digital bullion> The article seems to have a negative bias from the outset and devotes far greater time to coverage of this aspect than any other.

[20-Oct-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <digital bullion> "Morland said she and her colleagues were happy with the final product and have rolled out the segment frequently at conferences. They also saw a spike in traffic to the TRI website in June 2016, when the segment aired on Fox Business Network."

[20-Oct-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> "Morland said that the decision to go on the show came down to a simple cost-benefit analysis. It was less about being featured on a public television segment, and more about the value of having a highly produced company video."

[20-Oct-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <polycryptoblog> Funds should be spent on helping @mrlynch  get the lite node via mobile working

[20-Oct-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Diablo_> I guess it is also a question for us what we value more. The produced video (and if we can freely use it), or the airing on TV (which possibly has many risks involved, such as channel, airing time etc. and generally will likely barely hit ppl from our target audience)

[20-Oct-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Hobot> Would prefer to see funds directed to usability development like the lite wallet and push existing media 'Top 5 reasons' harder and alongside privacy news media/events

[20-Oct-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> _would much rather see micro-PCs that are capable of a full client than lite wallets ever_

[dscrd-prt] <cascrypto> I scruwed up I think big time, lost my pirate! or is their a way ???üò©
my laptop where I had my kmd wallet on with my pirate has been profesionaly cleaned and files where deleted! I made the mistake of thinking with my kmd private key I could recal my pirate! are my private private bag lost for good?

[20-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kaks> for recovering you pirate, you must have one of( Pirate private key - Wallet.dat)

[20-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grewalsatinder> @cascrypto really sad to hear it mate. For pirate, you need your private address's privkeys, the address starting with "zs"

[20-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grewalsatinder> the KMD's transparent address' (which starts with "R") `privkey` or the passphrase/seed can't recover Pirate funds unfortunately.

[20-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <CombatWombat> hey im in the gravix discord some one asked about pirate wallet they said its not even syncing and they contacted the devs but no one responded

[20-Oct-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Strob> @digital bullion I've read it entirely and realized that it was maybe not a total scam but at the same time they can't guarantee where it will be aired (each local channel choose their content) and how many people will see it and the audience is probably not the best for ARRR. PBS putting up a warning on their website against this kind of practice is the biggest red flag.

[20-Oct-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <grewalsatinder> @cascrypto See if it's somehow still possible to to do some recovery on the file system, and if files recovery could somehow recover your "wallet.dat" file from `komodo/PIRATE/wallet.dat`.

[20-Oct-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `PBS putting up a warning on their website against this kind of practice is the biggest red flag.`
PBS doesn't like paid content because if they use too much of it then they cannot use govt funds and month long fund drives

[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Diablo_ Thanks!

[20-Oct-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @Strob  @digital bullion that's why i edited the announcement at the end earlier to say:

"it turns out that it's a pretty shady marketing scheme that is not nearly worth the money (it doesn't produce the numbers that we would hope), so going a different direction would be better to actually target the audience that would care about our video"

The money would probably be better spent actually targeting our audience through different methods, such as major crypto news sites, etc.

[20-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> i'll get in contact with some major news sites today and see how much they charge to produce a video for us

@BinanceAmerica @PirateChain Technically (security-wise) ARRR is best cryptocurrency, as it got 2 hardest things done: 1. double spend protection inherited from BTC 2. full privacy inherited from ZEC but enforced like in XMR. No other cryptocurrency has these both.

[dscrd-prt] <napa> lol, i can't belive you guys even considered paying someone 23k to appear on pbs smfh. you shouldn't have to pay for shit, stop forcing things and let the project grow organically. funds should only be used to hire better devs. fucking 23k for pbs

[21-Oct-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <house> Good passionate response @napa ... consider *‚Äù... you guys‚Äù* = we guys ... and *‚Äù... you shouldn‚Äôt have to‚Äù* vs we shouldn‚Äôt have to ... of course, the presupposition here is based on idea that you are a part of the community as well. Good feed back though, thanks for your input ‚úäüèΩ

[21-Oct-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> I have to say, I very much dislike the idea of paying for such exposure - tried to word this as neutrally as possible.

[21-Oct-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> assuming all arguments against have already been formulated, I won't try to repeat them- it is just a futile notion that this would be productive at all

[21-Oct-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Domoo> Imo we need more exposure to get more liquidity on the market. Then we would interest bigger exchanges to list us for free. That said its all about the price vs the actual exposure such a campaign would bring and this need a research work. I do defend that any ideas need to be taken into account with a community brainstorming which is as well one of our best forces

[21-Oct-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> or.....
we need more use cases and less liquidity....

So apparently NordVPN was compromised at some point. Their (expired) private keys have been leaked, meaning anyone can just set up a server with those keys...

[21-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Marketing is a big deal. A prime example is Grin and Beam. There was so much hype around it before it even came out. That was pure paid marketing. There's a reason why it takes a long time for solid projects to get noticed, with no real marketing budget, it stays in the shadows. If we were able to raise money to increase our exposure to the markets that we have yet to tap and do a solid marketing campaign, you would easily see the effects of the money spent. 

I'm open to any and all ideas @napa. It's easy to s**t on others ideas, it's a lot harder to provide sound ideas that are worth moving forward on. That being said, if you have any marketing ideas or strategies, let me know

[21-Oct-19 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Also, this is why I made an announcement about it and asked for the communities input about information matrix. To collect the communities input and not move forward with an idea without full support/ input

[21-Oct-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> ‚òï morning everyone

[21-Oct-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <wookie25> @napa Appreciate the input. To add to @house and @Draeth replies, Pirate is a community project with no centralized funds or figurehead leader. Everyone that contributes, regardless of deckhand or firstmate are volunteers. Many of us have day jobs and volunteer our own free time to help Pirate move forward. We do what we can and I would argue that what we‚Äôre doing is the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù community-driven growth because we ARRR the community. I started out just like any community member, my name is in orange only because I started writing articles and offered to help with merchant outreach. We don‚Äôt have a golden compass, but at least we, the community are trying. 

You and I ARRR Pirates, We ARRR all Pirates.

[21-Oct-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `To collect the communities input...`

[21-Oct-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> Hmm, grin and beam both have more volume then market cap. Seems legit.

[21-Oct-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> Whatever you do, don't pull a CHIPS, we don't need no stinking marketing and hype is bullshit train. Organic growth sure didn't help Beta win against VHS.

[21-Oct-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> At some point you need to accept that 100% of all crypto is just hype. Crypto  and hype go hand in hand like peanut butter and jelly or peas and carrots.

[21-Oct-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Hype with 0 delivery on tech = disaster
Hype with a solid tech = good

[21-Oct-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We have solid tech

[21-Oct-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> But it's also about hitting target markets where we don't exist, that's the whole reason for a marketing strategy

[21-Oct-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> A little hype + exposure in places we aren't noticed go a long way

[21-Oct-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> What is ARRR target market? Corporations or Criminals?

[21-Oct-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> Aren't those one and the same? üòõ

[21-Oct-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> At this point, our target market should be Asia

[21-Oct-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> We have no presence there

[21-Oct-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Overall though, we need to just increase our exposure everywhere

[21-Oct-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> A great BTC hype moment came when some politician exclaimed, people are using it to buy illegal things, and we can't stop it.

[21-Oct-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> Politicians speak about what they see on the media; media speaks about what would bring them views. It's the typical crap that's been happening for years. It'll continue to happen until Bitcoin becomes openly accepted and viewed the same as cash (which is also used for illegal activities).

[21-Oct-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> Personally, I think it would be worth a shot to reach out to those on 'crypto twitter' who have high amounts of followers, etc and see if they would do an honest review of ARRR. Whether or not you have to 'motivate' them is unknown to me.. but it's worth a shot üòõ

[21-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> PBS would have only shown an ARRR documentary to throw pirates under the bus. Their view is privacy = criminals. Cause that sells. We disagree and counter with education facts, but media doesn't sell education. Media sells scandals. And politicians then advertise this scandal. We should embrace this, and set the media up. I think a good market for starters, is to penetrate the online sexy cam market. We can exponentialy generate more hype this way. And who doesn't need privacy when using this industry?

[21-Oct-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> @joe2x4 it would have been a scripted documentary displaying what we wanted to display, no opinions from them

[21-Oct-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> Maybe, but I have also learned that mainstream media is not to be trusted.

[21-Oct-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Draeth> Of course, but the production of it wouldn't be done by PBS, since they are just a station and not a production company

[21-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> You mentioned Asia as a target market. What reason would Asia have to use ARRR? Gambling and speculation? Privacy for Hong Kong resistance?

[21-Oct-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> seriously- consider the audience, TV is so 20th century... 
exactly how much user potential is there supposed to be in PBS audience?
tech adept pioneers that are likely to be made aware of ARRRs existence and rush to the internet to install and use it?
I don't think so!

[21-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <camthegeek> eg: online friend traveling broke down 250 miles away and forgot their wallet; luckily, they have their mobile phone and the ARRR mobile app. they need a bit of help. you send them ARRR, they cash out and are able to pay a tow provider (or someone) to get out of their situation.

[21-Oct-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> If governments are increasingly anti privacy, does this make ARRR anti government? Embrace the pirate. Expand into markets that a pirate would

[21-Oct-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <joe2x4> @camthegeek replace ARRR with any other crypto, why would I use ARRR?

[21-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <napa> @Draeth sorry if i came of rude, i was just flabbergasted that the idea was even considered. i do understand that marketing is highly needed, and i wish i had an ideal one to propose but honestly i don't. I just threw up on the thread cos 23k is a lot of money. its a full yr salary for those living below poverty level but i should have worded my comments better. am sorry for that. anyway, u guys doing a great job.
