@jongalt0, UTC-4 digitalprice.io should have deposits open tomorrow again.    There are some trades there but there‚Äôs not much pirate available because the deposits were shut off this morning.

[03-Nov-18 04:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
On trading, they were having deposit confirmation issues as volume started to increase. 

Oh see then when genie talks I should just shut my hole!!

Anybody can give me quick instructions for the bootstrap file for pirate ?

[03-Nov-18 07:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
download from here
https://bootstrap.0x03.services/pirate/ARRR.html

[03-Nov-18 07:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
and than unpack into the folder where PIRATE is stored

[03-Nov-18 07:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
don't delete wallet.dat

[03-Nov-18 07:25 AM] Acura#2748
Thanks @CHMEX a user had asked this in Telegram

[03-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
It's located in komodo/pirate folder

[03-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Acura#2748
Maybe we can put the instructiontext into the bootstrappage on the onboardsite

[03-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
Think in program files

[03-Nov-18 07:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
OK I can write something.
Just need to make sure people don't delete the wallet :S

[03-Nov-18 07:40 AM] And1_89#6578
can I check with the opid if a tx has arrived?

[03-Nov-18 08:34 AM] penguin#0544
What this treasure hunt?

[03-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Acura#2748
I am curious what will happen as soon as the deposits on DP are working again, regarding the topic "Onboardingsite‚Äú :trollface:

[03-Nov-18 08:58 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
The price of $ARRR on the onboarding tool is gone down quite a lot compared to when I bought them (not very long ago). Any reason for this? 
I thought that because of the hash rate etc the price would be probably increasing.

[03-Nov-18 09:03 AM] BlockTech#6895
@D2D privacyalternatives.com  well it's kind of following mining cost and OTC trade, if everybody is trading at 0,1KMD, onboarding get a bit down to 0,14-0,12, if suddenly OTC trade are around 0,2KMD, onboarding will also follow it near 0,2KMD.

[03-Nov-18 09:04 AM] BlockTech#6895
And at the beggining, some people where saying it wasn't worth it to mine ARRR for 0,15KMD when net hashrate was about 60Msol/s that was false information, it's still worth it at 100Msol/s with a price of <0,06KMD.

[03-Nov-18 09:04 AM] BlockTech#6895
(GPU not worth it, but ASIC with a price of 0,06KMD you're still making profit =D.)

[03-Nov-18 09:07 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@BlockTech  OK thanks, I should have waited a bit but it's not even on any major exchanges yet so.

[03-Nov-18 09:07 AM] BlockTech#6895
But i think, for now it's just being reajusted to mining hashrate and manually corrected if it's not "correct"

[03-Nov-18 09:08 AM] BlockTech#6895
Exactly, in my opinion 0,3KMD is near. I also bought around 0,19KMD onboarding.

The privacy features it has are very unique from what I understand. And I like the whole identity branding. I liked very much the logo that was being used until a few days ago on Twitter, you really noticed it amongst the other thumbnails but it's been changed now.

[03-Nov-18 09:34 AM] CHMEX#0686
Over time onboaring price will be increase if the otc prices increase.
There is only so many coins that can be mined a day.

#pirate  whoever is mining on https://polly.chainstrike.io/workers  with an invalid address  zcDvnVLLoCsmuDDsQEea8AM4vFFjHQAPUi   stop it right now you are getting blocked and are not going to get paid

[03-Nov-18 09:50 AM] shubham#7381
what min configuration needed to mine?

[03-Nov-18 09:56 AM] AndrewK#3947
which miner is zcCfvDT7Nespr9aRRYiQ...r8GfWBbaBmpuhRQqTzFv?

[03-Nov-18 09:57 AM] AndrewK#3947
no need to do this peak and valley style mining, pumping out 80 mSols every other payment cycle.. think its better for all of us to cruise control at an average

Will there a qt Wallet available for Pirate ? (Question from Telegram)

[03-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Oszy#5734
i don't think so. don't they mean lite wallet? qt doesn't make sense for pirate.

[03-Nov-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
oceanqt might work

[03-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Oszy#5734
is there any point using that over agama?

[03-Nov-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
some people like QT better it is smaller size executable, smaller footprint

[03-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Oszy#5734
i see.

[03-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Oszy#5734
Is there a tool or cli command that generates the kmd address off a set of seed words?

Hallo
How can i see my last transactions on agama wallet?

[03-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Oszy#5734
receive or send? there is no transaction history in Pirate

[03-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Oszy#5734
you can only see what you sent and if it was successful

[03-Nov-18 11:26 AM] Philtr#9415
Someone send me but it dont arrive. He want know how  to  look

[03-Nov-18 11:27 AM] Oszy#5734
he can go to the "Send" tab and on the bottom see the transaction status.

[03-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Oszy#5734
operation id and TX number is there

[03-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Oszy#5734
you can see on the explorer if it's been mined or not

[03-Nov-18 11:30 AM] Philtr#9415
Ok. But only when i send Pirate

[03-Nov-18 11:31 AM] Philtr#9415
For bigger TX the mining need more time than 10 h

[03-Nov-18 11:32 AM] Oszy#5734
it can take a lot time if you have many small amounts received and then you send 1 big amount yes.

[03-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Oszy#5734
send status must be "success" to get the transaction on the blockchain. mustn't  close the wallet until that is finished

[03-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Philtr#9415
He send me yesterday 9.30am and nothing come. Ok i say  him he must look  there.

[03-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Nabob#5004
Ask him to check status on Send tab In agama, if you scroll down,  You can see status of operater ID status

[03-Nov-18 11:39 AM] Nabob#5004
@Philtr

[03-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Nabob#5004
If it shows failed, means transaction never went through

yes it works, but the quote escapes are funky

type `z_getoperationstatus`  and click on execute - quotes wont work on agama cli

@dukeleto that's the format for cli
for agama's passtrhough, the quotes need to be escaped in some odd manner

[03-Nov-18 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i haven't tried to use CLI-via-Agama, I almost always use the CLI straight up. `z_getoperationstatus` works fine with no arguments, and will show you the last few recent things
