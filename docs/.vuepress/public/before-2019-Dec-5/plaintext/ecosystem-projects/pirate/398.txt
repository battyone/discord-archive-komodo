[16-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> tek = reality

[16-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> the key to getting what you want is believing you already have it

[16-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> then it magically manifests into reality

[16-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> or as tthe holy scripture says

[16-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> ‚ÄúAsk, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

[16-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> visualisation is key tho.

[16-Nov-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> religion is socially and psycologically constructed through a series of personal truths

[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> #not-safespace

[16-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> wait

[16-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> idk where that # came from

[16-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> there is no such thing as "personal truths"; it's either truth or it isn't

[16-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> meant to say #fact

[16-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> Dont get me started

[16-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> ask the 3 people closest to you in church WHy they belive, they will give 3 different stories. this is their personal truths

[16-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> not the objective truth of science

[16-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> sorry not sorry, god is fake

[16-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `ask the 3 people closest to you in church WHy they belive, they will...` all give you answers not based on truth

[16-Nov-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> The earth is but a mere neuron in the brain of God.

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> As above so below.

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> exactly. Truth is the objective truth of science

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Obviously God wants us to keep it healthy so that he doesn't get a brain tumor.

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Praise the Lord God

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> We live in his mind

[16-Nov-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> and he in his

[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> there are about 4200 religions on Earth, you ONLY belive in 1... and completely disregard the other 4199....... yet people think im crazy for denying them all

[16-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> funny story..

[16-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> lol

[16-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I've seen that quote before

[16-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> I do not dismiss all religions, all of the holy texts have great wisdoms in them and have part of the truth.

[16-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> all of them also have corruption

[16-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> Wait until the james webb telescope is in the sky. we will see past the expanding universe and we wont see some bearded guy. Wanna bet

[16-Nov-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Like anything touched by men seeking power and control

[16-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> Also if you think God is "a bearded man in the sky" you  r truly stupid my fren.

[16-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> religion is socially and psycologically constructed through a series of personal truths. the bible says great things, shall not kill, dont steal, respect thy mother and father... all GREAT things, nobody can deny those are amazing things to live by.  But god simply does not exist. Jesus is a fictional character written in a book to be percieved as a role model to live by.

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> that was a joke to tick you off

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> You can stay in the dark if you want. I'll walk in the light.

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> good. because it says great things

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> The light of God

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> just dont rely on "gods plan"

[16-Nov-19 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> it's not about the bible the bible is just a book.

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> nothing has a plan for you. no external force is controlling you. only YOU control you

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> you and the world aroind you determine the path your life flows

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Tek> listen buddy, you make your own reality, not mine.

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> the dominant force in your existance is the thinking you engage in

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Chaloom> no...

[16-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
