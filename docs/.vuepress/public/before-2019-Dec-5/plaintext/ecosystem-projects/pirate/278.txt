business you make this way - when customers coming and yo uahve even more then you wanted - you raise fees. If more coming still (example of Apple company) - you raise it even more. IF more custoemrs still coming - well at least you have decent fees üòÉ you can build another factory and give them more iphones

off the wall idea: There could be some sort of mining contest, 1 winner from each pool. So to win you would want to try and be on the lowest occupied pool.....

if anybody want to buy

[07-Nov-18 03:23 AM] rickiejohnson#0578
soon cheaper than OTC price

[07-Nov-18 03:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
OTC should be moving with floor price.

[07-Nov-18 04:42 AM] CiPhEr#2091
are there any links for various ways of exchanging pirate? I'm just learning about this project, I saw digital price exchange, any escrow services or other (somewhat  cheesy) exchanges like dp?

[07-Nov-18 04:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
https://digitalprice.io/?inviter=4fdaf7 
that is the best one.

[07-Nov-18 04:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We have applied at Crex24 and will hopefully be up there in a couple weeks.
They have over 2M volume.

[07-Nov-18 04:45 AM] CiPhEr#2091
cool! yeah i've turned my z9 onto this coin as of almost 24hrs ago.

[07-Nov-18 04:46 AM] CiPhEr#2091
I was trying out barterdex earlier on in the year but i notice on dexstats there really isn't much volume on there anymore. Has it been replaced by something else? It would be great to see pirate on an atomic swap dex

[07-Nov-18 04:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate cant be on a DEX like that.  It's TOO private üòõ  Bobs and alices cant talk.

[07-Nov-18 04:52 AM] ph03nix#3115
not for now...

[07-Nov-18 04:53 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i see

[07-Nov-18 04:55 AM] ph03nix#3115
barterdex was the first gui
hyperdex is the second version
marketmaker, the underlying "engine" for both is being upgraded

[07-Nov-18 04:56 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh ok so kind of down for re-tooling i take it

[07-Nov-18 04:57 AM] ph03nix#3115
yes

[07-Nov-18 04:57 AM] tipmebits#4427
thanks @pheo

[07-Nov-18 04:57 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah it will be great when utxo management is more automatic, i've always been super excited about the atomic swaps work komodo has been involved with

I will sell to you for that.

[07-Nov-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But @rickiejohnson the exchange is much lower ATM.

that affiliate link is it like a discount or other incentive for signing up with for dp?

That's ok.  If we keep on these new exchanges. and people DO uyse the links.. we should get a little here and a little there :0

[07-Nov-18 05:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Because not everyone has used Crex or Dig Pri

[07-Nov-18 05:25 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah for sure. Well i plan on holding all the pirate i mine until maybe at least 6 months down the road and sell some only if it goes up substantially (i'm a miner)

[07-Nov-18 05:26 AM] CiPhEr#2091
i just want a safe place to keep it, just trying to figure out encrypting agama pirate

[07-Nov-18 05:27 AM] ph03nix#3115
only way i know is to encrypt the wallet.dat file

[07-Nov-18 05:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ill get a paper wallet done for you soon.

[07-Nov-18 05:30 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah i'm going to look up info on the 'encrypt seed' part in settings but i think that is just for lite mode like what i have already done

[07-Nov-18 05:33 AM] ph03nix#3115
if you encrypt the seed it will ask for a pswd when trying to send, even in native

[07-Nov-18 05:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Unfortunately minethepiratechain.black is requiring longer down time than expected. I hope to have the pool up in a day or so. If you were mining on the pool and require immediate payout, please message me with your address. I have a log of all the payouts currently in the system. Apologies for the inconvenience. When up and running, the pool will adopt a 0% fee until December 1st to compensate for the troubles.

[07-Nov-18 05:33 AM] ph03nix#3115
but wallet.dat is still not encrypted

[07-Nov-18 05:34 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ah i don't think native can be enrypted- found this: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024441-why-can-t-i-encrypt-komodo-wallet-wallet-dat-in-native-mode-

[07-Nov-18 05:35 AM] CiPhEr#2091
maybe safest is to run virtualbox (and only use it for wallets) and veracrypt the wallet.dat file. still pretty cheesy

[07-Nov-18 05:37 AM] ph03nix#3115
yeah, one of the downfalls of zcash as i understand

[07-Nov-18 05:45 AM] CiPhEr#2091
Thanks @FishyGuts ! a paper wallet would probably be the most secure, I look forward to seeing your work üòÉ

[07-Nov-18 06:47 AM] CiPhEr#2091
anyone know of a way of setting custom diff on piratepool.io or theminingpoolstratum.selfip.com?

[07-Nov-18 06:53 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah looks like vardiff puts my z9mini at roughly 4 shares a minute on piratepool.io, thats pretty risky for having a coin that is 60s blocktime. High risk of losing shares. Trying the low diff port for theminingpoolstratum.selfip.com right now and looks much better at around 10 shares a min, but its dropping so i'll see where it equalizes at

[07-Nov-18 06:59 AM] CiPhEr#2091
usually 10 to 15 shares a minute is safe (doesn't overly spam pool's network) but reduces chances of losing shares. Basically 1/((accepted shares per min)*(blocktime in minutes of coin)) will give you your % chance of submitting a lost share

[07-Nov-18 07:01 AM] CiPhEr#2091
in bitmain asics "utility" = accepted shares per minute and WU = total difficulty submitted. Aim of the game is to adjust difficulty so WU is highest as possible without getting rejected or stale shares.
