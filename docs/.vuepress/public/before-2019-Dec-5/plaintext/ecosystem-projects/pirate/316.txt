Hope you didn't lose much

[15-Nov-18 04:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
Free stuff is never free 😉

[15-Nov-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no test, just 15 dumb things including unscanned torrent files and win firewall turned off

`Hope you didn't lose much` 29k ☹

[15-Nov-18 04:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
Shit

[15-Nov-18 04:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
Sorry man. That sucks

[15-Nov-18 04:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have a look at qubes

[15-Nov-18 04:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
It runs stuff in isolated vm's and the hypervisor is baremetal

[15-Nov-18 04:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
You can have a vault, disconnected from everything to store keys and what not

[15-Nov-18 04:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
You can run stuff in disposable VMs

[15-Nov-18 04:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
But wouldn't recommend it on anything with less than 16 GB RAM

[15-Nov-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I normally vm most everything, that day was just upper-level stoopid

[15-Nov-18 04:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
And you can run stand alone vm's as well if you need windows for example

[15-Nov-18 04:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
Sounds more like lazy and you forgot to put the rubber on 😂

[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more like to lazy to even buy rubbers 😛

[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
That's the beauty with qubes. It will stop stupit in it's tracks. Or at least it will give you a reminder that you're running unsafe stuff in your safe environment

[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
And if you proceed, well. That's on you

[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
Lol

[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[15-Nov-18 04:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
Can't have enough rubbers man. And tin foil. Don't forget about the tin foil

[15-Nov-18 04:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
Tin foil very important

[15-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@mrlynch are you in the usa?

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
nope

[15-Nov-18 08:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
canaries - uk ... depends on the mood :))

[15-Nov-18 08:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
it would be really bad if piratepool went down for a few hours 🤔

[15-Nov-18 08:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
i bet most of the miners are nh miners & dumping and have been on piratepool since it was 1 of the 3 pools lol

[15-Nov-18 08:53 PM] jansako#3330
can't dump NH proceeds at thee prices any more... or rather quite risky, if the hash doubles for a few hours, like it likes to do, your profits go out of the window...

[15-Nov-18 08:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
@jansako tell that to whomever sold 10k ARRR for .000015 and lower in the last few hours

[15-Nov-18 08:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
0 miners on http://piratetheminingpool.selfip.com so 100% chance of winning 😁

[15-Nov-18 09:20 PM] P3L3#1096
when is the drawing? how does that work?

[15-Nov-18 09:20 PM] P3L3#1096
saw it says something like once a week.. but on what day?

[15-Nov-18 09:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
the day is randomly chosen by @Cryptofist

[15-Nov-18 09:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
as he organized the contest

[15-Nov-18 09:22 PM] P3L3#1096
