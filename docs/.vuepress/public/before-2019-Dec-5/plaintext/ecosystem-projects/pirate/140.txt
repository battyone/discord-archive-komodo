About every hour on the hour the pool cuts out.

[08-Oct-18 03:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085

saw it in #feed-telegram 😅

[08-Oct-18 05:35 AM] kangster#3597
I will move to the other pool if the pool stability issue isn't fixed. It's draining making my hashpower less cost effective

[08-Oct-18 05:35 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Xyz?

[08-Oct-18 05:35 AM] kangster#3597
how often does difficulty readjust

[08-Oct-18 05:35 AM] kangster#3597
yes xyz

[08-Oct-18 05:36 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Yeah it’s fluctuations are cray

[08-Oct-18 05:36 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I’m going to put my next batch on the other pool

[08-Oct-18 05:46 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Any idea y one of my gpus are putting out 270h/s and the rest doing over 700?

[08-Oct-18 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
riser?

[08-Oct-18 05:48 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
It’s on both pool of pirate, but if I point at mining something else all is fine

[08-Oct-18 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then sounds like sharediff issue

[08-Oct-18 05:50 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Something I can do to fix it?

[08-Oct-18 06:30 AM] 0x03#8822
no, something i will have to do to fix

[08-Oct-18 06:30 AM] 0x03#8822
but it's not costing you any money, just sayin

[08-Oct-18 06:58 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Not costing n electric but costing profits lol

[08-Oct-18 07:04 AM] 0x03#8822
feel free to mine on the other pools that have a fee or to set up your own :trollface:

[08-Oct-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a solo pool for PIRATE is very very easy.

[08-Oct-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but with this hash rate, its not really a grreat idea anymore

[08-Oct-18 08:14 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
👍 my avg stays quite a bit higher on piratepool

[08-Oct-18 08:51 AM] Mylo#8306
@jspook16 "still a steal", the alliteration would be the use of s's & l's.   Depending on your accent, "still" and "steal" could be considered a homophone.

[08-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Mylo#8306
_is not a grammar pirate_

[08-Oct-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the richlist is now composed of mining pool and solo miner balances that havent been shielded yet. it seems we wont be able to get it reduced to much less. as the coin supply goes up, this number should still stay about the same, so we can get to 99.99% shielded
