`internally, all deposits are swept into a single main address`
people just never seem to get this 👆🏽 
no one has any currency "on an exchange"
you give them currency in exchange for a promise and everything you see is just balances on an internal ledger(not actual currency moving)

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I suspected that but was not sure / never coded CEX 😛

[29-Nov-18 05:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is that not doable to actually have address per client?

[29-Nov-18 05:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
seems could be less error prone ?

[29-Nov-18 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it is doable, but that's not how banks work

[29-Nov-18 06:34 PM] jansako#3330
Thing is you do have an address per client (I would expect your deposit address is different than mine. The problem is that all of the different deposit addresses live in the same wallet.

[29-Nov-18 06:35 PM] jansako#3330
a workaround could be multiple wallets, but then the costs vs. profit for the exchange come to play...

[29-Nov-18 06:35 PM] jansako#3330
they don't profit from withdraws, but do when the coins are on the exchange and keep changing hands 😃

[29-Nov-18 06:36 PM] jansako#3330
nothing sinister there, just business

[29-Nov-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
most exchange software sweeps funds to a central account to simplify the internal workins

[29-Nov-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and splitting into different wallets would make things order of magnitude more complex

[29-Nov-18 06:37 PM] jansako#3330
for sure.

[29-Nov-18 06:42 PM] jansako#3330
I bet forced switching people's deposit addresses for every X deposits would resolve the mining-to-exchange issue :trollface:  would be not so good for the set-and-forget folks...

[29-Nov-18 06:43 PM] jansako#3330
of course it would require the exchange to have the structure in place to recreate the addresses/wallets

the force itself would be more coding than the tracking

[29-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Strob#3417
About the script for the "Why privacy is important" video, I would like if we could first make a list of all the reasons why privacy is important by just naming the reasons in a list and a few word to define each of those reasons. Them maybe we can choose which one we want to talk about in the video and then we can develop more on those reasons by adding concrete examples. Because so far most sentences excerpted from the interview or the draft are examples of the same 2 or 3 reasons or just naming some applicable fields for privacy without really explaining why. I am working on the list right now.

[29-Nov-18 07:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dwx select "activate" and then just type "pir" and it should be right there

Why privacy matters: Targeted advertisements / Who shall i rob today? / Gossip on how you spend your Money / Look, boss, I´m part of a trade union! / Unwittingly tainted Money (fungibility) / Contracts, salaries, margins, suppliers.. / Miners can become censors ...

[29-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Strob#3417
I have this so far: Why privacy is important:

1-Fungibility 
To remove power from anyone to blacklist coins or addresses.

2-Business privacy
To keep negociation power with vendors and clients.

3-No Big Brother
We don’t want governement of corporation to monitor our every move and we don’t want to be subject to eventual persecution resulting from such monitoring.

4-No Mishandling of data.
If the data is not leaked in the first place, then there is no mishandling of that data possible (Facebook-Cambridge Analytica). If we let suposedly trustable governement or company handle our private data, there is always a risk for the data to fall in the wrong hands by hacking or just plain incompetence.

5-Keeping control of our wealth.
Removing control from bank on our wealth. Being our own bank to remove the power from anyone to freeze our accounts.

[29-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Strob#3417

Why privacy is important:

1-Fungibility 
To remove power from anyone to blacklist coins or addresses.

2-Business privacy
To keep negociation power with vendors and clients.

3-No financial Big Brother nor Big Data (preventing financial data collection)
We don’t want governement of corporation to monitor our every financial move and we don’t want to be subject to eventual persecution resulting from such monitoring. If the corporations are so eager to collect social media data massively, they will be even more for your financial data which misuse can be even more troublesome.

4-No Mishandling of data.
If the data is not leaked in the first place, then there is no mishandling of that data possible (Facebook-Cambridge Analytica). If we let suposedly trustable governement or company handle our private data, there is always a risk for the data to fall in the wrong hands by hacking or just plain incompetence.

5-Fully reclaiming or financial sovereignty.
Removing control from bank on our wealth. Being our own bank to remove the power from anyone to freeze our accounts.

6-Risk of robbery.
 If ledgers are public, robbers can monitor them to help them find who to rob.

7-Gossip on how we spend our money.
    Sometimes it’s better that our insurance company, our boss or even friends don’t know every details on how we spend our money without explanations.

[29-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
We should make content that also appears to nocoiners. ... I think it's important to address why privacy is important in block chain. As people would were brought up using fiat, more often than not we had privacy when we wanted it in transactions (cash) and our digital transactions were only viewable by our choice or the demands by government/ law.

Being as most blockchains are naturally a viewable  public ledger we exchange privacy for lack of government involvement, fully coding Blockchain to a standard where we take our privacy BACK is the ultimate next step to freedom via the crypto revolution.

[29-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Or something like that. Might need to be just a separate video. Appealing to both people in and out of block chain seems daunting to me at times.
