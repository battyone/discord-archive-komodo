[09-Nov-18 06:35 PM] hfaz63#1930

[09-Nov-18 06:35 PM] hfaz63#1930

[09-Nov-18 06:39 PM] Draeth#3300
Because that's what happens with every new coin

[09-Nov-18 06:39 PM] Oszy#5734
you answered the question

[09-Nov-18 06:39 PM] Oszy#5734
because there is an exchange

[09-Nov-18 06:39 PM] Draeth#3300
The price will go up in time

[09-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Draeth#3300
@FishyGuts you guys should make a pirate support channel

[09-Nov-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
#deleted-channel

[09-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Draeth#3300
I figured #deleted-channel was for just newbie questions n such

[09-Nov-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
90%+ of support is needed by new pirates

[09-Nov-18 06:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe a Price discussion channel though....

[09-Nov-18 06:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It has taken up a lot of space in all of the channels lately.

[09-Nov-18 06:46 PM] Oszy#5734
not like people will keep it there.. üòÑ

[09-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Draeth#3300
Figured I'd throw it out there

[09-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Bikob2#4549
piratepool.io disappeared from the list of mining pools  on the site https://pirate.black/mining/ why??

Yarrr

[09-Nov-18 06:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Bikob2 to spreas the hash across the pools

[09-Nov-18 06:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
webworker is a busy man and running an ever growing pool might prove to be a tad difficult:abusedsmily:

[09-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Bikob2#4549
i hope every thing is fine with piratepool.io, but first thoughts hacked, 51% attack, hard fork...

[09-Nov-18 07:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
No chance of that. Pirate is dPoW secured by bitcoin's blockchain ;)

[09-Nov-18 07:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
Is any one here on gab? everyone

[09-Nov-18 07:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
Might be worth posting in there as well

[09-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Bikob2#4549
yea

[09-Nov-18 07:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
I could do a few posts if i have permission to repost some of your material. I suck at marketing

[09-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Bikob2#4549
some article

[09-Nov-18 07:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
What's gab??

[09-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
NVM ... I googled.

[09-Nov-18 07:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
Lewl. Gab is awesome

[09-Nov-18 07:09 PM] mrlynch#5735

[09-Nov-18 07:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
Don't go if you're a professional offence taker üòÇ :trollface:

[09-Nov-18 07:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I read some things about the site.

[09-Nov-18 07:16 PM] HellBlazeSRB#6211
did I read that correctly that the biggest pool was taken down so others can get some spread??? and what will happen with piratepool showing pending txs, why the delay in payment?

[09-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Seko#7408

@HellBlazeSRB it's not been taken down. Just off the site so that new pirates jump on the other pools. Piratepool is still going :) funds are safu

[09-Nov-18 07:28 PM] macwinny#1922
Anyone know what's up with piratepool.io

[09-Nov-18 07:33 PM] jansako#3330

[09-Nov-18 08:43 PM] wolfgang#3508

[09-Nov-18 08:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
Not really. Most of us run asics and nh

[09-Nov-18 08:43 PM] wolfgang#3508
thought so

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
But depends how many 1080s u have :))

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] wolfgang#3508
only 10

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
A 1080ti hits 460 sols

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
So that's around 4600sols

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
Not really worth it

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] wolfgang#3508
nopd

[09-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
But you can test and see

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] mrlynch#5735

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
Don't u have them on hiveos?

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] wolfgang#3508
nope

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
You should get them on it

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] wolfgang#3508
might have to get that setup

[09-Nov-18 08:45 PM] wolfgang#3508
management through phone?

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's really easy. Create an account on hiveos.farm

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Deploy the agent and you can manage it via the website (phone included) wherever u are

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] wolfgang#3508
any costs?

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
I have flightsheets created and can switch them to other pools in a heart beat

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] wolfgang#3508
nic

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] wolfgang#3508
nice

[09-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
It's free for 3 rigs/asics

[09-Nov-18 08:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you add the 4th u pay for all of them but it's only $2 / asic / month and $3 / gpu rig / month
