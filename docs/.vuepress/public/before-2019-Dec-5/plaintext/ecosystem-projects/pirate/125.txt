joe, if you want to stabilize the price, please stabilize the hashrate

😂 

[05-Oct-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
oh you didnt want stable, you wanted slower

[05-Oct-18 07:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
I'm trying really hard Captain

[05-Oct-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, slow down the hashrate increase

[05-Oct-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if the hashrate triples, how to prevent the price from tripling

[05-Oct-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
just convince miners to cut their hashrate in half

[05-Oct-18 07:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
Ie: how to stop or slow a drunken party? :rum:

[05-Oct-18 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just convince miners to cut their hashrate in half`
Just convince the oil cos to cut production in half while you're at it 😂

[05-Oct-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i know, make the ocean not have any wave

[05-Oct-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
to do that, you will need to remove the moon and stop all the winds

[05-Oct-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
hmmm.. nope i think the earth spinning is making things a bit unstable

[05-Oct-18 07:31 PM] cHOPE#9228
Its a free market. No one is being forced to buy or sell at a particular rate....why do we need a useless debate on this.....

[05-Oct-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`remove the moon `
Nooooooooooooooooooooo, must have moon

you cant assume anything until the cork surfaces

[05-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if the cork is still below the surface it has no direction to go but up

SOLD ~~WTS 50 @6.5kmd ~~ :trollface:

[05-Oct-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
basically all the miners are purchasing the coins at the higher prices

[05-Oct-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and miners are not buying the PIRATE for charity

[05-Oct-18 07:34 PM] cHOPE#9228
💯

[05-Oct-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a bit surprising so much is being sold so close to mining cost, but I assume that is just old inventory with lower cost basis

[05-Oct-18 07:35 PM] cHOPE#9228
If you want stable price, go buy USDT and hold it

[05-Oct-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
perfect trade to make at the bottom of the bear!

😂 

[05-Oct-18 07:35 PM] joe2x4#5987
Really, am just fishing for some good guestimates, where might price be per coin at Tortuga, at halving, vs the coin supply

[05-Oct-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
when the hashrate starts slowing down maybe that is the surfacing

[05-Oct-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but usually things stairstep up, so the first surfacing might just be the first step

[05-Oct-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
another point is that PIRATE appears to be behaving in a non-standard way, so maybe the standard methods of price prediction wont work, especially for short term

[05-Oct-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
using the real estate analogy of comparable coins, PIRATE is like a DOGE+XMR combo with I think a stronger meme and better privacy and better security

[05-Oct-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the marketing does its job, it should be a top coin

[05-Oct-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
how far up the ladder it climbs will be up to the PIRATE spirit we can tap into globally

[05-Oct-18 07:40 PM] joe2x4#5987

@joe2x4 I'll ask 1 more question, then I leave it be...
Were your panties in this much of a bunch over the BTC prices in March-Aug '16?

[05-Oct-18 07:45 PM] joe2x4#5987
Lol

[05-Oct-18 07:47 PM] joe2x4#5987
Gives me a great idea, pirate paper wallet on panties

[05-Oct-18 07:48 PM] joe2x4#5987
For the salty dog at sea

[05-Oct-18 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You "lol", but I'm serious. You're going off like 9 cents is the end of the world, meanwhile there's at least a dozen examples of BTC doubling hundreds and/or thousands in 1 day

[05-Oct-18 07:52 PM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe. But these be uncharted waters. We can't be expected to buy everyday without at least questioning our sanity least we start seeing rogue buccaneers  taking advantage like the other day. Or maybe the rogues appearance is a sign of a cork explosion the likes ney seen since Davy Jones first sailed the ocean blue.

[05-Oct-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No one is "expecting" you to buy, period, much less every day. There's 7 billion people out there beyond your narcissism

[05-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Guys it's simple supply and demand, supply is becoming more expensive because mining is becoming more expensive

[05-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So price goes up

[05-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It's not rocket science

[05-Oct-18 07:54 PM] Hermes#6934
I like more mining than buying in some way , it also helps the network

[05-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Hermes#6934
feels better in some way

[05-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you feel the price is too high, sell

[05-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you feel the price is too low, buy

_agrees with @Hermes and would frankly be much happier in life if there was a way to get auto-paid market price for his mining and never had to deal with markets, trading, APIs, and the like_

I imagine it's better now, but 2 years ago, it was nothing but hassles - strat locked up 1/2 the time he sent payments, web locked up 100% of the time to the point where he started killing it on purpose ahead of payments

@Deleted User I'm not sure what you issue is, nor do I care except for the fact that you're the 2nds asshole to cry today
There's no "price manipulation" going on.
We were having an open and honest discussion about what we all feel the current market of a new coin should be

[06-Oct-18 03:50 AM] rrrj288#7865
@Deleted User actually the answer  it's very simple : don't buy it 😂😂

[06-Oct-18 03:51 AM] rrrj288#7865
You not buying. What the he'll does the price got to do with you then ?

[06-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Lol it’s not manipulation I simply asked when the price was raising to match conditions

You keep going on about "manipulation", I've asked you **twice** what your price and volume is and you refuse to answer; you're not "selling" or worried about anyone else selling, you just want to start some shit

If I were trying to manipulate things I wouldn’t do so publicly. I’d get a group message of everyone I know pushing heavy hash rate and say hey we need to up the price to 0.6 kmd and settle no less than 0.5. That’s how manipulated markets works. It damn sure don’t happen in public
