A cex would be the best way to verify the order books. I looked into a bot. But it would rely on an honesty based system to input the orders. Which, as much as we'd like to hope it'd work, it wouldn't.

Necessity is the mother of invention. @TortugaExchange will be the most private centralized exchange it will be. zk-SNARK only deposits and withdrawals. First pairs to active on will be $PIRATE & $KMD

@TortugaExchange @PirateChain @KomodoPlatform This too is a community effort. 3 different implementation are already in the works, including a chat bot based exchange to web based exchange. Don’t confuse it to be an exchange made and managed by @KomodoPlatform 
At least ...

The #MOST private #cryptocurrency in industry from zk-SNARKS blockchain family.
99.9% of it's coins are in shielded. How can a blockchain data analyst beat this level of #Anonymous transactions? Can't even attack it with 51% Sybil attack

@Chewy depends on the question

[07-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Chewy#0565
fair enough.  I just tried the onboarding process, and stupid me.  Should have picked the smallest amount until I knew for sure I have it figured out.  Sent the exact amount, but for got about the .01 transaction fee.  Is that going to screw me?

[07-Oct-18 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX ? 👆🏼

[07-Oct-18 02:37 AM] KSanJuan#9608
No, it won't. Thew wallet did it for me.

[07-Oct-18 02:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, you got it sorted OK then?

[07-Oct-18 02:45 AM] Chewy#0565
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , if you are talking about my question, no luck yet.  been about 40 min since transfer.  Found transactions on KMD block explorer.

[07-Oct-18 03:01 AM] Chewy#0565
So, just for the record, I went through the process again and did the smallest amount this time.  Accounted for the fee by adding it into the payment so I over paid by .01 KMD and the second transaction just showed up in the wallet, but the first one didn't.

[07-Oct-18 03:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@Chewy CHMEX handles that site and when around next, I'm sure will be willing to help you sort it out if it didn't work

[07-Oct-18 03:09 AM] Chewy#0565
Yeah, I figured.  Not worried as it shows up in the block explorer so I have records, and the second one worked so the address is good.  My last message was just for information is all regarding the fees in case anyone else was reading.  Thanks for taking the time to talk this over with me.

Genie.. most likely you’re confronting a bot

[07-Oct-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@sid3way It may very well be, but it is definitely mining PIRATE so there's a more than likely chance the owner is a community member

[07-Oct-18 04:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
all sorted now I sent the PIRATE.
Thanks Genie for pointing him in the right direction

I think fishy had the same problem yesterday

@house The answer is: "electronics and KMD"

[07-Oct-18 05:43 AM] house#8741
Ahh

[07-Oct-18 05:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
servers, GPUs, and ASICs don't come for free 😦

[07-Oct-18 05:46 AM] Redbeard#8343
.

[07-Oct-18 05:47 AM] house#8741
KMD is fully understandable ... electronics hmmm ... unless you are quick to ROI don’t you worry about their obsolescence ?

[07-Oct-18 05:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The other side of that rabbit hole is that I don't view my currency as a commodity ("store of value") `money severs no other purpose than to be spent`
As far as hitting *positive ROI* (as soon as you make a single satoshi you have ROI [because, words]), that's why I buy newest and as fast as possible.

[07-Oct-18 05:55 AM] house#8741
Agreed, currency (fiat) is best spent while it retains current value. Because, inflation.
ROI (because, words) yes smarty pants you are correct 😚 perhaps correct vernacular is ROTI. 
Is still quite a gamble I would think

[07-Oct-18 05:57 AM] house#8741
Ie 2080Ti

[07-Oct-18 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all mining is a gamble, but my risk management is that item 1 pays for item 2, items 1&2 pay for items 3&4....
Think about this.....
I bought 50 Z9 minis (3 of them at $2k)
and in the last 2 weeks (not when it was easy) I've parlyed their hash into mining over 900k PIRATE.
Granted a good chunk of that goes back to NH, but a not small amount is mine (be it sold or held)

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] house#8741
To parlay or not to parlay ...

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] house#8741
Good question

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and my GPUs are what paid for those minis

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
does nh take kmd?

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] house#8741
Well, you are one gutsy SOB

[07-Oct-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nh only takes BTC

[07-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Bakes#0367
Thats the best way to do it, grow with your rewards. I started with 1 Baikal X10 5 months ago, I have grown to 2 z9 minis and 3 more X10'

[07-Oct-18 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I will say that I've caught some good breaks along the way that I couldn't duplicate the results of if I started again today, but the same as I do now would still be but on a smaller scale

[07-Oct-18 06:07 AM] house#8741
Perhaps I am just to conservative/chickenshit ... parlaying profits continually into tech in the hope to exponentially profit makes my tummy gurgle

[07-Oct-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I started that way

[07-Oct-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then I decided to run it like a business and then it became one

[07-Oct-18 06:08 AM] house#8741
I’d venture to suggest that we may not all have your constitution

[07-Oct-18 06:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, it was either that or going back to building nice homes for rich people.....
I decided I wanted the nice home

you used to build houses?

[07-Oct-18 06:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I Swear  ... you guys need a room. lol

[07-Oct-18 06:19 AM] ronyi#5719
Just theory: We say PIRATE is secure, but every mining page  (except: https://piratechain.org) use stratum+tcp, every data send "plain text" between  miners and mining pools. If miners not use TOR or  VPN or... government can assign a Z address to the IP address clearly(users to Z).  The node is a little bit different in my opinion. I just thinking simple privacy. I do not intend to harm the pool operators or violate it. think about it together. thanks in advance for the constructive comments.

[07-Oct-18 06:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Dr Debt and in MH at that 😝

[07-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I need to talk to ya then. lol

[07-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Dr Debt#0891
like next weekish. need to know how they operate that way.

[07-Oct-18 06:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi a pool is not PIRATE or the PIRATE/Komodo protocol

[07-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I gotta go to the courthouse that way, monday.

[07-Oct-18 06:21 AM] ronyi#5719

@ronyi ... are you suggesting IP can be mapped ?

[07-Oct-18 06:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi pools are like central exchanges to the extent that your relationship with, interactions with, and transactions with are not part of the currency, have no ties to the currency, and are your personal choice

[07-Oct-18 06:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also `read the feken whitepaper`

[07-Oct-18 06:24 AM] ronyi#5719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i know that. @house yes.

[07-Oct-18 06:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you know that, then wtf are you on about?

[07-Oct-18 06:28 AM] ronyi#5719
I'm looking at the community side now, not a pirate/komodo site. I described what I would like to talk about. the community is good when mapped....? i thing not.

[07-Oct-18 06:29 AM] ronyi#5719
I think it is a common interest.

[07-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Redbeard#8343
Not good, vpn

[07-Oct-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, we've been through this conversation before (as a community) and I offend at least 1 pool op every time we do
Personally, my answer is that everyone needs to go back to solo-mining and pools are mostly unnecessary (outside of a free source of advertising the existence of a coin/chain)

[07-Oct-18 06:33 AM] house#8741
Is a pertinent observation ... I for one am not worried about identity, but for the purposes of following with our intentions of becoming the most privacy secured contingency in crypto, it is worth making some plans or at very least some instruction for new comers to fulfil this strategy

[07-Oct-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
setting my opinions on pools aside, who cares if anyone knows what your z addy is? the fact that they can do nothing with that info is the reason PIRATE exists

[07-Oct-18 06:34 AM] house#8741
Hmmm , mayhaps I misunderstood

[07-Oct-18 06:36 AM] ronyi#5719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 one solution and we have many possible...  need to know that you have Z address or mining PIRATE?

[07-Oct-18 06:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, I just had a block orphaned

[07-Oct-18 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi I don't understand that last sentence, I'm sorry

[07-Oct-18 06:38 AM] ronyi#5719
the pirates did not know where and where they lived. just a simile.

[07-Oct-18 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you say I mined PIRATE because some random guy had a database that said so? prove it`
