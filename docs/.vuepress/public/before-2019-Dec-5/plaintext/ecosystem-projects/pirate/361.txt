yea

[04-Dec-18 12:26 PM] Bikob2#4549
And in terms of further arrr-adoption for people will be much better to read about a fully shielded chain than about a NEARLY fully shielded chain.

[04-Dec-18 12:27 PM] Bikob2#4549
"fully shielded user coin base" - good one

[04-Dec-18 12:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
@FishyGuts ...  seems the word 'attacked' is mssing on p12:
'In May 16 2018, Bitcoin Gold was by an unknown actor who...'

You can add Vertocoin (VTC) 51%

[04-Dec-18 12:31 PM] Bikob2#4549

[04-Dec-18 12:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
didnt it happen before to VERTcoin?

[04-Dec-18 12:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
can always add it later when the attack has finished

[04-Dec-18 12:48 PM] Flexatron#8809
seems to be still ongoing

[04-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Flexatron#8809

[04-Dec-18 01:07 PM] Bikob2#4549
"The following Pirate features AND estimated deliveries multiplied by the number œÄ" to be perfectly correct üòÜ

[04-Dec-18 01:08 PM] Flexatron#8809
its meant like the dates are estimations of deliveries, but already worded it differently

[04-Dec-18 01:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
haha

[04-Dec-18 01:10 PM] Bikob2#4549
the dates - as derivative of work hour estimation

@Flexatron  are new ttx 100% z ? if so then new tx are full z, there is just minority of < 0.1% tx that are not z, but these are old, but it does not matter since all new are z?

[04-Dec-18 01:32 PM] Flexatron#8809
what's your question exactly

[04-Dec-18 01:32 PM] Flexatron#8809
there will still be  "new"non z coins going into mining pools, older non-z coins are cpu mined so "old"

[04-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Fully shielded peer to peer initiated transactions. or Fully shielded user initiated transactions

[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Flexatron  my mind has been on this "how do we say 100%" dilemma for a bit.  ü§∑

[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Thats correct though right?

Ok.....  Time to set sail Pirates. 
We've built the new discord and we want to get all of us migrated over there.  We have radio, and tip bots and will get a bridge to the one remaining Pirate channel in KMD discord once everyone sets sail.  

TODAY THE INVITE BOUNTY STARTS!!!!  
So get your ref link and lets annoy everyone on social media platforms from Instagram to Twitter, FB to Gab, Reddit to Steemit!
