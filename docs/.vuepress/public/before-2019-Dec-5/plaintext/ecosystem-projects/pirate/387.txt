[dscrd-prt] <wolfgang> statins no good

[09-Nov-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> Statins and chemotoxins no good indeed- painful as it may be, the only thing that helps is good diet and exercise... 
or end up like those millions obese diabetics, dependent on pharma industry for their next insulin shot- or die a slow, lingering death from diabetic ulcers and all the other assorted nasties

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `the only thing that helps is good diet and exercise...`
There's no diet or exercise regimen in the world that alters basic genetics, but sure I'll just eat more carrots to fight my 92% likelihood of having cancer

[09-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> Is poor nutrition and non-activity a contributing factor to the functional decline of the species? Yes.
Is it going to alter basic evolutionary traits? No!
`or end up like those millions obese diabetics, dependent on pharma industry for their next insulin shot- or die a slow,`
You're comparing apples to oranges and TypeII shouldn't even be allowed to be called "diabetes" in most cases

[09-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <LocoMB> yes, it rather is 'insulin resistance', similar to opioid or alcohol habituation :rum: :rum: :rum: :rum:

[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> `it rather is 'insulin resistance'`
it's not even that, byproducts of chemical reactions occur; when you multiply the components by a quintillion, you have a mass effect
that's just basic logic
the body produces sugars from the consumption of x, consuming 15000x produces 15000x more sugar

A fad diet will cure your genetic defects and make everything alright....

[09-Nov-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <Acura> I can prefer 5:2 fasting method, works very well for me since several months as a pirat

[09-Nov-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> stop eating shit for the 1st 5 days and you will not need to "reduce" for the last 2 üòõ

[09-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> If people, in general, practiced moderation, then all these extreme change diets would never exist

[09-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> a fad diet that scientifically is proven to dramatically improve diabetes, sounds pretty reasonable to me

[09-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> it "improves" a form of "diabetes" that is self-induced and wholly related to diet
that's like saying that it's scientifically proven that if you move to a planet with no cars then you will not ever suffer a car accident

[09-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <kp> i have no insight in your situation so i guess its stupid to discuss it

[09-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> So do ACE inhibitors :troll:

[09-Nov-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-prt] <ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢> likely the same as my aversion to insurance companies
but that doesn't change the fact that some things are self-induced and some are genetic
We live in an over-medicated world, but that doesn't mean that all meds are bad or that all things can be changed without them üòâ
