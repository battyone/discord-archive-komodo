@Maat newly mined coins go into a taddr and then get paid to a zaddr. If you're using a mining pool you have to have a zaddr as the username.

[30-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Maat#9515
@house yes,somebody created for me equihashpool and add pirate few days a go,but cant work with z adress,any suggestion?

ARRR is a privacy coin built off a couple different ideas!! @ShadowKnight 
– Komodo Assetchain
– Independent blockchain
– Privacy/Shielded/z tx only chain (No transparent transactions possible on PIRATE chain)
– Has the most shielded coins of all other coins, even more than Zcash
– Block time aprox 60 seconds.
– Block reward: 256 PIRATE (ARRR)
– Block reward halves: every 388885 blocks – every 270 days
– Block reward of 1 satoshi will be reached in about 25 years.
– Total supply of around 200 million PIRATE
– Mining algorithm: Equihash PoW
– TOR network supported.

ASIC is cheaper than GPU in every way at leasy for equihash 🤷

99% of people droning on about "ASIC resistance" in equihash have less than 1% understanding of equihash

[30-Oct-18 04:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Aside from Komodo and dPoW, the only "ASIC resistance" in equihash is "RAM is expensive" 🤦🏼

[30-Oct-18 04:50 AM] ph03nix#3115

[30-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
when opening the Agama wallet for ARRR spesifically, do I need to activate the coin each time I open the wallet, and sync the whole blockchain, then re-import my address with my private key? Is there no way to just open the wallet, and let it continue where it left of the last time I closed it?

[30-Oct-18 06:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You will need to sync the blockchain every time, yes. As new blocks are being created all the time. You shouldn't have to import your wallet everytime as it should be stored in your wallet.dat file on your computer. You may have to let the chain sync before it will show in your wallet though

[30-Oct-18 06:49 AM] Dr4gonTrader#6152
ok cool, thanks 😃

[30-Oct-18 06:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It should only start syncing from the block it was last at though.
