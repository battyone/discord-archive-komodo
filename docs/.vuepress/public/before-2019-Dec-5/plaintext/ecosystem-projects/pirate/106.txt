Kinda depends on jurisdiction
Here in the US, judges define porn as "I can't describe it, but I know it when I see it" 😕

[03-Oct-18 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In many parts of the world, what that dude calls "porn" they call "the beach"

[03-Oct-18 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dump the license and go back to whatever znomp has

[03-Oct-18 10:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's my license, I can invalidate it whenever I want 😛

[03-Oct-18 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I hereby declare that whatever knmop/znomp/nomp/stratum code I wrote has no license and is open to the public domain

[03-Oct-18 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😃

[03-Oct-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so I'll make a new repo of "random code I "found on pastebin" and you can fork that

[03-Oct-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😃

[03-Oct-18 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the core of it belongs to matt little and nomp, so I guess the real license starts there

[03-Oct-18 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no clue what, if any, he had

[03-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
@SHossain are you in control of github.com/PirateNetwork?

[03-Oct-18 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i was trying to figure out why you made it a more restrictive license`
Because it was a wip, I didn't care, and that was the 1st option the GUI had in the list

[03-Oct-18 10:30 AM] SHossain#0007
@jorian I'm not. what is needed?

[03-Oct-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
someone in charge

[03-Oct-18 10:31 AM] jorian#4555
@grewalsatinder is it you who is in charge of Pirate github?

[03-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbt, I never wanted, or cared, if it had *any* "license", I only even made it a repo so that we could all share shit

[03-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how that turned into *not* sharing shit is beyond me

[03-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Besides, if mine had MIT license, why does your fork have 'GNU General Public License v2.0' if your claim is you can't do that?

[03-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔

[03-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

anywho, next time don't lay your baggage off on me; without fail, everything I put in the public is meant for **everyone**
If you don't want to support something, say that. Don't hide behind some shit about licensing.
🛀🏼 time

[03-Oct-18 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a license can only be enforced by the licenser (or their representative[s], of which I have none) and as such I am repeating, I don't give a parrot's right ass cheek about the licensing of shit that was meant for all to have, share, learn from, and enjoy.
Especially since the entire point of the repo was a giant 🖕🏼 to ZCL and ZEC code that broke it from working for KMD

[03-Oct-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`release the code if there was a bounty `
I'll give you 2 PIRATE and 14 PIZZA to release so that I never have to hear about licensing a 237th generation clusterfuk stratum again....

[03-Oct-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@0x03 there you go 👆🏼

[03-Oct-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S.
`i don't believe in free work however sorry i'm poor`
While I respect the honesty of that sentiment, I wonder (personally) how to balance that going forward with it being the literal antithesis of the intent of the whole project to begin with

[03-Oct-18 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No one is "forcing" anyone to do anything

[03-Oct-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm merely saying 2 things:
1) If someone's excuse for not sharing work they did is somehow related to a license I added to a worthless alpha repo (that everyone who has touched it has done more than I did), then the excuse is bullshit.
2) imo, it's pretty shitty to build upon a repo that was wholly intended *for the community* to share *for free* and then talk "I don't do for free" (without free work by someone who had 0 financial gain and actually loses revenue by the existence of the repo, the repo never would have even existed)

[03-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Oct-18 12:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
actually sharing the code increases the value of the project.

[03-Oct-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
I just make everything MIT

[03-Oct-18 12:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and hence the holdings value in return.

`i think he deleted it over all this license stuff`
tbh, I deleted it (along with all of my repos) because it was b4 there was a verushash GPU miner and I was all in my feelz about CHIPS
Which means it's all @blackjok3r's fault :trollface:

sarcasm aside, since all the vavava about licensing and who did what for how many cookies, the ps will come with the new repo I'm working on and wtfever the least restrictive license is that I can attach to it when I push it

[03-Oct-18 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
None of it's from scratch; it's all under Matt Little's license
Because, NOMP

[03-Oct-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I always make everything MIT and then fill it with bugs :trollface:

The entire intent of the license change was to go back to what Matt had and to share shit as a community

_take a breath me hearty pirates_

Well, I can't go back in time 5y years and change his mind about how he licensed it, @grewalsatinder hasn't fixed WLC yet

is it only me that feels like this argument (and, hopefully, its resolution) brings more value to PIRATE than anything else so far? nothing like a bunch of devs arguing over code, without code you got nothing! 😃

[03-Oct-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[03-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, here's the goal:
To make the best project possible that can be shared with and worked on by the most amount of people and in the end have the most devastating effect on my revenue stream.....Pick a feken license that fits that and that's what it'll be licensed as

[03-Oct-18 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm sure if Microsoft releases all their Windows and Dev kits source code as full open source code, the Windows can become as good as Linux. Open source idea is that valuably good.
_ I don't argue on licensing. legal stuff is annoying_

[03-Oct-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i think gpl is still the right choice, it allows people to use the code how they wish, but if they a distributing forks, they should be licensing and sharing it it the same`
So, if that's the case, then how tha fek did the topic of license even come up?

[03-Oct-18 12:26 PM] ronyi#5719
i hate stupid debate. One importanthin, IF @webworker01 make fully buggy code, it does not help the community. Because he wrote a good code I voluntarily offered him half of the fee.  Everyone is ashamed of the one who gets trash from his hand or upload github or........ rather do not upload.  thank you all for your work

[03-Oct-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
GPL has the problem that corporations wont use it

[03-Oct-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ronyi There's nothing "stupid" about making the best pools that we can

[03-Oct-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and as long as the open source devs are publishing the codebase, we get the best of both worlds

[03-Oct-18 12:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_looking at my imaginary wrist watch_

[03-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically if a clandestine dev made a fork and private improvements, there is no way to know this even exists, let alone forcing them to publish their codebase

[03-Oct-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but GPL cant be for the entire project

[03-Oct-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so to get the codebase into corporations, it is MIT

[03-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
we assume the goodwill of the open source devs to publish when it benefits others

[03-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
at least it is in the blackhole and and it can resonate with code outside the blackhole and create some hawking radiation

[03-Oct-18 12:32 PM] house#8741
*electromagnetic radiation which, according to theory, should be emitted by a black hole. The radiation is due to the black hole capturing one of a particle-antiparticle pair created spontaneously near to the event horizon.*

[03-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but hawking was wrong!

[03-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
Unfortunately, Susskind's proposed solution is even more difficult, and almost impossible to envisage or explain in an understandable way. He suggests that, as an object falls into a black hole, a copy of the information that makes it up is sort of scrambled and smeared in two dimensions around the edge of the black hole. Furthermore, Susskind believes that a similar process occurs in the universe as a whole, which raises the rather alarming idea that what we think of as three-dimensional reality is in fact something like a holographic representation of a "real" reality, which is actually contained in two dimensions around the edge of the universe.

[03-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and if a dev is not contributing to the wider community, nothing can force him to anyway

[03-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
