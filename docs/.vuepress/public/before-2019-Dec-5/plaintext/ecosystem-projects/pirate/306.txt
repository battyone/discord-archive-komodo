We need to make sure to "play by the rules" even if it means blindly fudding other quality projects because of the size of our bags.

since my vape has no nicotine I think I will just start making my own juices from sources uses VG

[12-Nov-18 09:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Steep it well and look for good quality flavours, i had to go back to the retail juices cheap mixes killed my coils very fast

[12-Nov-18 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts seems like we need to somehow organize an attempted 51% attack to bring people to our side. It would be great to convert Mr. Monero himself.

[12-Nov-18 09:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Might just quit vaping soon though. It's mostly unnecessarily pricey and involved.

[12-Nov-18 09:44 PM] mrlynch#5735

[12-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Noooo

[12-Nov-18 09:44 PM] mrlynch#5735

[12-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Oszy#5734
I gave up real smoking but couldn't give up nicotine yet

[12-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Oszy#5734

[12-Nov-18 09:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
where i live it isn't and i don't trust the vape shops... they're putting detergent flavouring chemicals in the liquid for all i care

start running, or swimming

[12-Nov-18 09:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Pretty sure people mix trash chemicals into vape juice anyway.

[12-Nov-18 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's effort and requires discipline... running ONCE doesn't count

if you're running tesla K series (Kepler core) that doesn't play well with dstm

[12-Nov-18 11:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
as in you need at least a Maxwell
