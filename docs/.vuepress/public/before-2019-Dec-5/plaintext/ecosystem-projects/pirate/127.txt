Eh the way I see it it's just a matter of a year until that's the case

[06-Oct-18 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah if someone takes my offer up of 2095 @ 0.22 KMD mine will finally be sheilded, as I need to send to Z to sell that exaact amount.

[06-Oct-18 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
leaving only Rpirate address the last one in standoff refusing to sheild.

@Deleted User why do you keep saying cowboy is a mod? he isnt. stating a wish that a duel was still a thing is a bit of a distance from a threat of physical violence. in a duel both parties consent to it and it is done according to strict rules. It is like saying "I wish we could go 10 rounds in a boxing match" I dont know what your problem is and why you are trying to stir up so much troubles. please just be calm

[06-Oct-18 05:41 AM] ph03nix#3115

For the love of all that is crypto, will someone with more clout than me please pressure nh into accepting at least one other coin besides BTC?

it's a permission setting for "ecosystem developers"

[06-Oct-18 05:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it wasn't about truth or not. Not sure what (if any) got deleted in this channel, but he pruned the rant and ensuing clutter in OTC

[06-Oct-18 05:49 AM] ph03nix#3115
it's about abusing power

[06-Oct-18 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, in OTC wasn't and if you scroll up it was agreed that shit should be in there

[06-Oct-18 05:50 AM] ph03nix#3115
yeah ok /s

I deleted the conversation that clogged up the channel, for that I am sorry. I wont be deleting anything else. polycryptoblock messaged me and I said I would just leave things as they are from here on out.

[06-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I will sell out of what I mine and be done with this childish shit. lol

`Pirate Chain
54 subscribers`
How dafuq does a youtube chan with 0 vids have any subs, much less 54?

[06-Oct-18 06:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
At this time not much has been done so it's pretty much all upside the way I see it.  I have groups on fb that I can organize giveaways for  to get people familiar with it and once exchange website and merchant integration tools happen  it's pretty much all about getting users after that point

[06-Oct-18 06:00 AM] Dr Debt#0891

So, it seems that nh will only allow fixed to be 1/3 of available now 😦

[06-Oct-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So get more accounts :trollface:

[06-Oct-18 06:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not accounts, whatever the available amount of hash they have, 2/3 of it is for standard orders and 1/3 is for fixed

one more question....is this cpu mineable only?

[06-Oct-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, more like asic only, but a GPU might get some traction in a pool

[06-Oct-18 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL how sad is it that I'm actually thinking about pointing my GPUs at someone else's pool?
