Pretty freaking weird since I told James I wouldn't switch careers and since day one I have had the best time doing this.

I had a dmt trip where I experienced the singularity, I died and was reborn on the blockchain. I’m pretty sure if anyone is gonna figure out how to do it, it will be these guys.

is OTC the only exchange with PIRATE listed?

[11-Oct-18 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes but

[11-Oct-18 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OTC isn't an exchange, so PIRATE isn't listed there either

[11-Oct-18 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

sry, as you can tell im a noob,

[11-Oct-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OTC stands for "over the counter" aka "direct person to person trading"

Should I make this into a paperwallet design option?   With the Public key on the bottom outside and the private key on the bottom inside. ?

let me spam one last time for today... please, everybody currently mining on https://pirate.komodopool.xyz/ - switch to the new pool infrastructure at https://arrr.pool-mining.xyz/ - just change your miner stratum host to `stratum.arrr.pool-mining.xyz` (ports are the same, `8888` for low diff and `18888` for hi-diff/nh). the majority of the hashrate is already on the new pool, there is only about 1MSol left on the old one. thank you for your attention.

Which pool will you recommend ? pirate.pool io or pirate.komodopool?

[11-Oct-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Whichever has the lower total hashrate

[11-Oct-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you pick based on that, it maintains the illusion that pools control the blockchain and you're doing your part to maintain balance :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Zach#9973
Also not pirate.komodo, that one is going away

[11-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Zach#9973
It’s being replaced by arrr.pool-mining.xyz or something like that
