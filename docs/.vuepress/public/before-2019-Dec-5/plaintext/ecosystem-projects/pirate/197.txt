"no longer a majority" as it has 55Msol against current nethash of 82

[20-Oct-18 04:43 PM] KOSIUS#0001
people who mine pirate, I have a couple of questions, DM me pretty please

[20-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Dr Debt#0891
lol just make all payments to me directly 😄

[20-Oct-18 04:44 PM] bishop#9773
do it

[20-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Oh i see your issue is lying with the people only mining a few an hour and having to make small payments to everyone

[20-Oct-18 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A batched z tx outputs is limited to 54

[20-Oct-18 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And that takes a long time to process

[20-Oct-18 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
ANd with 300 miners..

[20-Oct-18 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He's not able to get out all the payments on all the blocks that are being mined...

[20-Oct-18 04:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Unless he spends 10K on new servers and noone is asking him to do that.... for a freeservice he is providing. 

I WAS THE ONE who asked him to raise his pool fee and the payout helps by reducing the number of miners able to get paid every payment cycle.

[20-Oct-18 04:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As example... I am pretty sure I broke @sclear bot server sending a Soak to 500 people. 😛

[20-Oct-18 04:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It was sent at 4 AM and it's 10 and strill not done 😃

[20-Oct-18 04:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If web sent 300 payments at 4 am they probably would still be wrapping up? +-

[20-Oct-18 04:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So that's the challenge.   

For now, the simple answer is go to one of the other two pools available.

[20-Oct-18 04:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a friend I have asked to setup a third.

[20-Oct-18 04:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Web will likely drop his fee and payouts as it makes sense.   He's not trying to gouge anyone.

[20-Oct-18 04:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's true, howver small it may be.

[20-Oct-18 05:00 PM] Zach#9973
small miners wont get paid for a while, which may make them swap pools

[20-Oct-18 05:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A multi Pronged approach.

[20-Oct-18 05:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
(Small miners, if you switch, your payout will get sent when he lowers the pool payout min again).

[20-Oct-18 05:00 PM] Zach#9973
like a trident? that could be a pirate weapon

[20-Oct-18 05:03 PM] ronyi#5719
@webworker01 i give one 😄

[20-Oct-18 05:05 PM] figgy132#7531

To reply to @FishyGuts ... JawARRR will hopefully be ready for testing phase before going live. Will need few testers when I ll get the latest parts secured

[20-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Zach#9973
^ is that a mining pool?

[20-Oct-18 05:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Jawarrr is mutha effin community effort and coming together.   DWY you’re the man!   You will have to charge other coins for that service when you are done.

`std::bad_alloc is the type of the object thrown as exceptions by the allocation functions to report failure to allocate storage.`

'no disk space left' is probably a good guess

[20-Oct-18 05:43 PM] 0x03#8822
@Llama at least you're not asking for nethash of a coin this time.

[20-Oct-18 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn t think avout charging or fee yet tbh i just want to handle hardware cost atm. It works with any kmd assetchain natively

[20-Oct-18 05:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
ARRR / KMDICE / KMD trades have already been done without issues.

[20-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
My problem won t be until I integrate btc and other coins

[20-Oct-18 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Because it’s under NDA @Zach

[20-Oct-18 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
But integrating well known ones can attract people on kmd ecosystem so I believe we should have at least btc/eth/zec

[20-Oct-18 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will test swaps in 1h approx during 1h. Then i ll spend the night improving and adding cancellation logic on

any plan for pirate lightwallet (if possible ofcourse) ?

[20-Oct-18 06:17 PM] plazma#1625
i think that's after sapling.....

[20-Oct-18 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Llama that means "ye ain't got any more memory left"

[20-Oct-18 06:20 PM] Llama#1330
ok

[20-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Llama#1330
Was asking for a friend. @stephenleeholmes118

[20-Oct-18 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Voight light wallets and shielded transactions don't mix, but some features in Sapling may make it possible in the future

[20-Oct-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 are you CPU limited on the server that does z_sendmany's that do payouts? you could run N pirate nodes on the machine, and then process N*54 payouts at a time, in theory. A short term solution to avoid buying more servers.

[20-Oct-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
are you doing z_getoperationresult?

[20-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it would be manageable to send one zdestination at a time?

[20-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then it wont ever get too big or take too long and might end up being faster than batching

[20-Oct-18 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
all depends on exact zutxos

[20-Oct-18 07:04 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
@Oszy 8gb (7.89 th usable)

[20-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Oszy#5734
Yes that's the total, but how much exactly is in use at the time of sending
