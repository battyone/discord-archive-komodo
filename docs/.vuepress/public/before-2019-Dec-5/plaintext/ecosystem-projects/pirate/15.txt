Difficulty of KMD and PIRATES are totally independent, as they are different chains

[03-Sep-18 08:08 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ok..

[03-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
what I meant by diff on Komodo is weird is that it's higher than a chain with the same amount of hashrate would be

[03-Sep-18 08:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
You spot the last 5-6 posts, then you can have an idea of why it is so complicated to explain what komodo is to someone 😂  (even if the guy is around cryptos for a looong time)

[03-Sep-18 08:13 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Love this sequence 😍

[03-Sep-18 08:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
OK, so how does 1,5m vs 25m PIRATE vs KMD difficulty translate to hashrate?

[03-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
75% of KMD's "hashrate" is notary nodes easy mining

[03-Sep-18 08:23 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Difficulty adjustment is related to the last blocks mined times, it differs from many coins but are the same for all ac's and are not directly corellated with hashrate (especially with a early chain with so much fluctuations in hashrate)

[03-Sep-18 08:24 PM] metaphilibert#0926
All this to say pirate has is own hashrate

[03-Sep-18 08:24 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Independent of KMD

[03-Sep-18 08:26 PM] scubapanda#2485
I'm trying to understand the amount of ASIC power (lets say S9 mini) needed for 1.5m diff with PIRATE vs 25m diff in KOMODO. Just curious so I could understand bigger picture.

[03-Sep-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I think it is not exactly linear

[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
say about 4x difference in hashrate

[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] metaphilibert#0926
And maybe it is time to make the first pool alive
@webworker01 as soon as in place I'll direct some few power (1.4kh) even if difficulty is the same as now, I prefer to get a few per day than to rely on "solo mining"

[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
@scubapanda once you see that blocks are coming in about once per minute, look at `getmininginfo` for the network hashrate

[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
it will be a rough estimate, but it's somewhat accurate

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] scubapanda#2485
Thanks! So with networkhashps:396181 we have about 40 x S9 minis working at PIRATE?

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would be pretty accurate

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
wow, 40 minis on pirate

{Reactions}
😱 

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
no, it's very inaccurate when blocks aren't consistently 1 minute apart

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
well if they are overclocked,then it would be 25

[03-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
it's higher right now

[03-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
blocks coming in shorter than 1 minute on average

[03-Sep-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so the hashrate is actually higher!

[03-Sep-18 08:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 i am willing to help with zaddr payouts, if you want any

[03-Sep-18 08:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
I heard a tortured soul with initials CG likes to point loads of z9's against small chains and then leave them stuck, just for funzies

[03-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
I think there may be a bug in how komodod limits coinbase txs. Need to do some more testing, but it *seems* like if you claim more than 256 in the coinbase, it can't have multiple outputs

[03-Sep-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
there are indeed some restrictions with coinbases having lots of outputs

[03-Sep-18 08:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 z_sendmany is async, as you probably know, but also, z_sendmany locks some notes (the zaddr equiv of utxos)

[03-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
even with 2 outputs it was rejecting blocks for me

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 my guess is some operation of yours is trying to use notes that being used by z_sendmany, and are locked/etc

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
the reason I think that is because I was sending t -> t transactions with 0 coin output then trying to claim the inputs in the coinbase

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
for pools you need to fiddle with the txfees

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
basically you need to assume txfees are zero if making multiple coinbase vouts

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
it worked with single output coinbase txs, but if I added a second, it rejects the blocks

[03-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
exactly what I'm saying

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it is technically a bug, but changing it would require hardforking

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
subtract out the txfees

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
then it will work

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds better to call it a feature

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 z_shieldcoinbase and z_mergetoaddress do the same stuff

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
just pretend the txfees are 0, ie. that there is only blockreward

[03-Sep-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
then it should work to allocate the coinbase across vouts

[03-Sep-18 08:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 this stuff doesn't matter much with taddrs, stuff is so fast. but with zaddrs, many operations run into locks from other slow operations

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-Sep-18 08:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
do they have a choice to take the fees?

[03-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Alright#0419
yes, burned

{Reactions}
🔥 

[03-Sep-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, thus technically a bug

[03-Sep-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry

[03-Sep-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, shared pools need to burn the txfees if they want to do coinbase allocated to many vouts

[03-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
burn the fees and call it a day 😛

[03-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
miningspeed claimed exactly 3 KMD in each block they mined for like 6 months 😂

[03-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
probably lost a couple thousand in unclaimed rewards

[03-Sep-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if they got an unclaimed interest block, could have been more

[03-Sep-18 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
make sure the sum doesnt go above blockreward

wtb 500kmd worth of PIRATE, pm best offers

[04-Sep-18 07:04 AM] jorian#4555
WTS 1 PIRATE for 500 KMD arr

[04-Sep-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[04-Sep-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
someone is trying to mine a huge bag, my single mini is no longer getting 50% ofthe blocks.

[04-Sep-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might even switch it to KMD until the rental runs out 😦 I already have a fair few pirate.

[04-Sep-18 08:32 AM] jorian#4555
Someone sees potential

[04-Sep-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure I have mini I can point at it if you like?

[04-Sep-18 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
finding a decent amount of blocks at least, not like last few days, but still a few each hour

[04-Sep-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
stopped mining. i'll start again after about 10 days.

[04-Sep-18 11:14 AM] SHossain#0007
and, with the current hashrate my 2 minis weren't getting enough blocks

[04-Sep-18 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007
pool looks nice @webworker01. Great job 👍🏽

[04-Sep-18 11:51 AM] SHossain#0007
please send me your z address to get the bounty of 10,000 PIRATE for being the first public PIRATE pool 😃

[04-Sep-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like it was a lot of work, and its one CPU heavy pool

[04-Sep-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I think webworker should get all of the bounty and 1000 KMD aswell.

[04-Sep-18 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[04-Sep-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then he can share the pool code so more of us can run it 😄

[04-Sep-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, I prefer to mine to my T address so i am on top of the rich list tbh :trollface:

[04-Sep-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I will leave my hash o your pool for a day to amke sure its stable.

[04-Sep-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I lost my top spot 😦

[04-Sep-18 06:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes whenever the fool with NH on it runs out of moey we cna all  put CPU miner on your pool LOL

[04-Sep-18 07:20 PM] Alright#0419
pool is up?

[04-Sep-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTT ANN is blaming of being unfair. What did I do wrong???

[04-Sep-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can’t reply properly from mobile.

[04-Sep-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you didnt take out a superbowl ad to let everybody to know to start mining when it was easy

[04-Sep-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but they do have a point about you saying its a test chain, while buying

[04-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
why not to remove/edit the post that says is for testing only

[04-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
a snapshot is not possible...

[04-Sep-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe make some PIRATE available at your cost to allow people that missed out to participate

I did not launch PIRATE Assetchain. 
I am not a developer of PIRATE Assetchain.
I do not advise anyone anything about PIRATE Assetchain.
Don’t blame me for anything regarding it.

[04-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that was fast

[04-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
is there 100,000+ of PIRATE that can be sold?

[04-Sep-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the current mining cost?

[04-Sep-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if 100,000+ can be made available at current mining cost, I suggest to offer than to the BCT peoples

[04-Sep-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
no more than 5% to any single person
