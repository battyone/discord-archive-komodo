Therefore can't pull the api so it's off the list for now.

[14-Nov-18 07:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
If the pool op can check and get back to me that would be great

[14-Nov-18 07:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just a heads up all... I will be AFK-ish for the next 36 hours +-   May hop on a little tonight.   
Important family things to do today and tomorrow üòÉ

Enjoy the time off cap'n

question...what stopping zen from fully copying komodo/pirate ?  They are copying all the best features and incorporating them?  Node system, DPow, sidechains ect...will this come down to komodo vs zen adoption by users or is there something proprietary about pirate that they can't copy...if everything is opensource whats to stop them from just copying the best features from other coins?  Or from KMD doing the same?

[14-Nov-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
they cant copy all the devs and notary nodes

[14-Nov-18 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
copycat coins are followers and not innovators

[14-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
right...so kmd wins there...is that the key?  I'm planning on hodling arrr but frustrating to see others just blatantly copy ideas and give them different names

[14-Nov-18 08:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
hopefully btc will crash enough to flush all the crap away

[14-Nov-18 08:25 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
yes but sometimes the early adopters that don't take the market will sucumb to marketing machines...a la...myspace to facebook....seems some proprietary innovation will be needed to stop the copycating

[14-Nov-18 08:26 PM] Flexatron#8809
Chill

[14-Nov-18 08:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
You worry too much. Copy cats are sloppy. Can't think for themselves, make mistakes & die

[14-Nov-18 08:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
Do you know the name of any copycat killer?

[14-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC!

[14-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it totally dominates BTC now, right?

[14-Nov-18 08:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
Lol

[14-Nov-18 08:28 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
I love open source and I'm a dev...but this can be quite frustrating...well I'm just gonna hodl and see where the ride takes us...it would be super cool to see a proprietary KMD feature like DAG or something tied to notary nodes that puts a stop to the copying...it seems until that happens we all just float along the bottom until a winner emerges

[14-Nov-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the notary nodes notarizing to BTC cant be copied at the source level

[14-Nov-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the BTC needs to be spent

[14-Nov-18 08:30 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
@mrlynch i do worry to much üòÉ  thats the job of every captain (captain_morgan for everyone!)   Sucks to have hard innovative work copied and renamed by some other turdburglar

[14-Nov-18 08:32 PM] jansako#3330
You do realize that without 'creative copying,' KMD as we know it would not be here either... ZCash anyone?

[14-Nov-18 08:33 PM] jansako#3330
I am sure on day one of the fork they were much closer than they are now

[14-Nov-18 08:34 PM] jansako#3330
who knows where other forks will be in a few years

[14-Nov-18 08:35 PM] HellBlazeSRB#6211
damn, kmd tanked... then again everything tanked but still...

[14-Nov-18 08:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
You do know that without zero knowledge math work going for 40 years there would be no zcash right? And you do know that without fire being discovered there would've been no people to build zcash right?

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] jansako#3330
indeed üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
Kmd brought a lot of innovation to the table

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] jansako#3330
I take your idea and make is a basis of mine

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] jansako#3330
build on it

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] jansako#3330
or not, if my idea is a dead end

[14-Nov-18 08:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
1 of the most important features that springs to mind is dPoW

[14-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
yes  you are right @jansako ...this is the greatness of opensource..we all work and we all share....bringing open transparent development and currency together is a dichotomy...even Linux started to splinter when $ came into the mix

[14-Nov-18 08:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
A captain's job is to lead ... pirates & sailors into battle

[14-Nov-18 08:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
üòú

[14-Nov-18 08:38 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
right thats what I'm saying...kmd was/is so far ahead...and possibly a marketing machine overtakes it eventually ...all they have to do is continue to 'build' on others ideas.

[14-Nov-18 08:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have you ever considered that some things are not copies, but different implementations of certain concepts?

[14-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
and the originators of the innovation no longer fiscally benefit...the marketing machine does...ok...enough sorry to start this crap.....anyway...keep up the marketing efforts and innovations...great job so far and thanks to all for pirate!!!  ARRR

[14-Nov-18 08:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
I see you're all about the money. I'm all about solving problems

[14-Nov-18 08:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
Once you solve the problem, money will follow

[14-Nov-18 08:42 PM] jansako#3330
@mrlynch that would depends on point of view. nobody can know your real motivations, only you

[14-Nov-18 08:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
If money doesn't follow then you're not really solving a problem

[14-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
yes I agree mrlynch...open source is good...I work on ipfs and 3 other open source projects...wait wait...all about the money?  I think devs should be paid for their work...is that all about the $ or all about paying devs fairly for their work?

[14-Nov-18 08:43 PM] jansako#3330
youwoudl need to solve a problem that someone else is willing to pay money for in the first place üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 08:43 PM] jansako#3330
anyhow, way off topic...

[14-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
when a company works the sh$t out of a  dev to produce a product and makes billions and that dev dies in a shack...is that all about the money?

[14-Nov-18 08:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
Did you know you had a problem when smartphones came about? I was doing just fine with my fliphone :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 08:43 PM] jansako#3330
why do you think I have a smartphone?

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
Why work for such a company in the first place?

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
I don't. It was just an example

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] jansako#3330
For sure.

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
People didn't need cars when they had healthy horses right?

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] jansako#3330
people did not, armies did

[14-Nov-18 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
I just love philosophy, that's all üòÅ

[14-Nov-18 08:45 PM] jansako#3330
me too, can;t you tell üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Flexatron#8809
Maslow's hierarchy of needs

[14-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have a close look at an every day item that you take for granted and ask yourself "do i really NEED this?"

[14-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
No more examples as i see you're a "debater" :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
But we digress

[14-Nov-18 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
We were talking tech üòÅ

[14-Nov-18 08:47 PM] jansako#3330
(I need an emoji that bows)

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
Lol

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
:rum: will do just fine

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] jansako#3330
üôá  üèπ

[14-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
@mrlynch well to say devs should only solve problems and not be about $ is somehow wrong, seems to me to be just missing something imo...so developers should just leave the $ to those marketing and sales people?  I would like to see a token for developers like we have tokens for musicians.....open source may be being twisted into another method of vacuuming up ideas without recompense

[14-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
sounds like sharecropping....."don't worry your pretty little head about the finances...you just pick that cotton...no need to read or write....we'll tell you how much you made"

[14-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
your focus should be on solving the problem of picking that cotton..the money will follow

[14-Nov-18 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
NO

[14-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
yea right

[14-Nov-18 08:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
But if you're working on a billion $ project i'm sure you can come up with something that solves a problem and MONEY follows

[14-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
just keep picking...the money will follow...I promise

[14-Nov-18 08:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
We're digressing again.

[14-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
üòÉ no worries...I'm pretty intense about the $ for devs...but I fully agree that open source is key to progress

[14-Nov-18 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
If you're a good dev, here's a good idea

[14-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
Im not a good dev...lol...I'm a hack

[14-Nov-18 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
Build a security solution that integrates machine learning

[14-Nov-18 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
Happy to share my code with you :D

[14-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
hmm...supervised or unsupervised?  have training data?

[14-Nov-18 08:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Well, there it is :trollface:

[14-Nov-18 08:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Unsupervised

[14-Nov-18 08:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
Training data is wildly available. And you can generate it yourself as well ;)

[14-Nov-18 08:57 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
there are some algo improvements but to implement this you would need a huge compute from nodes i presume...also cassandra is to slow...and level db to light

[14-Nov-18 08:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
Have you heard of tesla's?

[14-Nov-18 09:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
They're doing a great job

[14-Nov-18 09:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
I have a sensor at work that's the size of a microserver. Custom built for the purpose

[14-Nov-18 09:01 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
interesting...I'd be overcommitting with other projects...but if you don't mind I'd like to follow up..have to go put out a fire...in general I think that blockchain/ML goes to DAG/AI in our lifetime so I think you are on the right track...I hope your work doesn't get vacuumed into AmazonChain üò¶

[14-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
