[07-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Mylo#8306
see if i can lure one or two in.   they do caricatures and blender stuff the two main buddies.

@fmproductions I currently use a super hybrid character controller in Twilight Punkster Galaxy, that won't fly for demo's (Physics, Ragdoll, IK and 20 layers using masks)

[07-Mar-19 01:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but these were easy peasy

In Twilight Punkster, inverse kinematics are part of the combat system, specifically for combat: blocking reflexes and countering  (3/3)

hitboxes, based on a C# async StreetFighter 2 engine I made for a jam

I would probably prefer the approach of a 2,5d  game approach where the centers of the players make the plane the cam look on in an normal angle.

[07-Mar-19 01:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Wouldn't that be crap, as you will need to constantly lerp?

[07-Mar-19 01:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
because when you fight, and give an uppercut, the character flies up

[07-Mar-19 01:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the only way to make that look good is to prep a bounding box with a calculated center and offset that with the camera angle

[07-Mar-19 02:00 PM] fmproductions#2904
sure, but cam movement is important no matter the game, so you might not be spared from that. 

street fighter has incredibly easy abstracted hitboxes, or better said: hit-rectangles, all manually set, 
to have a more automated approach, instead of manually crafting the hitbox animations, we can just place hitboxes on the separate body parts

[07-Mar-19 02:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you probably have to fuck with easing curves just to make the camera move smoothly to prevent keyboard barfing

[07-Mar-19 02:00 PM] fmproductions#2904
one of the modern mortal combats does it like that

[07-Mar-19 02:00 PM] fmproductions#2904
probably

[07-Mar-19 02:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions yes, I do that already, even have a script for colliders that are attached per transform

[07-Mar-19 02:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(I'm lazy, I know)

[07-Mar-19 02:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh wait

[07-Mar-19 02:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Has been a while, so time for an update storm. So, what's new? A lot! Like hair that is not only so much better, but moves responsive to physics like movements but also in windy areas. Also, a full rewrite of inverse kinematics and foot placement.

Dana's beloved scooter has been upgraded to a low top speed vehicle with superior handling. Vehicles are using a similar mechanic like mounts have in fantasy RPG. The scooter can be upgraded too.

can do this with items too

[07-Mar-19 02:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I use it for factory

[07-Mar-19 02:03 PM] fmproductions#2904
neat stuff! 

with that approach, we could also say that hits that specifically go to the head deal a little bit more damage.

*is lurking translating game dev talk*

[07-Mar-19 02:04 PM] fmproductions#2904
camera angle would have a game design indication too though, one of the advantages of the side angle is that you can focus on movement in 2 axis. You could do that with isometric too, if you say that characters are not able to jump of course

[07-Mar-19 02:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
of course they can jump

I think it is most likely well received, this is exciting to have here!

[07-Mar-19 02:07 PM] fmproductions#2904
nice

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions ok, probably gonna do the docs in markup, not sure what the komodo team uses standard

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
wow, this channel has a lot of interesting talk going on. Keep it up, folks

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they are gonna rebrand things, so probably should avoid working too much on that

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] fmproductions#2904
so I just discovered that we can't post images here. was just about to show the hitboxes attached to body parts approach.

[07-Mar-19 02:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and we're not getting the rebrand stuff, so basically we have to keep it fugly

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yeah, I noticed

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there is a hack though

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just drop it in my DM, click it, open original and paste the link

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
pastebin, ibb, any link really.

[07-Mar-19 02:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that works

- the rock paper scissors of fighting games

[07-Mar-19 02:14 PM] fmproductions#2904
actually it should be
grab -> block -> attack -> grab

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that actually will make things worse

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
too bad we dont have a funding box for that crap

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hah

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we make the demos with blocks

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[07-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
block people

[07-Mar-19 02:17 PM] fmproductions#2904
so basically, the yellow sphere, which could also be abstracted as capsules for some body parts, follow the positions of the body parts. so you have all of the hitboxes that will register damage moving automatically, without manually doing them for animations

[07-Mar-19 02:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
those hairphysics suck

[07-Mar-19 02:18 PM] fmproductions#2904
they sure do

[07-Mar-19 02:18 PM] fmproductions#2904
and the green box is calculated from the bounds of the hitboxes, not necessary if it is only a game with 2 players, but if you have more than that, it is an easy performance improvement for collision detection.

[07-Mar-19 02:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

is hair physics

[07-Mar-19 02:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
on the GPU

[07-Mar-19 02:21 PM] fmproductions#2904
perfect for performance.

[07-Mar-19 02:22 PM] fmproductions#2904
or rather, perfect as a mix of dynamic animation and performance

[07-Mar-19 02:22 PM] fmproductions#2904
it looks really nice. in a lot of fighting games, those things are just preanimated though, at least in the older ones

[07-Mar-19 02:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no this is dynamic

[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
is half rigged, half shader, flavored trails

[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
regarding hit boxes, you need them to be dynamically scale based on the animation event

[07-Mar-19 02:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
like a dragonpunch has a massive force build up and should defy the physics engine for the opponent player

[07-Mar-19 02:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically inverse normal force times 10K but over multiple frames

[07-Mar-19 02:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
your fighting game

[07-Mar-19 02:26 PM] fmproductions#2904
I have seen someone animating smear frames into a 3d fighting game, quite interesting. 
but if you use the animation to exaggerate the sizes for let's say the fists for certain moves, that needs to be considered for the hitboxes too ofc.

[07-Mar-19 02:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
depends on the crazy move

[07-Mar-19 02:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you don't want that for every move

[07-Mar-19 02:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
in fact, by default they are tiny

[07-Mar-19 02:28 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but based on the type, mid-attack you can then decide to switch to projectile or capsule
