if the preview works, the final game will also work so 2 down, just 1 to go

[10-Mar-19 11:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL pray to the coingods, just hitting on the build button for x86_64 for Linux

[10-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar do you know an example of a game that got backed with a dICO?

[10-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
or just an app?

[10-Mar-19 11:54 AM] Meyse#0952
no examples, but it should work. but only when a game works with coins and they have actual value. Its just crowdfunding, and you get GAMECOIN for your support

[10-Mar-19 11:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse so pretty much fire up komodod, create stuff and DPoW that baby and integrate coins. Mhm..

[10-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Meyse#0952
yes

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Meyse#0952
create some coins, and sell those coins for btc/kmd to fund your game development

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
DPoW costs like 350 KMD right?

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Meyse#0952
yeah

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and to sell these coins, probably need that DEX thingie too right?

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Meyse#0952
no it happens peer2peer with a dico app

[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, where is the bloody tutorial for dICO's xD

[10-Mar-19 12:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[10-Mar-19 12:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
awesome - gimme a holla here if it "works"

[10-Mar-19 12:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
if that preview works, its pretty much home free, because most logic in that is what we need

[10-Mar-19 12:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
secret, it already has the bridge in it, but it isn't called

[10-Mar-19 12:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, it has ransomware that locks your machine and demands furry porn.

[10-Mar-19 12:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[10-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hah, wait until next build

[10-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I already have the different units in place, but I want the buildings and stuff to be finished too

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Haha, ok waitng üòÉ Going for dinner - maybe will generate some RTS <-> Blockchain ideas ü§û

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
‚ù§ enjoy dinner

[10-Mar-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! üëç

[10-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, so here is my basic new story line(while Unity imports)

[10-Mar-19 12:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Good morning BTW. I‚Äôm here for what you need.  

If you need assets let me know.  I‚Äôll send you funds or disposable CCs. 
@TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 12:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you were an orc slave captured by the evil elves to be sent to a far away continent, but caused by a shipwreck, you ended up on unclaimed territory. All you could salvage was a barrel, and little tool. So you made a fire. (you get randomly spawned on the map)

[10-Mar-19 12:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you now must gather resources: wood, stone and meat. So you must get out there and explore. However, you can't just grind, because your barrel will only hold up that much. So you need buildings/constructs to make your life easier.

[10-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- on the map there are possibly other (up to 3) orcs, but since they aren't part of your clan, and if they are - there is no way to verify - its all about survival; thus you treat them as enemies. There are only so many resources on that map. As long as you maintain ownership of that map, you will get resources over time in the next expansion of your territory.

[10-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- sooner or later you will be able to research, to create better units, but they will be capped to a certain level. However, you can try to sacrifice 2 units, to create a new one, which *might* have better statistics.

[10-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you can capture wolves for meat or in exchange for meat keep them in a wolves den, so you can have calvary like units.

[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- once you are killed as you will be permanently dead. Like protecting the king in chess. Every victory will grant you a reputation point, which increases your leadership skill, that allows to give a special bonus to a certain unit. You can pick between "Ruler" (buff your workers), "Overlord" (buff your combatants) and "Holy" (buff your science and research)

[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
To me, that sounds like a fun game to play.

[10-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Meyse#0952
yes yes yes

[10-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Meyse#0952
you can make a blockchained leaderboard

[10-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts awesome, I'll keep it in mind. Disposables might work because that would be easier to purchase directly to my Unity environment, probably good to get some other races, maybe some buildings/animals.

[10-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse please, elaborate in detail

[10-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Where to store, how to store and how to prevent malicious behaviour

[10-Mar-19 01:07 PM] Meyse#0952
oh fuck you want me to do work

[10-Mar-19 01:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now work, you lazy man

[10-Mar-19 01:07 PM] Meyse#0952
ohhh

[10-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
a Fiverr fee for AAA quality and 1920 work ethic!

[10-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Meyse#0952
``Every victory will grant you a reputation point, which increases your leadership skill, that allows to give a special bonus to a certain unit. You can pick between "Ruler" (buff your workers), "Overlord" (buff your combatants) and "Holy" (buff your science and research)``
every player should have a pubkey right? For every player you can store Ruler points, Overlord points, Holy points and the reputation points. When you die you start again from scratch (if you exit, your stuff will be saved). You can make an overview, a leaderboard, who has most points etc. If you saved and want to continue to play with your epic "army" or "city", you can even get matched with people who have same points as you

[10-Mar-19 01:15 PM] Meyse#0952
``Where to store, how to store and how to prevent malicious behaviour``
these questions i dont really know how to answer

[10-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nice nice nice

[10-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but that sounds like an idea to cultivate

[10-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Meyse#0952
yes, a player would want to be nr1 on the leaderboard. and even if you died, youre still on the leaderboard. so it would be an incentive to keep on playing i think

[10-Mar-19 01:23 PM] Meyse#0952
10 KMD spent wisely ;D

[10-Mar-19 01:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[10-Mar-19 01:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
together we are strong

[10-Mar-19 01:24 PM] Meyse#0952
no money no honey though

[10-Mar-19 01:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Kings can be NFTs

[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, that would be super easy

[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
my first integration with 6AM and Unity was with Token

[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I know that baby by heart

[10-Mar-19 01:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Where to store? 
On the blockchain in a private key/public key combo.

[10-Mar-19 01:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, I meant a little bit more technically, but as token that should fly

[10-Mar-19 01:37 PM] Meyse#0952
OOHH yes you can sell your king with your epic stats, for all those lamos who dont want to grind but still want to call themselves the best

[10-Mar-19 01:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol

[10-Mar-19 01:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sell your king xD

[10-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Meyse#0952
i would sell my king for some sweet komodo

[10-Mar-19 01:38 PM] Meyse#0952
or GAMECOIN and exchange GAMECOIN for komodo

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Meyse#0952
yes

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I like it

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sell the king!

[10-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
SELL THE KING

[10-Mar-19 01:40 PM] Meyse#0952
economy of kings, leaderboard attached to pubkeys, kings attached to pubkeys

[10-Mar-19 01:40 PM] Meyse#0952
its gonna be epic

[10-Mar-19 01:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably need to create a UI to make your king look super epic as you progress

[10-Mar-19 01:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
like a goku aura

[10-Mar-19 01:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Crowns with jewels

[10-Mar-19 01:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
remember resident evil 4

[10-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh definitely have a way to tell if a king has been sold or created. There will likely be a market for old school kings and definitely a reputation built on "my king is built not bought"

[10-Mar-19 01:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
where you find like jewelry and you can forge them into one

[10-Mar-19 01:43 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar history, gotcha!

[10-Mar-19 01:43 PM] Regnar#6164
Should be on the chain anyway :P

[10-Mar-19 01:43 PM] Meyse#0952
just put everything on the chain and then let us pick and choose
