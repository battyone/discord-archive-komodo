Enjin looks strong in Blockchain Gaming

[21-Mar-19 06:12 PM] Paul#0981
I hope so, I just bought Kmd. 😂🕺🏻

@Paul - This here is exactly what I was talking about with to @TwilightPunkster K64 a few weeks ago, and was my ultimate discovery goal with paying him to do WARCHAIN.

@Strob and I were discussing this in February.  
It just took the right person to find to make it happen, and I think @Meyse finding and bringing in @TwilightPunkster K64 at that meetup one day was the critical catalyst.  

He is the proverbial Rats tail to Komodo as it was to Final Fantasy I.

Hahaha, its funny that just some weeks ago I got in a meetup with @Meyse and now we have offices next to each other, working madness with magic.

[21-Mar-19 06:53 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Paul define "strong" ? They released one SDK for Unity that has barely been changed since last year. Bunch of games made by only self-funded indies that aren't even close to live playable or tested massively yet, with 100% vendor lock. And you still need Ethereum to transfer your ENJ from your wallet, so you still need to keep that secure. Also, they partnered AND locked themselves with Unity. Which is great, BUT... Unity isn't the only game engine around. Let's be honest, I love Unity, but its only secondary in performance compared to Unreal. That's just the bare fucking truth. Now, let's not mention all other engines, or even custom 3D engines. Oh, well. Enjin had the financial backing of kadzillion dollars and took two years to create a wallet. A wallet. Yes. I think we can expect maybe a gem, maybe five gems in the giant mountain of turds.

In the realm of gaming and blockchain, I think Loom is the one to watch out for. But, we'll crush them.

@jl777c that's a great incentive for the community, probably any game is applicable. Are you going to sent in Rogue 😃

[21-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Paul#0981
@TwilightPunkster K64 I'm so excited about your work!  I only liked the graphics from the Enjin game.

[21-Mar-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont apply for grants, but someone else maybe should

Actually, I want to apply for a lot of grants (a lot of the exist). However, they come with a lot of paperwork. At this moment, @Meyse and I are focusing on Komodore64 which will be the beginning, which now is mostly done in Unity. I really would like to develop with Unreal too, and definitely will work out the SDK port towards it; as the grant applies to that. However, that would require me to get at least two experienced developers in Unreal Engine that spend their time for a month to create a concept that can apply for a 100-250K grant , who have to sit somewhere, consume beans and pizza, work with high end machines. So, unless if someone is batshit crazy enough to drop 30Ks, I'll think I just focus on the tasks at hand 😉 There are plenty game ideas, but developers that can keep up with our insane velocity, workflow and open communication is a hard task. Also, don't underestimate that a good demo takes real time and effort; of course a smaller project will apply, but my aim is never to go for second place, but passing the test first time.

[21-Mar-19 07:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We're batshit crazy around here, have you NOT figured that out yet?

[21-Mar-19 07:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Impossible is not in our dictionaries.

[21-Mar-19 07:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
7.77 KMD from each discord user would be more than enough to do what you're talking about.

Do we have that kind of fundraising power in us folks?

[21-Mar-19 07:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Ha, you know what

[21-Mar-19 07:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
fuck it, I'll apply anyway

[21-Mar-19 07:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bro, I never met you, spent hours on the phone and was throwing coin at you, remember.

I wasnt suggesting that a dev should apply

[21-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be silly

[21-Mar-19 07:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But you have what we need I think... you and those you know and can surround yourself with.

[21-Mar-19 07:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hey, I am right here, you can always take a jet. Leave the dogs at home though, expensive stuff.

@jl777c gonna need a Unreal SDK demo anyway

delegate as much as possible for any sidetracking applications

[21-Mar-19 07:28 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@jl777c couldn't agree more 😉

I wasted too much time in the dev-general channel today lol

[23-Mar-19 02:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Alrighty, so here goes. We made a boot screen, had some madness about setting up UI and UX for Komodore64, talked about games, games and more games. Also, some grant applications for Unreal games have been filed, so that's gonna be fun. I found a new 2D concept artist, the Unity SDK is being written out with video tutorials and such. Together with @Meyse we have a rollercoaster of ideas and things in the pipeline, @FishyGuts and @Mylo are strategizing some non-tech stuff, to make stuff work. So, since we got some serious things going, we both got a desk at The Hague Tech, a vibrant co-working environment, where magic is happening on the 4th floor. We are going to bring things to next level.

So, awake and alive, it has been a busy week. So, action plan is to recruit a 2D artist, secure some funds for that person to be onboard. Also working on the basic Komodore64 Virtual Console menu, which manages KPG's (Komodo Powered Games). Easy to use, turnkey and rock and roll.

This channel has inspired me to try and learn a bit more programming. Traditionally I only really do stats stuff (R, Python) but nothing really 'game friendly' got any recommendations for someone who is interested in building some little games on the side @TwilightPunkster K64 ?

[23-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Regnar#6164
Pygame seems pretty old and not sure about Phaser.js but there are some easy tutorials on it

[23-Mar-19 02:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[23-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Regnar#6164
lol doing codecademy for javascript right now...

[23-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Regnar#6164
doesn't seem too tricky or different from python

[23-Mar-19 02:44 PM] Regnar#6164
by that I mean it seems intuitive

[23-Mar-19 02:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
want to have solid good advice?

[23-Mar-19 02:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Learn Unreal or Unity (C++ or C#), its always uncomfortable to learn new things, but Unity is easy to learn and someone here happens to have a working SDK that could need a tester and better an adopter.

[23-Mar-19 02:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and C# is an easy language.

[23-Mar-19 02:57 PM] Regnar#6164
hmm good to know. I'll definitely look at that then
