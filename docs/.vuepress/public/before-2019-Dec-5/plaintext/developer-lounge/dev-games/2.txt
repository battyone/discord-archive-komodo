I see the potential, because it was so easy to earn money with flashgames 5 years ago...

[22-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Well I am more the man mind behind the general idea but I am pretty sure experienced guys like you could join us on this endeavour.

[22-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Seko#7408
All peoples are played flash. Then came the applications more and more...

[22-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We are planning to use in a second stage, Augemented Reality, Virtual Reality and AI

[22-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Seko#7408
That is the next step. Really big vision!!! üëçüèº

[22-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Our first step will be to build the platform on top of the Komodo Technology

[22-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Seko#7408
But realistic, I believe in that...

Using Atomic swaps, a decentralized exchange inside the platform, lighting network for gaming purposes and so forth.

Do you have a plan? When and how do you want to start?  How to finance?  Do you have developers and designers?

[22-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
I have a team already, you can see the website or the white paper. But the main reason to be here is to include Komodo members in our team.

[22-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We welcome anyone who wants to participate in this project.

@jl777c for something like rogue is the seed that determines path(same seed, same user input, same outcome) defined by the user?

[06-Feb-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[06-Feb-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
each rogue seed determines the exact game, so this is something that is based on future blockhash

In which language are games programmed on the blockchain?  Potentially also in HTML5?  I run HTML5 Games websites and I'm looking for a bridge to the blockchain.

[13-Feb-19 10:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Existing demonstrations are coded in C/C++ lanaguage, it's Crypto-Conditions code which is coded in C/C++.
So, it's not specifically what langauge is used for game(s).
Mix of languages is possible to code a crypto-conditions code, but it has to compile be linked as a library to komodo code.
An interpreter can be built for this, which I'm not sure how long it might take. In my opinion, the first thing needs is to sort and make libraries for crypto-conditions in other languages, including WASM and such.

[13-Feb-19 10:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but since you talk about games for web, it is possible to create a game engine, and let other languages use that to build games using it, including HTML5 games.

[13-Feb-19 11:44 AM] fredrik#2289
Great. Do you think there is a performance loss using interpreters builds. I‚Äôm using PHP a lot and do mainly text based games. No graphical stuff as per se.

[13-Feb-19 12:06 PM] Seko#7408
But theoretically it‚Äôs possible to connect Html5 games with the Blockchain or better program HTML5 games on a Blockchain. I have a good idea, can we talk about? I don‚Äôt know what do Pixdum, I don‚Äôt want a conflict, but maybe somebody interested in this idea...

[13-Feb-19 12:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is no interpreters for CC as of yet

[13-Feb-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810

@Cryptofist I've tried Arena - but it works only via wine on Mac so crashed permanently
Besides of offline competitive played some MTGO long time ago

How about a simple game like CryptoKitties?  Same game, our Komodo graphics.

Not because it was successful do, but to show that the system is still fast despite the game.

And to show that it's time to prove to everyone that Komodo is better than Ethereum.

[18-Feb-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
cryptokitties is not a game

why not make a rogueplayerdata visualizer + DEX

[18-Feb-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810

@grewalsatinder When an idea comes to fruition, I'll get involved.  I myself work with HTML5 and JavaScript games.  I publish and share them online.  Such a game distribution with an affiliate program on blockchain basis would be an idea for example.

[18-Feb-19 08:59 AM] Seko#7408
How about a decentralized game distribution platform for developers and publishers.

With an affiliate program for both parties, for developers and publishers.  And for advertisers who finance...
