and thats old devlog crap

[09-Mar-19 09:49 AM] fmproductions#2904
not sure about the best mechanic actually

[09-Mar-19 09:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
multi units attacking a single unit

[09-Mar-19 09:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
prob some statvars

[09-Mar-19 09:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm, mechanics in Sanctum?

[09-Mar-19 09:53 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Artist got examples of your work?

[09-Mar-19 09:56 AM] Artist#0765
well do mobile game dev

[09-Mar-19 09:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just some screenies of your work would suffice

[09-Mar-19 09:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
holy shit

[09-Mar-19 09:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
this is awesome

[09-Mar-19 09:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
üòÑ

[09-Mar-19 10:01 AM] fmproductions#2904
some unity with different strategies like snipers, or depending on the setting, archers, sword fighters, or even units with special abilities, like cloaking and only being visible after initial attack could be interesting

[09-Mar-19 10:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, pumped up a fog of war

[09-Mar-19 10:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so mostly a 5 tile max range

[09-Mar-19 10:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably go for 3

[09-Mar-19 10:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cloaking not necessary due to FoW

[09-Mar-19 10:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they are orcs, big ugly and cant really hide behind a rock

[09-Mar-19 10:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
fixed up some cool blood particles

[09-Mar-19 10:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c I built win from jl777 yesterday - can share this binary. Can try to build latest FSM as well if especially FSM is needed

[09-Mar-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 is in sync with FSM now, so either is fine

[09-Mar-19 10:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions is it a mad idea to put the combat mechanic calculation in a compute shader

[09-Mar-19 10:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and run those for every skinned attack on the GPU?

[09-Mar-19 10:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nevermind, too limited

[09-Mar-19 10:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@actionslacks what about when you kill a worker orc (peon) it drops its resources xD

I've never played warcraft. I guess I need to do some homework on the details.

[09-Mar-19 10:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
play it, its like

[09-Mar-19 10:52 AM] fmproductions#2904
I mean, the problem with it among other things is that shaders are a pain to debug and it is a pain to write shadercode, 

thank you tony!

[09-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
pathfinding done

[09-Mar-19 12:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions does unreal have a builtin Dijkstra/navmesh?

[09-Mar-19 12:37 PM] fmproductions#2904
Yeah, there is a navmesh system, probably similar to unity's, 
I guess they are using some sort of a star algorithm

[09-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 orc voices ‚úÖ

[09-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 @FishyGuts  
What about special rewards in game , thinking achievement type of deal.

[09-Mar-19 02:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
when will you have them ready?

[09-Mar-19 02:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have already a playable game with formations and units

[09-Mar-19 02:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
will be done with most in 3-4 hours

[09-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Get me a script and I'll record what I can.

[09-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok 2 secs

[09-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
3 kind of units (worker, combat, rider)

[09-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
on selecting unit

[09-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
on being attacked

[09-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
when dying

[09-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
for the worker just one voice, maybe 2 different ones

[09-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
combat 4 kind of units

[09-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
rider just 2 units

[09-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry its a demo xD

[09-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That's a lot of voices .

[09-Mar-19 02:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, they are just sound bits

[09-Mar-19 02:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
"mine mine" (instead of work work)

[09-Mar-19 02:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably at max 10 minutes recording, another 10 remastering

[09-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I guess I recall lthe units being different voices and that's why I think that

[09-Mar-19 02:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sure, but no need to overdo it, as long as the audio have a master equal volume

[09-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
definitely have "HODDLLLLL"

[09-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(in WC2 "we are beinggg attaccckeed")

[09-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I can  hit record and then send them

[09-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
can you hit up a Google Drive folder, share that, its easier, working on multiple machines at moment

[09-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll be back home in a little while. If speed is the priority here, someone else please step in. I'll alert here when I sit down to do it.

[09-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If you think there are any ones that should be a higher pitch, my 6 year old will want to help.

[09-Mar-19 02:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Also, got a real wicked screechy goblin voice if that fits anywhere.

[09-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
relax, let me know when

[09-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
What is relax?  üòÇ

[09-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
relax as in don't panic

[09-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
worse case I can pop those myself too

[09-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
You'll figure out mastering? I have recording down, it's been a long time since I've altered audio.

[09-Mar-19 02:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mastering is easy, basically use Audacity

[09-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm good. üòâ Just excited.

[09-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, that's what I used

[09-Mar-19 02:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its easier to master on the box you are recording, and for one make the clips in one recording, and use background noise filtering, test them with and without headphones, cut them into wave clips and bang

[09-Mar-19 02:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what were the max amount of units per player in wc2

[09-Mar-19 02:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
50?

[09-Mar-19 02:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
don't guess, find

[09-Mar-19 02:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I really don't recall a number, I remember there being one.

[09-Mar-19 02:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there is always a manual

[09-Mar-19 02:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
never reinvent the wheel if the wheel aint broken

[09-Mar-19 03:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
One version 600 total, battle.net was 1200

[09-Mar-19 03:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Food limit 200

[09-Mar-19 03:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
600 per player?
