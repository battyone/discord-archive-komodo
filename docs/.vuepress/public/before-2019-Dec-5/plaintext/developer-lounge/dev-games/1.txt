I talked to JL777 in #talk-other-topics  about the future of games on blockchain.

I firmly believe that games will work on the blockchain as well.  Of course we need funding and developers.

There are really good games on NEO and Ethereum already.  We on Komodo have the big advantage of scaling already now.

An example:

I'm a big football (soccer) fan, that's why this example. 
 
A simple football game.  A penalty shootout.  A tournament and everyone pays a small stake in the pool.  The winner of the tournament gets the pool at the end minus small fees.

I was already successful with Flash and HTML5 games.  With game sites and affiliates.  But the blockchain opens new doors for us.

The market is so big!

[22-Oct-18 10:06 AM] Seko#7408
Casino games, but also RPG games, everything is possible.  These games already exist, some are very complex.  But even simple games work.  Just like Flashgames a few years ago and applications today.

[22-Oct-18 10:10 AM] Seko#7408
There was once a simple penalty shootout that many fans from Europe played for their club.  It was very simple, but it still worked. 

The name of the game was „play for your club“.
 
The operator made money with Affiliate.

On the Blockchain you can earn money with fees.  And as an incentive for the game there are rewards, for example if you win.

[22-Oct-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
CASINO games is already being worked on

[22-Oct-18 10:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Might be worth doing a PoS instead of PoW so people can use coins to play instead of a few miners

[22-Oct-18 10:13 AM] Seko#7408
But the possibilities are greater.

[22-Oct-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Seko I could of of some help in some non-dev part somewhere. 😉

[22-Oct-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
find the devs.

[22-Oct-18 10:14 AM] Seko#7408
For which programming languages?

[22-Oct-18 10:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
whichever gives us the working game.

[22-Oct-18 10:17 AM] Seko#7408
Developers will need and a financing model.

[22-Oct-18 10:18 AM] Seko#7408
An ICO, Crowdfunding or whales...;)

[22-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Seko#7408
Or a game on the Blockchain which simulates the Blockchain technology.  A simulation game in which each player can make his own crypto currency.  Just an example, but you can really max out everything.

Oha! Very good idea already implemented, but anything is possible.

[22-Oct-18 10:32 AM] Seko#7408
There used to be an affiliate platform.  The name was Mochiads.  Every developer could host his games there and earn money with it.

Such a platform would also be possible.

[22-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Seko#7408
A review and trust portal, but this can also be implemented in Utrum.

[22-Oct-18 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
why not wait for CHIPS to be ready with CC and use that for games

[22-Oct-18 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is meant for games already.

[22-Oct-18 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that chain already exists

[22-Oct-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
@sg777 is very slowly making progress but single player games of chance against the house is technically quite different than multiplayer

[22-Oct-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also, we cant stop a decentralized community from launching chains

[22-Oct-18 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[22-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and i imagine we will get a variety of emission plans, locked funds, airdrops, etc.

[22-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
may the best chain win

[22-Oct-18 10:45 AM] Seko#7408
As an example, this games as dApps are already running on the NEO blockchain:

[22-Oct-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I find it hard to get some english link

[22-Oct-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to know about it

[22-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i have no idea what it is

[22-Oct-18 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄 okay

[22-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Seko#7408
But the Chinese are already developing.  If not them, then who? 😉

make an oracle feed, make a game

[22-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
launch a chain

[22-Oct-18 01:34 PM] joe2x4#5987
Yup, this is my second mention about fantasy football. My friends describe the football season as 16 weeks of Christmas. Fantasy leagues and block chain go hand in hand like peas and carrots.  🥕

[22-Oct-18 01:34 PM] joe2x4#5987
Unfortunately, the only thing I can make at the moment is suggestions.

[22-Oct-18 01:36 PM] joe2x4#5987
"American" football btw. 🏈

[22-Oct-18 03:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
Fantasy football on the blockchain in the US would be a juggernaut.

[22-Oct-18 03:34 PM] Seko#7408
And European football in Europe, I‘m sure. But we should bake smaller buns. ;)
A simple game for now.

[22-Oct-18 03:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
The added benefit would be the market you would create and the millions who could be on-boarded into the cryptosphere.

[22-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Seko#7408
Yes. Even now there are apps where the developers have implemented Fantasy Coins, which you can buy against FIAT.  Just not on blockchain.

I am sure that such a manager game can be financed by an ICO.  With the coins you can then build a stadium and environment, make transfers, etc.

[22-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Seko#7408
The best thing would be an interoperability coin for all games in the ecosystem...

[22-Oct-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC + oracles CC will let you use the blockchain to bet in fiat equivalent

[22-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Regnar#6164
I've played that Beyond the Void game, got to meet the team and played it back in early 2017. Pretty fun game tbh

[22-Oct-18 04:47 PM] Regnar#6164
it's their assets that are tradeable I believe, unless something changed

[22-Oct-18 04:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
2nd the notion of blockchain MTG,  if we can get WotC's blessing

@metaphilibert a simple trading card game with fantastic graphics...👍🏼

Hello everybody just for you to know we are planning to build www.pixdum.com using the Komodo Platform. It will be a Decentrlized Gaming Platform.

good to hear!

[22-Oct-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
just ask if you need help with designing CC

[22-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We were going to use previously other platform but Komodo seems to fit perfectly

[22-Oct-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
good to hear. doing a bit of an airdrop to KMD holders can also jumpstart your userbase

[22-Oct-18 05:43 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Thanks James will for sure

[22-Oct-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
not a requirement, but people love airdrops

[22-Oct-18 05:44 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Yes that is the idea

[22-Oct-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a simple command line dice game is surprisingly popular. a well designed and fun to play game that is monetized via crypto should be quite the hit as long as it can maintain realtime performance

[22-Oct-18 05:45 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We were going to use Elastos but the Komodo community is better and the technology we are looking for is here.

[22-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Thanks James we will be here getting ideas.

[22-Oct-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there was a long discussion on making the dice entropy cheat proof, even under reorg

[22-Oct-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you can determine game outcomes from 2 hashes, it is pretty solid and 512bits should be enough entropy for most game transitions

[22-Oct-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the best part is that it can have realtime (a few seconds) response

[22-Oct-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course txfees in your coin

[22-Oct-18 05:51 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We can make that game the first one on PIXDUM

[22-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
As you can see our ideas is for a Decentralized Gaming Platform, where all the games share the same coin

[22-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
So we can trade inside of the game with other Komodo assetchains

[22-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
And buy non-fungible assets

[22-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Like weapons, powers, characters, and so on

[22-Oct-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you will be using assets CC for tokens, oracles CC to get offchain data onchain, dice CC for RNG

[22-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
It will be like the REAL PLAYER ONE movie on Blockchain

[22-Oct-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
very good to have you here!

@Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) Great News.

[22-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We will compete with big companies, the only difference is that this will be a open and free solution for game developers without going to the hassle of centralization

[22-Oct-18 05:59 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Yea @Seko this could be the killer application from Komodo

[22-Oct-18 06:00 PM] Seko#7408
In which language you program the games?

[22-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
I am not the main developer but I think those can be made on Unreal Engine

[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
We are going to make it agnostic an open to the most used platforms.

[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Seko#7408
@Ignacio Figueroa (FIG) I‘m sure, a gaming platform on a blockchain launches a rocket to the moon.

[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
So we eliminate the barriers of entrance.

[22-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Yes, there are so many people asking for this solutions but no one seems to see the potential here.
