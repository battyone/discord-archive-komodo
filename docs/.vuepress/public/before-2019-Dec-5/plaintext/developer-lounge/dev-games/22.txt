This morning a short brainstorm session, three powerful words to deliver the message that will encapsulate the vision ahead. Now a little time with my son, as working hard is important but that great things happen through the people who empower us and charge us to make a change. Expect great things. Magic.

[18-Mar-19 05:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
So, here is the super update.

[18-Mar-19 05:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
1. Games
========================================================

[18-Mar-19 05:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Adding to "powered by Komodo" will by my own developed RPG, which I've been partially porting to use Tokens CC (cc-assets here, Token CC in the docs), probably considering cc-oracles and cc-heir), which has MMO capabilities. Probably will take a month or so to finish.

[18-Mar-19 05:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Secondly, a racing game that focuses on custom made tracks, ghost rider bets at super high speed - thank you @Meyse for that idea. Most likely be finished somewhere this week.

[18-Mar-19 05:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Two fast arcade shooters; one a zombie survival (like Resident Evil's mercenaries) where you have to survive for a certain amount of time and you can extend time by finding hourglasses. The other being a doom-like shooter, where you play as a humanoid komodo dragon in an intergalactic war.

[18-Mar-19 05:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
In the RTS department, a re-factor of WarChain; everyone in this channel has already seen this going around in this channel.

[18-Mar-19 05:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
For the sake of insanity, a set of smaller, extendable classic top-down RPG's, most likely going to use some old doujinshi material I've written. Basically, pointy haired heroes, magical legendary swords, monsters.

[18-Mar-19 05:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
One brawling game, but still have to work out the details on that one.

[18-Mar-19 05:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
A bunch of platform shooters - metroid classic type - aimed for speedrunning.

[18-Mar-19 05:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
2. SDK's and more
========================================================
Primarily the focus are on Unity development, because well, I work in Unity. Yet the SDK's should be super duper portable, but all small things need to be set up. I've been using Odin Inspector to make a sexy tool that fetches news, updates, but also can install "modules", straight from git, but its fairly bare bones. To call it a SDK, takes a while to be tested, and I prefer to focus on quality and turnkey, instead of massive features. Never the less, the Unreal variant should match functionality. The high level layer 6AME (6AM Enhanced) has a dedicated dude working on the documentation and some optimization, writing out some tutorials, and I'll orchestrate something crazy so there is stuff to be distributed on the YouTubes, because that is what kids like these days. The SDK development will mostly be on-the-fly as I work on the games, finding the use cases for crypto condition contracts as I go. The SDK's will be **open source** for anyone to improve and tamper with; at this point there are like 400 things I like to add, so bear with me; probably up somewhere this week.

[18-Mar-19 05:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
3. Awesome things and PR stuff
========================================================
Making cool stuff is one, but making sure they are getting noticed are equally important. So, I got myself a decent haircut and hoodie sweater. Yes, it aint much, but a lot better than my former grunge look (which I have grown fond upon, but hey... team stuff ya know).
To make turnkey things possible, we are going to need make blockchain - and specifically the Komodo solution - understandable for mortals. These things can be in small details; like one liners for solutions like oracles or an onboarding into blockchain for gaming. For this a little PR strategy is important. Of course this is going to be streamlined with Komodo Team, so its still decentralized team thingies, but we don't want to shock Steve. Yes, more presentation, less disfuckingclaimer stuff.

[18-Mar-19 05:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
4. Game Store
========================================================
Sorry, but we are going to need more control on the outlets where we put our games. So we are going to roll our own. Yes, you read that right. We are going to build a genuine virtual arcade hall and bring those babies to the world. Intuitive design, sexy buttons, super duper ultra performance and a lot of eye candy. Working towards that.

[18-Mar-19 05:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Good morning, and Sam is now going to take a shower, head over to our local news city, talk with some important people and head back down to the Hague to talk to our president (jk jk jk)
