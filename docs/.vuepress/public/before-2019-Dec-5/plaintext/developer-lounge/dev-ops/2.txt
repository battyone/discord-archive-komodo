scaletest stuff was impossible without docker-compose

[14-Jan-19 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just noticed there is no official komodo repo for docker hub.

[14-Jan-19 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
just yesterday i found out that Emmanuel is the owner of https://hub.docker.com/u/kmdplatform

[14-Jan-19 01:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, that is the nearest we are to a official repo

[14-Jan-19 01:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but there is none with the official tag

[14-Jan-19 01:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im playing around with docker :p

[16-Jan-19 03:13 AM] Mylo#8306
There is a dockerfile in kmd src also I have a cpl different but the most optimised is a 250MB image at https://hub.docker.com/u/imylomylo using the releases binary

[16-Jan-19 03:15 AM] Mylo#8306
This is the best one imo for size.  I‚Äôll be using it for all documentation in devportal.  Will post recipe online, it will need one further optimization for official release with the binary release of komodod/Komodo-cli from the release catalogue to provide a json file of the sha256 of those files so someone can be sure when they build their own from binary, rather than src.

[16-Jan-19 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
Src builds in docker are >1.5GB

[16-Jan-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The scaletest container is tiny

[16-Jan-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from source.... You need to delete heaps of crap

interesting, i'll try it out - cheers

[28-Jan-19 09:28 AM] Mylo#8306
hmmmmm, my containers from sprout to sapling seem to have gone from 2GB to 5GB.

[28-Jan-19 09:29 AM] Mylo#8306

[28-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah at runtime i have zcash-params ro.  will check my build.

[28-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Mylo#8306

[28-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Mylo#8306
@Deleted User can you build container without the keys?

[28-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Mylo#8306
build komodo

[28-Jan-19 10:19 AM] Mylo#8306
ok,  "initialize" with a rw volume, then after that re-use that same volume ro.   annoying but it's like that for a reason!!

[28-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm building kmd like i used to, for a time i used the binaries only and mounted a docker volume ro, which was really lean.  but building it, i guess i just have to mount an empty volume on first build rw.

[28-Jan-19 11:45 AM] Mylo#8306
for zcash-params.   my localhost has zcash params but i'm making some recipes for ppl new to blockchain

@Mylo have you got a recent repo for this?

[22-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Mylo#8306
no, but i have an updated recipe on a server i can push - have other tasks atm, so expect on weekend.

[22-Mar-19 08:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no worries and thanks, pls let me know when ready to go. I'm new to docker but keen to wrap my head around it to make testing CCs which are multinode from within a single node.

Hi I just rand the docker build command using the main repository and it fails.

[26-Mar-19 11:11 AM] Monetashi#8770
The command '/bin/sh -c cd /komodo &&     ./autogen.sh &&     ./configure --with-incompatible-bdb --with-gui || true &&     ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)' returned a non-zero code: 137

[26-Mar-19 11:12 AM] Monetashi#8770
Does someone have a pointer to a working Dockerfile to build from source, preferably with a lean production stage?

@gcharang thanks

[15-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Greer#0666
I'm trying to build on alpine.  Looks like zcash made some changes to the source a couple of years ago to make it possible.  With komodo I'm getting an issue with librustzcash.  cargo cannot be found and there is no option to build without-rust as there was in zcash.
Has anyone managed to build in alpine?

[16-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Mylo#8306
no i gave up with alpine.  not much advantage compared to ubuntu

[18-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Greer#0666
Its tiny in comparison so much quicker to fire up an image from dockerhub, but alas, gave up too.  Zcash got it working.

[18-Apr-19 03:39 AM] Greer#0666
debian:buster-slim did the trick üëç

gents

[08-May-19 05:35 PM] Bongistan#2965
I was searching for proper docker images to run komodo

[08-May-19 05:35 PM] Bongistan#2965
and to be honest I was quite disappointed.

[08-May-19 05:35 PM] Bongistan#2965
most of the docker images for komodo were not working.

[08-May-19 05:35 PM] Bongistan#2965
so I did put something together.

[08-May-19 05:35 PM] Bongistan#2965
my idea is to start up two dockerd images via docker-compose

[08-May-19 05:36 PM] Bongistan#2965

[08-May-19 05:47 PM] Bongistan#2965
The image I  did is quite similar.

[08-May-19 05:47 PM] Bongistan#2965
However I am trying to run multiple of this images

[08-May-19 05:47 PM] Bongistan#2965
because I think I need to run two komodod to launch my own chain.

[08-May-19 05:49 PM] Bongistan#2965
I actually download the zcash params when I build the docker image.

[08-May-19 05:49 PM] Bongistan#2965
yes it does

[08-May-19 05:50 PM] Bongistan#2965
that is a good optimization.

[08-May-19 05:51 PM] Bongistan#2965
But this is too early for me.

[08-May-19 05:51 PM] Bongistan#2965
Right now I try to start my own chain,

[08-May-19 05:51 PM] Bongistan#2965
and then do some transactions via cli

[08-May-19 05:51 PM] Bongistan#2965
I am somehow struggeling there.

[08-May-19 05:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use -testnode=1 so you can test params and start chains with 1 node only. üòÉ

[08-May-19 05:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might only be in jl777 branch though

[08-May-19 05:52 PM] Bongistan#2965
the jl777 branch is the dev branch

[08-May-19 05:52 PM] Bongistan#2965
right?

[08-May-19 05:52 PM] Bongistan#2965
it is a little confusing as normally I would look for a dev tag

[08-May-19 05:53 PM] Bongistan#2965
but as I understand it jl777 is dev repo,

[08-May-19 05:53 PM] Bongistan#2965
and then komodo has the release repo

[08-May-19 05:53 PM] Bongistan#2965
I see

[08-May-19 05:53 PM] Bongistan#2965
thanks!

[08-May-19 05:54 PM] Bongistan#2965
the addnode

[08-May-19 05:55 PM] Bongistan#2965
they communicate on the port specified in port=

[08-May-19 05:55 PM] Bongistan#2965
I want to create 10000 unique assets for a start.

[08-May-19 05:55 PM] Bongistan#2965
so I guess I have to tell the komodod to start 10000 chains?

[08-May-19 05:57 PM] Bongistan#2965
I want to track ownership of multiple unique items.

[08-May-19 05:59 PM] Bongistan#2965
no  problem.

[08-May-19 05:59 PM] Bongistan#2965
I will figure that out

[08-May-19 05:59 PM] Bongistan#2965
haha

[08-May-19 05:59 PM] Bongistan#2965
or not

Ive done 128 or 256 on a very big AWS instance with docker for scale test. 10,000 needs crazy amounts of cpus

does anyone here use a docker GUI mgmt like rancher.io  or equivalent?

[24-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Mylo#8306
does not have to be production, just dev/testing/experiment.

[08-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Greer#0666
@Mylo I played with https://www.portainer.io/ a while back was impressed.  Dont use it though, was curious so tried it.

[08-Jul-19 04:21 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks i'll check it out on the next docker tutorials work
