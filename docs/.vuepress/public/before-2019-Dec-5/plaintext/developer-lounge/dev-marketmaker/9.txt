With hindsight, it could be have been more effective to promote BarterDex highlighting the support for various USD pegged coins and setting most marketmarker efforts around them: tusd/gusd/btc pairs, etc...

[15-Oct-18 11:55 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
coin-to-coin trading seems least appealing during bear markets, especially compounded with the ux and learning curve, but edging with fiat without kyc is good for all seasons and worth the learning curve for avoiding reporting&taxes...

[15-Oct-18 11:55 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
what do you think?

[16-Oct-18 06:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@KomodoWorld HyperDEX has support for GUSD

[16-Oct-18 03:52 PM] tolken#2655
I’ll add GUSD if you think anyone will use them.  Quit honestly I’m surprised kmd/btc at the very least isn’t used more often. Seems like maybe there’s an exchange once a week at most. @KomodoWorld

[16-Oct-18 03:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Ok try test it

[16-Oct-18 04:00 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'll do a bouunty for specific video guide, then we can try to make big twitter traders to give it a try

[16-Oct-18 05:24 PM] tolken#2655
Are we feeling confident enough in order matching to promote like that to new users? I’m still unclear how well order matching is working right now with so few users. My bob seems to generally fulfill orders on all pairs I have setup, but I don’t know what the true success rate is. For all I know there are lots of failed matches, or there just isn’t enough activity/attempts. For whatever reason I don’t have much luck when doing Alice buys. Sometimes, but rare. Can’t figure out where the problem resides.

[16-Oct-18 05:24 PM] tolken#2655
I guess more testers is better than less. 😃

[16-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
what is needed is a dedicated set of bobs that are monitored and have the inventory

[16-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
without that people will have a hard time making swaps

[16-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i used to do this but ran out of time to continue

[16-Oct-18 05:26 PM] tolken#2655
My bobs have inventory. Should I monitor them in some specific way? I’ll do whatever I can to monitor them more closely if I can.

[16-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as they are running, that is what is important

[16-Oct-18 05:26 PM] tolken#2655
Yep, they’re pretty solid I think.

[16-Oct-18 05:27 PM] tolken#2655

Someone is try my and failing to complete a kmd/eth trade with me.  Anyone here?

[17-Oct-18 04:08 AM] tolken#2655
Connected but never sent payment on first one, second one timed out after connect.

[17-Oct-18 04:22 AM] cipi#4502
look at console output... i assume you will find messages like this
```didnt get valid data after 120
error waitsend pubkeys```
on bob, which indicate bad internet between bob and alice... the experience that i made was that when i download stuff on my alice and try a swap at the same time the swap will most likely fail with this error message...
same happens when i start the swap right after starting mm on alice... have to wait a bit before doing... as you can see there could be many reasons why swaps fail, so clearly need much more info

[17-Oct-18 04:27 AM] tolken#2655
indeed, I don’t mean to be so vague but there so much output. I was asking if it was someone here so we could keep trying.

[17-Oct-18 04:27 AM] tolken#2655
As for errors, the second one was then”didn’t get valid data after 120”

[17-Oct-18 04:29 AM] tolken#2655

[17-Oct-18 04:32 AM] cipi#4502
`Can't send transaction with too low gas price` seems to be the error... interesting, haven't seen this error before... the only explanation i have is that in the time between querying the gas price info and the time the tx was sent, the gas price changed... maybe @artem.pikulin can tell us what this error means

[17-Oct-18 04:40 AM] cipi#4502
ok, found 2 other possible explanations
1. the request doing the gas price query failed, mm used the default gas price but that was too low
2. the parity node doing the ETH transaction has a problem

[17-Oct-18 04:47 AM] cipi#4502
parity node looks good, as far as i can tell... it has the correct height compared to https://etherscan.io/
the parity proxy log though shows some errors `Rejecting transaction with too low gas price`

[17-Oct-18 04:57 AM] cipi#4502
looked in the code and found the URL to the gasprice call: https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json
i can query this URL, but i think if this not possible by the time the swap starts, mm is using a hardcoded default and if that is too low compared to the real gas price, the tx will fail... not sure if i got all this right, but artem will tell us 😃

[17-Oct-18 04:57 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi Hi, yes, proxy rejects transactions with too low gas price, it was done to prevent tx spam to Parity node.

[17-Oct-18 04:58 AM] cipi#4502
oh yes, now i remember, there was a time an attacker was bothering us...

[17-Oct-18 05:00 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Alice payment is now stuck, @tolken you have to manually claim it, I'll help you to do it.

[17-Oct-18 05:06 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@tolken Please respond in PM when you are available.

[17-Oct-18 05:19 AM] tolken#2655
Ok thanks artem. Tx isn’t that large fortunately

[17-Oct-18 05:32 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi  why is the Alice/Bob connection so fragile? Isn’t canBind (maybe Alice isn’t binding? 😃 a more direct way to connect the two parties? I would love to better understanding how these connections are established/maintained.

[17-Oct-18 05:41 AM] cipi#4502
that is a good question, i don't know why it is so, just observed that with my own swaps... could also be that it is not the usual most common cause for failed swaps, just with me... my internet is very lame, 16MBit down and only 1MBit up... the 1MBit up is the problem in my case... it is simply total BS to offer such internet connections to clients, 1MBit up is simply not enough to sustain 16MBit down, but ok, that is another story :-)
canbind only means that the node can do more then one swap in parallel, but for that to work the node needs a public IP (directly reachable from Internet, not NATed) and all ports open, no Firewall

[17-Oct-18 05:43 AM] tolken#2655
That internet doesn’t sound toooo bad... Ah, I thought the connection was more robust somehow.

[17-Oct-18 05:44 AM] tolken#2655
I run bob with canBind. I may have had multiple swaps happen a few times.

[17-Oct-18 05:46 AM] tolken#2655
if the IPs is the two machines remain the same, is there anything technically preventing the Alice/bob from picking up where they left off, even if for example, someone’s machine crashes mid swap? Assuming they can find each other, is there any technical reason (technical as in, technically very difficult problem to solve) that can’t happen. Or just a mm1.0 limitation that could be overcome with a bit more dev?

[17-Oct-18 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
mm1 limit

[17-Oct-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ask the mm2 team for this feature

[17-Oct-18 05:48 AM] tolken#2655
@jl777c awesome 😃

[17-Oct-18 05:48 AM] cipi#4502
most of the swaps that are interrupted because of nodes going offline are simply reverted (alice gets alicepayment back, bob gets bobdeposit back)

[17-Oct-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, better to be able to resume

[17-Oct-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
since I dont have to implement it 😃

[17-Oct-18 05:49 AM] tolken#2655
Hah, easy right? 😛

[17-Oct-18 05:49 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi yes Artem is helping me with that now, I’m doing it for science as it’s only 3kmd.

[17-Oct-18 05:52 AM] cipi#4502
this swap-reverts should normally happen automatically, only in special situations it is needed to intervene manually (like bugs or failures not covered by the code, which is also some kind of bug)

[17-Oct-18 05:53 AM] tolken#2655
I’ve had to do it a couple times manually, I think each time due to my bob crashing/shutting down.

[17-Oct-18 05:54 AM] tolken#2655
both times not mm’s fault.

[17-Oct-18 05:57 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, but i think it would be good if the code would try to cover most of this situations, simply because it can happen, nodes may crash and it is always difficult to revert this manually... and sometimes you are not even aware that the swap failed... imagine you run bobs and they run all the time, you won't look all the time what they are doing, so you may miss such failed swaps

[17-Oct-18 06:01 AM] tolken#2655
That’s why I’m trying to better understand the bdex output better. I still get confused with reading/parsing some of the output logs. I even have endpoint exposed, which spits out lots of info. Haven’t quite figured out how to utilize all of it though. It seems like within sufficient understanding, I could write something to watch/catch certain behaviors. If more swaps start happening, you’re absolutely right, it could be quite a mess. I expect there to be lots of hands on maintenance.

[17-Oct-18 06:02 AM] tolken#2655
Gunna try and get GUSD setup next, hopefully @KomodoWorld  is right and there’s a market for that.

[17-Oct-18 06:11 AM] cipi#4502
yes, mm console output is not that easy to understand... often you also need to know some things about the internals (the code) to be able to fully understand it

[17-Oct-18 06:12 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It's one of the MM2 goals to improve user experience in case of bad network conditions, I surely agree that swaps are too "fragile", short connection interruption leads to swap abortion which is not acceptable especially for mobile platforms which we plan to support.

[17-Oct-18 07:58 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
That's right! In MM2 we now have a way to inform the user about the ongoing, in-progress operations without adding too much clutter to the log, which in turn allows us to more often share such information.
Plus in the ported code we're adding a layer of logging which is explicitly human-readable and human-oriented (the logging we have in MM1 is mostly debug/developer-oriented).

[17-Oct-18 12:46 PM] tolken#2655
@KomodoWorld GUSD online for most pairs now, kmd/btc/bch/ltc etc. Not selling any of those, just buying at moment until I can get GUSD funded.

[17-Oct-18 02:14 PM] luke#8628
Hello, I have a couple of questions about marketmaker and privacy. 1. Is it possible (or will it be possible at some point) to trade from a privacy coin like Zcash to another privacy coin like KMD directly between z-addresses? This seems like a way to perform private trades without needing to go through JUMBLR. If this is already possible I'd love to try it out (even if it's in early stages). 2. When a swap occurs, is the network traffic sent directly between the two peers doing the trade or does it go through the full-relay node that is in the middle hosting the orderbook? Is this traffic encrypted?

[17-Oct-18 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont see how to do this without some incredible complicated new type of homomorphic encryption. I saw some academic paper that said it might be possible, but I am not so sure

[17-Oct-18 02:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@luke oh that'd be a like some spooky action in quantum physics 😄

[17-Oct-18 02:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would love to see as reality someday in future....

[17-Oct-18 02:31 PM] luke#8628
@jl777c ya, I figured if it was easy you would have already done it 😃

[17-Oct-18 02:32 PM] luke#8628
does anyone know about "2. When a swap occurs, is the network traffic sent directly between the two peers doing the trade or does it go through the full-relay node that is in the middle hosting the orderbook? Is this traffic encrypted?"

[17-Oct-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
during the swap alice and bob are in direct comms

[17-Oct-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the default version is broadcasting tradestatus though

[17-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
however it would work just fine with a "running silent mode" where it didnt broadcast the tradestatus

[17-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
my feeling is that trying to do swaps privately is not really a good idea

[17-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if only because you dont know who you are trading with

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so any "privacy" is just an illusion if you are swapping with the attacker

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why I do all the swaps in clear text

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
no pretense of privacy

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want privacy, use zaddrs or JUMBLR

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
or PIRATE

[17-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then from a fresh address do swaps in the clear

[17-Oct-18 02:37 PM] luke#8628
cool, I see what you mean. I think the tricky thing with that is that you only get one smart address per passphrase, so you have to restart marketmaker in order to monitor multiple smart addresses (can't query all of your smart addresses at once) right?

[17-Oct-18 02:38 PM] luke#8628
I suppose you could go out of band and query the block explorer apis of the coins you are trading for those addresses

[17-Oct-18 02:39 PM] luke#8628
but it still adds a layer of complexity when trying to generate a fresh smart address

[17-Oct-18 02:39 PM] luke#8628
and trade with it

[17-Oct-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
privacy is difficult to maintain, but well worth the effort

`> that is why I do all the swaps in clear text`

Some of the NAT traversal solutions might "impose" the encryption on us, though: https://zetok.github.io/tox-spec/#end-to-end-encryption. Albeit they'd be kicking in only between the new MM versions [and if the normal direct communication fails].

[19-Oct-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
having it encrypted by some standard layer is fine, as long as you dont assume it is 100% secure

[22-Oct-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just got multiple RPC threads working with marketmaker... not 100% sure, but I think this would solve a lot of the "marketmaker is not working " issues that happen when a command locks it up.

[22-Oct-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
obviously, only certain commands can be run in parallell ... as some might confllct with others.

[22-Oct-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
simply having 2 RPC ports one to send commands and one to fetch state should work no ? I had to disable the LP_Command queue on one thread.

[22-Oct-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that thread should be able to be used to pull info.. maybe I am wrong. but its working for what I need it for anyway. If anyone wants to know how I  did it, ask.

[22-Oct-18 05:36 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@blackjok3r Hi, MM2 will support concurrent requests. HTTP server implementation was already replaced with Rust Hyper server: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/tree/etomic/mm2src/rpc. So the task is about 50% done, however we have to emulate "single threadiness" of MM1 RPC for some  time as Rust RPC code is still calling old C functions.

Cool just hacking around to get my streamer working, and figured it out... Guess there must be a reason its not enabled, as msot of the code is there, it just didnt work.

[22-Oct-18 05:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I think you might use the current MM1 release which doesn't contain Rust code at all. If you would like to test the version with some parts implemented in Rust you can find nightly builds here: http://195.201.0.6/etomic/

{Reactions}
👍 

[22-Oct-18 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I will probably use what I have as it works.. I am not using 99% of the code, ideally at some point it would need to be a standalone binary.

[22-Oct-18 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just has 2 RPC threads, one to activate TX blaster with OP_return and one to receive data to add to the queue. So far seems working very well with extremly high bandwidth.

[22-Oct-18 05:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Even with MM1 you can enable WS endpoint, connect to it and schedule command execution at "background" receiving the result from WS.

[22-Oct-18 05:54 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
You need first to call `getendpoint` and then set the `queueid`param to set the id of your request. You need to to ensure that it's not possible for 2 requests to have the same ID.

[22-Oct-18 05:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I accomplished it this way, maybe that way would have been easier, or could work better... but I am not very experianced in C.  I think for now this will do. Thanks for the advice.

[22-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the concurrency in mm1 mostly works, until it deadlocks

[22-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but depending on usage, it might be ok

[22-Oct-18 07:34 AM] namhoang28#4328
@jl777c when it deadlocks?
could you provide more details?

[22-Oct-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
luke had the problem with the hyperdex gui when we allowed it to have two pending requests

[22-Oct-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
limiting it to one pending request made it revert to the single threaded behavior and it runs stable

[22-Oct-18 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In my case I am litterally not using any marketmaker functions at all, its on an unused netid with no seed node... So I think thats why its working fine in this case.
