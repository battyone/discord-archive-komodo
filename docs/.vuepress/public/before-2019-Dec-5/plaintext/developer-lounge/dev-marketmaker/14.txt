P.S. USDT has both UTXO-based version and ERC20 - supported too.

What is the the best way to track the changes between MM1 and MM2?

any update there is a change from mm1

[02-May-19 05:06 PM] wbradt#2043
Is there an upgraded version of the documentation? If not, is my only option to look through the code and GitHub issues to learn the differences?

[02-May-19 05:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For now yes, I think all documentation will be updated after most bugs/features are fixed/done

[02-May-19 05:24 PM] cipi#4502
the documentation of the API calls is here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.md

hey guys

[20-May-19 05:34 PM] kenCode#4725
i have a couple questions regarding htlc/accs

[20-May-19 05:35 PM] kenCode#4725
Q: is there a komodo/barterdex/hyperdex dev who would be willing to consult with a couple of the bitshares core devs on atomic swaps and transfers between your atomic order book and the bitshares one? HTLC on bitshares is live now and they are implementing the swaps and transfers stuff and uiux now, would be great to bridge the two communities and all of their currently supported coins (bitshares has over 2000 active assets atm). if so, could you please have them either ping me on telegram @kenCode, or join the @htlcbts telegram group? 
 
my job is with the palmpay point of sale systems and we want to connect to more/as many atomic order books as possible so the customers get the best possible pricing at the cash register. 
 
thanx in advance for any direction you guys can provide 😊

@kenCode this sounds like a great initiative! contact @artem.pikulin he is the lead dev for barterDEX and is the best one to work out these details with

[20-May-19 05:38 PM] kenCode#4725

Hi guys 😃

[23-May-19 04:53 PM] Jahan#6742
Recently I learned about Komodo's atomic swap and since then I am looking for a clean and technical-level explaination of it. But I can not find anything.

[23-May-19 04:53 PM] Jahan#6742
Do you have any publicly available resources, such as academic papers or well explained blog posts?

[23-May-19 04:54 PM] Jahan#6742
(I am familiar with similar solutions like cosmos peg system or truebit doge-eth swap)

[23-May-19 04:55 PM] TcHóS#5683
Guys I could create a blockchain in the Komodo ecosystem with consensus (POS + Mastenodes)?

@jl777c Thanks for sharing! 
Awesome high level explaination 😄

[23-May-19 05:01 PM] Jahan#6742
But still so much left for me to understand

[23-May-19 05:02 PM] Jahan#6742
For example who setups the addresses and how ?

[23-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
both nodes setup a temp address

[23-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for themselves

[23-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and coordinate with the other node directly

[23-May-19 05:04 PM] Jahan#6742
So it's kind of multi-signature address with timelock ?

Mobile dex is going into public beta next week. I signed up for the public beta testing, is there anything specific that the team wants? Or do we just trade as wanted and report bugs?

[26-May-19 10:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I wonder if there should be a competition or not 😛

[26-May-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only if there's a way for people with real phones and no micro-PCs to have a chance to win

[26-May-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[26-May-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe we should just have a random drawing of users rather than most xyz

[26-May-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So like each trade is a ticket

[26-May-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So the more you do the better chances of winning

[26-May-19 11:30 AM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX that sound like a good idea 👍

[26-May-19 12:44 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Hello I have a question about the beta mobile Dex

[26-May-19 12:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Do you have to register to join the public beta, or will it be open ,

[26-May-19 12:46 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and which coins will be tradable , will there be stable coins allowed?

[26-May-19 12:46 PM] Coin2stable#1872
cheers

Thanks @SHossain

[26-May-19 03:28 PM] jspook16#3059
Is it a coincidence that bartelly is going into beta too?

[26-May-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[27-May-19 09:05 AM] Lennart#9331
are we now in "next week"? 😃

[27-May-19 09:06 AM] Lennart#9331
anyways I'll wait patiently

[27-May-19 12:50 PM] SadykovT#2123
next Tuesday 😉

[28-May-19 03:25 AM] Mylo#8306
The more you do the more chances @hyperDEX ..... that’s a lot of tickets!
1+ month ago when I last tested the mobile dex, I was doing 3-5 swaps at the same time...always working.  It’s an impressive offering.  I think any competition will make >100k swaps in a week quite easily.

[28-May-19 10:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Im happy to donate to a prize pool

[28-May-19 10:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will the beta only be for android users or will there be s desktop app too?

[28-May-19 02:54 PM] Mylo#8306
you gotta ask ca that, he's on top of that roadmap - i think hyperdex will be go-to desktop app for takers for a few months

[29-May-19 07:02 AM] jspook16#3059
Hyperdex will support mm2.0?

[29-May-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jspook16 Eventually it will

[29-May-19 09:00 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've read in the past that mm2.0 has some abstraction layer that will make possible to add support for non-Bitcoin based coins. Are there more details about this? If a non-bitcoin based coin wants to start studying how to integrate, where to start?

[29-May-19 03:11 PM] jspook16#3059
@hyperDEX outstanding. I really like hyperdex

[30-May-19 04:22 AM] Mylo#8306
@KomodoWorld any particular coin you want to know?

[30-May-19 07:03 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Mylo I was thinking about a project still in the works: AVA that uses the new Avalanche consensus. It's still in testnet and I've read they haven't yet decided how to distribute the coins. It seems a good case for a dICO

[30-May-19 07:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I can propose to send someone our way to enquire, I would like to have a little more to say

Were additional non-test coins added to atomixdex?

[11-Jun-19 03:51 AM] jacman#4756
Does this work with a hardware wallet?

[17-Jun-19 04:18 PM] wbradt#2043
Has the order matching algorithm been changed between MM1 and MM2? Specifically, my main concern with MM1's algo was an order could be filled by only one other trader. Is this changed or is there any plan to?

[17-Jun-19 04:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@wbradt this is the protocol:
```
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`

A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2)
A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)
After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4)
When A takes the KMD, he reveals the secret `secret_A` which will allow B to claim BTC

The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and "ease of use"

Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A don't reveal the secret `secret_A`
```

Ofcourse, once the order is matched and the swap starts, you will only be dealing with one other person

[17-Jun-19 05:06 PM] wbradt#2043
That doesn't answer my question

[17-Jun-19 05:06 PM] wbradt#2043
Rephrased, I am asking if in MM2, can 1 order lead to multiple swaps (each one with a different person)?

[18-Jun-19 04:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@wbradt 
before the order is matched, you can advertise the same coins in many different pairs
Ex: If you have 1 btc, you can have orders up for selling it for ETH, KMD, LTC etc., at the same time

but if any one of the orders is matched, the same BTC can't be used by anyone until the swap goes through or times out

```
 my main concern with MM1's algo was an order could be filled by only one other trader. Is this changed or is there any plan to?
```
honestly, I don't understand what you are asking for here

[18-Jun-19 04:29 AM] dan.#2473
i think hes asking, if he wants 1k kmd will it auto execute multiple swaps (if needed) to get 1k kmd

[18-Jun-19 04:30 AM] dan.#2473
i havent tried mm2 but if utxos are auto magic now i would guess its possible

[18-Jun-19 07:11 AM] Mylo#8306
Had to delete some msgs I wrote incorrectly.

[18-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes.  Multiple swaps to fill order.  Auto UTXO mgmt.

[18-Jun-19 07:18 AM] Mylo#8306
Mm2 does things a bit more like what a trader on a CEX is familiar.

[18-Jun-19 08:58 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Hi, MM2 still makes a little difference between taker and maker orders, so the order placed by `buy/sell` call is currently `fill` only (it's planned to change in near future). But if it's not matched in 30 seconds it's automatically changed to `maker` order which can be matched with several other orders until it's filled.

[18-Jun-19 08:58 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also you can still place the `maker-only` order by using `setprice` call.

[18-Jun-19 03:21 PM] wbradt#2043
@artem.pikulin Thanks! I guess that explains `impl Into<MakerOrder> for TakerOrder` (https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/09b82076135f0bcfc05a364bd1b61d796e5cfa7e/mm2src/lp_ordermatch.rs#L148). I was hoping it was for this purpose.

I guess another part of my question is: Can 1 taker order fill multiple maker orders?

[18-Jun-19 03:26 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Not now, but it will be done for sure, this part is still inherited from MM1.
