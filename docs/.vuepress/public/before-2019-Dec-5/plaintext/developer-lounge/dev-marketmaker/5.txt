Thanks for the talk!

I'm going to save that kmd address that you posted earlier too.

If anyone reading this can make the unicorn code magic that lives in the computer give me my money back hit me up. üòÇ üòá

If they can do that, I'm pretty sure that the 1 ZEC in that wallet will be the least of their concerns

This is true. Anyone who can make the unicorn code magic that lives in the computer give me my money back stay away from my computer!

[11-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
or donate me some zec. not to that address though.

Quiet around here. Taking a little break myself after coming to the realization my system is having difficulties now doing Alice trades strangely enough, but bobs are generally going though, decided to pause and start from scratch. How‚Äôs everyone else fairing lately?

[15-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jansako#3330
Set up my first 'proper' bob recently (KMD/SN and KMD/BOTS, for now), got one swap on KMD/SN, so at least I know it works. haven't had any luck with Alice sells for a long time, but pretty sure that would be because there are no UTXO's of any size left in the AC 'buy' bobs (the ones I wish to trade, that is). That is not a complaint, I understand perfectly why there aren't.

[17-Jul-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c 
Using the USD peg on ZILLA bob it seems the price updates faster than the orderbook propagates the prices, this leads to unmatched swaps when you click the order book. Its very very small margin causing quote to fail eg.
```ZILLA/KMD ignore as qprice 0.34939785 vs myprice 0.34958873(edited)
0.34939785
-0.34958873=
0.00019088
```
What should I change to make the bob a little more lenient so swaps go through more reliably. Is it the sellmargin value? OR is there something else we can fix to make it a bit more reliable. Manually setting a higher price is resulting in all swaps getting to complete on Atrems latest release.

[17-Jul-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
updating too fast... can you just boost the price a bit?

[17-Jul-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes increasing the price on the Alice makes it work, but its not nice for user experience, you click the price and it wont buy.

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Likley this might be more a GUI issue, but my question is more to make the bob let a trade go though where the quote is like fractions of cents off.

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But maybe on very large amounts that could be not good either.

[17-Jul-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
well bob is setting a price. you are asking to make the price bob sets actually a bit lower than what bob set

[17-Jul-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No not exactly... The price the bob is showing on the orderbook of alice is different to what the price it is offering.

[17-Jul-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are not the same value.

[17-Jul-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
this is slippage

[17-Jul-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so offering the price in the orderbook results in an unmatched swap

[17-Jul-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
increasing price makes it work, it could also go the other way, if USD peg makes the price lower I guess, but in that case the swap will still match.

[17-Jul-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
compensating for slippage is non-trivial and likely not possible in all cases

[17-Jul-18 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no problem. Just have to try work this out from Alice side.

[18-Jul-18 09:28 AM] jansako#3330
@blackjok3r sorry for the ping if you don't know the answer!
I checked my MM, when I run ./myprice, the orders show as expected. The MM is running only ~24 hours. Do you need to restart these every day, or how do you tell it is 'gone bad' if it reports the orders? (trying to keep my bob orders showing in HyperDEX & Dexstats orderbooks)

[18-Jul-18 09:28 AM] jansako#3330
do you just keep checking orderbooks on Dexstats?

[18-Jul-18 09:33 AM] jansako#3330
Happy to try @artem.pikulin 's latest, which repo is it?

Please note that it doesn't differ a lot from main repo except ETH/ERC20 swap support.

[18-Jul-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes orderbooks showing g on the Bob but not propagating has been an issue at times from my experience, seems totally random and is likely a network issue I guess, but not really sure. Just try  restarting it and see what happens.

[18-Jul-18 10:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jansako do you have canbind:1 specified on your client script?

[18-Jul-18 12:36 PM] jansako#3330
I don't , using the 'stock' script, just checked. Is that a startup argument, or where exactly should it go?

add "canbind":1 if your node allows other nodes to connect to yours

[18-Jul-18 01:02 PM] jansako#3330
right, the question was where to put it and the exact syntax.

[18-Jul-18 01:03 PM] jansako#3330
should it be set that way OOTB/mentioned in the setup guide if it is important?

[18-Jul-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
stdbuf -oL $1 ./marketmaker "{"canbind":1,"gui":"nogui","client":1, "userhome":"/${HOME#"/"}", "passphrase":"$passphrase", "coins":$coins}" &

[18-Jul-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only one JSON in your post above, I put it into the JSON

[18-Jul-18 03:18 PM] tolken#2655
Jansako, I think this client script will get updated/overwritten when marketmaker updates itself, so I think you may want to periodically check to make sure it‚Äôs still in there, or make your own script named something else.

[18-Jul-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For my bobs I made my own, using only the coins I am using in the "coins" section and place it elsewhere.

[18-Jul-18 03:25 PM] jansako#3330
thank you all!

[18-Jul-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you want to use as small amount of stuff as possible IMO.

[18-Jul-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
reduce chance for bugs. But yes, canbind:1 and having no firewall on the bob is the best policy

[18-Jul-18 03:33 PM] jansako#3330
all configured & reset. Let's see if I can catch some alice's :-).

[18-Jul-18 03:33 PM] jansako#3330

add "canbind":1 if your node allows other nodes to connect to yours

[22-Jul-18 10:26 PM] ph03nix#3115
how would one know if their node allows other nodes to connect?

[22-Jul-18 10:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if it works, then it works.if not, then not. this is the problem with networking

[22-Jul-18 10:28 PM] ph03nix#3115
gotcha, thanks

[22-Jul-18 11:37 PM] tolken#2655
With my limited understanding I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I had a clear understanding of which ips have attempted to connect to me - what info they have exchanged with me - i might be able to better determine where things are going wrong.  Most of the time I have no idea if anyone is attempting to connect to me, yet I get lots of reserved UTXOs so someone appears to be connecting. I‚Äôm not sure what most errors mean yet, so that makes it challenging as well. I‚Äôve just rebuilt my system and will get it all back online soon. Hoping some of the issues will go away now. Shooting in the dark though.

[23-Jul-18 12:15 AM] cipi#4502
if your node is running on a server with a public IP and no firewall activated, then anybody can connect to you, if you are using a NATed home connection, then nobody can connect to you

[23-Jul-18 12:36 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi all criteria met. No firewall, canbind:1 Public ip etc.

[23-Jul-18 12:40 AM] tolken#2655
have done many bob and Alice trades. Got really bad a few weeks ago, could barely do alice trades for some reason. No idea what may have changed yet.

[23-Jul-18 12:42 AM] tolken#2655
I thought it was mainly non assetchain trades that where the problem, but even oot/kmd Alice trades are very hit and miss

[23-Jul-18 01:19 AM] ph03nix#3115
if you are using a NATed home connection, will forwarding these üëá  ports help?

[23-Jul-18 01:20 AM] ph03nix#3115
`RPC_port.7783 mypullport.7793 mypubport.7803`

[23-Jul-18 02:07 AM] cipi#4502
@ph03nix not really, because the used ports are not only the 2... on every swap bob tells alice to connect to a specific port and finish the swap... the port is chosen randomly, so you would need to forward all ports to make a difference

[23-Jul-18 02:17 AM] ph03nix#3115
understood, thank you cipi

[23-Jul-18 02:24 AM] tolken#2655
Isn‚Äôt the random just a way to improve chances of avoiding occupied/used ports?

[23-Jul-18 02:25 AM] tolken#2655
Isn‚Äôt canbind partly there to avoid some of the randomness and just let two peers talk directly to each other?

[23-Jul-18 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I *think* that canbind:0 uses the Full Relay nodes to create a connection, where as canbind:1 just binds to a random port and starts listening for Alice to connect.

[23-Jul-18 03:04 AM] Mylo#8306
```
cipi [12:00 PM]
yes, if you start marketmaker with `\"canbind\":1`, it must not be behind NAT or firewall, all ports have to be open... you could start without `canbind`, but it would not work so well and you wouldn't be able to do more then one swap at a time


blackjok3r [12:02 PM]
Yes I know this, what I mean is that with a marketmaker set with `canbind:1` set I have full orderbooks and very fast performance almost instantly after start... where as on my local computer using hyperdex or barterdex it takes 20mins to get orderbooks at times, and still after that only 20% of them are showing up.

grewalsatinder [1:44 PM]
we always need more FR nodes
more there are more better experience for DEX
```
from a history chat.  let's get to the bottom of FR nodes.

[23-Jul-18 03:04 AM] Mylo#8306
i snipped your comment @blackjok3r

[23-Jul-18 03:05 AM] Mylo#8306
there is not much documentation online for `canbind`

[23-Jul-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no... all it means is your not behind NAT and have no firewall... to trade as Alice, you dont need it at all.

[23-Jul-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its only for bobs, orderbooks and all that stuff has been pretty good for me latley. I had 5 concurrent swaps going on ZILLA KMD without issues. But some users are still complaining of stuck swaps... No idea whats going on there. üòï  The ZILLA chain was not mining blocks, but it should be now, so that cant be the issue. Maybe I need to make a pool and GPU mine ZILLA to make sure there are blocks flowing for sure.

[23-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Mylo#8306
set your notary to mine it

[23-Jul-18 03:39 AM] ph03nix#3115
i'm behind a NAT and i've had alice trade with my bob successfully a few times

[23-Jul-18 03:39 AM] ph03nix#3115
running the default client script...no `canbind` set at all

[23-Jul-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make one trade at a time with canbind:0

[23-Jul-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but while its happening anyone else trying to connect withh get "swap never started" and your UTXO's will get locked out

[23-Jul-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ZILLA is ondemand CPU blocks, so it wont mine. I am already mining it.

Trying to reinstall bdex cli using the macOS, I've done this many times now so I'm uncertain what could be wrong. Any idea why I may be getting a ```./build_static_nanomsg.sh: File '../OSlibs/osx/x86_64/libnanomsg-static.a' not found.``` error ? What should but isn't installing that?

[23-Jul-18 05:40 AM] ph03nix#3115
looks like you need to install nanomsg

Install nanomsg on Mac OSX

[23-Jul-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... check where the file actually is @tolken

[23-Jul-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I go that before... not on mac though... but you might have to rename it

[23-Jul-18 05:52 AM] tolken#2655
@ph03nix I‚Äôve never had to before but I‚Äôll check that out.

[23-Jul-18 05:54 AM] tolken#2655
@blackjok3r just so weird. I‚Äôll take a look, not entirely sure what to look for. Never had to do that before. I feel like it missing a step

[23-Jul-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It compiles nanomsg static library, but I think it copys the file to the wrong place

[23-Jul-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe you should just use artems build from here: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases
