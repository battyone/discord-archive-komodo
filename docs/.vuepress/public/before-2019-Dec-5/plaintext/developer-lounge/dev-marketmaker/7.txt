damn, surprised such low volume.  My bobs seem happy.

[09-Aug-18 03:50 AM] tolken#2655
Would love to see a version of Bdex in the future that matches trades via email or direct message. For exchange between known parties. So two people, without the ambiguities of p2p order matching, could easily do an OTC atomic swap.

[09-Aug-18 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Possible

[09-Aug-18 04:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Has to be another app

[09-Aug-18 04:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or service

[09-Aug-18 04:09 AM] tolken#2655
Maybe a consideration for mm2.0 ? Could be a useful mode.

[09-Aug-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a bounty of 25,000 KMD for the creation of such an app.

[09-Aug-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible with MM1 and I was going to create a PoC for this, but after reading the work by the artems on MM2 document... I think its probably best to work with them on adding functionality to  MM2 instead.

[09-Aug-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the amount of work required to work around the limitations of MM1, is quite large and expensive.

[09-Aug-18 05:19 AM] tolken#2655
That‚Äôs a sexy bounty. Seems like a natural extension to mm.

[09-Aug-18 05:23 AM] tolken#2655
Just saw some guy in telegram volunteering to be escrow for two people that wanted to exchange cryptos. Hah

[09-Aug-18 05:24 AM] tolken#2655
Your days are numbered, pal.

[13-Aug-18 09:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for all your patience and help @ComputerGenie @tolken @blackjok3r  a few weeks back üëÜ  with setting up the bob.
I managed to get one working thanks to your help before things got a bit crazy.
Back at it now!

My stuff is working reasonably well, but struggling to get eth trades to go through.

[13-Aug-18 03:55 PM] tolken#2655
Btc, bch, KMD, ltc all reading fairly reliably, Alice or bob side.

I haven't tried eth yet.

[13-Aug-18 04:43 PM] CrisF#3405
It's on the list though.

[14-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Mylo#8306
I'm testing out some marketmaker docs.
So far so good except my bobs are showing up on barterdex with no UTXO to trade in the barterdexGUI.

I've imported privkey with a label "smartaddress" to make thing easier
```
digibyte-cli importprivkey <theprivkey> "smartaddresslabel‚Äù false
```

I've sent some DGB to the smart address
My UTXO
```
$ digibyte-cli listunspent | jq '.[] | select(.label=="smartaddress")'

[14-Aug-18 06:04 AM] Mylo#8306
"max UTXO size" is 0, should it have a number?  like my max UTXO size from `listunspent`?

[14-Aug-18 06:15 AM] tolken#2655
@Mylo sure that‚Äôs your bob? The screenshot address isn‚Äôt the one you‚Äôre mentioning above.

[14-Aug-18 06:42 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes +ve.  `DMqzVS4bJyRjuL3abinPVMGPsMvjakigw6` is mentioned above.  Screenshot pop up matches - which is the highlighted black table row in sellers.  Clicking the "i" for info gets the pop up showing the same address.

The address on my BarterDEX GUI on the left is the Alice on my laptop.  @tolken 
Thanks for checking üòÉ

[14-Aug-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant import privkey like that

[14-Aug-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Restart DGB with -rescan without closing the marketmaker

[14-Aug-18 08:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
marketmaker will only do `importaddress` I am 99% sure, and will only check UTXO's ont he watch only address

[14-Aug-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have seen this behaviour a heap fo times. Either send the balance yourself or rescan the blockchain.

[14-Aug-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Mylo

[14-Aug-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you do the balance -> self option, make sure you keep marketmaker open, and it will "see" the utxos

[14-Aug-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you try a withdraw it will show something like "selected 0 fof 3 utxo" 
But fter you send the balance with the deamon, it will be able to select the UTXO.

[14-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thx mate, this is on bob side.  i'll rescan and and go feed myself!

[14-Aug-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rescan OR send balance

[14-Aug-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either will work

[14-Aug-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this will be on any side in native

[14-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Mylo#8306
```importaddress.(DGB DMqzVS4bJyRjuL3abinPVMGPsMvjakigw6) -> ({"result":null,"error":{"code":-4,"message":"The wallet already contains the private key for this address or script"},"id":"jl777"}
``` good to know.  maybe sending balance to self with a 15s block time DGB has would have been quicker.

[14-Aug-18 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you send balance while marketmaker is running, its 99% of the time perfectly fine in seeing the utxos

[14-Aug-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are already in the "wallet" it cant find them

[14-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Mylo#8306
hmmmm...ok v.handy

[14-Aug-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, its by design, if it didnt work like that it would ahve to rescan the whole blockchian on marketmakre load, that would suck lol.

[14-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Mylo#8306
yep makes sense.

[14-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Mylo#8306
good one for the rule book üòÉ

[14-Aug-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
easiest work around is to not have the privkey in the wallet, then send after marketmaker is alreay running

[14-Aug-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from another address

[14-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Mylo#8306

[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] tolken#2655
@Mylo sorry for misunderstanding Mylo

[15-Aug-18 08:35 PM] tolken#2655
I believe getprices api is this just an aggregate of P2P broadcasting prices that bdex collects, is that right? This might vary significant from CMC correct?  I‚Äôm trying to price my trades in btc, pairs that aren‚Äôt directly priced in btc like ltc/kmd. I‚Äôm leaning toward estimating the btc value of each using an external source like an exchange rather than bdex getprices. Does that seem like an ideal choice?

[15-Aug-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
getprices is what your node has seen most recently, no assurance it is anything like CMC

[15-Aug-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
cipi has a setup where he gets prices from external sources

[15-Aug-18 08:38 PM] tolken#2655
The slight concern is that for a 20min atomic swap (or longer) the price may drift more than I‚Äôd like, so I may have to grab the price from cex right at the start of an attempted trade.

[15-Aug-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, best to do it as soon as you see alicepayment

[15-Aug-18 08:39 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm pulling prices from external sources as well, bittrex and binance presently

[15-Aug-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then you know it is a matter of confirms before the trade completes

[15-Aug-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so a perfect time to issue the balancing trade to binance

[15-Aug-18 08:39 PM] tolken#2655
good call, I‚Äôll do that. That has been my trigger for everything,

[15-Aug-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
in the even the price moves more than 12.5%, you can just not send the bobpayment

[15-Aug-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt much consolation, but having a 12.5% worst case is better than a 12.6% worst case

[15-Aug-18 08:41 PM] tolken#2655
I figure this slippage will average out most of the time, so not too worried about it, but that‚Äôs an interesting idea.

[15-Aug-18 08:42 PM] tolken#2655
Adjusting pricing based on volatility might not be a bad idea either.

[15-Aug-18 08:43 PM] tolken#2655
I learned how to query native chains locally to confirm bob/Alice payments. That‚Äôs handy.

[20-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Andersen#8337

[20-Aug-18 08:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
not sure if that is what you mean. But you can trade on BarterDEX and inverse the trades on a CEX interacting with their API.
lets say:
you Sell on BarterDEX 10KMD for 0.1 LTC
on a CEX at the same time you Buy 0.1 LTC for 9 KMD
1KMD is your profit

[20-Aug-18 08:34 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this arbritrage with CEX, is there an app to do automatically it?

[20-Aug-18 08:34 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I remember something like this had been proposed months ago, not sure if anyone has been working on it

[20-Aug-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810

Hi, I've seen `trex (and  cryptopia) error getting marketsummaries` errors when my connection on autoprice drops.
I'm wondering if I can use those markets in my autoprice scrip instead of `CMC`.  Does anyone do this if it can be done?
(eg. `"refrel\":\"coinmarketcap\"` replaced with `"refrel\":\"trex\"`) ?

[22-Aug-18 10:21 AM] cipi#4502
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"BTC\",\"margin\":0.03}"` is doing exactly that... it tries Bittrex and then Cryptopia

[22-Aug-18 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @cipi !  So `"refrel\":\"coinmarketcap\"` isn't needed?

[22-Aug-18 11:27 AM] cipi#4502
no, only if you want to use cmc

[22-Aug-18 11:31 AM] CrisF#3405
If I wanted to use prices from just one exchange (eg. Bittrex) and not use cryptopia etc, could I use ```"refrel\":\"trex\"```?

[22-Aug-18 11:31 AM] cipi#4502
no, afaik mm tries Bittrex and if the coin is not listed there, it uses Cryptopia

[22-Aug-18 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405

Hey guys,
I am rewriting the dicoapp with React, Redux and Webpack. You can view the source here: https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e. 
The application need to displayed transactions when it start. I realized that it was quite slow and make poor user experience.
Is there any param I can set to speed up marketmaker app? (using cache .v.v.). I can cache transactions in application level but just wonder.

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
DB/SWAPS folder has all the pending swaps

[02-Sep-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you do need to do some app side caching

[02-Sep-18 07:12 PM] namhoang28#4328
@jl777c uhm, thank you!

[02-Sep-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
dont call swapstatus without requestid/quoteid, as that will take quite a long time

[02-Sep-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
one way is to use recentswaps to get list of recent swaps

[02-Sep-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and swapstatus(requestid,quoteid) for those swaps that are still in progress

[07-Sep-18 11:40 AM] luke#8628
Hello! I am reading through the BarterDex api docs (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/barterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category#buy) and under the "buy" method it says that "If a match is not found, a bid order will be added in the orderbook". However, when I issue a buy order that doesn't have a match, nothing is added to the orderbook. I can see the buy order being broadcast to the network, and then it times out with a "time expired for Alice_request". Whereas if I run "setprice" instead, I can immediately see the ask/bid in the orderbook. Is this misdocumented, or am I missing something? maybe I need to add some parameter to the buy order to get it added to the orderbook and stay there for a certain duration?

@luke  I could be mistaken, but that sounds like an error in the documentation to me. Afaik, if you buy and nothing happens, the Alice request expires. The GTC flag will cause BarterDex to repeatedly try and ‚Äúbuy‚Äù periodically until you stop it. To set a price, I believe you‚Äôre making a Bob configuration where your request is broadcast to the orderbooks then passively awaits Alice requests.

[07-Sep-18 12:43 PM] luke#8628
@tolken  yes, that lines up with what I have experienced as well. thanks! I'm not familiar with the GTC flag. Is the GTC flag a UI flag in the BarterDex app, or is that a flag that can be set in the RPC data directly?

[07-Sep-18 07:08 PM] cipi#4502
GTC is in the GUI... best way to do orderbook-entries is `autoprice` though
