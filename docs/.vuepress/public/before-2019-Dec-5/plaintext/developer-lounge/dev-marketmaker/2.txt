those are the two critical datapoints

[30-Jun-18 02:22 PM] barv#0867
setting up a barterdex bob and the chips  electrum doesn't seem to work. feedback from ./setpassphrase: {"coin":"CHIPS","installed":false,"height":-1,"balance":0,"status":"active","electrum":"electrum2.cipig.net:10053"
any idea what could wring here?

[30-Jun-18 02:22 PM] tolken#2655
Calling balance and the sum of listspent are the same, both lower than they should be. Listspent was missing a couple 65kmd UTXOs, restarting bdex, the UTXOs reappeared via listunspent. The sum of listunspent and balance remain equal. @jl777c

[30-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
native?

[30-Jun-18 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
its possible some utxo are being resrved

[30-Jun-18 02:24 PM] tolken#2655
yes all native

[30-Jun-18 02:26 PM] tolken#2655
I believe they were reserved at some point in the day.  But it was likely many hours earlier. Didn‚Äôt seem like any recent trades we‚Äôre starting.

[30-Jun-18 02:31 PM] tolken#2655
could i safety do something like check for pending swaps - if there are none and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù != actual balance... purge some data file and/or restart BarterDex?

[30-Jun-18 02:31 PM] tolken#2655
not sure what bdex data file may exist that i could safely delete, if any.

[30-Jun-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
recentswaps

[30-Jun-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that would show the ones that are pending

[30-Jun-18 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_uses_
`    pending=$(curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:$port" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"recentswaps\",\"limit\":3}" | jq '.pending.timeleft') # check if awiting a swap process for any of our last 3 swaps`

[30-Jun-18 02:33 PM] tolken#2655
Alright, if zero pending, but old reserved UTXOs, that might be a good time to restart bdex to flush this out.

[30-Jun-18 02:35 PM] tolken#2655
Is Pending Swaps info directly derived from the SWAPS data files?

[30-Jun-18 02:36 PM] tolken#2655
Or is that unique data from SWAP stages data?

[30-Jun-18 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
recent swaps uses DB/SWAPS and data in RAM

[30-Jun-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if there are missing utxo, good time to restart

[30-Jun-18 02:55 PM] tolken#2655
Thanks, I‚Äôll see if I can clearly detect when this discrepancy manifests and handle it.

[30-Jun-18 03:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I'm getting this
 ```~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts$ ./client
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7783: Connection refused```
Anyone know what I can do to fix it?

[30-Jun-18 03:01 PM] CrisF#3405
I've also been seeing this
```max rpc threads spawned and alive 0 <- 1```

[30-Jun-18 03:11 PM] tolken#2655
@CrisF the first one typically just means your bdex isn‚Äôt running.

[30-Jun-18 03:12 PM] tolken#2655
might mean misconfig, might mean many things,  but you‚Äôll certainly get that if bdex is offline.

[30-Jun-18 03:13 PM] CrisF#3405
It pauses there and then continues
```./client

[30-Jun-18 03:13 PM] tolken#2655
I actually use that failed response as a means to detect if bdex has died and restart it automatically.

[30-Jun-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`./client
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7783: Connection refused
Already up-to-date.`
In that context, it means that the "just in case" kill of mm found no running mm to kill

[30-Jun-18 03:16 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôd just kill market maker anyway. That client script is too compassionate.

[30-Jun-18 03:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Could this be related to why I get these messages when trying to run native?
```max rpc threads spawned and alive 0 <- 1

[30-Jun-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You get a debug for what it did, because that's how a debug output works

[30-Jun-18 03:23 PM] CrisF#3405
Like this `tail -f debug.log`?

[30-Jun-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no

[30-Jun-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the output you see in terminal when you run marketmaker from a terminal is known as a 'debug output'

[30-Jun-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
some things in the debug are displayed for no other reason than to allow for debugging of issues

[30-Jun-18 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I've not been able to figure out what is wrong from that.

[30-Jun-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm still not sure what you think is "wrong"

[30-Jun-18 03:30 PM] tolken#2655
Is this your new Linux install chris?

[30-Jun-18 03:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, and on my other system too.

[30-Jun-18 03:31 PM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie  I can't see my balances in native.

[30-Jun-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@CrisF what call are you using?

[30-Jun-18 03:32 PM] tolken#2655
balances for all (which coins) or just some?

[30-Jun-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:$port" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"balance\",\"coin\":\"$Coin\",\"address\":\"$smartAddy\"}"`

[30-Jun-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
?

[30-Jun-18 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
getcoin, balances, getwalletinfo. basically every call I could find.

[30-Jun-18 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
this looks ok @CrisF

[30-Jun-18 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"getcoin, balances, getwalletinfo. basically every call I could find."
Are you using calls or the local scripts?

[30-Jun-18 03:35 PM] CrisF#3405
previously only KMD showed a balance, but now not that.

[30-Jun-18 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
the `./client` script has a kill command of marketmaker in the beginning fo the script that ensures clean start of marketmaker

[30-Jun-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
this message while startup is ok `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7783: Connection refused`

[30-Jun-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The msg comes from attempt to call the stop api before the kill

[30-Jun-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no mm to stop = no connection to mm

[30-Jun-18 03:37 PM] CrisF#3405
{
    "userpass": "{{ myuserpass  }}",
    "method": "getcoin",
    "coin": "KMD"
}

[30-Jun-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the json is connected to what?

[30-Jun-18 03:38 PM] CrisF#3405
That's from insomnia connected to barterdex after `./client``setpassphrase``enable`

[30-Jun-18 03:39 PM] tolken#2655
When you call ‚Äúbalance‚Äù where are you getting your kmd/bch addresses from?

[30-Jun-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@CrisF have you tried *not* using insomnia and just the actual scripts?

[30-Jun-18 03:40 PM] CrisF#3405
Originally, but not recently.

[30-Jun-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the 1st step to sorting out issues is almost always to remove any extraneous things - i.e., how do you know mm is having an issue and not layer2 app if you only use layer 2 app?

[30-Jun-18 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
@tolken I got the addresses from bdex gui that I imported into cli. (edit: I used the same passphrase)

[30-Jun-18 03:45 PM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie  I will do it without insomnia.

[30-Jun-18 03:49 PM] CrisF#3405
The smartaddress shows a balance in electrum for ltc and bch but I've never been able to get it to show up in native.

[30-Jun-18 03:49 PM] CrisF#3405
What address should I be using for those coins?

[30-Jun-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"calcaddress\",\"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\",\"coin\":\"COINX\"}"`

[30-Jun-18 03:51 PM] tolken#2655
@CrisF and these balances are the same ones you see when you do a ‚Äúgetcoins‚Äù ? I‚Äôd double check/ verify they are the same

[30-Jun-18 03:52 PM] CrisF#3405
KMD was and nothing for other coins (0 balance)

[30-Jun-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and you're pulling from the latest dev/jl777 git?

[30-Jun-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You should get like:
`$ curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"balances\"}"
[{"coin":"KMD","balance":10187.31266256,"KMDvalue":10187.31266256,"zcredits":0}, {"coin":"COQUI","balance":24294.35793251,"KMDvalue":3606.85162441}, {"coin":"SUPERNET","balance":45.33400204,"KMDvalue":1399.85278199}, {"coin":"total","balance":15194.01706896}]`

`$ curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"balance\",\"coin\":\"KMD\",\"address\":\"RUdNzKNzsyebRdDoprrkDZum1PkGoMY4RP\"}"
{"result":"success","coin":"KMD","address":"RUdNzKNzsyebRdDoprrkDZum1PkGoMY4RP","balance":10189.33835242,"zcredits":0,"zdebits":{"swaps":[.......],"pendingswaps":10.81792440}}`

[30-Jun-18 03:57 PM] tolken#2655
@CrisF sorry to clarify, by doing a getcoins, I mean to check the addresses associated with each coin. See if each respective address is the one you expect it to be.

[30-Jun-18 04:05 PM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie  `calcaddress` finished

[30-Jun-18 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and?

[30-Jun-18 04:11 PM] CrisF#3405
`balances` 
`[]`

[30-Jun-18 04:13 PM] CrisF#3405
`balance`
`{"result":"success","coin":"LTC","address":"LZGArBt9CtEt5eg2N13FERZJeKPtW8ZSKC","balance":0}`

[30-Jun-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and you've done an "init" whereby you enabled coins?

[30-Jun-18 04:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, sorry I messed that up.

[30-Jun-18 04:16 PM] CrisF#3405
That was the wrong calcaddress passphrase I used.

[30-Jun-18 04:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I enabled it.

[30-Jun-18 04:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Will calcaddress again.

[30-Jun-18 04:17 PM] tolken#2655
Have you verified getcoins addresses are what you expect them to be yet?

[30-Jun-18 04:18 PM] tolken#2655
I think that shows all the addresses you need.

[30-Jun-18 04:30 PM] CrisF#3405
`{"result":"success","coin":"LTC","address":"LZ8v9pR7a4j2zy7BDRU5MdQztwBDWmm8YD","balance":0}`
The correct passphrase also shows no balance.

[30-Jun-18 04:30 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll check getcoin now.

[30-Jun-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Is the passphrase for that addy the same passphrase you're logged into marketmaker with?

[30-Jun-18 04:34 PM] tolken#2655
If this doesn‚Äôt work; go full vanilla. Don‚Äôt try and link up your existing bdex passphrase/address. Create a new one from scratch, send some test funds, verify that works first. I suspect you aren‚Äôt getting the right addr.

[30-Jun-18 04:34 PM] CrisF#3405
`{"result":"success","enabled":2,"disabled":84,"coin":{"coin":"LTC","installed":true,"height":0,"balance":0,"KMDvalue":0,"status":"active","smartaddress":"LZ8v9pR7a4j2zy7BDRU5MdQztwBDWmm8YD","rpc":"127.0.0.1:9332","pubtype":48,"p2shtype":5,"wiftype":176,"txfee":100000}}`

[30-Jun-18 04:34 PM] CrisF#3405
getcoin

[30-Jun-18 04:36 PM] tolken#2655
that‚Äôs using getcoin or getcoins?

[30-Jun-18 04:37 PM] CrisF#3405
The address passphrase and setpassphrase passphrase are not the same.

[30-Jun-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
going way back to way back; do you have your LTC wallet config set to daemon/server = 1?

[30-Jun-18 04:38 PM] CrisF#3405
@ tolken, it was getcoin.

[30-Jun-18 04:38 PM] tolken#2655
Use getcoins, not getcoin

[30-Jun-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"The address passphrase and setpassphrase passphrase are not the same."
Then that's likely 1/2 or all of your issue

[30-Jun-18 04:39 PM] tolken#2655
Agreed

[30-Jun-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mm will use the pass that's in the file; if that pass is not the pass for the addy you want to use, then mm doesn't have access to the one you want to use

[30-Jun-18 04:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I hope so.  I'll try now.

[30-Jun-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
think of it as a house
Just because George knows your address, doesn't mean  he can get through your locked door without the correct key

[30-Jun-18 04:44 PM] CrisF#3405
Will the userpass change now, too?

[30-Jun-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
userpass will be passphrase specific

[30-Jun-18 04:45 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok,

[30-Jun-18 04:50 PM] CrisF#3405
Does the userpass come from my `komodo.conf rpcpassword=`

[30-Jun-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
userpass comes from an encryption of passphrase (in the simplest of terms)
not related to any coin's config

[30-Jun-18 04:52 PM] tolken#2655
@CrisF no

[30-Jun-18 04:56 PM] CrisF#3405
I might have misunderstood @ComputerGenie .
```ComputerGenie - Today at 1:32 AM
Is the passphrase for that addy the same passphrase you're logged into marketmaker with?
```
