really it goes quite fast, just a lot of adding NSPV_globals *gp, to all the functions that need it

[28-Jul-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes understood. Will definatly have a go at it.

[28-Jul-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
multi-coin nspv would then enable the cross chain notarization validation and also the chains cluster cross chain migrate

[28-Jul-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so definitely makes sense as the next step forward in nspv land

[28-Jul-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it goes from the best superlite client to a multicoin superlite and once we get the html wallet pages working, it will even be easy to use

[28-Jul-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
Notarizaions not validating on ILN, but work on KMD just fine. Its not recognising any of the sigs

[28-Jul-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looked up txid on explorer and it definatly is a vlaid notarization

[28-Jul-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
strange, i used ILN to validate notarizations. let me check

[28-Jul-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if I broke something or not, because I tested on KMD only...

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
ready for reorgs, just tag me

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ILN is broken for me

[28-Jul-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any idea why it would do that?

[28-Jul-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its fgailing the sig check, but it passes on KMD

[28-Jul-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
dev branch is broken too, so not your changes

[28-Jul-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm ok

[28-Jul-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
let me update the fullnodes

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
probably was that fix of the hardcoded access into the pubkey structure in the notarization validate func

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
found it

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its using height instead of timestamp to select notary nodes

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! yes that would do it. can you fix it?

[28-Jul-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can try

[28-Jul-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
may be wrong but i;lkl check it out

[28-Jul-19 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its using season 1. I will just hardocde it now to test reortgs then try fix after that

[28-Jul-19 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know the problem, its calling blocktime function which is a remote call

[28-Jul-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but ILN was validating before... very strange

[28-Jul-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
oh and blocktime isnt cached, so it if times out it wont know in time

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... the code I have needs to request the data then validat it when it arrives

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant call it inside a receive of something else

[28-Jul-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doenst work,... took me a LONG time to get the txid for notarzxations validating

[28-Jul-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so the timestamp needs to be passed into the notarization function

[28-Jul-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Jul-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works fine with hardcoded season

[28-Jul-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so you know how to fix it?

[28-Jul-19 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can yes; @Alright  I have it working for reorg test at least

[28-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Alright#0419

need me to keep an eye on anything in specific or just reorg a few blocks?

[28-Jul-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we just need to see if my nSPV node will stay inm sync if blocks are going backwards

[28-Jul-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if that makes sense? just reorg it ðŸ˜ƒ

[28-Jul-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
chain isnt moving atm though

[28-Jul-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
need to set up a tx sender to get the chain moving

[28-Jul-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
reorged 4 blocks

no owrries with 3 blocks

[28-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
well?

[28-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
keep doing them or what

[28-Jul-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Jul-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe need more than 3 to be sure

[28-Jul-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im 99% sure under heavy reorg it will just say its no longer in sync until the reorg is over.

[28-Jul-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming that is the case, just not doing tx when it isnt in sync is decent protection, for big amounts wait for all utxo to be notarized

[28-Jul-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has sync detection for the chain globally and for each peer

[28-Jul-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the chain tip links back to the last notarizaion its in sync.

[28-Jul-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if a block with a lower height arrives it ignores it

[28-Jul-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and waits for the chain to advance

[28-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this is quite an improvement over electrum clients!

[28-Jul-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It saves all block hashes, just incase it needs them to link back if the main chains order changes from reorg

[28-Jul-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
up to a max of 128 blocks, when it gets to 128 blocksit clears the oldest 64 and waits for the next notarization

[28-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
you just want perpetual reorgs?

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
will script it and leave it running if you want

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, I guess evena  censorship attack lol

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
lost my scripts for that ðŸ˜­

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Alright#0419
man I had them tweaked so well

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
meh, I think that would totally fuck it anyway

[28-Jul-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or well it would just not be able to sync until you stopped

[28-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
I'll redo them if you think it's relevant

[28-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
censorship

[28-Jul-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont think it is really, not something that ever happens

[28-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r did like 5 or 6

[28-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
stopping right now to script this then will just leave it running

[28-Jul-19 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems like its handling it ok, 50% of ndoes say not in sync

[28-Jul-19 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It wont fix itslef on a chain that doesnt move forwards though

[28-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
**use POS**

[28-Jul-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wihtout someone else minign the chain its hard to way what just happened  lol

[28-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
someone else is

@jl777c  
This seems the easiest way to fix it, its working for me with my own ILN node, but I assume its hard forking. Fetching another request and then being able to match them up on the nSPV side is tricky and prone to error

[28-Jul-19 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It should simply not use the timestamp variable for the other notarizaions. Only fills it for getinfo call

[28-Jul-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a new version for nspv. if you are confident this will fix it, do the two PR, bump the protocol version and i will update all the fullnodes

[28-Jul-19 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is there somehwer to se protocol version in the daemon?

[28-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo

[28-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, for fullnode side?

[28-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
there is nowhere yet, maybe it should be added to getinfo on the fullnode side too

[28-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
updating the fullnodes

[28-Jul-19 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesdnt seem to break anything here, but I dont have any ILN to spend to test it.
