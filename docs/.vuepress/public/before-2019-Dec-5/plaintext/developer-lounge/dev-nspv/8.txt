If it runs on a rasp it might very well run on a phone some of them have 4gb+ ram now

[06-Jul-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, komodod nspv client eating less than 100 mb ram

[06-Jul-19 02:22 PM] TonyL#3577
on smartwatches and etc it's possible to run in theory I think

[06-Jul-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
broadcast KMD txs from toaster - thats the future üòÖ

[06-Jul-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
CC signing for some things wont be hard, for others, quite difficult

[06-Jul-19 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Do you need clients spam attack on KMD node?

[06-Jul-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
no, lets keep attacks to the ILN node

I shutdown spammers yesterday, can prepare new server image with latest komodod and spin (if ILN fullnode updated)

[06-Jul-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, all the nodes updated

[06-Jul-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
btw now to run nSPV client node zcash params are mandatory - is there any way to avoid it?

[06-Jul-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that skips loading, but it might still have other checks for it

[06-Jul-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
so all what client need now is 199M komodod + 9M komodo-cli

[06-Jul-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
And like a 100M free ram

[06-Jul-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577

I'm ready to noob test. Downloaded. How do I launch haha? In the kind that needs basic instructions

[06-Jul-19 04:25 PM] daemonfox#6136 (pinned)
launch a fresh daemon but instead of normal command, add a specific addnode=5.9.102.210 which is James main full node, then also add the nSPV=1 flag

[06-Jul-19 04:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
./komodod -ac_name=ILN -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -nSPV=1

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ILN nspv_getinfo

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] allbits#5898
I'm in the src directory. I don't see komodod

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
^ should then return info using the nspv command in help

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh did you build it?

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] allbits#5898
Also, are we doing ILN only, or is KMD possible?

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
Was only told to try ILN so far

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] allbits#5898
No, download only. I've never built anything

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
but was in the middle of trying to stand up a VRSC capable full node and nSPV to it

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
run this...

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
cd ..

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
you shoul de back in komodo

[06-Jul-19 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
then run...

[06-Jul-19 04:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh

[06-Jul-19 04:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
then run...

[06-Jul-19 04:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
./zcutil/build.sh -j#

[06-Jul-19 04:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
except # is how many threads you want to build with

[06-Jul-19 04:30 PM] allbits#5898
Got it. Yes I've done that before on native. Didn't know that was "build". Didn't know was required for nSPV. Makes sense tho

[06-Jul-19 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
also change branch

[06-Jul-19 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
git branch -a

[06-Jul-19 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
shows a list

[06-Jul-19 04:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
you wanna run...

[06-Jul-19 04:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
git checkout nSPV

[06-Jul-19 04:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
then run that final build command

[06-Jul-19 04:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
@jl777c if I start a VRSC node with this build... and then nSPV to it is there any reason it would not work? I know its all ALPHA and at own risk... just wanna check with you if you know any reason i shouldnt bother yet.

[06-Jul-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
my tree doesnt support VRSC, that is a source level fork

[06-Jul-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so my nSPV changes would need to be merged into VRSC for that\

[06-Jul-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you can test with my KMD nSPV fullnode

[06-Jul-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok so KMD testing

[06-Jul-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -nSPV=1 -addnode=23.254.165.16 &

[06-Jul-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont even need to download the zcash params

[06-Jul-19 04:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
gotcha

[06-Jul-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
too easy

[06-Jul-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
You make this stuff look simple J

[06-Jul-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it was simple!

[06-Jul-19 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
a very novel solution indeed

dont use address with any big funds

[06-Jul-19 06:07 PM] allbits#5898
Ok, won't use hollowman's address.

[06-Jul-19 06:18 PM] allbits#5898
So, I've logged in successfully using wif. To spend to a different address I use nspv_spend? Do I then need to nspv_broadcast?

[06-Jul-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Jul-19 06:21 PM] allbits#5898
noob friendly confirmed

[06-Jul-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
presto! a cli wallet

[06-Jul-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
theoretically it supports collecting rewards, but doesnt set nlocktime yet

[06-Jul-19 06:24 PM] allbits#5898
Love it. That was fun. Thanks!

[06-Jul-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i made it set nLockTime for KMD now and it should also collect rewards. let me know if it works

[06-Jul-19 06:32 PM] allbits#5898
I see you added getnewaddress for nSPV mode!

[06-Jul-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i realized it was disabled and inconvenient to have to make wif externally

[06-Jul-19 06:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
id paste a pic but cant...

[06-Jul-19 06:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
But live Agama lite wallet just picked up my nSPV transaction of KMD through your node

[06-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
with latest version? nLockTime isnt set, i fixed that not too long ago

[06-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i have it calculated total rewards and spending it (i think), but forgot to set nLockTime

[06-Jul-19 06:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
idk... i just did a spend and then a broadcast of 0.01 to test to myself

[06-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
when did you last update?

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then signed into AGAMA 5.7.3 Verus lite with WIF and saw the TX come in

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] allbits#5898
So here's a noob question.  When you update the code, I have to rebuild from scratch again (that seems to take twenty minutes or so)?

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
i recompiled not long agao

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
update again

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
like third time today ive built this

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i built it 134 times today

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits after you build it once

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
just go to ~/komodo/src

[06-Jul-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
git pull; make

[06-Jul-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
@daemonfox i am not exaggerating

[06-Jul-19 06:39 PM] allbits#5898
Ok! Can I get a verbatim command for git pull and make please?

[06-Jul-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
git pull; make

[06-Jul-19 06:40 PM] allbits#5898
Haha ok

[06-Jul-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
cd ~/komodo/src

[06-Jul-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
git pull;make

[06-Jul-19 06:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that faster than ./zcutil/build.sh -j3

[06-Jul-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Jul-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
only works after you already did a build

[06-Jul-19 06:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol ok so ill try that .next time

[06-Jul-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
make will just do what needs to be done

[06-Jul-19 06:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
so... should it not have worked when i did it before?

[06-Jul-19 06:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
the tx has a confirm

[06-Jul-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
until you build successfully,make likely wont work
