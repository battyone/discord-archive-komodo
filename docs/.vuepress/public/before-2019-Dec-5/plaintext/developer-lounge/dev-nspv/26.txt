because BSV attacks/etc

[25-Jul-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm not sure who told me that now, im confused lol

[25-Jul-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
saying that a fullnode wont reorg more than 10 blocks is not a checkpoint

[25-Jul-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it also is subject to a chain split attack if a 10 block reorg is broadcast to half the network at just the right time

[25-Jul-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
a superlite client relies on fullnode to tell it what the current chain is. so which node will it trust?

[25-Jul-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it has no way to know which fullnode is on the mainchain or the attacker chain

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV, all the signatures are validated (using a purely local bruteforce validation of the notarization tx)

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, understood.

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
superlite clients follow the chain that their server follows, just like Electrum

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent about 3H last night getting that notarization validation working

[25-Jul-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
clever stuff

[25-Jul-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c does nSPV randomly choose to connect to different servers or is it possible to get "stuck" on one "malicious" node?

[25-Jul-19 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it randomy chooses most of the time, We need more nodes though.

[25-Jul-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
Electrum has such problems with evil servers

[25-Jul-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say all notaries at least  right?

[25-Jul-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Or does that allow people to dos them 🤔

[25-Jul-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
we can use Cloudflare

[25-Jul-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
use DNS and have that DNS record point to various NN ip's

[25-Jul-19 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
spiritually similar to a DNS seed

[25-Jul-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the client finds peers just like a normal, node does. Then connects to up to 1000 of them I think.

[25-Jul-19 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got that working last night aswell

[25-Jul-19 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c that ZIP requires changing the tx header format, ugh

[25-Jul-19 03:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got some basic functionality up at http://oracle.earth/nspv_login/
totally unsecure tho :D
needs a bit more error handling too, crashed out a couple of times when method times out

[25-Jul-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
currently, it updates the current height based on getinfo height being higher than the last

[25-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we do need to add validation that the new height prevBlockhash -> prev -> ... latest notarization

[25-Jul-19 03:11 PM] TonyL#3577
yay! let's test :)
```ls | grep .exe
nspv.exe```

{Reactions}
🙏 yassinheart 

[25-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is the max height and traces back to the most recent notarization, it seems it is the right chain and right height

[25-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as the latest notarization is updated, that also needs to be validated

[25-Jul-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with those two validations, you just need to have one honest peer to get onto the mainchain

[25-Jul-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this is similar to the PoW risk profile. a 100% eclipsed node, well not much can be done if all your peers are evil, but a single honest peer against 1000 evil nodes, that single honest peer is enough to get onto the main chain. this is the power of PoW

[25-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r does this make sense? it is fundamental to the PoW concept

[25-Jul-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I get it.

[25-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
single honest node overpowering all the evil nodes, just due to the PoW work. in our case, due to knowing about the latest notarization

[25-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you want to take a stab at updating the getinfo logic?

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
in superlite.h, where it gets the getinfo message, right now it just checks the height

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
that needs to be changed to tracing back the headers and also updating the latest notarization

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. That seems to be giving me some problems elswhere aswell.

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
sort of fits into the gettransaction logic

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and this will filter out bad nodes that are bad just because they are not in sync

[25-Jul-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for gettransaction if you dont  enter a height I made it use the tip. Which means the tx wont validate. because it canot scan forwards.

getinfo now returns protocolversion. oldernodes are backward compatible and will just return 0

[25-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r we did some saturation load tests and with 850+ peers doing full saturation requests, the fullnode did go up to 150% CPU load, but that is a crazy level of peers as normal superlites would be doing 1% that level, so that is estimated 100,000 normal superlite clients per fullnode. my 10 nodes i have setup could well support 1 million superlite clients

[25-Jul-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i will call the superlite that does crosschain between any two chains in a cluster the "superwallet" as it is a superset of the existing wallet

[25-Jul-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice. I have pulled down those changes I think. just reading some code for this headers thing, gettransaction works, but its not very user friendly atm, returns some unexpected things.

[25-Jul-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will fetch the tx, but using a tip height isnt any good without the check forwards from the last notarization.

[25-Jul-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is why i suggest the height /hdrs validation

[25-Jul-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just trying to find what to use, still have a more to get up to speed on

[25-Jul-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
once you understand hdrsproof (which is a subset of gettransaction), then the hdrs validation wont be so bad, it is just the same logic to do for the prevblockhash checking

[25-Jul-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[25-Jul-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
probably would be good to share code for doing the backwards headers thing

[25-Jul-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I thaught something liek that already may exist. But it doesnt so thats what im trying to work out

[25-Jul-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need a special mode on the fullnode side to just return a specific set of headers, like if the nextheight is 0, that would tell the fullnode to return all the headers until the latest notarization

[25-Jul-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! currently fullnode getntzsproofresp returns error if there is no nextht

[25-Jul-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so you just need to add code there to special case it and have it return all the most recent headers. the superlite side should be able to gracefully handle missing ntz tx data

[25-Jul-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo_nSPV_fullnode.h (you do need to become familiar with the fullnode handling of the superlite client requests to do such changes) line 463 is a good place for this

[25-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
internally it is a hash that is sent to the getntzsproofresp function, not a height, this avoids the confusion about what height the notarization is at vs what it notarized
