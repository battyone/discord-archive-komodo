nspv uses a single threaded model, sometimes the network request doesnt come back in time

[25-Jul-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
reissuing the command will usually fix it as it will use things from the local RAM cache and avoid the timeout

[25-Jul-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if you get retcodes of all 0, then it is ready to broadcast

[25-Jul-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
even if you dont, as long as it has scriptSig for all vins, it should still work

[25-Jul-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
max of 64 vins, so this is not for any address with a lot of small utxo

good, so the fix for oversize tx worked. still there is a 64kb limit now, but that should be sufficient for all <64 utxo tx with normal vins.

[25-Jul-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly possible to make some edge case >64kb tx, but those will not be supported by nspv

[25-Jul-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r i added a NSPV_methods[] array that describes how to map values in a params[] array to key:value json fields. when adding a new api call with parameters you need to add the appropriate entry in the NSPV_methods array

[25-Jul-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nice, started looking at GetTransaction, will do this tonight

[25-Jul-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810

that defines the order of the parameters and what type they need to be it will print the updated argjson after creating new fields based on the params array, so internally it is always using the "key":value

[25-Jul-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810

you can look in the _NSPV_JSON function  all api calls

[25-Jul-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if ( strcmp(method,"apiname") == 0 ) <- that means it is an api call

hdrsproof scans backwards from the prevheight to find the first notarization, forward from nextheight for the first notarization

then it gets both notarizations

i err on the side of getting a larger range of blocks between notarizations

[25-Jul-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181

doesnt hurt too much to send back 20 hdrs vs 10 hdrs

as you know the exact location of notarization txid is not deterministic

[25-Jul-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
though we do know that a notarization for height must happen after that height

[25-Jul-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes and  as there could be reorged notas under rare circumstance more range is much safer./

[25-Jul-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
just spin up a nspv for each chain

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
use the nSPV method to validate the tx on the other chain

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then submit the proofs required using dimxy backup method from importcoins

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
since you can dynamically spin up and connect to a new chain via nspv in seconds, there isnt even a need to stay connected to all the chains in the cluster, can just do it on demand

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
which would be a very cool crosschain wallet

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
make a cluster of N chains

[25-Jul-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
of course the fullnode will use the dimxy baggage claim method

[25-Jul-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but the multichain client would be able to construct the required proofs as gettransaction returns the txproof
