too funny

[05-Jul-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the desttxid are the KMD txid

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow getinfo is the only call that doesnt work

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
very strange

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
very

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i will keep an eye out for it

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
and this is straight Ubuntu 16.04 VM in hyper-V

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
no frills

[05-Jul-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is some sort of bug in my code as all the other messages are working

are you on this commit?

[05-Jul-19 06:11 AM] TonyL#3577
just in case

[05-Jul-19 06:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
im on whatever seeting the branch to nSPV and git pull has it on

[05-Jul-19 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
Maybe this will serve as a good example. 
I created new function to scan notarizations DB forwards, along with existing backwards. Should enable a very fast return of a notarization range.

yes, i found it and figured out how to do it. seems easy enough

[05-Jul-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Given a height, you can call each function once, and it will return the noatization neither side.

[05-Jul-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
that was the next thing i was going to do as it gets the fullnode side feature complete

[05-Jul-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, just letting you know its there, I had to make it for the CC I am working on.

aha, same commit. quite strange that this call not working on your side

[05-Jul-19 06:14 AM] TonyL#3577
did you try to sync in non spv mode before? maybe some files in ~/.komodo/ILN affecting

[05-Jul-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i will change how that call works

[05-Jul-19 06:14 AM] TonyL#3577
just crazy ideas ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Jul-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is done a bit differently than others

[05-Jul-19 06:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
im applying some updates to this VM didnt realize how out of date it was

[05-Jul-19 06:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
same...

[05-Jul-19 06:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
ill check back for the next build commit

[05-Jul-19 06:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
Just to check... if I run it without the -nSPV=1, i am then a full node and as many conenctions as you config to allow can use my node jas their -addnode=

[05-Jul-19 06:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
maxconnections=XXX in conf file?

[05-Jul-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the effect

[05-Jul-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual logic is fully decentralized

[05-Jul-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
an nSPV client will reject any node that doesnt provide nSPV services

[05-Jul-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV branch enables nSPV services for fullnodes

[05-Jul-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so with the p2p networking having a few nSPV enabled fullnodes, eventually the nSPV node will find them, of course much more efficient to just point them at one directly

[05-Jul-19 06:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok im trying to reverse it now and test that myself

[05-Jul-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
after majority of people update to nSPV enabled nodes, then most any node will provide nSPV services, so this state of sparse nSPV support is just during testing

[05-Jul-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the cool part is that we are able to test nSPV with the live mainnet, without disrupting it at all

[05-Jul-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and basically all full nodes perform function similar to electrum servers, automaticallly

[05-Jul-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and of course the data set it fine tuned to be 1000x more efficient than an SPV headers only client

[05-Jul-19 06:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok... is there a perk OTHER than solving this decentralized issue to a node deciding to provide nSPV services? Do they earn anything... do they contribute to the other asset accumulation in any way?

[05-Jul-19 06:24 AM] daemonfox#6136
or is this a 50/50 we all want it so we all support it as a use cost?

[05-Jul-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is part of the p2p messaging

[05-Jul-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
all fullnodes are delivering blocks to the network

[05-Jul-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
no cost

[05-Jul-19 06:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c how does the memo field and nspv work ?

[05-Jul-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
what memo field?

[05-Jul-19 06:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
ðŸ˜¦

[05-Jul-19 06:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
well, wondering if nSPV has support for shielded transactions

[05-Jul-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv is about proving a txid happened or not

[05-Jul-19 06:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
shielded txid ?

[05-Jul-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
proven via notarizations, merkleroots

[05-Jul-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
txid is a hash of the raw tx bytes, so you can prove a specific txid exists

[05-Jul-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is what txids need to be proven?

[05-Jul-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and then given the rawtx, how will you process it

[05-Jul-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the layer above nspv

[05-Jul-19 06:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
how does zSPV and nSPV interact, if at all?

[05-Jul-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV would be the transport layer

[05-Jul-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the big giant issue with zSPV is that nobody knows which txid belongs to which node...

[05-Jul-19 06:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
oh god my heads gonna explode zSPV

[05-Jul-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so short of syncing the entire chain and trying to decrypt each one, you cant know which txid you want

[05-Jul-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
however...

[05-Jul-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if the sender can tell you the txid, say using a taddr opreturn with encrypted payload

[05-Jul-19 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that sounds interesting

[05-Jul-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then we can get a taddr/zaddr nSPV solution!

[05-Jul-19 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am just catching up on nSPV stuff but it really reminds me of https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226

[05-Jul-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but it leaks privacy big time as people will know you are getting txid

[05-Jul-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, flyclient

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried to read that paper and realized it would be faster to implement nSPV than to decipher it

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
nSPV seems like FlyClient in a DPoW-ized world

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV is very simple

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c yes, the paper must be hard to read so it looks good and gets published

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i made a 2min medium post, it achieves the same effect as flyclient

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
FlyClient didn't have DPoW, so it had to do a bunch of complex stuff

[05-Jul-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
not saying it is better or worse, they are equivalent

[05-Jul-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
resultwise

[05-Jul-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
Since we have DPoW, the job of nSPV is much easier

[05-Jul-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i like easy

[05-Jul-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
third day of coding and it is almost done, the reference cli nSPV client

[05-Jul-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
I really don't like the architecture of Electrum and I really like how every full node can help light wallets run

[05-Jul-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
need a few addressindex=1 nodes

[05-Jul-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not required to have addressindex=1 to support nSPV, most of the calls are available to any txindex=1 node

[05-Jul-19 06:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH3 GUI nodes turn on all indexes by default, I haven't done that for plain CLI full nodes since I assume people can do that for themselves. I knew it would pay dividends in the future

[05-Jul-19 06:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
If RPC work is needed, let me know

[05-Jul-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i am making a C based nSPV wallet so people can see what they need to do to make a GUI for it

[05-Jul-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
they can either just use the rpc calls to avoid having to mess with p2p messaging

[05-Jul-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
or they can become a non-relaying peer and issue the messages directly

[05-Jul-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess i should implement the superlite wallet purely via rpc calls

[05-Jul-19 06:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
SUCCESS!!!!

[05-Jul-19 06:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
Using my own full node and then a second data directory for the nSPV node... i got a good nspv_getinfo call

maybe not... maybe im just finally connected to you i just killed my local node and still get good calls with info now

[05-Jul-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@daemonfox fixed your not getting nspv_getinfo bug

[05-Jul-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also all fields are now returned and hopefully accurate. barring any big bugs, fullnode side is feature complete

[05-Jul-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i will be lazy and do the nSPV wallet inside the komodod so i dont have to fight with making new functions for things that already exist

[05-Jul-19 01:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
recompiling

[05-Jul-19 02:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
