non-det tests = bad tests if they are supposed to be det

Was never needed, due to using different wifs for tests. Will implement auto-merge later, when other automation parts are final.

sounds like i need to merge some more nspv changes into Hush, it's hard to keep up with y'all

[14-Nov-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
this bug was in libnspv

[14-Nov-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i assume hush is using an older version of libnspv that the internals use, but i don't pretend to know how it all works. haven't had time to go read all of that code

[14-Nov-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv is for clients only

[14-Nov-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing to do with the nSPV fullnode

[14-Nov-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
or nSPV=1 clients

[14-Nov-19 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, so for instance, a GUI libnspv wallet running on a smart toaster is what actually uses libnspv. not smart chain full nodes or smart chain nodes running in nspv mode

[14-Nov-19 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought the full node used libnspv as well, so i have already learned something

[15-Nov-19 01:41 PM] dimxy#2587
I found a problem with libnspv for Android (I'm adding support to have it as a so library for my kogs project).
There is a call to pthread_cancel() which is apparently absent in Android NDK.
@jl777c 
I can see that the loop in the work thread listens for NSPV_STOPRECEIVED flag. Maybe shutdown the thread also with setting this flag?

[15-Nov-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if you know how to fix this, then please do and make a PR. i am not familiar with android pthread usage

[15-Nov-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dimxy i know very little about nspv

[15-Nov-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i have many scars of porting weird software across weird OS's

[15-Nov-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dimxy firstly, there should be a macro/etc that detects running under Android NDK, and run different code instead of `pthread_canel()` if true

[15-Nov-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
then, if you know the proper way to do it on android, do it üôÇ

pthread_cancel() alternatives in Android NDK?
I am porting a mid-sized body of C++ code to Android NDK. Unfortunately the pthreads implementation (as of NDK v5, anyway) is incomplete. Specifically, our application relies on pthread_cancel() to...

yes, thank you, 
I'm testing the suggested fix for this

[15-Nov-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
groovy. Android support is super awesome and important to have working well

[15-Nov-19 02:54 PM] dimxy#2587
I also found this article but seems in nspv there is a cleaner way to shutdown the thread, thank you

[18-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Slyris#2880
We agree that if I use the call rpc `spend` without `broadcast`  then I risk nothing? No funds are locked and the balance is not reduced?

[18-Nov-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
spend is purely local, cannot affect the blockchain.

[18-Nov-19 01:51 PM] Slyris#2880
Okay thank you so much.

Now I have another question, for example I am in a video game, I have the sufficient number of gold to buy an item, I buy this item, visually I see immediately that my golds have been debited from my wallet. In the case of the blockchain we have to wait for the confirmation to be sure of the transaction, the feeling of play will not be skewed by the fact of seeing its sum debited later and receive his item only once the confirmed transaction?

(everything using nspv)

[18-Nov-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant speak top the gameplay aspect, but you should be able to mask over the fact it takes a minute to confirm

[18-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Slyris#2880
I can obviously visually immediately reduce the balance, it is not a problem but in case there has been a problem of transaction must be able to restore the state correctly.

[18-Nov-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as it is pending, it is very very likely it will confirm, so it can be displayed as pending and then marked complete when confirmed. well, actually, until notarized, it isnt 100% permanent as it could get reorged, but that is unlikely

[18-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok so in game wallet visually will have 2 balance: Available, Pending ?

[18-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Slyris#2880
I think it's likely what we want to achieve

[18-Nov-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if you just display things based on pending or confirmed, the blockchain state will restore your gamestate?

[18-Nov-19 01:55 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i mean if in the wallet instead of 1000golds i see: 900 Rick 100 Pending

[18-Nov-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
you do need to make sure that if you assumed it was completed and it turns out it isnt, to undo whatever impact the orphaned tx had in the game

[18-Nov-19 01:55 PM] Slyris#2880
It's ok

[18-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Slyris#2880
do we have an nspv call where we give the txid and it's telling us if it's pending or completed ?

I see https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/nspv.html#mempool

But it's written `in development` means that's not finished yet ?

There is also `spentinfo` that i can use after the `broadcast`.

[18-Nov-19 02:04 PM] Slyris#2880
i also see that: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/nspv.html#txproof

Is using a rpc call named `gettransaction` but it's not documented yet i think

[18-Nov-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool rpc works

[18-Nov-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can scan for txid to be in mempool or not

[18-Nov-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt, you can check to see if it is confirmed

[18-Nov-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
with txproof

@jl777c I think I've broke the nSPV (crashed on my side): https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jnjbnqV4yz/

What I did is such call:
``` curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "gettransaction", "params": ["e07709088fa2690fdc71b43b5d7760689e42ca90f7dfb74b18bf47a1ad94c854",1 ] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/ | jq```

[18-Nov-19 03:23 PM] TonyL#3577
There was an example in documentation with existing tx `e07709088fa2690fdc71b43b5d7760689e42ca90f7dfb74b18bf47a1ad94c855` and it works fine, that I wanted to check which error it'll return in case of non-existing tx so changed last number in txid and it crashed

[18-Nov-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix to jl777 branch

[18-Nov-19 03:29 PM] Slyris#2880
@Sir Seven Do not hesitate to sync release from github too ^ i will probably need to use this call to

for existing transaction it works super fast

[18-Nov-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it queries peers, if a response comes in, it returns. if not, it waits, but no response will arrive. maybe it is sending a "not found" response at the low level. someone can dig into this and make it respond faster for not found txid, but it seems in most cases the valid txid is queried

@jl777c There is a branch or an ongoing development for tokensCC + nspv ?

[19-Nov-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo is working on CC over nspv

[22-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
With nspv, can we only execute commands that are in the nSPV API in the documentation?

KV really should deprecated, oracles are much better. and we are working on doing CC over nSPV, just not done yet

we don't want to use KV anymore as PoC?

it has scaling issues, we should start deprecating it
