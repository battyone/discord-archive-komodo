works. now mempool detection works and displays properly!

[14-Aug-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the only issues i know of are: too much bandwidth used for hdr sync, chromebook browser, -x option not working, broadcast of large tx gets timeout

[14-Aug-19 02:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ns408 works!!!

beautiful. thanks for testing it @grewalsatinder 

I'm still cleaning bits up and adding some doco. All code is on github.
@jl777c would you rather have the tap sitting in one of your repos? I'm happy to send instructions to create one and I can create PR so you can merge it so that people can do this:

```
brew tap jl777/homebrew-libnspv
```

instead of the current `ns408/homebrew-libnspv`

[14-Aug-19 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

nice homebrew marketing 👍

[14-Aug-19 08:49 PM] phideas#8309
did a little test. small tx in and out. worked ok. 
when finished, i tried to empty the wallet. tx generates fine but couldn't broadcast. results in timeout.

[14-Aug-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
send 0.0001 less than balance

[14-Aug-19 09:16 PM] phideas#8309
tried several times, didn't worked out. i will try to post some debug info.

[14-Aug-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is a test account without much funds, you can send me the wif and exact step you do to get the bug, i can then fix it

[14-Aug-19 09:37 PM] phideas#8309
no problem james, i always test with small amounts. only dust left in there. for some reason it always bugs me if i can't sweep a wallet to zero. 😃 maybe b/c i see potential value in dust.

[14-Aug-19 09:44 PM] phideas#8309
here the generated tx screen `https://i.imgur.com/pAD132w.png`
broadcast times out.

[14-Aug-19 09:57 PM] phideas#8309
sent a little dust to the wallet. after generating tx now there are 2 tx - vin on input.
broadcasted ok. 👌 wallet empty

[14-Aug-19 10:27 PM] Regnar#6164
Can't post a screenshot but I'm pretty sure I got nSPV KMD going on my raspberry pi 4. 😄

[14-Aug-19 10:34 PM] Regnar#6164
wasn't sure what to put for p2p though <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/nSPV/#enabling-the-nspv-client>

[15-Aug-19 03:08 AM] Regnar#6164
What exactly does `misbehave` score mean when looking at peers? and is there a point where it disconnects from them or something?

[15-Aug-19 03:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar full nodes have a system of keeping score of which nodes should be banned, and each peer gets a "banscore", so misbehaving most likely means close to being banned

[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
sending invalid/wrong data will get you banned as a peer, since that is an attack vector

[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
and it can happen normally, i.e. during a chain re-org, where different nodes have different views of reality

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Aug-19 03:37 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay I thought it was normal for some peers to disagree at chain tips, I have a few peers with misbehave score of 2. What's the scale here for "not normal"?

[15-Aug-19 03:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't know and would have to go read source code to find out. If it's not causing bugs, I wouldn't worry about it

[15-Aug-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Regnar `p2p` should be set in coins file, and match what is seen from `getinfo` p2pport for the chain.

[15-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is automatic for coins already properly configured in the coins file

[15-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
you just need to know the coin symbol

[15-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
no symbol defaults to KMD

[15-Aug-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Regnar  That was something I added, because for a while there were lots of non updated full nodes sending rubbish or incorrect heights

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Aug-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It only really uses it to ban a node on old version, or if it continues to send chain tips shorter than 2 blocks behind the current tip it has.

[15-Aug-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven some reports of broadcast timeout, but for tx that are not big. i cant reproduce this, so if you can plz get me the raw hex that gets timeout when broadcast

[15-Aug-19 08:11 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Ok. Will try a few.

[15-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
of course any other bugs are good too. it seems to be getting pretty solid, but need to add some more error checking/handling and error page

[15-Aug-19 09:56 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Found 2 hexes, 1st always ends up in `error adding to mempool`
2nd timeouts. Sent 'em in PM.

[15-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
first one is trying to doublespend, so it should get an error

[15-Aug-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
second one, just worked for me via html

Hm. So far can't get timeouts on broadcast with good nodes connected.
Noticed other thing:
Txs in mempool can be displayed with 0 amount:

After pressing update there are like 50/50 if Amount will be shown or not.

[15-Aug-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe i need to update the protocol version, the mempool amounts was a fullnode change

[15-Aug-19 10:54 AM] Sir Seven#7158
What is current version? 70000005?

[15-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i will update the version and update my nodes, that should fix this

[15-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
7000...5 is nServices

[15-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
current protocol version is 000...2

[15-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Also, autologout in html wallet happens with no notifications to user. I mean, at least at login we might inform user about 777s timeout.

[15-Aug-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a text change in html, plz ask satinder for such

[15-Aug-19 10:58 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Got it.

[15-Aug-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
updated my nodes. ILN and NSPV chains are already running, KMD chains will take 10 minutes to update

[15-Aug-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
should have protocol version 3 now

[15-Aug-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it shows on the getinfo page

[15-Aug-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
NSPV is a good chain to test mempool as i dont think it is being actively mined

[15-Aug-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
now the broadcast should be more reliable, along with mempool and i think a few other tweaks that are now active

[15-Aug-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will look at the headers sync tonight.

[15-Aug-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

where should it be showing? 🤔

[15-Aug-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can do a modal display. so on the account page if it is logged in, it shows one view. if not logged in, another view

[15-Aug-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make a variable to control this via "" vs "none" and another for the time left before autologout

true... adding those too
