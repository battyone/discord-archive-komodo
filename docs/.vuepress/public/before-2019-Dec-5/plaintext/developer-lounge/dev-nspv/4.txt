With which compiler are you compiling ?

[03-Jul-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this is meant to be a reference version, not worried about efficiency so much

[03-Jul-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just using gcc or clang

[03-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Slyris#2880
May be, when the efficiency will be important we can add unlikely attribute

[03-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Slyris#2880
what do you think ?

[03-Jul-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for reference version, i dont see so much need

[03-Jul-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
though i guess the fullnode side will likely be the production version...

[03-Jul-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, i am not worried about optimizations, more just getting it to work so it can be used as a spec

[03-Jul-19 06:44 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok !

[03-Jul-19 06:44 PM] Slyris#2880
No problem

[03-Jul-19 06:45 PM] Slyris#2880
i will check the rest of the code and ask you if i dont undesrtand something

[03-Jul-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks, not worried about small stuff, just that it makes sense and works

[03-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Slyris#2880
to be honest i trust you on the behavior, because it's your idea, and if the tests are going well, i dont worry

[03-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Slyris#2880
I was thinking that performance was mandatory for you that's why i tell you that minor things

[03-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Slyris#2880
i will focus on the behavior and critical error if i find

[03-Jul-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
most concerned i forgot some field in some structures in the (de)serialization

[03-Jul-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
or forgot to initialize some variable before using it

[03-Jul-19 06:48 PM] Slyris#2880

yes for the interface functions, there will be c++ stuff as it is interfacing to c++ code

[03-Jul-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i did minimize it a lot though, so a pure C implementation wont be too much changes, but it didnt make sense to convert the C++ interface to the c++ code to C

[03-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Slyris#2880
i think for future pure C implementation we can think about something like ceeds to make our life easier

[03-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Slyris#2880
So it's will be more pleaseant to write

[03-Jul-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it only took a day to get it all in place, i just didnt want to spend time getting familiar with some new tools

[03-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Slyris#2880
i understand you

[03-Jul-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
on a strict schedule. today was to get the fullnode side as close to code complete as possible

[03-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Slyris#2880
Perfectly understandable

[03-Jul-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow is to get the client side done

[03-Jul-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so that last function will be totally redone anyway

[03-Jul-19 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i am finding that a 12000 utxo address is taking fraction of a second, so i can change the client side model to being a single threaded one

[03-Jul-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
which will simplify the logic a lot and still i think the transaction can be constructed and sent within a few seconds, though for many vin tx i will need to rethink the one request per second limitation on proof queries

[03-Jul-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, i will think on how to make the client side easy to understand and flexible

[04-Jul-19 02:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c rebuilding to test connection with latest changes

[04-Jul-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577

on both server and client?

[04-Jul-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
just the client

üëç 

[04-Jul-19 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this will change with next version

[04-Jul-19 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
just needed a hardcoded address

[04-Jul-19 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
invalid free could be an independent bug, but i should be able to make things more reliable once i get client side way to invoke messages

[04-Jul-19 04:57 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, I can just wait for the next version I think

[04-Jul-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that will have client side rpc, much easier to use

[04-Jul-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL next version has half a dozen nspv_* rpc calls, help will show them. ILN is the best chain to use, very short and notarized. -addnode=5.9.102.210 and it should connect to 1 or more fullnodes ready to go. there is a one message per second limit per peer, for each specific type of message. now that the low level messages appear to be working, the next step is to put it all together to allow it to send funds. at first without 100% validation, as that gets it to the same level as API wallets, and as more and more is validated, it becomes the near native level security.

there is the concept of "login", which is passed in a valid wif. for the following 60 seconds, transactions using vins with that privkey will be signed. that is the plan. after 60 seconds, it is scrubbed from RAM.

still need to implement an efficient way to find the notarization transaction txid, once that is there, all the data needed for validation will be back to the nSPV client. more peers are 5.9.253.200 to 204

[04-Jul-19 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
sounds great! will go ahead with testing when wake up

[04-Jul-19 10:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have synced an ILN node with the latest nSPV branch to try and help if I can.

Aha @daemonfox , so this node is your nSPV server - now you can connect client/s to it. In your client daemon start  params just use your server IP in `addnode` and add `-nSPV=1`

[05-Jul-19 02:42 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/blob/master/scripts/nspv_clients_spawn.py have simple script to spawn multiply clients on single PC in case if you will want to test loading on your server, just chain params needs to be changed to ILN

oh man... this looks awesome... but im working on another thing right now so it has to wait

[05-Jul-19 03:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
but i will play with this soon

[05-Jul-19 03:03 AM] TonyL#3577
calls seems work fine, just need some addy with balance to check listunspent

[05-Jul-19 03:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
and try some nSPV commands

[05-Jul-19 03:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
is there a testnet coin we can get some funds on that will work with this? I think i have BEER and PIZZA left but IDK which will work with this

[05-Jul-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
in general you can make full node for any chain you want

[05-Jul-19 03:07 AM] TonyL#3577
just for huge chains syncing with `-addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 ` is long

[05-Jul-19 03:07 AM] TonyL#3577
only clue is that this chain should be notarized

[05-Jul-19 03:11 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, and if you want to connect many clients to server - server you should start with `-maxconnections=somebignumber`, forgot to mention that

[05-Jul-19 03:19 AM] TonyL#3577
`  "connections": 191,` connected few clients from laptop

[05-Jul-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
`"connections": 790,` somewhere around this number server starting to drop connections, it feels like there is 777 nSPV clients limitation üòÖ (other few clients - initial non nSPV connections)

[05-Jul-19 04:31 AM] TonyL#3577
`"connections": 835` oh just passed trough - 1000 is close

[05-Jul-19 04:32 AM] TonyL#3577
resources usage on server with almost 1000 connections

looks like it's possible to make nSPV server on microwave

[05-Jul-19 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Can't pass trough `"connections": 873,`, have few thousand clients
tried to restart server but it reaching this number and not connecting more, nothing helpful in prints/logs

[05-Jul-19 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577

[05-Jul-19 05:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
im almost done with my PoS64 setup and want to mess with this lol

[05-Jul-19 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt need to spin up any fullnodes, i have 10 of them and i think there is enough remote data calls now to put together a wallet function

[05-Jul-19 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i just need to implement the DB query for finding the notarization. its been a long grind, but finally coming together

[05-Jul-19 05:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
so then i think i technically do not have a full node running... that IP I set is my VM static but I launchd and left my daemon with one of your addnode IPs and -nSPV=1 from the start

[05-Jul-19 05:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
I should be able to make an nSPV call from here but i have no coins lol

[05-Jul-19 05:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
WTB ILN?

[05-Jul-19 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
post your address i will send some test amounts

[05-Jul-19 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pretty sure i fixed that invalid free() crash, but we really need to stress test the fullnodes as the support for it goes into all the fullnodes and any bug could cause the entire network to be messed up

[05-Jul-19 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok will attack with ` -addnode=5.9.102.210 ` param so

[05-Jul-19 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
`RMjy5VkHFJkXTJDTJ3XX1zVzukP48sKyva`

[05-Jul-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
or -connect so it will just try to kill that node

[05-Jul-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i will send funds later today

[05-Jul-19 05:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok without my local node running without nSPV, i cant get the rigth info

[05-Jul-19 05:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
nspv calls come back 0 blocks

[05-Jul-19 05:35 AM] daemonfox#6136
so how would I launch a simple nspv command to one of the published nodes?

[05-Jul-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to build nSPV branch

[05-Jul-19 05:35 AM] daemonfox#6136
i have it

[05-Jul-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
launch with -nSPV=1

[05-Jul-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
now it is an nSPV node and other than the nspv_* rpc calls, maybe they will work, maybe not

[05-Jul-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the normal wallet is disabled

[05-Jul-19 05:36 AM] daemonfox#6136
just komodod -ac_name=ILN -addnode=5.9.102.210 -nSPV=1

[05-Jul-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as you have 1 nSPV full node, you can issue nSPV messages and the nspv rpc calls will work

[05-Jul-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if you see a "got info response... " prints you are in contact with the fullnode

[05-Jul-19 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
`-ac_name=ILN  -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -nSPV=1`

[05-Jul-19 05:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
When i run that with that last flag added...

[05-Jul-19 05:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
