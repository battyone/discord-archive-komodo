pushed to dev branch, i will start using the dev branch for when the new features appear stable. after it tests out ok, then it will migrate to beta and eventually master

[15-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810

if I select a .jpg file in an input field it will only post it's file name

@Sir Seven there should be a set of reliable KMD fullnodes now

[15-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Shouldn't be they included in coins file?

[15-Aug-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
for KMD it is an exception

[15-Aug-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it can have a DNS server yes?

[15-Aug-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it can, but i dont know how to configure DNS server and having a decent list of seeds will cross connect to the peers they have

[15-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@dukeleto HUSH seems to work just fine on nspv, yet there are but 1 good node to connect. Thus, timeout errors are frequent. Unless you manually disable node discovery.

[15-Aug-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven latest version automatically limits the sending amount to 0.0001 less than the max amount you have. plz test this

[15-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Sir Seven#7158
With curl and API it always result in error `not enough funds`.
In webUI any amount more than (balance - 0.0001) will result in autolimited tx.

Note: there is txfee param in coins file, we might use it here.

[15-Aug-19 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sir Seven thanks, you are correct. Notary nodes are not yet running versions of HUSH which enable nSPV, so we only have 1 full node with nspv services right now

[15-Aug-19 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sir Seven i will spin up some more hush nodes soon, and ask some NNs to update when that code hits master branch (it hasn't yet)

[15-Aug-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven this is an html only feature

[15-Aug-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, make an issue to use the txfee in the coins file, though all komodo coins use the standard

[15-Aug-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven added support for wallet seeds in english, french, italian, spanish, korean, japanese, chinese_simplified, chinese_traditional
you can use the seed interchangeably with the wif, at least you should be able to, if not it is a bug. to make it change language just add a &lang=korean to the url

[15-Aug-19 07:29 PM] Sir Seven#7158
html-only or new rpcs?

[15-Aug-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
both should work, just pass in the seed via the "wif" field, it autodetects if it is a wif or a seed

[15-Aug-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
added russian seeds

[15-Aug-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you can see all the supported languages in the ~/libnspv/seeds dir

[15-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven added "language" api, the "help" api should list all the current api calls

[15-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it just has "lang":"russian" to set the default language to russian

[15-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
we can add any language with a file having the 2048 words in that language in the seeds dir

[16-Aug-19 04:24 AM] Don King#8901
Can the new nspv wallet be used for other coins like Agama could, e.g. Bitcoin?

[16-Aug-19 04:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
For other notarized SmartChains like RFOX DEX REVS etc yes

[16-Aug-19 06:00 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, just KMD and smartchains, thanks!

[16-Aug-19 06:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
@Don King  Bitcoin may be the gateway drug into the potential of crypto but it will not be the "killer app" that takes crypto to mainstream adoption. Even those in charge of it's development are documented as being in favor of it's role as reserve asset.

[16-Aug-19 07:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
the eradication of ECMAscript from crypto transactions is key to it's security and feasibility for mobile, low bandwidth applications. credit card machines don't run internet browsers for a reason.

[16-Aug-19 01:39 PM] Don King#8901
@actionslacks , I agree btc is probably the crypto reserve currency like gold used to be in the fiat world. I really liked being able to use Agama for other coins though, that was a cool feature!

[16-Aug-19 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is getting an external coin to use nSPV tech something you care about? Do we want that, as proof that nSPV is awesome? Or would you rather keep this tech inside the KMD fold for a while?

[16-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
porting nspv to an external coin would be 10x the work as adding dPoW

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c thank you, now I know how much to charge üëº

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c people have asked me about adding it to CHIPS

[16-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I told @grewalsatinder it would be non-trivial

[16-Aug-19 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c regardless of complexity, "strategically", what are your desires?

[16-Aug-19 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
If somebody gonna pay me 5BTC to add nSPV to their coin, is that OK? No person is offering this yet, just wondering

[16-Aug-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
seems better if it stayed komodo only for a while, but if someone will pay you 5 BTC, seems you should do it

@Sir Seven can you verify if it still works on windows

[16-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hardcoded now to use a .jpg file called test.jpg and from that it makes a dest.jpg with the wif steganographically encoded. but the password is very silly, so dont use real passphrases yet

[16-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that you can save your wif inside a .jpg protected with a password.

[16-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
without knowing which .jpg if was and the password, then it cant be extracted

[16-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
of course using a fixed location test.jpg and a fixed passphrase defeats this, but it was just a lot of code to get the basic functionality working

[16-Aug-19 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c that is really awesome, looking forward to trying this feature out

[16-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the .jpg is really small it should be impossible to visually see any changes

[17-Aug-19 11:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Havent really been following along but what are the benefits to using the jpg? Just a 2fa of sorts?

[17-Aug-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like pin code,but there isnt any data directly associated with nspv

[17-Aug-19 12:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So you would need both the hardware key and the pic

[17-Aug-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c you will also be able to put a 200KB JPG image into the memo field of any kmd sapling chain, which offers many other exciting possibilities

[17-Aug-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH+ARRR wallets will probably support it first, and then others

[17-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@jl777c Seeds generation work fine with curls. Checked all langs you listed above.
You can log in with them in html wallet no problem.

Few problems: (on latest jl777 branch)
1. Using api call: http://127.0.0.1:7771/api/method/getnewaddress   results in error `{"error":"cant find methodfile"} `
2. If there is no lang supported passed ass param (AE: "lang": "svensk", or typo like "lang": "englih"), you will get random data as seed.
```json
:~/libnspv$ curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getnewaddress", "params": ["englih"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:12986/

{"seed":"19 1789 1601 670 516 1566 1734 726 857 77 1692 855 1129 1183 1203 948 1350 1447 1741 998 1263 1003 1593","wif":"Uq6bnT9VPGnfJCn9NPQ6fVzZdtELQS5XThhZ7jhND942ExWKyErt","address":"RTaTmrR3TgK4gBmiC5Ru9Tg2HzZWmx5S32","pubkey":"0331eea382ac2b308eb98ebdd1e8f3b05fea2ddd6af5d5f0068015e781e54a6236","wifprefix":188,"compressed":1}
``` 
It's probably better to either default unknown langs to english, similair to "lang": "", or throw an error instead.

Will recheck nspv build for WIn soon.

Would adding nSPV to CHIPS be a KMD funded development. It seems like it would greatly benefit the project.

[18-Aug-19 04:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't think so. CHIPS is independent project.

[18-Aug-19 04:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Well CHIPS is a SuperNET project technically. Along with managing the revshare from CHIPS

[18-Aug-19 08:02 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Builds now and works on WIndows.

[18-Aug-19 11:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
Adding nSPV to CHIPS would not be easy, but possible. It's more work than adding DPoW to a coin and it's more work than putting verushash in chips

Judging by this error here - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/501#issuecomment-516940954 - we're past the Boost build on raspbian, e.g. we don't have a full mm2 build there yet, but Boost builds NP, because this errors happens after the Boost build.
