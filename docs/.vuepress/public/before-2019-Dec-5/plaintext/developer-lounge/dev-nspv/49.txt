@siu - Chainmakers first compile latest komodod ona vps and start the kmdice chain 
then add the KMDICE chain to the coins file in the libnspv dir
with the above properties

[21-Aug-19 03:54 PM] gcharang#6833
add the full nodes's ip to the nSPV key

[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
why run a komodo superlite??

[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
-nSPV=1 runs it as a superlite node, NOT as a fullnode that supports nSPV

[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to run a normal node from the right branch of repo

[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i guess i would need a fullnode ip address for KMDICE?

[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] TonyL#3577
yes you need at least one full node with nspv code included

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] TonyL#3577
latest FSM lets say is fine

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
welp., that extends my testing for a few days then

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
syncing KMDICE is a pain

[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh, i can use my NN

[21-Aug-19 03:57 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't think thats NN repo has needed code

[21-Aug-19 03:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i use beta branch on the NN

[21-Aug-19 03:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, true.

[21-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
dev branch or "below"

[21-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if you just update the KMDICE node to dev branch it would work as a seed node for "nSPV" field

[21-Aug-19 03:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

right... I was student when I tried RedHat 8

if you wanted to make GUIs for Unix systems, you had the choice of TK, GTK or QT, which all came from TK, i think

@Sir Seven pushed new version to jl777 branch. it should be able to display p2sh addresses now, you can check by looking at a txid with a multisig address in it. there is also a new api call "addnode", with param "ipaddr", the format is "5.9.102.210" or "5.9.102.210:port"

[22-Aug-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
any new bugs?

[22-Aug-19 09:40 AM] Sir Seven#7158

@Sir Seven pushed fix. you didnt have any "ipaddr" field, so it was a null pointer

[22-Aug-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang most all the normal rpc commands will fail in some way or another. @Mihailo will need to add some error checking for the ones that crash in a bad way

[22-Aug-19 11:00 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Fixed. Returns error if no parameter given.

[22-Aug-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven i added libcryptoconditions code to libnspv. i made a script called "onetime" that you run one time. this will autogen and configure and build the libcryptoconditions.

[22-Aug-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
after you run the onetime script, then just make from ~libnspv and it should build nspv as usual

[22-Aug-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i tested this on unix and osx but not windows

[22-Aug-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang can you make a list of the non-CC rpc calls that crash with nSPV=1 mode?

[22-Aug-19 11:47 AM] gcharang#6833
will do

[22-Aug-19 12:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
is nspv v2 still compat with the network, or only v3 ?

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/makerogue @Sir Seven in general I think just condition with build via mingw as in this script is needed for `onetime` script

libnspv windows build script set host env to `x86_64-w64-mingw32` so this `if [ "$HOST" = "x86_64-w64-mingw32" ]; ` condition will match

[22-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i have no idea about windows

[22-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you see the onetime script is simple enough

[22-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and it just needs to link in the libcryptoconditions.la file to nspv

[22-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Sir Seven#7158
In this case, it's enough to run onetime script (or just make libcryptoconditions) and run build_win.sh right after.
In this case nspv.exe works fine on windows, not sure about CC itself.

[22-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no CC implemented yet, but now it has the cryptoconditions library linked it, it is possible to start adding CC spends
