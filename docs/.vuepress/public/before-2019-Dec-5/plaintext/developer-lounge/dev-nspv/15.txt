yep, created address, logged in. only "issues" was no right click to copy/paste, and balance when sending didnt take fee into account. Also, balance didnt change after sent (until confirmed I assume), so wansnt sure I sent and tried 2x

[09-Jul-19 10:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh darn, i need to rebuild.

too early to test rewards?

[09-Jul-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards work

treasure 

[09-Jul-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
max utxos allowed is 64

[09-Jul-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
nLockTime should be set

[09-Jul-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
`was no right click to copy/paste,` - aha, there is no implementation of it in this simple framework, need to write some code for it. But Ctrl+C Ctrl+V should work
`balance when sending didnt take fee into account` - Aha, I see what you mean, I'll add fees on confirmation popup and actual sum which I'll broadcast will be input + fee
`balance didnt change after sent` - and will update balance right after sending too

[09-Jul-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
thank you for feedback!

[09-Jul-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just that you are currently trusting the fullnode for the interest calc. that is last validation i need to add

[09-Jul-19 10:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll send some and let it sit until acrued.

[09-Jul-19 10:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
ctl-c, ctl-v worked ‚úÖ

[09-Jul-19 10:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if no rightclick, maybe a `copy` button?

[09-Jul-19 10:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it it tkinter?

[09-Jul-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah tkinter

[09-Jul-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577

havent used that for a couple years lol, but it is handy

[09-Jul-19 10:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe also autorefresh every 30sec ü§∑üèº

[09-Jul-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, it's worth to add. just need to solve microfreezes on RPC calls

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
to refresh balance you need to call listunspent and response taking ~1sec

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@TonyL got it working, what should i do on it?

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
and now app became unresponsible until get response - but it's solvable for sure

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
dont spend time on removing 1 sec delays!

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@hyperDEX you can try to generate new addy, broadcast some tx

[09-Jul-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
this is just a testers gui and it is taking 1 second or 3, let the testers feel this delay

[09-Jul-19 10:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ok will fund it and do some stupid things to try to break it

[09-Jul-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the real GUI will multithread things, and remove such delays

[09-Jul-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
point is to feel how easy to use nSPV I believe rather than break my shitty GUI üòÉ

[09-Jul-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
rpc calls take seconds if it calls the p2p network, to mask this you need to put it in a totally different thread

[09-Jul-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that should properly validate presapling notarizations. the way to verify this is to spend a utxo that is older than last dec 15th

[09-Jul-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
spends will now take about 3 seconds per utxo

[09-Jul-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, by adding threading freezes solvable. and good that 1sec limitation is for same messages, not in general

[09-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so this should be queued and processed in the background

[09-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, once we get more fullnodes, the 1 sec delay will go away

[09-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is 1 sec delay per peer per message

[09-Jul-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and GUI delays, responsiveness, etc. it takes a lot of work to make it smooth, but that has nothing to do with finding rpc level bugs

[09-Jul-19 10:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What happens when the wif expires?

[09-Jul-19 10:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Are funds within that address gone?

[09-Jul-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
?

[09-Jul-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
how would that even be possible. the coins are in the blockchain

[09-Jul-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
when the wif expires, it is deleted from memory, autologout

[09-Jul-19 11:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh üòÑ

[09-Jul-19 11:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586

This deposit has 4 confirms, in my GUi it still shows 0, how many confirms should it take to show up?

[09-Jul-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810

try to press `refresh` button

[09-Jul-19 11:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
i did

[09-Jul-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
still nothing, i clicked login using the wif as well, no change to the balance

[09-Jul-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
though the expire timer changes

[09-Jul-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
try to check in cli `./komodo-cli nspv_listunspent`

[09-Jul-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
actually refresh button calling it and fetching balance from this call output

[09-Jul-19 11:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
./komdoo-cli nspv_listunspent
bash: ./komdoo-cli: No such file or directory

[09-Jul-19 11:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is weird

[09-Jul-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
there was a typo in initial command I wrote

[09-Jul-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli`

So it isnt the GUI not displaying that

[09-Jul-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
let me update my fullnode

[09-Jul-19 11:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just noticed coutdown refresh doesnt seem to work if timed out

[09-Jul-19 11:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so says 300 sec to go, but click refresh it still says 300 sec to go

[09-Jul-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Mine keeps going to 0, after i refresh it still doesnt mention that i have logged out.

[09-Jul-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is that meant to be the case?

[09-Jul-19 11:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```Exception in Tkinter callback

[09-Jul-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, it's GUI problem - checking wifexpires value on refresh but not checking if it presists in general or not. It's a visual issue - will fix

[09-Jul-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
on timeout key just "dissapears" from nspv_getinfo call output so should handle it

yes

[09-Jul-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe it loads the index, i thought i fixed that

[09-Jul-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
does it finish?

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] TonyL#3577
I've killed it because it's quite long on windows (and VM is tiny)

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Can try to wait

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
mv the ~/.komodo dire

make sure it starts up fast

[09-Jul-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we can deal with skipping load after we make sure the basics work on windows
