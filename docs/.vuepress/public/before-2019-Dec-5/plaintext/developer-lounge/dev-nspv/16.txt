[09-Jul-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL It might be good to have a "tx sent" prompt or something

[09-Jul-19 12:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I got a prompt to confirm then nothing

[09-Jul-19 12:13 PM] TonyL#3577
if tx sent after you press confirm in popup you'll see info about tx in wallet window

yes, were peers on one server

there is no need to stop the superlite client, it doesnt use HDD

i will put a guard in the stop command

@TonyL pushed a bug to fix tx signing! that is why hyperDEX tx didnt propagate, it was signed incorrectly

now the bug fix is pushed

[09-Jul-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it defaulted signing to legacy mode, instead of sapling

[09-Jul-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
now all seems stable, other then when the ILN fullnode was being attacked

[09-Jul-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
probably good to start the attack again, i think there are some memory/socket issues under high load

[09-Jul-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
sure, let me update and start attack

[09-Jul-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess osx and windows are DOA though...

did it display notarization validation?

[09-Jul-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
On confirmation popup displaying "Input notarized" or "Input not notarized"

[09-Jul-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i assume there is a console where we can see all the prints?

[09-Jul-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
we still need to verify a legacy (pre dec15) notarization can be validated properly

[09-Jul-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and also that the latest fast notarization validation is working

[09-Jul-19 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`i assume there is a console where we can see all the prints?` yes, console should display all daemon printouts
