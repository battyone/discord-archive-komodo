To start use libnspv:
```git clone https://github.com/jl777/libnspv
cd libnspv
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
./nspv
now you can issue curl commands as in ~/src/tools/nSPV_testvectors```

@blackjok3r nice PR! dynamic peers, getpeerinfo and a bugfix for my opreturn extract!

[25-Jul-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
makes it easy to get to the bottom of things

[25-Jul-19 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That slowed me down a fair bit, some crazy pointers used in there to get the duplicate peer fitler to work.

[25-Jul-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
better than buried in some template for a class for some data type that isnt even clear what structure it has

[25-Jul-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is true, I had to use libevent code to get the correct structures.

[25-Jul-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, as you see, it is very easy to add new api, so feel free to port over whatever is useful from iguana as i want to use libnspv as the codebase for useful crypto things

[25-Jul-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
next step is to get a html wallet, but only using static html and having nspv dynamically generate it. that was there is no attack surface outside of nspv

[25-Jul-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
mihailo is adding CC support to the komodod -nSPV=1 and it seems most all can be ported, but that is indeed a lot of custom tx construction

[25-Jul-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
still for a specific CC, it wouldnt be that much work to add nspv support for it

[25-Jul-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
unless it needs a lot of blockchain data

[25-Jul-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, my idea was to just make a seperate libnspv for each contract. Hopefully get the lotto thing I made for LABS working with nSPV in new few weeks

[25-Jul-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the trick to solve that was to add fullnode p2p message support for getting the data more efficiently

[25-Jul-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although that pulls thousands of utxos for the first validation ü§î

[25-Jul-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
can just make a new api function with the tx construction. nspv does not have to validate

[25-Jul-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
listunspent/listtransactions got a new "filter" parameter that can be used to have the fullnode filter out the big list of unspents/txids and return only what fits. it is 32 bits total and i think 16bits might be allocated already

[25-Jul-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
on the build side, i think it works in osx now. also windows and even 32 bit CPU might work

[25-Jul-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Could always moce those heavy calls to a full node?

[25-Jul-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or that is not practical?

[25-Jul-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, can always add a new p2p message

[25-Jul-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that does require defining the structure (request and response), (de)serializer, issuing, global results and the message handling and the actual function that does it,

[25-Jul-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
all the existing messages follow the same pattern, so it shouldnt be too hard to figureout (after you are having the sleep)

[25-Jul-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes üòÉ very much needed.

[25-Jul-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a "hardfork", so if any new messages are needed, sooner is better than after it spreads to the wild

[25-Jul-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
can have differentl level of fullmodes via the NODE_NSPV nService bits

[25-Jul-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, great work!

[25-Jul-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you are up to speed on nspv

[25-Jul-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is 300kb of code total, just the pure essentials for doing transaction

[25-Jul-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
borrowed heavily from iguana though

[25-Jul-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its really nice i like it. Simple and eas to follow, as long as you understand pointers

[25-Jul-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
sort of the new iguana

[25-Jul-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it is C, and assumed you understand pointers

[25-Jul-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, mosts coders i guess are afraid of them

[25-Jul-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but use them indirectly and then cant figure out what is going on as they dont understand what is actually happening

[25-Jul-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep, üòÉ well I should get some rest. Let all this information sink in before I forget it

[25-Jul-19 06:30 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c C pointers are not that hard.

[25-Jul-19 06:30 AM] Slyris#2880
But yeah for novices sometimes it's can make you afraid

[25-Jul-19 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Slyris  
`if ( memcmp(&((struct sockaddr_in*)&existing_node->addr)->sin_addr, &((struct sockaddr_in*)&node->addr)->sin_addr, sizeof(&((struct sockaddr_in*)&existing_node->addr)->sin_addr)) == 0 ) ` I was reffering to this line in particular. Took me a while to get that right üòÖ

[25-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah common c stuffs which are boring to read i agree with you

[25-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Slyris#2880
which just mean i compare the memory of two pointers with the size of this pointer.

Seems a timeout? I think we wil need some extra error handling added for this in future. Did it work if you try again?

[25-Jul-19 08:28 AM] gcharang#6833
I've tried many times
it didn't work at all @blackjok3r

[25-Jul-19 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on KMD?

[25-Jul-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Could be plenty of things, other calls work? Just not broadcast? I didnt actually test sending anything just the building txns

[25-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang have you documented both the nSPV=1 for komodod and nspv?
nSPV=1 if added to the standard komodod puts it in nSPV superlite mode. it can also do most of the CC tx

[25-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
with nspv you specify the coin. it currently doesnt have a cli (though somebody could write such a program without much trouble)

[25-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
curl of the JSON is one way

[25-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
http GET via url construction http://127.0.0.1:8901/method/getinfo

[25-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
another way is POST, but not sure how to do that via browser

[25-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i am also adding a json 2.0 compatible way of having a "params":[] array with the arguments inside it

[25-Jul-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and i think all the different ways needs to have specific examples to make it easy.  i heard using params array there are many existing tools to issue the api requests

[25-Jul-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
also a few details that might not be apparent. for txproof if you dont pass in the height, it wont return the merkleproof, but just the rawtx, so it is like getrawtransaction

[25-Jul-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
list commands (unspent transactions) have a skipcount that lets you skip the first n entries, but it will always return the last entry, so it is an easy way to see if any new funds came in and confirmed, ie wait for the most recent utxo to change

[25-Jul-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it also has a new filter field, which will be used to filter the list using filter specific defined values. this is to allow efficient support for CC tx creation that often has to search through many tx. also there is a CCflag that specifies whether you are looking for a CC address or a normal (p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh) address

[25-Jul-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
new mempool functions exist which range from returning the entire mempool, but also able to have a subset matching search parameters returned. please ask if anything is unclear

[25-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r i think having an api call that exposes the internal gettransaction is a good new api to add as that will allow to get the specific retcode for that utxo. 0 means it is notarized, many errors possible during the notarization validation

@Bryan_Beus not sure about your workload, but nspv has come a long ways pretty quick and is close to being beta, so getting it properly documented seems a good idea. focus on rapid integration to anything that wants to securely connect to any of the ecosystem coin networks directly and do transactions, or just get explorer level data

[25-Jul-19 09:29 AM] gcharang#6833
I am working on documenting the libnspv

[25-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
most all of the functionality is the same with nSPV=1, so it might make sense to document them both with the same? just have a section on how to use each one, which is where the main difference is

[25-Jul-19 09:44 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c I will reuse the content
but I think documenting them "komodod -nspv=1" and "./nspv" seperately is better

for komodod it will go along with the komodo-api
for libnspv, installation is different and command names are different so, having a seperate space for it makes things easier

[25-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
