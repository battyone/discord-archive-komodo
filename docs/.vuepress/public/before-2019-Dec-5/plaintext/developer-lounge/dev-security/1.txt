Hi, Could someone tell me what an ISP would think was going on when analyzing Barterdex traffic (2 native coins)?

[27-Aug-18 06:43 PM] tolken#2655
dPOW - considering dPOW backs up every 10min, does that mean there’s a 10min window where someone can send funds to an exchange, then cash out and effectively steal funds? I know dPOW isn’t a perfect solution (what ever is really?) but this seems like a big hole, but I think jl777 has mentioned the cost/risk makes it not generally practical.  I know something like this has been asked before, so if anyone has a link that might shed more light on this I’d appreciated it 😃

[27-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if an exchange doesnt wait for notarization, then certainly such things can be done

[27-Aug-18 08:04 PM] tolken#2655
Awesome, that sounds pretty damn great if that’s the only real situation is someone not waiting 10min 😃

[27-Aug-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, well as long as it didnt miss a notarization round, which does happen at times. there is even an api to check for the notarization lag

[29-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Prado#3941
Hi i was wondering if there is a Komodo Secure Pool in place or in plans that does or will do something of this 3 things:

[29-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Prado#3941
1: Redistribuite hash power to Komodo Chains avoiding effective or useful 51% percent attacks in the 10 minutes window

[29-Aug-18 06:27 PM] Prado#3941
2: Using dPOW to notarize the block winners of every chain

[29-Aug-18 06:28 PM] Prado#3941
3: Analizing minners in real time and saving their data in a chain for transparent analysis, security and rewards

[29-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Prado#3941
If there isn´t, how can we organize a team to build it (its very important for me that small, non market cap chains have a strong hash security option as well), should i just build it with my team?

[29-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Prado#3941
@jl777c  this will effectively add a rent security (and CDN) feature for all chains compatible with the pool (obviously komodo first) and the option to avoid non secured hashes (outside notarized pools) which i think will become a standard in years to come, as https notarized hash

[29-Aug-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a good idea for a mining pool to secure assetchains. dPoW is already notarizing all the notarized assetchains

[29-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
@Prado what can an attacker accomplish with a 10 minute reorg?

[29-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dont they have to successfully attack bitcoin at the same time within those 10 minutes? *asking for a mate

[29-Aug-18 11:25 PM] Prado#3941
@Alright  in big chains almost anything, my concern is for small dapps, icos and projects, where 10 minutes it´s enough, and what i think it could be happen it´s been attacked for days in lapses of 5 or 7 minutes before you realize you lost half the tokens or someone stole millons from your ico, or someone corrupted the logics of an app by double spending, in some cases tokens will be a physical representation, imagine you give 10,000 usd of inventory through tokens, just to realize you were victim of a double spending attack (that could destroy both small business, startups and komodo it self)

[29-Aug-18 11:26 PM] Alright#0419
just don't let them get anything of value within those 10 minutes

[29-Aug-18 11:26 PM] Alright#0419
but I agree, could definitely mess with dapps

[29-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Prado#3941
i mean that would be a short time answer, but for some apps 11 minutes confirmation will take them back to legacy backends and solutions

[29-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Prado#3941
if you could rely on trusted hashes that will solve almost everything

[29-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Prado#3941
and the techonology could be available for any pool to implement dPOW so it could inject serious FIAT or capital into KMD coin

[29-Aug-18 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure I quite understand what you mean by trusted hashes

[29-Aug-18 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
as in only certain people can mine the chain?

[29-Aug-18 11:47 PM] Alright#0419
that would be useful

[29-Aug-18 11:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like notary mining for assetchains but nobody else can mine?

[30-Aug-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wouldnt do it on official notary keys as the wallets would get destroyed. But something similar seems like a good idea.

[30-Aug-18 04:08 PM] Prado#3941
exactly the most cool of all, is that you could use the hashes of non trusted miners to find blocks but if the block winner is not written in the chain of the pool you can ignore the rewards for those miners, with a 3 factor authentication for pools (secure hash sign,  written block winner, and dPOW request confirmed) you solve 51% attacks without loosing decentralization as anyone can implement the dPOW tech of komodo

[30-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Prado#3941
Because this requires high speed dPOW it needs to live in the komodo chain before going to bitcoin in 10 minutes, or it will be both too slow and too expensive to actually been implemented

[30-Aug-18 07:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Anything that secures the chains further is welcomed

[30-Aug-18 07:13 PM] PTYX#6840
I guess an asset chain can fork each year to add the new notary nodes so only NNs can mine

[30-Aug-18 09:07 PM] Prado#3941
NNs is notarized nodes? it sounds cool

[30-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Prado#3941
In strict sense a fork is not needed just a protocol, if the pools comply with the dPOW protocol the nodes accept them, it will require to check the transaction written in the chain (when a block is rewarded) and a status confirmation from komodo verifying constant dPOW of the pool chain and confirmation from the last rewarded blocks already notarized, rewards can be kept on hold until pools notarizes past rewards (making impossible to accumulate not notarized blocks)

[30-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Prado#3941
The protocol could be written in different languges so developers of different coins could implement the protocol in minutes, making all pools implement an assetchain in the next years

[30-Aug-18 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is an api that pools and exchanges can use to find the last notarized block, dynamic lag and it can be done

[30-Aug-18 09:31 PM] Prado#3941
exactly

[30-Aug-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json

[30-Aug-18 09:32 PM] Prado#3941
you could concentrate 99% of the hash power as long as you notarize your winnings

[30-Aug-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it already exists, pools and exchanges just have to use it

[30-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Prado#3941
Nodes would have to comply as well?

[30-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Prado#3941
otherwise pools and exchanges could simply ignore the api

[30-Aug-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if value is not being transfered until notarized, then double spends are not an issue

[30-Aug-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
in order to double spend, there needs to be 2 spends (and typically a transfer of value from the 1st one to some other form)

[30-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Prado#3941
But it keeps the system with 10 minutes confirmation for transactions which happen 1000X times than blocks rewards, wouldn´t be better to put lag on rewards and not in transaction confirmations?

[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
onchain doesnt matter as if it is reorged, it is reorged and like it didnt happen

[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
only issue is when there is a transfer to some external item, like BTC via exchange

[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you are trying to solve a problem that isnt an actual problem

[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Prado#3941
Yeah, particulary exchange of tokens or coins for physical goods

[01-Sep-18 02:13 AM] Prado#3941
We could build a notarized pool and a security complement for dapps that reviews if nodes transactions or blocks are compromised (by not notarized miners and nodes) it will be really easy to add it in feature releases and we could put it publicly available to any dapp or assetchain that wants extra security wihtout white/black listing

[01-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Prado#3941
We can build an API to the assetchain core functions, so any pool in the world can implement the standard in relative no time. (komodo ones will be te most important for my projects but its the same for all)

[29-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Notarization onto eth for an auction.

[29-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Interesting what will happen as eth tries to become asic resistant with 'ProgPoW' or a move to PoS.

[11-Oct-18 09:22 AM] Seko#7408
Does Einsteinium already use dPoW? 

Then we will have the best advertising on October 14th when the hacker attacks.

[11-Oct-18 09:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
hacker found out, he's gonna attack something else, but may still try emc2 just to see what happens

[11-Oct-18 10:37 AM] Seko#7408
@actionslacks best advertising...

[11-Oct-18 11:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
i'm not completely sure but I think it has been implemented. they are ready for the attack, if it happens

[11-Oct-18 11:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
it was supposed to be a suprise

[11-Oct-18 11:27 AM] ted#5473

[11-Oct-18 11:29 AM] ted#5473
interesting

[11-Oct-18 11:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
seems like a lot of coins are getting delisted from exchanges now, so there is a widespread vulnerability. I support that the guy is doing it publicly

Hi, what info is available about an attacker once the attack starts? (What info would the chain have about who is performing the attack?)

Please read the following article regarding the Blockchain attack

The vast majority of the current blocks were claimed by the attacker, so generally there is nothing to worry about. we paused trading on our exchanges for now.

10/21/18 Blockchain Attack – Lethean – Medium
On 10/21/18 at approximately 00:00 UTC, it became clear to us that a malicious entity had attacked the LTHN blockchain. Until more…

[22-Oct-18 02:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
That attack requires at least 51%+ hashrate to pull off, and then exploits another issue

[02-Nov-18 04:33 PM] luke#8628
hello! someone mentioned a possible attack to me that would impact atomic swaps, and I was curious how barterDEX handles it. Let's say Alice wants to send BTC to Bob and receive ETH in return. My understanding is that Alice initiates the order, and a Bob accepts. Alice sends her deposit, which is 0.15% of the amount of BTC she plans to send. If Alice was malicious, after she sends her deposit, couldn't she sit around for 9 minutes until right before the next block is made on Bitcoin, to see if it is still favorable for her to make the trade (since the price of BTC may have changed by a lot more than 0.15% that she paid as deposit) and if she decides the trade is no longer beneficial to her, just not send her BTC effectively cancelling the trade? sure she would lose her deposit, but it would be a lot less than the amount she may lose on the trade. seems like attackers may try to take advantage of something like this. is this a known issue for atomic swaps? is it addressed by barterDEX?

[02-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The dex fee is less than that, and its not a deposit, its a fee, alice pays it and never gets it back.

[02-Nov-18 04:41 PM] luke#8628
ah, ok. I guess that would make this issue worse then right? because alice doesn't even need to consider getting her dex fee back. she is even more incentivized to cancel if not favoriable for her.

[02-Nov-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
She cant get it back

[02-Nov-18 05:32 PM] luke#8628
right, so she will be even more incentivized to not send her payment if the price of BTC changes in a direction that is unfavorable for her

[02-Nov-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
until the trade is completed, it isnt completed and will be undone, other than the alicefee. for this fee, alice does get to play around with slippage, but realistically BTC wont usually be changing 5% in price during an atomic swap

[02-Nov-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
also a node that is bailing out half the time will soon get black listed and nobody would want to trade with your node

[02-Nov-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and making a new account would make you have to start building reputation from scratch

[05-Nov-18 04:16 PM] luke#8628

[13-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Hi, question.

Say a small chain with little hash power is completely overtaken (90% of hashpower is malicious), creates a completely invalid block, i.e. it mints 1B tokens on one of the accounts out of thin air, then builds 1000 otherwise valid blocks on top of it, and then initiates a cross-shard tx by burning those 1B tokens.

Would Komodo somehow spot that those 1B tokens originate in an invalid block?

[13-Dec-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the key words there is "invalid block"

[13-Dec-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
an invalid block will be rejected by all nodes

[13-Dec-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter how much hashrate you have

[13-Dec-18 06:42 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
so all nodes in Komodo validate all blocks in all chains?

[13-Dec-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
no, why would it have to?

[13-Dec-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
only nodes for chainX validate tx and blocks in chainX

[13-Dec-18 06:44 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
right, so if 90% of chainX hashpower is controlled by malicious nodes, who will detect that the chain they build has an invalid node?

[13-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the nodes for chainX

[13-Dec-18 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all nodes in all useful chain currencies validate all blocks in all chains
