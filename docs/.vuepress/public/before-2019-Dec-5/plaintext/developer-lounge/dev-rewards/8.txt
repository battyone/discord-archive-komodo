I see it's your team's mistake to keep it public while it shouldn't have been when you are till experimenting and deving.

[11-Dec-18 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The solution here is that i will finish this app for the community, then some other person can sink their funds into funding devs.

[11-Dec-18 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No there is no mistake here @grewalsatinder  from our end about keeping repo public. The only mistake is thinking community members would think about Komodo as a whole before their own self interest.

[11-Dec-18 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙂 If you don't consider it a mistake mate, then don't mind on the code being used by others.
I totally agree on the code being used in UN-Open-Sourced project is absolutely subject to objection.

[11-Dec-18 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The intentions of yours is good mate, I know. 
but keeping the repo private wouldn't have done any kind of harm

[11-Dec-18 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well not following the license is ok? Ripping our code instead of including our file is ok?

[11-Dec-18 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this whole situation would have been totally avoided.

[11-Dec-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can expect to have trust in the team, but you can never have a trust on external parties. Just for the sake of any kind of infringements I think it makes sense to take the repo private until it is solved and the project release.

[11-Dec-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't see anything wrong with that.

[11-Dec-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
>Ripping our code instead of including our file is ok?
hm.... I probably missed that chat log... 🤔

[11-Dec-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not good at all.

[11-Dec-18 09:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will leave the repo public, we have nothing to hide.

People that think I am in the wrong here is thinking about things backwards. I am done contributing my funds on development where it seems that self interest is more important than community interests.

[11-Dec-18 09:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The only people interested in our code is people from the Komodo community. If someone wanted to use it they could have contacted us about it so they can wait till we have launched.

[11-Dec-18 09:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We would have been fine with that.

[11-Dec-18 09:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is about principles. Especially when we have contributed the most paid dev hours (out side of the KMD team) to this project than probably everyone else combined (by a huge margin), for the betterment of Komodo.

[11-Dec-18 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Agree with you mate. 💯

[11-Dec-18 09:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
Regarding why the repo wasn’t private, the code was open source and linked to in this channel for review:

https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/502811530002300939/517217595800289382

The development of this whole project has been in the open. If you scroll up in this channel it’s pretty much a development log of the project since it began.

We can’t get peer review from the community on a closed source project.

And just because something is open source doesn’t mean others can take it and use it without attribution.

[11-Dec-18 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`which from what i understand with MIT they cannot do without including our file itself.`
then you misunderstand MIT

[11-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MIT means you can do what ever you want I am pretty sure ... its the most lax licence of all licences.

MIT = "do wtf you want, just mention me and include MIT"

[11-Dec-18 10:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can you see that they did not mention it from your high horse?

[11-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Mylo#8306
There is this thing called “reading between the lines”.  In the F/OSS community this is called “spirit”.   The spirit of these licenses is to foster innovation.

Capitalism rewards innovation, not centralized control of a piece of software.

[11-Dec-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Can you see that they did not mention it from your high horse?`
Since I am not privy to the internal communications they had with the company, I can see no such thing

[11-Dec-18 10:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What communication? 😃

[11-Dec-18 10:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The tweet was the first time we heard of it.

[11-Dec-18 10:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It doesn't matter what you heard, what matters is what the wallet people were told, you became irrelevant the second you clicked "push"

[11-Dec-18 10:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are saying that with MIT, people can do whatever they want. Now you are claiming that they dont need to abide by the license because we published the code?

[11-Dec-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810

from where I sit, you're looking at what the wallet people did and your cheif complaint is with them

[11-Dec-18 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
aside from the fact that you don't understand the license you used

[11-Dec-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I can tell the terms of the license were violated, but it has been promised that it will be fixed

[11-Dec-18 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`from what I can tell the terms of the license were violated, but it has been promised that it will be fixed`
near as I read everything, yes they were unintentionally violated and notification has since been made

[11-Dec-18 10:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Deleted User 

MUST - Include Copyright

You must include the copyright notice in all copies or substantial uses of the work.

[11-Dec-18 10:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can somehow read their minds now?

[11-Dec-18 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You must include the copyright notice in all copies or substantial uses of the work.`
And you know that they didn't do so how?

[11-Dec-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it was admitted that it wasnt

[11-Dec-18 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from what I read it has since been added to the wallet people as an addendum

[11-Dec-18 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which meets the spirit of the license

[11-Dec-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it was promised to be fixed, but not yet confirmed that it is fixed

[11-Dec-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of intent, the situation here is something that needs to be fixed, it was promised it will be fixed and once it is fixed, the problem is fixed

[11-Dec-18 10:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and once it is fixed, the problem is fixed`
@hyperDEX are you going to be reasonable once they show that they added the 1050 characters and let this all go?

[11-Dec-18 10:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all this shit, literally, over not adding 2 feken sentences

[11-Dec-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User I wish I could ☹

[11-Dec-18 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
I think it was more “the last straw” than the words.  It’s a continued lack of collaboration, communication and coordination.

[11-Dec-18 10:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am acting unreasonable?

[11-Dec-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
- MIT allows using the software/code with mention of it's source and authors with credit. 
- Magnum intends to add the credit where it used the code from. 
- Magnum is not open source? 
- Better open source the code and then add the rewards library.
- Until then  just hold on to that feature inaccessible until open sourced

[11-Dec-18 10:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They probably forgot about point one

[11-Dec-18 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I am acting unreasonable?`
In the scope that you're blowing up about "lost revenue" over someone not copy/pasting 2 sentences giving you credit that will never be seen where you're looking, yes!

[11-Dec-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then better make it inaccessible.

[11-Dec-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no obligation to open source

[11-Dec-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is a violation of the license

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if it is made to look like magnum is the one to have solved the rewards claiming, then they could get projects that otherwise hyperDEX might have gotten.

We have devs in this chat right? This should show "intent"

[11-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Maybe wrong licenses @Deleted User .  It’s bound to happen with the anarchy style licenses

[11-Dec-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so not getting attribution is actually quite a big deal

[11-Dec-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is in fact the only deal for MIT

[11-Dec-18 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c I get that' but I don't get how a text doc that is never going to appear in the js min is going to change that one way or the other

hyperDEX could point to the magnum wallet release and say "see they are using our tech, we made it."

[11-Dec-18 10:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I cant believe @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you are defending a closed source wallet that stole work from a komodo community initiative .....just shows who you are. You make assumptions and can read their minds regarding their "intent".

[11-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Mylo#8306
@jl777c how is unSAFE and kmd different to what is happening here?

[11-Dec-18 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hyperDEX What I'm "defending" is that you made it open, said anyone can do anything they want with it, and then try to claim that they are wrong for doing what you said they could

[11-Dec-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mylo indeed

[11-Dec-18 10:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyways, i dont want to waste @jl777c / @Mylo / @grewalsatinder time. I will leave it be. There is nothing i can change and it seems like people would rather someone trying to leech from the community rather than contribute to it.

I am wrong for investing my own money to make apps for Komodo. Please punish me.

[11-Dec-18 10:24 AM] Mylo#8306
Appreciate the quick closing action.  It is still early days.

[11-Dec-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Are they wrong for not giving you credit? Yes
Are you wrong for claiming some "harm"? Maybe
Are you wrong for saying 2 opposing things (one now and one with the license you chose)? Yes

[11-Dec-18 10:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
Hey btw what do i do with all this OPALTKN?

[11-Dec-18 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is a harm to chainzilla.io business in my views. If the reputation is at stake.
Better sort this out.

@PTYX

[11-Dec-18 10:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh I thought Magnum is a project from PTY 🤔

[11-Dec-18 10:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
who are Magnum devs ?

[11-Dec-18 10:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@PTYX then mate, help @hyperDEX if you have a say with Magnum 😄

[11-Dec-18 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
__all__ that @PTYX is obligated to do is copy/paste 2 sentences to Magnum
nothing more, nothing less

[11-Dec-18 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072

[11-Dec-18 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, the largest issue here is the spirit of the license used vs the intent of the license that *should have been used*

[11-Dec-18 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
MIT seems to have been a wrong choice

[11-Dec-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
for what satinder wants, a GPL would have been better

[11-Dec-18 10:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was all under the impression that Magnum is PTY's project 😅

[11-Dec-18 10:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

I dont care for marketing right now. We need mm 2.0 for HyperDEX to be viable. My stop gap was this ledger app. We will still get this out as our app imports all the addresses whereas magnum doesnt, and who would trust their funds to a closed source project anyway.

[11-Dec-18 10:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
Good point

[11-Dec-18 10:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
