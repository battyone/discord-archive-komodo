Don't employ close source companies who steal code dude..

[12-Dec-18 01:48 PM] PTYX#6840
@blackjok3r why throw accusations or statements like that aimed at me?

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm one the 1%/battery bye

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
We are a team here man

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe another day

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes same team.. Bet at government

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And money loving

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] PTYX#6840
magnum isn't charging users to claim interest.

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] PTYX#6840
so what do you mean by money loving

[12-Dec-18 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U don't need money to live

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Don't employ close source companies who steal code dude..`
He had no way of knowing that instead of adding an unlinked text doc, that they could point to at any time, @Magnum Wallet was going to create an even bigger issue than was to begin with

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
Some unknown asshat from magnum wallet comes im here shitting on our efforts... wtf dude

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He knew they were closed source

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Fuk that

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] PTYX#6840
@actionslacks you do understand they are the first wallet that managed to implement the claim function right?

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] PTYX#6840
not even agama

[12-Dec-18 01:50 PM] PTYX#6840
So how is that bad for the ecosystem?

[12-Dec-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`shitting on our efforts...`
remind me which part of the code is yours.....

[12-Dec-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I bet bill gates is slaughtering babies right now

[12-Dec-18 01:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But u know

[12-Dec-18 01:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
Dude had ledger acknowledge your pull request first... maybe you would have a point

[12-Dec-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`He knew they were closed source`
Right, because no one in this ecosystem uses closed-source mining apps, right? ü§¶üèΩ

[12-Dec-18 01:53 PM] PTYX#6840
@actionslacks the eyes see what the mind says. there is no arguing with someone who doesn't want their mind changed.

make sure you specify it's a bug report

[12-Dec-18 01:55 PM] max8882#8882
OK,thanks

[12-Dec-18 01:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
Look man, we‚Äôre all in the same boat here. I support your efforts because i know you‚Äôve been here since day one. Just ask whoever you know at magnum wallet who their legal counsel is because they fucked up.

[12-Dec-18 01:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
Bad

[12-Dec-18 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
` Just ask whoever you know at magnum wallet who their legal counsel is because they fucked up.`
That's not his job and ...
for the sake of the ecosystem, I feel the need to reiterate (as many times as necessary)...
**For the record:**
The failure to cite MIT __*to*__ @Magnum Wallet and the current accusations __*against*__ @Magnum Wallet are separate, __unrelated__ issues

Its thanks to a patent law

[12-Dec-18 02:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
Here is how I see it... we can let @Magnum Wallet take a shit on the efforts of this community or we can make an example of them

[12-Dec-18 02:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
I am fully prepared, with the support of @hyperDEX and @lukechilds to file suit against @Magnum Wallet for lack of attribution

[12-Dec-18 02:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
I am perfectly within my rights to do so and will cover all legal costs herein

[12-Dec-18 02:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
I dont even want any damages, i just want that smug fuck to acknowledge the work of @lukechilds

[12-Dec-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`we can let @Magnum Wallet take a shit on the efforts of this community or we can make an example of them`
That's not even a question at this point, imo
From my perspective, the **main** thing is to ensure that the actions of a 3rd party (specifically @Magnum Wallet *in this instance*) do not get conflated with the action of someone in this ecosystem using that 3rd party (specifically @PTYX  *in this instance*).
It's important to keep the initial lack of 2 text sentences distinctly separate from any blatant action after license was more than well known

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
Look, the fucking ledger thing has been a thorn in the paw of kmd for YEARS

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
If i was magnum, i would drop Komodo and move on. I wouldn't want to deal with this sort of community. One that blames and points fingers at the command or because of pure bias.

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
they were the first to create a wallet to claim interest with the ledger without having to expose your keys

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
they are working on fixing the sapling ledger app

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
Luke and pondsea fixed it

[12-Dec-18 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
regardless, they had no working gui.

[12-Dec-18 02:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
Not fucking magnu wallet

[12-Dec-18 02:21 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm not excusing or saying it's good. what i am saying is, there is pure bias here from you and a few others.

[12-Dec-18 02:21 PM] PTYX#6840
honestly, that's what i will recommend to magnum. to drop komodo and keep chainzilla.

[12-Dec-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`If i was magnum, i would drop Komodo and move on.`
If Luke's current accusation is correct, I can't say that I believe that to be a bad thing

[12-Dec-18 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
then the users wont have any gui to claim until luke or someone else created it.

[12-Dec-18 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
these types of situations are not worth the effort.

[12-Dec-18 02:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
Gui shmooey

[12-Dec-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
No GUI > illegal GUI
imo

[12-Dec-18 02:24 PM] PTYX#6840
I will keep working with magnum. my recommendation to them is to drop Komodo. Leave the 2-3 to fix their gui and be happy.

[12-Dec-18 02:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
Blocknet, safecoin, decred, stop the fucking madness and stop the fucking biters

[12-Dec-18 02:25 PM] PTYX#6840
It will remove them from the equation.

[12-Dec-18 02:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Isn't that what you want? to have hyperdex team implement their own claim function in their gui

[12-Dec-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`my recommendation to them is to drop Komodo.`
my recommendation to everyone is to drop any wallet that blatantly lies about not using code

[12-Dec-18 02:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
If you guys wont i will @Magnum Wallet is a slam dunk case TODAY

[12-Dec-18 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Do what you have to do @actionslacks, same to the rest of you.

[12-Dec-18 02:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
Hahahaha how many lawyer have you talked to @Deleted User

[12-Dec-18 02:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
Well ip is a huge deal.

[12-Dec-18 02:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think there have been a few precedents. The really heartbreaking thing is that all @Magnum Wallet has to do is put some text in their code and they can save me a lot of money

[12-Dec-18 02:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
But if an example has to be made. So it shall be

[12-Dec-18 02:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
That fuck is smug

[12-Dec-18 02:32 PM] PTYX#6840
There is no damage to chainzilla emmanuel. let't not overeact once again

[12-Dec-18 02:32 PM] PTYX#6840
lol

[12-Dec-18 02:33 PM] PTYX#6840
the only damage are loss braincells from reading this

[12-Dec-18 02:33 PM] PTYX#6840
too long arguing the same thing

[12-Dec-18 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`There is no damage to chainzilla emmanuel. `
Provided that people don't conflate @Magnum Wallet's actions with being part of chainzilla....

[12-Dec-18 02:34 PM] PTYX#6840
this entire ordeal has been more damaging to Komodo's internal mood and collaborative spirit than it has or ever will to chainzilla.

[12-Dec-18 02:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
Sad

[12-Dec-18 02:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
Nice try though

[12-Dec-18 02:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
We are in danger of running off our hyperdex funder for what? Chainzilla? Of which you are the ceo @PTYX. Please elucidate us... mow much or YOUR proceeds were going to mm 2.0?

[12-Dec-18 02:41 PM] PTYX#6840
not sure what you are insinuating.

[12-Dec-18 02:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
You are the ceo of chainzilla?

[12-Dec-18 02:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes

[12-Dec-18 02:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
Ok well are you planning to or is @Magnum Wallet planning to contribute to the next generation of the atomic swap dex?

[12-Dec-18 02:43 PM] PTYX#6840
None of my funds are going into mm2. What is going in though is a full time staff trying to onboard projects on Komodo and find companies that want to build apps on the platform. I am not on a Komodo payroll, I am not part of the internal channels. We are a separate entity.

[12-Dec-18 02:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
Well so as far as core kmd investors are concerned would you agree to defer to someone like @hyperDEX ?

[12-Dec-18 02:45 PM] PTYX#6840
I dont have anything to prove how much pondsea spent on hyperdex

[12-Dec-18 02:45 PM] PTYX#6840
but as far as I know, that's his major contribution to the project.

[12-Dec-18 02:45 PM] PTYX#6840
Oh he is also a notary node.

[12-Dec-18 02:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
Well he spent a bunch on claiming ledger rewards as well and that is why we are having this conversation

[12-Dec-18 02:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
It has not been a trivial thing

[12-Dec-18 02:46 PM] PTYX#6840
if you feel you have a case against whoever and you want to pursue it. then go for it. i don't see how talking about it on discord is going to help your case.

[12-Dec-18 02:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
I‚Äôm just trying to give you some perspective man. We all see the world through our own eyes

[12-Dec-18 02:48 PM] PTYX#6840
I have enough perspective.

[12-Dec-18 02:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
The optics are not flattering to your project or magnum wallet

[12-Dec-18 02:48 PM] PTYX#6840
I think you are lumping two things into one problem with the goal of dragging chainzilla into the conversation

[12-Dec-18 02:49 PM] PTYX#6840
i've recommended the magnum team to drop Komodo. To drop the fix for the sapling ledger app, and to just focus on other platforms.

[12-Dec-18 02:49 PM] PTYX#6840
as a business man, these situations are not favorable in the sense that it creates divisions in the community

[12-Dec-18 02:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think that would wise at this juncture

[12-Dec-18 02:49 PM] PTYX#6840
as a community memeber, i am also with other points brought up but that's not my main role

[12-Dec-18 02:50 PM] PTYX#6840
however, this is a prime example why corporates, businesses, and legit companies hesitate to onboard to these platforms.

[12-Dec-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
many personalities, no control whatsoever, and tribalism. it's not suitable for any business at all.

[12-Dec-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
how does any of the last 15 minutes have anything to do with anything

[12-Dec-18 02:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
It doesnt, i‚Äôm turbo wasted
