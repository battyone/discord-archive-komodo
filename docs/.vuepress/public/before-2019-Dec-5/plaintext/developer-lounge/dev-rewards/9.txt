Hey, Magnum Wallet is here.
Let us clarify the yesterday issue from @hyperDEX and @lukechilds. 

Magnum is the active contributor for different coins, we are developing the universal wallet. Recently we decided to support Komodo, as one of the most valuable blockchains. Moreover, it has the perfect match with our marketing idea - multiply your funds. The user can multiply own funds using Komodo PoI build-in function. We have listed BTC, ETH, ETC, XTZ, BTG, BCH, Zilla and other coins in our wallet. It’s a blockchain infrastructure solution.

The claim of @hyperDEX and @lukechilds is about using the code that was written by @lukechilds chids. Magnum is closed source and because of this nobody is able to see the credentials in our source code. That is true, we are going to become open source next year, but not yet. 
But anyway, what we used from @lukechilds, it’s a getKomodoReward method that implements Komodo blockchain algorithm for claim value. I want to emphasise that its blockchain method, but not the know-how of the third party. It saved us about 1 hour. It’s not a rocket science to implement a known function that is described in the documentation I can say.

[11-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Magnum Wallet#0608
At the moment of Magnum release, @lukechilds child doesn’t have the working application to claim the rewards using Ledger. At least it doesn’t have transactions. 

We released the working app and make the delivery that solves Komodo needs. Now I see that getKomodoReward is a big deal. Okay, we have removed that method and any code that was used from @lukechilds child. We just spent 3 more hours to write the own code, test and rebuild to close the issue. 

Moreover, we don’t use the additional commission to own address for a claim using Ledger, as it was in @hyperDEX and @lukechild code. We are contributing solution for the Komodo community that covers customer needs, but not earning money from the users for the network basic functions.

I appreciate for the support of Magnum all of you and all the valuable feedback that we've got. It gives us the opportunity to make the Magnum even better. I wish good luck to @hyperDEX and @lukechilds child on their own way of contribution, using customer's comission.

welp there ya go, it's not rocket science to copy paste someone else's code without attribution then re-constitute it to be legally safe. It's like an episode of Silicon Valley. Thanks for dropping by @Magnum Wallet

[12-Dec-18 05:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Magnum Wallet I just checked your JavaScript bundle. You haven’t removed our code, you’ve renamed the function and moved some of the code around in what seems like a pretty poor attempt at trying to obfuscate it so I didn’t notice.

You now have the following method bundled in your code:

``` {
    key: "kmdCalculateRewards",
    value: function(t, e, r, n) {
        var i = t - e,
            o = Math.floor(i / 60),
            a = 0;
        return r < 7777777 && e >= 5e8 && o >= 60 && (r >= 1e6 && o > 44640 ? o = 44640 : (o > 525600 && (o = 525600), o -= 59), a = Math.floor(n / 10512e3) * o), Math.max(0, Math.floor(a))
    }
}
```

It uses the same same variables in the same order with the same checks in the same order and the exact same mathematic operations in a slightly different order as our original code.

You’ve literally just changed the name and moved the code to the opposite branches of the condition.

If the original code was:

``` if(check == false) {
  return 0;
}

return doCalculation(); ```

You’ve essentially changed it to:

``` if(check == true) {
  return doCalculation();
}

return 0; ```

After the code has been bundled and minified the code looks different but if you follow the resulting operations step by step it’s clear that that’s all that’s been changed. Did you really think I wouldn’t notice that?

So not only have you copied our code without attribution, when called out on it you’ve tried to obfuscate it and claim it as your own. This is a pretty shitty thing to do.

[12-Dec-18 05:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
``` I want to emphasise that its blockchain method, but not the know-how of the third party. ```

Why? Why do you want to emphasise that you haven’t benefitted from our work? Why are you so adamantly against giving any attribution? Did you not benefit from our “know-how” getting the changes necessary into the Ledger firmware to make all of this even possible?

And when asked to respect the MIT license, why wouldn’t you just add attribution? Why would you instead “delete” the code and implement it “yourself” to avoid having to add attribution? Our solution is open source and free to use, even in closed source applications like yours. The MIT license allows that. You just need to provide attribution. Seems like a rather strange and pointless course of action to take.

[12-Dec-18 05:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
``` It saved us about 1 hour. It’s not a rocket science to implement a known function that is described in the documentation I can say. ```

I’m not claiming it’s rocket science, but it wasn’t just a 1 hour job either and it’s not described in documentation. I don’t recall exactly but I think it took me a few days to understand how it worked, implement it and test it thoroughly against the `komodod` consensus rules. There is no documentation on how the reward claim works at the low level like you claim, that’s why it took me so long to implement. There is only the Komodo implementation for reference: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/dev/src/komodo_interest.h which is a little hard to follow as it also seems to contain a lot of other code important for enforcing consensus or legacy reasons which isn’t really relevant in a client implementation. I’m sure @jl777c remembers me picking his brain over every other line of code to make sure I correctly understood what it did as I was implementing it.

I also used the JavaScript implementation by @pbca26 and the PHP implementation by @CHMEX as reference. They were a great help (thanks guys) but neither of those implementations follow the Komodo consensus perfectly. That is testament to the fact that it’s not a straight forward 1 hour job to implement. As far as I’m aware, our implementation is the only client implementation that follows the `komodod` consensus rules perfectly.

So based on the facts, I see only two possibilities that can result in this outcome:

Possibility 1

You have access to this secret documentation you mention that explains in detail how the reward claim functionality works at a low level. You used this documentation along with your impressive programming skills to implement a JavaScript solution that by some crazy coincidence is identical to ours in every way apart from inverting the conditional logic. You do all of this and test it against the consensus rules in a single hour.

Possibility 2

You copied our code, attempted to obfuscate it so I wouldn’t notice, and failed dramatically.

I’ll let the community decide which they think is the most realistic possibility.

You’ve made it clear you don’t intend to honour our license and provide attribution so I don’t see any point in continuing to be involved in this discussion.

I’m speaking on behalf of myself only and am not an official part of the team here @Magnum Wallet. This action only serves to alienate you from the kmd community. The right thing to do would be to simply give credit where credit is due. You copied the code, and distributed it as your own. That much you have acknowledged. It would benefit you a great deal to not be a dick about it. 🖕
