would be good to get a channel anyway to keep everything in one place, I'll probs come back with regular questions regarding the reward claiming
we hit a little road block with the app, it turns out the current official KMD app implements BTC consensus rule checks on the TX before signing
and having an output amount larger than the input amount violates this and causes the Ledger to throw an error
You can see the function here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

For more context it's called from here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/main.c#L1987

LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc

I've "fixed" this with a pretty simple hack here: https://github.com/lukechilds/ledger-app-btc/commit/e2ebcada593710faf8f438bd26d21a170a3b60d4
GitHub
Allow Ledger to sign Komodo reward claim transactions ¬∑ lukechild...

it works, and bypasses the check for KMD
However the txfee amounts shown to the user now overflow for reward claim transactions
I wanted to implement the reward amount calculations on the device but:
1) It is completely incompatible with the current BTC protocol coin codebase
2) I'm almost certain Ledger won't accept a PR with all that code

The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them. So we'd need to completely fork the BTC app, add support for passing block height info to the Ledger, implement all the KMD interest consensus rules on the device, and then fork their API client and add the block height support to that too. :/
so the current solution is preferable to that
just force allowing any output amount
Just wanted your opinion on if this change is ok, I don't think it should have any negative effects
The only down side I can see is, if the outputs are larger than the inputs the txfee value overflows so it displays the txfee as like a bazillion KMD
but that would only ever happen if the output amount is larger than the input amount
e.g with an reward claim TX
normal TXs will show up fine
so no normal software is likely to encounter this
worst case scenario possible, someone accidentally crafts a TX that has way more outputs than inputs and sends it to the ledger to sign, the Ledger signs it without error, then they broadcast it to the network and it gets rejected instantly
no loss of funds
it will just sign TXs that break the consensus rules in the single scenario that the outputs are too large
I think
but yeah, I'm a little out of my depth, I'm not very familiar with C at all
so would be great to get your opinion on that
and also if you or anyone else can see an obvious way to not make the txfee overflow so we can show negative fees like on explorers rather that ridiculously high numbers that would be great too

Great work @lukechilds üòÉ

[19-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe one way is to have two different claim functions? one for old rule utxo and one for new?

[19-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
or it could try the oldrules and if error, then use the new rules

[19-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as how GUI displays negative numbers,that seems up to the GUI side of things

[19-Oct-18 12:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
sorry, should have been more clear, regarding calculating the claim amounts, that all happens in the web app, the Ledger device has nothing to do with that.

It's not the GUI displaying a negative number, it's the actual Ledger device itself. It overflows negative numbers as their store as an `unsigned char`:  https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

KMD Fee over flow (should be -1 KMD)

[19-Oct-18 12:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can see in that example ‚òù

[19-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a bit distressing

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
lol

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
The input amount is 15 KDM and the output amount is 16 KMD

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
so it should be -1 KMD

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
but overflows to that huge number

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but the sum of inputs is really less than sum of outputs, so it is a negative fee using normal rules

[19-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it works ok and the explorer shows it, maybe its a feature?

[19-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
when you see big giant txfee, that means you claimed!

[19-Oct-18 12:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, they can check out output amounts on the device

[19-Oct-18 12:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
so as long as those are correct, the user can safely ignore the txfee

[19-Oct-18 12:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
only thing I'm worried about is Ledger not being happy about that and not accepting our PR

[19-Oct-18 12:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
but this would never happen with a normal TX using Ledger's KMD wallet

[19-Oct-18 12:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
so they might not notice

[19-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
can your pull request change their display code too?

[19-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but they likely wont notice

[19-Oct-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and i doubt users would complain if it is explained to them so they dont get a heart attack

[19-Oct-18 12:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah definitely, but I'm worried if I change to much, they also won't accept the PR. Not sure if your familiar with the codebase but BTC and all BTC style coins use a shared codebase with some if checks for different alts.

So if we had a few lines wrapped in an if check for KMD, (like it is now) they'll likely accept. If we go and rewrite large portions of the codebase that effects all currencies (the tx fee display) just to fix a bug in a very specific use case for one alt coin, I think they're much less likely to accept.

[19-Oct-18 12:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
so I'd rather try and sneak this in first

[19-Oct-18 12:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
if they have an issue, then we can look at fixing it and see if they're open to accepting it

[19-Oct-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i doubt they will care if the display shows overflow, they dont really seem to care much at all

[19-Oct-18 01:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
but regarding fixing that bug, i'm pretty far out of my comfort zone with all this C stuff, do you have any ideas?

It's the function that calculates the txfee here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71
The first argument `target` is the txfee. It's an `unsigned char` which seems confusing to me as it's a number. After some reading it seems an `unsigned char` is an ascii character AKA a number in the range 0...255 AKA an 8-bit integer.

So I'm not sure how it's getting interpreted as that huge number. I tried changing into a `signed char` which I thought might allow negative numbers but got the same issue. Maybe because `255` is hardcoded into the calculations as they're expecting it to be limited to 0...255?

its doing a long subtract one char at a time

[19-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
pointer to unsigned char, ie. array of them

[19-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it is overflowing into a negative number 0xf... which becomes 186...

[19-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the math is correct

[19-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is the display of the negative number

[19-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
well, maybe the math isnt correct, it is a bit tricky, but regardless negative fee will be a binary with MSB set

[19-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can do an if "KMD" and txfee is negative then display "reward claimed"

[19-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but of course that is a dream

[19-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is ok as it is, certainly much better than what we have now!

[19-Oct-18 01:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's a good idea actually

[19-Oct-18 01:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, not sure they'll go for that

[19-Oct-18 01:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
that could be a good option if they have an issue with the negative fees though

[19-Oct-18 01:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
but ok, what you say makes sense, I'll have a look into the display code and see if I can fiddle with anything there

[19-Oct-18 01:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks üëç

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
for the first pull request, just ignore the overflow, it seems harmless

[19-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and ledger wont notice or care

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it only happens to KMD, which they actively ignore for a year and thousands of customer requests

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt they value the sanctity of their positve txfee display

@lukechilds just want to make sure you are using integer math and truncating the numbers in the calcs. Agama had a bug due to using floating point and the fractional amount multiplied out bigger than allowed

[20-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Vertigo#0439
Sup guys noob question again.... Where does the 5.1% rewards come from?

[20-Oct-18 01:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The supply which is not out yet

[20-Oct-18 01:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Total ever going to be around 200mil

[20-Oct-18 01:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Current circulation is around 102mill?? Something like that

[20-Oct-18 01:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is mined and the majority of that goes to 5.1 rewards

[20-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Vertigo#0439
Ty.

[22-Oct-18 04:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c thanks for the heads up, all numbers are floating point by default in JS. I will write a comprehensive test suite to ensure all calculations are correct. Is there an accurate JS implementation of the reward calculations in Agama I can use for reference?

-= 59 is needed

[22-Oct-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
calcs need to use exact values from C code to be exact

[22-Oct-18 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
right, but there's no 777 in the C code and the `-= 59` is wrapped in a conditional in the C version

[22-Oct-18 09:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, I had assumed the calculations would consider time as 1 block equals 1 minute, regardless of what the real world time difference is.

The JS code is using the system clock. Is that correct? I'm not too sure about the C code, I'm not too familiar with C

[22-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
time() is the unixtime from system clock

[22-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the question about the 777, if the C code doesnt have it and you do, then it would claim slightly less

[22-Oct-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
which is pretty harmless and provides a buffer for any small calc differences

[22-Oct-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
as far as I can see, `time()` isn't used anywhere in the interest calculations

[22-Oct-18 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it's using block height as time, is that correct?

at least not with the lib I'm using

2 secs, let me find the pubkey

[24-Oct-18 10:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
address: `RMqevVxyUkgJdSqYEKj5CK4XcX5UvqFsyj `
pubkey: `02e4f4b2a6fc1b0b04ae652a961658802c94ffdbe5203ff45466b583c2ac6ec4eb `

why did you put 03e595e6e348e8d8571eef291a2bda3f4d5ee9c7be1d36991108a9815e86b9ed26 in the scriptSig?

I didn't, that's generated by the Ledger library, I pass it the previous transaction and the output index for the UTXO I'm spending.  The the BIP 44 derivation path for the privkey. And the output script. The library forms the transaction and sends it to the device to be signed.

do you know the pubkey for: RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm

I own that address so yeah, I can find it, however if you're thinking maybe I'm using the wrong output I don't think that's it. There are two outputs and I'm using `0` which I'm confident is the correct one. I just tried changing it to `1` to quickly test and then I get:

```
18: bad-txns-inputs-spent. Code:-26
```

Interestingly, the pubkey that this website derives: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ is different to the pubkey the Ledger pib is giving me

That website says: `02e4f4b2a6fc1b0b04ae652a961658802c94ffdbe5203ff45466b583c2ac6ec4eb`

assuming they are just different formats, one's compressed?
