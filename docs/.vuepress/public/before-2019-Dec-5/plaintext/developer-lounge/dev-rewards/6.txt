but still needs a bit of TLC

I can create a TLC chain. how many TLC coins do you need?

I hope that everyone in this channel remembers it was due to the work of Luke that made claiming rewards from ledger possible. The fact that @PTYX decided to steal our idea and steal the credit without contributing a cent to the development is low.

[10-Dec-18 08:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
the term ```interest``` was used and not ```rewards```. other than that... was it stolen?  I think @PTYX  has contributed to this ecosystem.  How much should it be to integrate the ledger claim feature? I'm sure this could be of value to future white label package clients.

[10-Dec-18 09:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The team uses rewards @actionslacks . @PTYX has contributed to the ecosystem i have no doubt, but who has funded the dev hours to get ledger claim support when ledger themselves did not want to do it? Who has contributed to the dev hours to test and come up with this solution?

Whilst i appreciate your input, you have no clue what you are talking about here.

[10-Dec-18 10:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
I often have no clue. carry on.

[10-Dec-18 10:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The answers to the questions above just to be clear was me. I paid for the dev hours to come up with a solution and to get ledger to merge in the code (Without this code merged there is no way for PTYX to do a rewards claim). I did it for the community and to hopefully collect a small fee so we can continue to fund more development for Komodo.

[10-Dec-18 10:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a punch in the guts when someone takes our idea and our hard work and claim it to be their own.

[10-Dec-18 12:54 PM] jorian#4555
he just shares the news, what is so wrong about that

[10-Dec-18 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840
@hyperDEX i stole your idea. how awful of me to use open source software.

[10-Dec-18 01:25 PM] PTYX#6840
if you wanted fame, money, or recognition, then you should have closed sourced it. I am not going to twiddle my thumbs and wait months to have a working claim function on a wallet. I also wasn't going to wait months to see the ChainZilla token on the ledger device. I think your behavior is childish, I do hope all those words sink in later when you read them again.

[10-Dec-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
not giving proper attribution is uncool

[10-Dec-18 01:30 PM] PTYX#6840
seriously?

what are supposed to do> add hyperdex on magnum's wallet?

[10-Dec-18 01:31 PM] PTYX#6840
thank you hyperdex project for getting the ledger module pulled over to github.

[10-Dec-18 01:32 PM] PTYX#6840

[10-Dec-18 01:32 PM] PTYX#6840

we'll even make a pretty graphic

it'll be posted later today üòÑ

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] PTYX#6840
so let me get this right. @hyperDEX funded the ledger implementation. didn't get a contract, didn't get paid, and released it to the open source wild before securing funding

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] PTYX#6840
how exactly does that work?

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] PTYX#6840
same for hyperdex

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] PTYX#6840
so........

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] PTYX#6840
how is that my fault

[10-Dec-18 01:35 PM] PTYX#6840
ok

[10-Dec-18 01:35 PM] PTYX#6840
it's simple. you get it to work 99% of the time, then you sell it

[10-Dec-18 01:35 PM] PTYX#6840
it's not rocket science.

[10-Dec-18 01:36 PM] PTYX#6840
you monetize every part of it. the trades, ads, and implementations. So there is revenue flowing however small.

[10-Dec-18 01:37 PM] PTYX#6840
but it needs to work first

[10-Dec-18 01:37 PM] PTYX#6840
noone wants to buy a DEX that dies every 15 minutes or drops connection for x, y, or z reason

i had a client that wanted a whitelabel HyperDEX

[10-Dec-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840
some weeks back. I brought them to @hyperDEX and didn't get a response for 2 weeks. The client is gone now, looking for something more reliable. However, i bring this point up to show the lack of business interest on hpyerdex's part

[10-Dec-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840

Was more of a jab towards PTY keeping the work closed sourced and charging projects to use it

[10-Dec-18 04:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's the other issue

[10-Dec-18 04:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
So there's the fact that this wallet  clearly makes use of our work on the Ledger firmware. But we've done that for the community, anyone is free to use that how they wish. It's kind of uncool to announce you've done it first right before we've made it clear we're about to publically announce our app, but whatever.

[10-Dec-18 04:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
There is another issue however

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] lukechilds#2707

```
For all software libraries, copyright law applies, and you must read and follow the license in order to use it legally. For a MIT licensed code library, if you distribute the resulting package, you must also distribute it with a copy of the license including the original copyright notices. Failure to do so is "stealing" or more technically a copyright violation, which you should address.
```

[10-Dec-18 04:34 PM] lukechilds#2707
I hate the idea of copyright and I'm definitely not going to sue anyone over a dispute. But sometime it does genuinely serve to protect the right of software developers, and I kind of just trust other developers to respect that.

üëç 

[10-Dec-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and here we have one community member copyright violating another. I expect this to be fixed ASAP

[10-Dec-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
If anyone is interested in viewing the actual license infringement, don't take my word for it, you can verify it for yourself.

Here is the link of the current minified JavaScript bundle being served by magnum wallet: https://app.magnumwallet.co/dist/build.js?v=99

You can search for the string "getKomodoRewards" which should bring you to this section of code:

```
{key:"getKomodoRewards",value:function(t,e,r,n){var i=Math.floor((t-e)/60);if(r>=7777777||e<5e8||n<1e9||i<60)return 0;var o=r>=1e6?44640:525600,a=Math.min(i,o);a-=59;var s=Math.floor(n/10512e3)*a;return Math.max(0,s)}}
```

This is a line for line direct copy of our getKomodoRewards() function here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/komodo-ledger-reward-claim/blob/master/src/lib/get-komodo-rewards.js

It looks different because it's been run through a build system and transpiled, minified and bundled. However if you view the logic line by line and compare it with our file you'll see it's functionally identical. 

if you run our function through a build system it'll come out looking the same.

I've added newlines at the end of each statement in the Magnum copy below if you want to compare it to our version more easily.

```
{
    key: "getKomodoRewards",
    value: function(t, e, r, n) {
        var i = Math.floor((t - e) / 60);
        if (r >= 7777777 || e < 5e8 || n < 1e9 || i < 60) return 0;
        var o = r >= 1e6 ? 44640 : 525600,
            a = Math.min(i, o);
        a -= 59;
        var s = Math.floor(n / 10512e3) * a;
        return Math.max(0, s)
    }
}
```

@Deleted User you would be over the top as well when you are the one funding the dev costs.

The community does not donate to these efforts.

[10-Dec-18 09:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I have paid for the development in the hope to get some revenue to keep adding features to hyperDEX which is again a funding hole. So unless you want to help contribute to this funding, words are cheap.

[10-Dec-18 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
