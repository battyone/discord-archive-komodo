Hippie!

[20-Dec-18 10:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
the addresses that you see for BTC, KMD and all other BTC forks, they are almost all in base58check format

[20-Dec-18 10:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
some new kinds of addresses are different, but don't worry about that for now

[20-Dec-18 10:40 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Is base 58 just as it sounds

[20-Dec-18 10:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
base58 is one thing, and then base58check is that plus a checksum

[20-Dec-18 10:40 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
It's a count upto 58 and then that's recorded as another digit to the left of the single digit.

[20-Dec-18 10:41 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Oh, want a checksum?

[20-Dec-18 10:41 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
What

[20-Dec-18 10:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
binary is base 2, octal is base 8, hex is base 16, and base58 is base 58

[20-Dec-18 10:42 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Did u study cryptography in pure maths?

[20-Dec-18 10:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
nope

[20-Dec-18 10:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
I studied differential equations, nothing to do with cryptography

[20-Dec-18 10:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
even so, any math knowledge will greatly help you learn other kinds of math

[20-Dec-18 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I studied the nonlinear wave equation which describes lasers, fluid mechanics and a bajillion other things

[20-Dec-18 10:44 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Yeah, like refraction and diffraction

[20-Dec-18 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
also studied computational methods, too

[20-Dec-18 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, sounds like you know some wave equation stuff 😃

[20-Dec-18 10:45 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
U coded matlab in arrays?

[20-Dec-18 10:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
i coded a lot of matlab and mathematica and fortran

[20-Dec-18 10:45 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
I studied a bit of computational physics at uni but dropped put 😭

[20-Dec-18 10:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
one of the first math-related open source things I ever wrote was a Perl module to solve N-th order ordinary differential equations in 2000: https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::ODE

I tired to create a model in matlab but it was too hard, lol

[20-Dec-18 10:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
cryptography and hash functions are discrete math, not continuous

[20-Dec-18 10:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
but many concepts still apply

[20-Dec-18 10:47 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Yeah, I wanted to get that book on discrete maths, the same guy that wrote the art of programming.

[20-Dec-18 10:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
difference equations are the equivalent of differential equations, with discrete variables

[20-Dec-18 10:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
Donald Knuth

[20-Dec-18 10:47 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Yeah, u know him

[20-Dec-18 10:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's one of the most important CS books, but it's also not easy to read 😃 I think I own them and read some parts, they are like encyclopedia's

[20-Dec-18 10:48 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
I've been relearning some of my uni maths and some computer science. Hopefully, it will help me in programming komodo and maybe fpgas

[20-Dec-18 10:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need to understand hash functions to understand cryptocoins, like MD5, SHA1, SHA256 etc..

[20-Dec-18 10:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are many, but understand the basics that they all share

[20-Dec-18 10:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
linear algebra and vector/tensor analysis will be helpful for FPGAs

[20-Dec-18 10:49 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Yeah, I will. I'm really looking forward to the new year when my books arrive.

[20-Dec-18 10:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
theory of signal processing as well

[20-Dec-18 10:50 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Sweet. I'm going to take note of all this.

[20-Dec-18 10:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
FPGAs allow you to operate on large buckets of data at the same time, so everything is vectorized/matrix format

[20-Dec-18 10:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
FPGAs have their own kinds of programming language as well

[20-Dec-18 10:50 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Interesting data structure

[20-Dec-18 10:50 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Like matlab

Yeah, I was wondering how good u need to be. If it's like phd mathematicians learning it, I guess I wouldn't be able to compete

[20-Dec-18 10:52 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Wow, thanks buddy, you are super helpful.

[20-Dec-18 10:53 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
When I get enough money I can save up for those books and we can try and master it together! 😃

[20-Dec-18 10:54 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Anyway, I'm getting to bed now. I will study those things in the new year. Super looking forward to it.

[21-Dec-18 12:56 AM] SuSC135#6248
for testing a smart contract . should I create a new asset chain on my system and then try to query it with my existing asset chain? Or should I create a new asset chain in a different system and try to communicate with it? How should I proceed?

[21-Dec-18 12:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 either option, also regtest mode is an option

[21-Dec-18 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
there must be some nodes running, maybe at least 2 sometimes, which know about your CC contract

[21-Dec-18 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
spin up locally and talk to it via localhost is probably what you want

[21-Dec-18 12:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
regtest mode makes it so mining blocks is very easy, it's for testing locally

[21-Dec-18 12:58 AM] SuSC135#6248
By testing I mean i want to create an application like a payment gateway using channel contract

[21-Dec-18 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can also test on KMD labs if the current assetchains have the params you need

[21-Dec-18 07:55 PM] SuSC135#6248
I have created a channel contract. And when I am trying to do a channel open I get an error. The error doesn't give lot of information . Where am I going wrong

[21-Dec-18 07:55 PM] SuSC135#6248
``komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=ChannelTest channelsopen 02d78a9254afc4b0715204364ff358b51b0a9c6744600976052967f2182e3ce9cd 10 10000000
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt create channelsopen transaction"
}``

[21-Dec-18 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 Could you restart `-ac_name=ChannelTest` daemon with `--daemon` param to see the daemon output and try again?

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Regards your previous question about best CC testing environment:
I think it's a best idea to spin own chain to not depends on someones updates and not guess if other nodes have same software versions when testing. It's super easy to spinoff chain so I don't see any reasons to not do it in private tests.

[21-Dec-18 09:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
yes I did spin up two different asset chains in my own system. with different port numbers and I am trying to open a channel between them.

[21-Dec-18 09:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
now I am getting this error

[21-Dec-18 09:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
``error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet``

[21-Dec-18 09:48 PM] SuSC135#6248
Here I have given pubkey of first assest chain

[21-Dec-18 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so actually this error means what it types: 
1) you have to get a pubkey on your assetchain for each node. Like a 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ChannelTest getaccountaddress ""
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ChannelTest validateaddress address^^```

[21-Dec-18 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
2) stop daemon and restart with -pubkey= param with pubkey which you get from actions above (other words pubkey valid for this wallet)

[21-Dec-18 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodod -ac_name=ChannelTest otherparams... -pubkey=pubkeyfromvalidateaddressoutput ...  ```

[21-Dec-18 09:54 PM] SuSC135#6248
So let me get this right.. I have two asset chains KMDICE and ChannelTest.  And  I gave the pubkey of KMDice as a destination address in channelsopen of  ChannelTest asset chain

[21-Dec-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what?

[21-Dec-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
channels is not cross chain

[21-Dec-18 09:56 PM] TonyL#3577
You have to open channel between pubkeys on the same chain

[21-Dec-18 09:57 PM] SuSC135#6248
Oh!! ok . So  I should have the address present in the same wallet of  a single chain. I get it now. Thank You

[21-Dec-18 09:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Destination pubkey may be related to any other wallet but on the same chain. And to be able to interact with CC by assetchain daemon you have to start it with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet

It's displaying channels list and possible to open a new channel - if I remember correct you asked about Python so maybe will be interesting for you @SuSC135

[21-Dec-18 10:03 PM] TonyL#3577
trollbox_gui source code is a crap 😃  but channels gui I've tried to make as clear as possible

[21-Dec-18 10:04 PM] SuSC135#6248
Yes I am creating a project on python. I will look into this. Maybe I can get better sense of the channels

[21-Dec-18 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh in GUI not much channels RPC calls so far so will not help the logic.
https://github.com/gcharang/cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/channels_cc_cli.py here an old channels TUI which implemented all the calls (but JSON outputs of channels changed since this time)

@SuSC135 just backed to my channels code - quite important moment `channelsinfo` call logic changed: 
now channelid as param is mandatory (before was possible to call it without an arguments) and new `channelslist` call was added. Also JSONs have a new look. So code above should not work 
I've reflected these changes in RPC calls desc file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l0dWEPcrv9zE11_TD-XrX_HIYV0VLpadCJN6hvaZERc/edit#gid=55258823 (channels page)

I went through your documents yesterday and I feel did something wrong  in the way I created and validated my address. I am still getiing the same kind of error ``error code: -1

[22-Dec-18 07:13 PM] SuSC135#6248

valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet - on assetchain for which you starting the daemon, not KMD chain

[22-Dec-18 07:48 PM] SuSC135#6248
yes i am sorry i did it on the asset chain only... I made a mistake in typing the command

[22-Dec-18 07:48 PM] SuSC135#6248

Could you please try to do this actions sequence again @SuSC135  ?

[22-Dec-18 07:56 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have 2 daemons and run one of them with correct pubkey - maybe you're issuing CC RPC calls on the second one which started without correct -pubkey param. Just an assumption

[22-Dec-18 07:58 PM] SuSC135#6248
So just for my understanding two deamons is one with komdod.exe or./komodod and another one is the RPC issusing daemon komod-cli.exe or ./komodo-cli
