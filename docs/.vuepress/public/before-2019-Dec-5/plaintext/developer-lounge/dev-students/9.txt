my guess is that they are connected properly and neither started mining

I am able to ping to to my other system but if I run **getpeerinfo** I am getting an empty array. I am using same asset chain name on both systems . Where do you think I am going wrong @Alright

[26-Jan-19 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
port is open?

[26-Jan-19 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of ping try `telnet <ip> <port>`

[26-Jan-19 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
port is p2p port and is shown in getinfo

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] SuSC135#6248
oh yes I think port is not getting connected

[26-Jan-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
firewall?

[26-Jan-19 07:33 AM] SuSC135#6248
I dont think its firewall issue. I checked the firewall. Is it because telnet is not installed in my system?

[26-Jan-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Telnet is on every system, o e of your nodes must be behind Nat

[26-Jan-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 if you can ping, but not other things, you probably have those TCP ports filtered by a firewall or one of the nodes itself

[26-Jan-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
you must open up the p2p ports on both nodes, and allow that port on any firewwall between them, too

[26-Jan-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
rpc port is usually only needed on localhost

[26-Jan-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
ping uses ICMP, which is often not filtered by firewalls

[26-Jan-19 05:58 PM] SuSC135#6248
My port is 12562 and i have allowed it on both nodes

[26-Jan-19 05:58 PM] SuSC135#6248

[26-Jan-19 06:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
And when I run the netsat it shows the port is not bound to any ip address

[26-Jan-19 06:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I think for issue isolation you may totally disable firewall / allow all traffic in your local network rules - if it works it means issue is here and you can setup it proper then from scratch. If no - have to find problem somewhere else.

[26-Jan-19 06:36 PM] TonyL#3577
There are a lot of tools to check connectivity / network configuration such as proposed above `telnet` or let's say `traceroute` (possible to provide port as param to traceroute as well - so you'll see where traffic is not pass / blocked), `tcpdump` is very powerful as well

[27-Jan-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 it's easy to use `curl` to verify a certain port is open

[27-Jan-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
curl will give different errors, based on whether the port is blocked, versus doing an invalid HTTP request against a p2p full node port

[27-Jan-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
use `curl -v`

[27-Jan-19 03:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
also make sure you are using the p2p port number, not the rpc port

[28-Jan-19 04:07 AM] SuSC135#6248
I did both traceroute and curl. It seems that the port 12562 is not bound to the ip address of the node.  its rather bound to 0.0.0.0:12562. Is there any way to change this?

[28-Jan-19 05:44 AM] cipi#4502
0.0.0.0 is OK, since it means it listens to all IPs that the node has... does the node have a public IP and not some private IPs? What is the IP of this node? `sudo ifconfig`

[28-Jan-19 05:57 AM] SuSC135#6248
I am running two VM in the same system and the IP address is 192.168.56.1

[28-Jan-19 06:01 AM] cipi#4502
ok, that is another story... seems the 2 VMs can't see each other because the host system does not route traffic from one VM to the other... but i am not familiar with VMs and how the host system must be configured to do that, since i don't use VMs

[28-Jan-19 06:05 AM] cipi#4502
i would google for something like "virtual switch VM"

[28-Jan-19 06:10 AM] cipi#4502
so basically both VMs must be in the same network, e.g. 192.168.x.x and be connected to the same "virtual switch"

[28-Jan-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fopr VMs I use a bridged adapter.... let your router give each VM its own IP...

[28-Jan-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this then works every time... and you can Port Forward a port to internet to let outside nodes conenct aswell.

[28-Jan-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With VirtualBox this is pretty easy, just chagne netowrk adapter to Bridged. Using QEMU its a bit tricky.

[28-Jan-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 yeah, if you have VMs, you need to do extra work to allow them to get traffic

[28-Jan-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i used vagrant in the past, and in the Vagrantfile, you can specify mapping a host port to a VM port

[28-Jan-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's the safest default for VMs to not be able to access the outside world, so that is usually the default

[29-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Mylo#8306

The article mentions these networking issues I have faced with @Bryan_Beus in various testing scenarios

[29-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Mylo#8306
And tbh docker provides the least networking headaches in exchange for some docker tool fundamentals.

Networking is a layer too far down for most devs learning dev stuff, compared to a devops tool which is closer to a new dev workflow

Should I buy a book or use something like KahnAcademy?

[20-Feb-19 11:57 PM] walrus#8604
just a quick question:

[20-Feb-19 11:57 PM] walrus#8604
I have set up an asset chain...on a remote aws node
say, that node is node 1
other nodes are joining in.....to that asset chain
previously node 1 was able to transfer coins to other nodes...but now whenever node 1 sends coins to other nodes....on other nodes logs it shows: ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found
Transactions from other nodes are going through fine
But coin transfers from node 1 is not being accepted.
any idea what could be the reason?

[20-Feb-19 11:59 PM] walrus#8604
From node-1's wallet, coins are being deducted...but on recipient's end it says: ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found

Have you tried restarting node 1's daemon?
