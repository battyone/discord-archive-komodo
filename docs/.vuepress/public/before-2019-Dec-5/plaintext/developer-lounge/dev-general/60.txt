why does activating best chain takes too long ?

[15-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
sometimes

[15-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am stuck on my local host before it used to work fine

[15-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but now its stuck on activating best

[15-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094

what is happening

[15-Nov-18 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@D.rabbani shouldn't take that long, usually that lasts for a few seconds or maybe minutes. Perhaps something triggered a full rescan

[15-Nov-18 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326

thanks

[15-Nov-18 09:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@D.rabbani it will be in a subdir of that, for an asset chain, like ~/.komodo/MYCHAIN/debug.log

[15-Nov-18 09:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has the top-level debug.log

[15-Nov-18 09:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094

i got i t

[15-Nov-18 09:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
yup

[15-Nov-18 09:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
its ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/debug.log on OS X, somewhere else on other crazy OS's

[15-Nov-18 09:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yup but debug log doesnt show any error

[15-Nov-18 09:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know what to do now

[15-Nov-18 09:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its normal

[15-Nov-18 09:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as always

[15-Nov-18 09:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@D.rabbani do you have a HD or partition full? is does the debug.log have new stuff as you `tail -f` it ?

[15-Nov-18 09:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes you need to look further up the debug.log, maybe hundreds of lines

[15-Nov-18 09:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
the thing you want is not always at the very end

[15-Nov-18 10:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai its running the log so ill let you know thanks alot for that ]

i am on the learning pahse

[15-Nov-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
another question please if someone can reply

[15-Nov-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is it possible that we can only give the command without the supply and reward and en ? for syncing with other nodes or is it necessary to do that ? i mean to say shall i give like that 
./komodo-cli -ac_name =EXAMPLECOIN -addnode=1.1.1.12 -addnode=1.2.2.13  ?? will that work

[15-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo-cli is local

[15-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
komodod needs all the parameters, otherwise it is a different chain

[15-Nov-18 11:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but we are giving the parameter in the -ac_name is not enough for the komodod ?

[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
do we need to give the full supply including the rewards and the end to our clients actually just want that hidden from the clients the suply and the rewards ?

[15-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
how is a node supposed to know the chain parameters if it never sees it?

[15-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some repository of chain parameters can be setup, but for now each node needs to be given the exact parameters

{Reactions}

[15-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just make a script file that encapsulates all the parameters and have users just run the script file

[15-Nov-18 11:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
true that @jl777c  we can give that to the users thanks alot for the help

[15-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Kmdlabs startscripts encapsulate the chain params in a json file - pulled from git on activation. That works nicely.

[15-Nov-18 02:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can we change the -ac_end ?? afterwards ? just asking >

[15-Nov-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you change any chain parameters, you change the chain

[15-Nov-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
immutable and all that

Hi! Please point me to where can I find patched node for insight explorer?

[16-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
add -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -timestampindex=1 to any komodod. that enables the insight required rpc calls

[16-Nov-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CMaurice do you know if your code validated addresses in any way, where if we try to use KMD address like `Rfoo..`, will it allow that?

[16-Nov-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems to allow setting an RPC port, which is good

[16-Nov-18 04:42 PM] CMaurice#1685
No idea, @dukeleto , I just came across the repo earlier and dumped the epub docs for later perusal.

[16-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
I could use some help debugging this chain if anyone has some time right now. 
`./komodod -ac_name=PTX -ac_supply=12000000 -ac_end=12000000 -ac_staked=50 -ac_reward=1500000000 -ac_pubkey=0359e2ee32833398c26378a2bb0962f98a7d77f3f6e6e4d27316bcb85542f23c61 -addnode=104.168.134.47` 
Seems it's bugged out. I can connect to peers, but it will never start syncing blocks. Any ideas?

[16-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Alright#0419
Has anyone ever experienced something similar?

[17-Nov-18 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright is there any node with non 0 blocks amount?

[17-Nov-18 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I get `18-11-17 05:18:54 connect() to 217.182.203.106:26435 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)` in debug.log

[17-Nov-18 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe node/s which got blocks have some network restrictions on connections

[17-Nov-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
all assetchains currently use KMD's DNS seeders

[17-Nov-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
that's where it got that address I assume

[17-Nov-18 05:23 AM] TonyL#3577
```  "blocks": 0,
  "longestchain": 0,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "tiptime": 1231006505,
  "connections": 3,```
In general seems I have same situation as you

[17-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
do `getpeerinfo`

[17-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
you see peers with blocks, yes?

[17-Nov-18 05:24 AM] TonyL#3577
All my peers have `"synced_blocks": -1`

[17-Nov-18 05:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I think ` "inbound":false` for all peers is a clue

[17-Nov-18 05:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I had quite similar issues when used cloud instances for AC building (by default inbound traffic was restricted)

[17-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
I believe "synced_blocks" is the amount of blocks you synced from that specific peer

[17-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
Ahhhh

[17-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
the inbound thing might explain it

hi
anyone can  help me how to generate komodo wallete address using nodejs

[19-Nov-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
same as bitcoin address, just use prefix of 60

[19-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Rohit#0772
var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')
const btc = bitcoin.networks.bitcoin;
const keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
const { address } = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({ pubkey: keyPair.publicKey, network: btc })
const privKey = keyPair.toWIF();
console.log("add: ", address, "\npriv: ", privKey);

[19-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Rohit#0772
?

[19-Nov-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810

[19-Nov-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
probably dont want to use the bitcoin network. i guess there are more customizations needed

[19-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Rohit#0772
where i  use prifix of 60

[19-Nov-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont know about javascript, hopefully someone else knows

[19-Nov-18 11:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c  60 is in decimal correct? Is it the same prefix for p2sh also?

[19-Nov-18 11:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@Rohit I don't know much but, In this file: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/test/integration/addresses.js#L6 the LITECOIN const is defined, it has `pubKeyHash: 0x30,` I would guess a similar const for Komodo needs to be defined and change the `pubKeyHash` value
