After it many things were merged so it's broken atm, Decker working on it

_goes back to doing useful things on a real computer 🤷_

[09-Jun-19 06:25 PM] ca333#0118
@TonyL which branch fails on OSX right now - last fix was few minutes effort to refix. Maybe i can provide a quick hotfix for genie.

[09-Jun-19 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm assuming (dangerous as that is) that it's a makefile issue, given that it's looking for a linux path

[09-Jun-19 06:33 PM] ca333#0118
yes exactly - its `-I` including a wrong path to berkleydb headers - checking shortly

[09-Jun-19 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 Checked yesterday - komodoplatform/beta failing with:
```komodo.h:811:26: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]

make[2]: *** [libbitcoin_server_a-main.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

beta/FSM/jl777 branches of jl777 repo failing with ```../depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/include/db_cxx.h: No such file or directory```

[10-Jun-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😖  no, I didn't notice the repo and was still on jl777/dev

[10-Jun-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577

[10-Jun-19 06:58 AM] ca333#0118
fyi - it was just a nightly quickfix and i didnt check it further, just ensured it builds successfully - we will sync up all branches and ensure they have a truly clean build procedure.

[10-Jun-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I think if you're new to blockchain this book might be a good start: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook
Then Komodo documentation for Komodo-specific moments:
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/ 
And somewhere between masterting cryptoconditons book to to soak up the CCs idea: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/all_chapters.md

What command can I use to find the utxos in my wallet?

So, I don't want to know what my balances are in my addresses. I want to see the actual utxo data structure.

[11-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Anyone know?

looks like it's `gettransaction` and then `getrawtransaction` from the hex... maybe...

listunspent

[11-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[11-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[11-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm hoping for something that shows the vins and vouts as a part of the same data structure.

[11-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
gettransaction -> hex value -> decoderawtransaction

We talk in the content about how a utxo has a vin, and the future transaction that spends it consumes its vouts...

[11-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh!

[11-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Wait, I think maybe I get it.

[11-Jun-19 07:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, a utxo has vouts, but there are no vins that match it in the chain, is that right?

[11-Jun-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
to be able to spent a utxo, it needs to start as a vout

[11-Jun-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
when you spend it, it is used as a vin

[11-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That is to say, when a user spends a utxo, the data structure of the utxo in the database does not change. Rather, there is a new transaction created that has vins that match the vouts of the utxo. 

And this would explain why, for any given address, to find out the current value in that address, you must scan from the beginning of the chain?

[11-Jun-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is indeed a bit confusing

[11-Jun-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, unless a chain has -addressindex functionality (or spentindex)

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the raw chain just has vins and vouts

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Gotcha.

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, cool. Learned something new!

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Now, let's see if I can write it down in a way that makes sense for the reader....

[11-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.

@jl777c 

Another question.

Take a look at this transaction's vins and vouts.

If I'm reading it correctly, vout0 sends change to the vin address.
