[24-Oct-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they dont store anywhere

[24-Oct-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are used to mathmatically determine the private key

[24-Oct-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ie... fed as input to a function and then are gone.

[24-Oct-18 08:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Can you elaborate further please

[24-Oct-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Actually is there any documentation for that

[24-Oct-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
So that we cna learn

[24-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Oct-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
noththat I know of

[24-Oct-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
I just need further elaboration please like.how do they work

[24-Oct-18 08:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094

Can someone please help me with this for the tech docs.

I need the default installation directories for the actual `komodod` and `komodo-cli` executables on Mac and Win:

MacOS: `?`

Windows: `?`

GNU/Linux: `/opt/AgamaApp/resources/app/assets/bin/OS_NAME/`

[24-Oct-18 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus it can be on multiple locations depending on how you got the binaries

[24-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For the Agama app, meant to mention that

[24-Oct-18 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
if you compile them locally, they will be in `~/komodo/src/komodod`

[24-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need both for the source, and for the Agama app

[24-Oct-18 02:02 PM] SHossain#0007
so, you got the agama app

[24-Oct-18 02:02 PM] SHossain#0007
?

[24-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's what I have:

```
Once installed, find the installation location.

If you used the default Agama installer:

MacOS: `?`

Windows: `?`

GNU/Linux: `/opt/AgamaApp/resources/app/assets/bin/OS_NAME/`

If you built Komodo from source:

MacOS: `?`

Win: `?`

GNU/Linux: `~/komodo/src/`
```

[24-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For people who just want to test Komodo quickly, we don't want to require them to build from source. Too difficult and time consuming. We just want to use what's in Agama by default.

If they are going to a production mode, then building from source would seem to be okay.

[24-Oct-18 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
if you use portable version of Agama on winodws, you can browse inside the portable directory. same structure as macOS

[24-Oct-18 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
if you build, it is inside `./komodo/src/` dir always.

[24-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't understand what you mean by "browse inside the portable directory"

Can you copy/paste for me what they look like?

[24-Oct-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus hey

[24-Oct-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus "~/Library/Application Support/Komodo" on a mac

[24-Oct-18 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
for both *from source* and binary, as far as I know. I only compile from source

[24-Oct-18 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, you were asking about binary locations

@Bryan_Beus browse means, double click on each folder, go inside. check the address bar above

[24-Oct-18 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007
that's the location of komodo binaries inside agama portable dir

[24-Oct-18 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007
the location of agama portable dir will be where you exported or un zipped it

[24-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus portable version is all inclusive.   no dependencies around the system, all in the zip file come the stuff.
compile -> stuff is linked against shipped libraries or the libraries are bundled into the executable = portable, maybe statically linked in tech docs(? @dukeleto ?)

[24-Oct-18 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo yes, compiled version will most likely refer to various libraries on your system, and is not self-contained

[24-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jorian#4555
i used the macos binary from latest agama which seemed to work

[24-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jorian#4555
the one on github doesn't work

[24-Oct-18 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus you can use directly auto compiled komodo binary from here for all OS https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases
easier than using Agama if you are only after binary

Ok, thank you everyone. I'll let you know if I have more questions.

[24-Oct-18 07:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Remember that discussion we had about pukey's, and my initial confusion? How I previously thought pubkeys were for donating to the block chain's creator?

I found the parameter that I was confusing it with. I think Zcash uses this or something for their developer's reward.

## donation

> Using donation as a default value in the coin's .conf file:

```
donation=027dc7b5cfb5efca96674b45e9fda18df069d040b9fd9ff32c35df56005e330392
```

`donation` donates all user rewards to a specific address. This value must be set to a 33 byte pubkey.

[24-Oct-18 07:11 PM] Alright#0419
that sends accrued rewards to that pubkey's address

[24-Oct-18 07:11 PM] Alright#0419
user rewards

[24-Oct-18 07:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
sent a z tx of kmd.
opid showed success. gave txid.
didn't show on explorers after few minutes of showing the txid on my local machine.
restarted kmd daemon couple times, trying with or without vpn, seeing less connections to the daemon.
a lot of connection refused in debug.log.
after about half an hour that txid still isn't reflecting on any explorers.

okay, so it's okay to leave the wallet open and just check explorer after few minutes till it shows txid there.... 🤔

[25-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm inserting a lot of the documentation into the Slate framework, and while I'm doing so, I found a command that I was unable to get to execute properly.

getblockhashes

I'm trying it on my machine, but am getting an error.

```
$ ./komodo-cli getblockhashes 1485604126 1485604100
error code: -5
error message:
No information available for block hashes
```

What am I doing wrong?

[25-Oct-18 01:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Tried doing `getblock 1000` and `getblock 1010`, and pulling the timestamps off of those two blocks and using the stamps in `getblockhashes`, still no luck.

Can't remember what happened last time, but the coding examples are empty.

[25-Oct-18 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have  -timestampindex=1 set,  i think that is required for getblockhashes

A Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange That's Almost Decentralized - Coi...
Bisq is launching a bitcoin-based token to pay code contributors and a DAO to manage payouts, all in service of further decentralizing the exchange.

[25-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Mylo#8306
```
This is why bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer balks at the idea of calling Bisq a DEX at all. He told CoinDesk he sees Bisq as more of a peer-to-peer, over-the-counter trading desk.

"Exchanges that don't have [order books] can't really help with price discovery, and are open to all kinds of manipulation," Wertheimer said. "So they can't really be considered exchanges in the same way that the incumbents are."
```

What I'm trying to do.
for tokens CC contract I'm saving the output of `tokenlist` and `tokeninfo` in a file.
I can chose to store it in browser's localStorage or I can also choose to push it to golang web server and via that store it to a static file on file system.
right now as we have no such chain with big tokenslist, it's nothing in size. few bytes maybe. but I am testing it with big size. example a million token id saved in a file makes about 68M of file.

Good day to you guys (and ladies)!

SQLite actually has and always had a KV module, btree.h, and I was crazy enough to use it back when it was undocumented and use-at-your-own-risk thing (now it's a bit more official, https://www.sqlite.org/btreemodule.html)

looking for golang lib/package for it.

[26-Oct-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have any idea if has it for golang?

[26-Oct-18 09:08 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Not sure it does, but nowadays I'd just go with the baseline SQLite API (the one that's SQL based), because the overhead of the (prepared-and-cached) SQL queries over the KV version is neglible, especially when you're I/O bound.

[26-Oct-18 09:13 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Aside from SQLite, both KV and not, I've used Tokyo Cabinet, Berkeley DB, GDBM & co, DBF, LMDB, LevelDB and RocksDB. I think I've tried all the major players in the field, mostly because most of them had serious downsides. E.g. Tokyo Cabinet suffers from fragmentation, Berkeley DB is kind of slow, GDBM slows down when it grows, DBF needs vacuuming, LevelDB and RocksDB can only be accessed from a single process.

[26-Oct-18 09:17 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
LMDB, aside from having this fixed limit to it, also crashes a lot.   D

[26-Oct-18 09:22 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Until recently, there was no winner for me in this field.

I've always liked the SQLite interfaces, both KV and SQL. You can shoot yourself in the foot with them, but the thing is more flexible than the other databases. But until recently it had a crappy write speed.

New versions though has upped their game and in the WAL mode SQLite is now a serious contender to LMDB and LevelDB/RocksDB.
