also, is that issue related to only 'shield' or both 'shield' and 'z_sendmany'?

[06-Apr-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just "conf" means "rawconf" to me`
I can't make you think right, I can just lead you to right 😛

[06-Apr-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```  "rawconfirmations": 3,
  "confirmations": 1,```
I go by what the protocol tells me

[06-Apr-19 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i wrote almost every one those for the entire KMD rpc system, I get ya. That is a lovely hack so that exchanges don't have to change their code

[06-Apr-19 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
words are hard

[06-Apr-19 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
in the internals, confs = rawconfs, at the RPC layer, confs = dpowconfs

[06-Apr-19 03:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
how about that for fuckery

[06-Apr-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, I saw that zip already and thought it was a heavy bunch of `for why?`

[06-Apr-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so 1GB less 100 years from now?

[06-Apr-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my 1st thought was honestly
'Why not just fix the shit that doesn't work now before adding more shit that might not work?"

[06-Apr-19 04:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes off to ponder the rewrite of solo payments module to include maturity_

[06-Apr-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if dpowconfs is used, then coin maturity is moot

[06-Apr-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe it is good to have bigger maturity for non-notarized coins, though we have found that most non-notarized coins can likely be reorged 100 blocks

In case anybody doesn't like the new HUSH v3 chain, I have mined a vanity `RHushu8NbbVAMcoEi1yiymQyk2siZQMSuX` address, so people can send all their funds away and vote with their wallet that Hush sucks. See, I really do care about customer satisfaction

what is a flaw about it?

[08-Apr-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is about the mix network, like coinshuffle. 100% of participants need to collude to break it

[08-Apr-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
teams are randomly selected

I qwould say a resync would fix it. but that is not  the correct way to fix it. It needs an exemption for this when it is loading the chain on startup.

[12-Apr-19 05:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes resync fixxed it on stop chains ( and than I stopped because or takes forever ) would rather recompile a fix:)

[12-Apr-19 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
