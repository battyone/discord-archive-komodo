and you need to upfront the 2%

[23-Mar-19 01:01 AM] zack#6467
PoS is really hard

[23-Mar-19 01:02 AM] zack#6467
only 2% of the rewards for a couple months probably isn't too hard to raise.

[23-Mar-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but then distributing modified wallets to so many.

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it would work if some official type of company did this

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] zack#6467
it is no more difficult than distributing the non-modified wallets

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so they would have enough credibility for people to install it

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] zack#6467
yeah, you can combine it with a marketing push.
With enough false advertising, you will have believers thinking that the attack is necessary to save the chain.

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the MSFT 2% bonus wallet

[23-Mar-19 01:03 AM] zack#6467
haha yes

[23-Mar-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but if they end up doing nefarious things, likely loss of credibility/reputation might be a deterrent for any big established company

[23-Mar-19 01:04 AM] zack#6467
I wonder why Komodo doesn't use normal merged mining?

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
have you tried convincing miners to merge mine 50 different chains?

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
how about 500

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
5000?

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] zack#6467
if only 60% of people participate in the attack, it is possible to profitably attack, and reward everyone who participates, by completely destroying the 40% who do not participate.

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Some miners are morally opposed to mergemining

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] zack#6467
oh right. miners can only run so much software

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
its not scalable solution

[23-Mar-19 01:05 AM] zack#6467
yeah, that makes sense

[23-Mar-19 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and requires convincing miners

[23-Mar-19 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
must speak chinese

[23-Mar-19 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the 2% bonus attack is a new one, it might be the death of PoS

[23-Mar-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
can the attacks be done within a 10 block window?

[23-Mar-19 01:07 AM] zack#6467
Vitalik came up with these attacks, and he hasn't given up trying to build PoS. I am hopeful.

[23-Mar-19 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_barely speaks English, much less Chinese, and can't imagine a winning stance that would convince him to merge-mine_

[23-Mar-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
2% bribe

[23-Mar-19 01:07 AM] zack#6467
I think you can't get >50% of the network to update their full node in a 10 block window.
But you could activate a bunch of full nodes at the same moment if they already installed.

[23-Mar-19 01:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`2% bribe`
2% of what people think your net worth is?

[23-Mar-19 01:09 AM] zack#6467
so if your staking normally pays you $100 a month, if you participate in the attack you will be making $102 per month.

[23-Mar-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
definitely worth killing the chain over

[23-Mar-19 01:09 AM] zack#6467
haha

[23-Mar-19 01:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for $2 a month I wouldn't even attack WLC 😛

[23-Mar-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so a 3% drop in value and it doesnt make sense

[23-Mar-19 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
who knows what the market reaction would be to a chain under the 2% alternate client attack would be

[23-Mar-19 01:10 AM] zack#6467
if you look at the decision matrix for each participant, you can see the nash equilibrium is always to participate in the attack.
Because it is always 2% more profitable than the alternative

[23-Mar-19 01:10 AM] zack#6467
even if the entire network drops 10%, you are still 2% better off by participating

[23-Mar-19 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
unless the market price crashes

[23-Mar-19 01:11 AM] zack#6467
because losing 10% is worse than losing 8%

[23-Mar-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you didnt participate, it wouldnt have crashed

[23-Mar-19 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In this imagined scenario, would it ever be known that it was me or complete anonymity?

[23-Mar-19 01:11 AM] zack#6467
it doesn't matter if you participate or not. other people will.

[23-Mar-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
though it seems like boiling the frog

{Reactions}
🤔 

[23-Mar-19 01:12 AM] zack#6467
they say if you heat water slowly enough, a frog wont try to escape. it wont notice itself being boiled.

[23-Mar-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so what is the solution to this?

[23-Mar-19 01:12 AM] zack#6467
I don't know. I gave up on PoS and used PoW for Amoveo.

[23-Mar-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810

[23-Mar-19 01:13 AM] zack#6467
I was following Casper from Vitalik and Vlad for a while

[23-Mar-19 01:13 AM] zack#6467
but it felt like they kept running into walls and retracing their steps

[23-Mar-19 01:14 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS does seem wobbly, could this attack also work on PoW?

[23-Mar-19 01:14 AM] zack#6467
http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/pow-cheapest/
PoS and PoW are alternative strategies for consensus. 
But only PoW can be used for distributing new tokens.

[23-Mar-19 01:14 AM] zack#6467
vitalik wrote about doing this attack against PoW. he claims it is possible, but I have doubts.

The P + epsilon Attack
Special thanks to Andrew Miller for coming up with this attack, and to Zack Hess, Vlad Zamfir and Paul Sztorc for discussion and responses One of the more interesting surprises in cryptoeconomics in recent weeks came from an attack on SchellingCoin conceived by Andrew Miller ...

"Particularly, let us point to one very specific example: proof of work. " starts with this

[23-Mar-19 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean just getting an attacker version of the daemon into majority of nodes

[23-Mar-19 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
all amounts of chaos and destruction would be possible

[23-Mar-19 01:17 AM] zack#6467
not in Amoveo.
A secure protocol should be executing a nash equilibrium strategy.
So if you change any aspect of the full node, then the operator of that full node loses money and doesn't harm consensus.

[23-Mar-19 01:18 AM] zack#6467
as long as the default strategy is a nash equilibrium, you are fine

[23-Mar-19 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but an evil node that has majority hashrate can change anything

[23-Mar-19 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
including the nash equilibrium

[23-Mar-19 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see how anything can survive a bribe to get installed base and then activate attack

[23-Mar-19 01:19 AM] zack#6467
i was talking to someone about this last week, im looking through our conversations

[23-Mar-19 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming the majority hashrate can be controlled

[23-Mar-19 01:19 AM] zack#6467
we came to some conclusion about how PoW can prevent this attack

[23-Mar-19 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem, is with majority control and activation of evil code, the consensus rules can be changed

[23-Mar-19 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
which means anything can happen

[23-Mar-19 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
anything

[23-Mar-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
seems the community just needs to be educated about this attack

[23-Mar-19 01:24 AM] zack#6467
Looks like our conclusion was that just having >50% hashrate isn't necessarily enough for the community to respect your blocks as being valid.
Since everyone can see that the attack is happening, they can just do a hard update and switch to a version from before the attack started.

I am not sure that would actually work.

[23-Mar-19 01:25 AM] zack#6467
and if it does work, I am not sure if it could work for PoS too.

[23-Mar-19 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why we are better off with more, rather than less, blockchains

[23-Mar-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be chains that are compromised in the future, we just need to hope it is limited in damage

{Reactions}
💯 

[23-Mar-19 01:27 AM] zack#6467
I wonder if attacking technology will overcome defensive technology, and then all the blockchains will die one after the other in a few month period.

[23-Mar-19 01:28 AM] zack#6467
I would be hearing "I told you so" for the rest of my life

[23-Mar-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i think onces the first attacks succeed, then the rest of the chains will go into lockdown mode

[23-Mar-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
no updates and after the damage to any big chain the nash equilibrium changes as people realize for the 2% gain, they lost 70% value

[23-Mar-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody paying 2% to run a custom version wont have any good intentions

[23-Mar-19 01:29 AM] zack#6467
that still isn't enough to change the nash equilibrium

[23-Mar-19 01:30 AM] zack#6467
it might change the nash equilibrium to be: sell all your crypto as fast as you can.
Which is a failure mode

[23-Mar-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
thats debatable, it would be close to finding out the nice 2% version is stealing privkeys

[23-Mar-19 01:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is post attack deployed so it is revealed that the 2% bonus version was a trojan horse

[23-Mar-19 01:31 AM] zack#6467
with POW, you only need to get a handful of mining pools to update to do this attack

[23-Mar-19 01:32 AM] zack#6467
if the mining pool forwards some of the 2% bonus to miners, I think they are incentivized to stay with that pool

[23-Mar-19 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
thanks for highlighting this one, i didnt realize its potential for damage

[23-Mar-19 01:34 AM] jl777c#5810
gotta go offline for a while now. nice talking, thanks for coming here!

{Reactions}
👍 

[23-Mar-19 01:34 AM] zack#6467
oh, here is a potential solution.
We could lock up the block reward for like 1 week until it becomes spendable.
Then if a mining pool commits this attack, we can burn 1 week of their block rewards as a punishment.

[23-Mar-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
unless the attacker version converts the punishment into a reward

[23-Mar-19 01:36 AM] zack#6467
what? I think this is actually a solution

[23-Mar-19 01:36 AM] zack#6467
oh wait...

[23-Mar-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if majority hashrate is running a version with timeactivated consensus changes

[23-Mar-19 01:36 AM] zack#6467
yeah, they can't change it to a reward until they have 50% hashpower

[23-Mar-19 01:37 AM] zack#6467
so we can punish them between when they start the attack, and when they achieve 50% hashpwoer

[23-Mar-19 01:37 AM] zack#6467
maybe that is why bitcoin block rewards take so long to activate

[23-Mar-19 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
as soon as they get 51%, they can undo any punishments

[23-Mar-19 01:38 AM] zack#6467
they will never get to 51% if the nash equilibrium is to not participate in the attack

[23-Mar-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
attacker pays 2% and promises a windfall after activation of attack

[23-Mar-19 01:38 AM] zack#6467
earning 2% extra is nice, but then when 20% of hashpower signs up, they all lose 100% for the week

[23-Mar-19 01:39 AM] zack#6467
the windfall will never activate if we refuse to mine on any blocks created by the attackers

[23-Mar-19 01:39 AM] zack#6467
all the attacker's hashpower will be wasted, so he will have to pay 102%, not 2%

[23-Mar-19 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you wont know which blocks were created by attackers, the attacking version will behave the same until attack activates
