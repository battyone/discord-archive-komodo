Thank you both.

I was able to figure out a way using `getpeerinfo`, so I'm good.

[13-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I think i will use it, on the other hand, @CHMEX , for some of these next methods...

[13-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you

Hi devs,  What mean letters ('F', 'E', 'B','L','W','T') in DiceValidate(...) function  switch case condition?  Maybe it's a separated validation for (create funding, add funding, dicebet, .....)?

[13-Sep-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
fund, entropy, bet, loss, win and timeout

[13-Sep-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
it's each type of possible transaction type

documented there

[13-Sep-18 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@Bryan_Beus I will let others answer questions like for minerids, others will know about this and it is better to have more people having explained it

[13-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, the two questions that I have left over are:

"
Also, here in getblocksubsidy, I see a section about a founder's reward.

This sounds like something leftover from the Zcash team?

getblocksubsidy
---------------

::

  getblocksubsidy height_number

The ``getblocksubsidy`` method returns the block-subsidy reward. The resulting calculation takes into account the mining slow start and the founders reward, of block at index provided.


How would we change this for KMD? Is there anything we'd need to indicate about how our rewards are calculated -- perhaps the 5% reward?

[13-Sep-18 06:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
""

And then also this question from before, about the block

[13-Sep-18 06:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
minerids.

I'm assuming the needs thing was put there by accident?

Also, in the response I receive, I see that inside the miners array there are 64 objects for notary nodes, and then one additional object that has 
{
        "pubkey": "external miners",
        "blocks": 541
}

Can you tell me about this object?

Also, in the notary node objects, I see that there's a blocks property as well. I believe these properties are related? Can you tell me about this as well?

{
      "notaryid": 59,
      "KMDaddress": "RWk4WLiAv6MKWLozJbj1jyhayKtjwbtX7M",
      "pubkey": "029d19215440d8cb9cc6c6b7a4744ae7fb9fb18d986e371b06aeb34b64845f9325",
      "blocks": 24
    }

[13-Sep-18 06:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
^ above, that is the response from the `minerids` command.

There a property about "blocks" that is both in each notary node JSON object (part of an array), and also in another object that follows directly after the array.

[13-Sep-18 06:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Not sure what that is referring to, conceptually.

[13-Sep-18 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
no founders reward, that text can be removed

[13-Sep-18 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
"needs" isnt needed

[13-Sep-18 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the minerids responses are about how many blocks mined in the last 2000

[13-Sep-18 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
external miners means external miners, not sure what is confusing about that

[13-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can we remove the entire `getblocksubsidy` function?

[13-Sep-18 07:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Now that I know that the `minerids` is about the last 2000 blocks, the rest makes sense, I think. Thank you.

[13-Sep-18 07:06 AM] Alright#0419
`getblocksubsidy` is useful for assetchains with decaying block rewards

[13-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Alright#0419
it works with no arguments right now, and the zcash PR I posted above will fix passing it arguments

[13-Sep-18 07:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's what I typed for the `minerids` description.

```
The ``minerids`` method returns information about the notary nodes and external miners at a specific block height. The response will calculate results according to the 2000 blocks proceeding the indicated "height" block.
```

[13-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright I'm not working on those documents directly. I'm working on them locally.

Any pull requests you're making won't be included in what I have, until I manually add them.

We should be working in coordination via github, but the way we created my setup originally, it sounded like it wasn't the best way to do it.

[13-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Maybe we stop and change how I'm doing it.

[13-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I just have it here on Github:

[13-Sep-18 07:10 AM] Alright#0419
I did not make a PR to fix `getblocksubsidy`. The only PRs I made were to fix help examples, and they were merged into dev branch

[13-Sep-18 07:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
github.com:siddhartha-komodo/KomodoPlatformDocs.git

[13-Sep-18 07:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
branch v0.0.1

[13-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Alright#0419
if just want those help example fixes, just `git pull` on dev branch and rebuild

[13-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, so you're talking about what's showing up in the terminal, correct?

[13-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm working on what we'll see in docs.komodoplatform.com

[13-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ideally, those should match with the terminal.

[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm...

There's a lot of territory to cover here, and to bring together...

[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I just don't want us to be operating on separate tracks, and wind up losing fixes.

[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm more than willing to help you, but I need to know what exactly the plan is here

[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I appreciate the feedback you're giving me. It is very helpful.

[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.

[13-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm simply realizing that we may be making fixes in separate repositories.

[13-Sep-18 07:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
From what you're saying, it sounds like you're working on a repository that is used for the terminal `help` commands.

The documentation there is theoretically the same as what we have on docs.komodoplatform.com, and that's what I started with.

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I'm not added to that repository, currently.

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Alright#0419
I changed the help docs in the actual daemon, nothing else

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right. That's what I understood just a minute ago.

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just FYI: any changes you make there, won't automatically be added to what I'm working on, and we may have conflicts, if you're doing extensive edits.

[13-Sep-18 07:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think, once I finish what I'm working on, I'll see if we can't find a way to match the two.

[13-Sep-18 07:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What I'm working on is in .rst format, so I don't think it will work for the terminal commands.

[13-Sep-18 07:15 AM] Alright#0419
they weren't extensive edits, just fixing typos in the examples

[13-Sep-18 07:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo was saying something about this earlier, but I didn't understand what he meant. I think I understand now.

[13-Sep-18 07:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay. It may be good for you to copy/paste whatever your suggestions are and give them to me, so that I can add them in my docs. Otherwise, unless I also catch them, there will be conflicts later.

[13-Sep-18 07:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you very much, you've been incredibly helpful and I really appreciate it.

[13-Sep-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
confused.... why not to use git?

[13-Sep-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
make your edits, then make a pull request

[13-Sep-18 07:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not sure.

[13-Sep-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
getblocksubsidy is a required rpc function, why to remove it?

[13-Sep-18 07:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need to talk with @Mylo

[13-Sep-18 07:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c Okay, won't remove it. I just didn't know.

[13-Sep-18 07:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll remove the text about the founder's subsidy, and change it so that it discusses what an asset chain developer may want to do.

[13-Sep-18 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt synced back into the dev branch, then it will most likely drift apart and we will have two sets of documentations, mostly the same, but different

[13-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, that's what I'm worried about, as well.

[13-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll need to talk with @Mylo, whenever he's around.

[13-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks.

[13-Sep-18 07:19 AM] Alright#0419
can you create a spreedsheet of commands you have gone through so far

[13-Sep-18 07:19 AM] Alright#0419
or even a git repo

[13-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I could, but it would slow me down maintaining it. 

For now, I'm just going sequentially through the list.

That's the one that I'm working from.

[13-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What file are you updating in the /dev/ branch on the actual daemon repository?

[13-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
they're in different places sometimes

[13-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
grep is very useful for finding where exactly the help docs are

[13-Sep-18 07:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 
I just did a git pull from the second repository that you posted, and am, working on it locally. 

@Mylo was saying back when I first started working on this that he wants to merge the terminal commands with the docs.komodoplatform.com documentation.

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Alright#0419
do you have commit access to that repo?

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, okay.

I think, for managing and getting all this together, we'll need to wait until @Mylo gets back. 

For now, all I'm doing is just working over each method, more from a technical writer's perspective, and a noob developer's perspective.

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no, not to that one.

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Alright#0419
Can you push any changes you have made from your branch

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo suggested I work in a separate repo, for now.

[13-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can't push to that repo, the one you posted. Not added to it, yet.

[13-Sep-18 07:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I suggest we not worry about it for the moment, and pick up when Mylo returns. I think he has a plan for how he's trying to bring a lot of this stuff together, and he's working towards it.

Don't forget about security. I don't want access to anything that presents a security risk and for which my computer is not yet properly set up.

My desktop machine is only moderately secure. I can improve the security, if need be, but I'd have to rearrange a bit, and possibly set up a separate ssd.
