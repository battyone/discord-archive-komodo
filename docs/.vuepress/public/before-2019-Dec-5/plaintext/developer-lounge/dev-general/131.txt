if you want, you can test my staking TUI, I'll have to walk you through how to use it as I haven't written the README yet

[07-Mar-19 06:23 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
hi all!
i'd like to check with you, my understanding so far is that we can't run an executable binary in the background from an iOS/iPhone app, is that right?

[07-Mar-19 06:24 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
kk, thanks Emmanuel!   )

[09-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Mylo#8306
Where in the codebase is opreturn max size defined?

not a show stopper.  i've tried for 15 mins looking in the various places and using grep.  i'm sure i've seen it and jl reckons it's in there somewhere.

[09-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe it's in script/script.h
```
// Maximum script length in bytes
static const int MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE = 10000;
```

hmmmm... unusual name.
the script/script.h is 10000 in bitcoin too, so my guess was wrong

[10-Mar-19 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again

[10-Mar-19 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
there is a problem with the running chain

[10-Mar-19 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and i cant help it

[10-Mar-19 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
`ERROR: CheckBlock: failed slow_checkPOW`

[10-Mar-19 07:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am getting this error continuously in my debug log

[10-Mar-19 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know why

[10-Mar-19 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have stopped and started again and set generate 0 as it was on POS

[10-Mar-19 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but i dont know why i am getting this error ?

[10-Mar-19 07:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
was running fine till yesterday again stopped today :/

[10-Mar-19 08:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi again

[10-Mar-19 08:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can someone please help me here i am getting the longest chain =0 ?

[10-Mar-19 08:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and the blocks are fine

[10-Mar-19 08:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
does it effect anything

[10-Mar-19 08:44 AM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani longest chain 0 typically indicates that there is a fork

[10-Mar-19 08:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
oh ðŸ˜®

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so its there anything to worry ?

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
are you getting this `ERROR: CheckBlock: failed slow_checkPOW` every single time or just occasionally?

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just ocassionally actually today

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the chain stopped

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so my boss told me to check it out

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have restarted the chain

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
as long as it's not every single time, it can be safely ignored

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the chain is not yet restarted

[10-Mar-19 08:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its rescanning the wallet

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Alright#0419
you really should set up https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am going to try again with set generate true 0

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Alright#0419
the entire purpose of that is "set and forget" staking

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
already did

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Alright#0419
you had this setup and it stalled?

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i had the issue couple of days back as well

[10-Mar-19 08:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but it started again safely

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but today

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it stopped no blocks were building up

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
stop restarting them when you face a problem, we could debug what the problem is if you keep the broken chains up

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yep

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
I'm still convinced they are stalling because of misconfigured staking nodes though

[10-Mar-19 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes it has just finished rescanning on both nodes

[10-Mar-19 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
now i am setting set generate true 0

[10-Mar-19 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and see if it gives the same error

[10-Mar-19 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
or not

[10-Mar-19 08:48 AM] Alright#0419
`ERROR: CheckBlock: failed slow_checkPOW` ignore these unless it's happening literally every time the daemon tries to create a block

[10-Mar-19 08:48 AM] Alright#0419
these will happen sometimes no matter what

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
if that's not happening every single time daemon tries to create a block, it likely has nothing to do with why the chain is stalling

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its still giving longest chain `0`

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
are you starting a new chain right now? I scripted the process if you want to try it

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but ill set generate true 0

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
should result in no stalls

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have started the chain

[10-Mar-19 08:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but i am doing set generate true 0

[10-Mar-19 08:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because

[10-Mar-19 08:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i need to check its a running chain

[10-Mar-19 08:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my boss is angry

[10-Mar-19 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
if you're willing to restart it once again, I'd recommend using the "Start a new chain" option in the pos64staker menu

[10-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
it's only in the "restart" branch as of right now

its giving this error in debug log

[10-Mar-19 08:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ðŸ˜¦

[10-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
you connect 2 nodes, before mining any blocks run the "start a new chain" option in the menu

[10-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
and it will start it properly for you

[10-Mar-19 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
it will start the staking node properly

[10-Mar-19 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
start new chain ?

[10-Mar-19 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like i have balance and everything inside these nodes

[10-Mar-19 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
will it affect that

[10-Mar-19 08:53 AM] Alright#0419
IGNORE IT

[10-Mar-19 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but not building up any blocks ðŸ˜¦

[10-Mar-19 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
that is the concern

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] Alright#0419
Idk how you got the chain into this state, but what I am telling you is that if you use the `start a new chain` option in the pos64 menu, you won't face these problems

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] Alright#0419
`peer=164 using obsolete version 170003` this means you have very old nodes on your network

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
`start a new chain` will it affect ?

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okay

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes so what to do to update it ?

[10-Mar-19 08:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
start new chain ?

[10-Mar-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
What I would recommend is

[10-Mar-19 08:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[10-Mar-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
get 2 VPSs that are dedicated staking nodes

[10-Mar-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
set them up properly with pos64staker

[10-Mar-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
then don't touch them at all

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we have two vps

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
they were running

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
awesomely

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i havent touched them

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its just today

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
when i came to know ðŸ˜¦

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
look, I'm not sure how to help you as I'm not sure what led up to this point

[10-Mar-19 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
I need a hell of a lot more info than "it doesn't make blocks"

[10-Mar-19 02:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
any dev here in need of a big help
