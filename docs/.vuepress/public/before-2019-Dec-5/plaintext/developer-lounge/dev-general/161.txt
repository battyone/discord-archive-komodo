[06-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
how?

[06-Apr-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
amt * 10^-8

[06-Apr-19 11:03 AM] Alright#0419
that's the same thing I posted originally

[06-Apr-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
satoshis is multiplying by 10^8, not 10^-8

[06-Apr-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
and depending on int32 and int64 on your platform and your language, bad things could happen

[06-Apr-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
my $satoshis = 100_000_000;
my $amount   = int(12.5*$satoshis);
```

[06-Apr-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
is what my hush_supply script does, but 12.5 keeps the value kind of small. If you used a large value, that code above might not be correct because of overflow of int32. fucking life is messy

[06-Apr-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
Python int() and Perl int() might not have same rounding, and also Perl does a lot of work to use bigints behind the scene, python doesn't

[06-Apr-19 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
does py not have a simple math pow function?

[06-Apr-19 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like the shit they teach in 5th grade?

[06-Apr-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a C builtin, most langs have it, pretty sure python does

[06-Apr-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
most langs just bind to `pow()` from C

[06-Apr-19 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```The ** operator in Python is used to raise the number on the left to the power of the exponent of the right. That is, in the expression 5 ** 3, 5 is being raised to the 3rd power. ```

[06-Apr-19 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
would seem to me that round(x,8) and then \*\* to move the decimal out?

[06-Apr-19 11:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
my Perl code above just works

[06-Apr-19 11:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is why I just fucking write Perl while others are figuring out how their languages work :troll_king:

[06-Apr-19 11:16 AM] Alright#0419
added valueSat to listunspent

[06-Apr-19 11:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
Abomination!

[06-Apr-19 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[06-Apr-19 11:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is the code diff?

[06-Apr-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419

[06-Apr-19 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since you're both here...
Is there a specific chain param that determines if coinbase maturity applies to an assetchain or not?

[06-Apr-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
ac_eras will be 100

[06-Apr-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
else 1

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
needs to change to it's own param IMO

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i don't like the name

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
and default 1 before any real ac_era chains are made

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
amountSat would be better, `amount` and `amountSat`

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
HUSH solo is doa because of maturity

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 tell me more

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am willing to just do ac_founders=1 to simplify life

[06-Apr-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
I like the idea of ac_founders=500, but it's causing so much issues

[06-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
what issue?

[06-Apr-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
making every pool work correctly with it

[06-Apr-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
ac_founders has nothing to do with coinbase maturity

[06-Apr-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
you are probably right, was just mentioning it

[06-Apr-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright if you change to `amountSat`, I am 👍 to simplify peoples lives

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the CPU overhead of trying to backlog cb maturity and then send out z txes can grow insane

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
`amount` and `amountSat`

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
no idea why it's amount here to begin with

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
everywhere else it's `value`

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
internals lingo is different than RPC output lingo

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
but sure, I'll PR with amountSat

[06-Apr-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
what do most RPCs output the key as?

[06-Apr-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems more intuitive to have both keys be named similar, they are the same value, in 2 different formats

[06-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
I've always seen `value` and `valueSat`/`valueZat`

[06-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
can't think of any place I've seen `amount`

[06-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
except here

[06-Apr-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
listunspent is pretty old

[06-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
I have a bit of disdain for ZEC for using valueZat

[06-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
just randomly valueZat in some places

[06-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
when it has nothing to do with zkSNARKs

[06-Apr-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
they call them "zatoshis"

[06-Apr-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is why

[06-Apr-19 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I can't see any way to do a solo pool that pays in z and has 100 block maturity that isn't going to irk ops, users, or both

[06-Apr-19 11:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 never even thought about solo + zaddr payouts

[06-Apr-19 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, you wanted the z for regular pools?

[06-Apr-19 11:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what I originally meant, Hush will give bounties to the first pools to enable zaddr payouts

[06-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
there is no good reason to use coinbase maturity 100

[06-Apr-19 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
i would pay a special bounty for solo zaddr payout, sounds cool and nontrivial

[06-Apr-19 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
coinbase maturity 100 is hardcoded in KMD, but HUSH is a source code fork of KMD *and* an asset chain, so I could change that for HUSH, it's on the table

[06-Apr-19 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
but that table needs to be prepared to eat, very soon

[06-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
I'll include it in the PR? 😂

[06-Apr-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
also 1 line

[06-Apr-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's the implications, lol

[06-Apr-19 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it's hard coded, but there's a way around it; PIRATE doesn't have that issue 😛

[06-Apr-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
changing supply of BTC is a one line change, too

[06-Apr-19 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but that table needs to be prepared to eat, very soon`
well, I've been throwing forks and knives at the pools for 2 weeks now 😛

[06-Apr-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even without z, maturity of 100 sux for solo pools

@dukeleto are you going to be hardcoding HUSH unique things?

[06-Apr-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
simplest way to keep rebases clean is to add anything specific as 
`if ( strcmp(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL,"HUSH") == 0 )`

[06-Apr-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
or something like this

[06-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
or better yet, make ac_params, so we can all use any of it 🙏

[06-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
I will accept a pull request for -ac_cbmaturity

[06-Apr-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto 👆🏽 You'd be my favorite HUSH dev :troll:

[06-Apr-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright HUSH is a source code fork AND asset chain just like the venerable VRSC, which allows us to retain control of our code in case we ever want  to make different decisions than KMD

[06-Apr-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, control over branch structure

[06-Apr-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
By default, I send everything upstream to KMD

[06-Apr-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
Yea I understand

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I try to make it all as agnostic as possible

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
but like SAFE for example would hard code things

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
not understanding that they just broke 10 other things

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i made -clientname so that Hush didn't have to hardcode a different one

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
VRSC did it cleanly by using VRSC specific exceptions for the most part

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
and now every coin can choose their own and each node can too, without modifying source code

[06-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are no HUSH specific code in the full node, yet

[06-Apr-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
HushList + Sapling will probably have some RPC support for advanced features

[06-Apr-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks that unsafe is a bad example because duke is better even when he's asleep than that whole crew  is ever_

[06-Apr-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
Hush will eventually deviate from KMD, but slowly

[06-Apr-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
and KMD might want all/most Hush changes ever makes. But the structure allows Hush to *keep* full control of our destiny

[06-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's all about finding the middle path

[06-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC as our upstream is one side of the spectrum

[06-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
our own HUSH codebase the other

[06-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
source fork + asset chain is in the middle and has the best of both worlds

[06-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
jl777 is my upstream

[06-Apr-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
or at least will be very soon

[06-Apr-19 12:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
and since I submit so many patches to jl777, I am pulling in lots of my own work I send to KMD for the new HUSH
