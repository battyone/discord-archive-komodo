@phm87 that is expected behavior (port being used already). The assertion is technically a bug but it is an edge case that happens sometimes in weird error modes. Make a github issue if you would like, or even better, send in a PR to fix it 😃

[30-Jul-19 08:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@Oszy afaik a wif can't be converted to a seed phrase
usually, a seed phrase provides randomness and it is hashed(along with some other steps) to get a privkey/wif
so, a wif can't produce a corresponding seed phrase

[30-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
so it's not possible to use a vanity address with mm2

[30-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
unless i have the seed

[30-Jul-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to use a wif directly as the seed?

[30-Jul-19 08:47 AM] Oszy#5734
yeah? i'll try that

[30-Jul-19 10:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
A seed phrase contains many addresses + WIFs, which is why you can't go in that direction. A WIF is a tiny amount of data, a seed phrase contains many many addresses and WIFs

[30-Jul-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not so sure about that. while it is possible to permute a seed phrase to achieve that, all implementations i know have a hashing function involved

[30-Jul-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
and you cant reverse hashing functions, which is why you cant go from wif (privkey) back to the seed

[30-Jul-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c your smart addresses only give 1 addr per coin per seed phrase, but really, there are many derivable change addresses

[30-Jul-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
but that is not really accessible to non-developers, I guess. Best answer is from James: `you cant reverse hashing functions`

[30-Jul-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but the passphrase is only for the master address in that case

[30-Jul-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
interesting

[30-Jul-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that you derive more from a single privkey doesnt change the fact that there is only one privkey derived from the seed

[30-Jul-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
somewhat like using a privkey, and taking the sha256() repeatedly to get other data?

[30-Jul-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
I know it's more complicated than that, but it seems to be similar. There is a chain of hashed data

[30-Jul-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
But only one unique input

[30-Jul-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the derivation paths are not a hash chain, but it all starts with a single privkey

[30-Jul-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so any multiple privkeys (addresses) are not inherent in the seed, but rather that you are deriving more keys from the master key

each day I understand a bit more

let him know we see sometimes 50000x and higher

[30-Jul-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
how can LWMA DAA mine the next block at the 50000x higher diff?

[30-Jul-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang a new -ac_adaptivepow option will be migrating to the various branches. starting a certain date in the future, all new chains that are 100% PoW would default to having in enabled. before that default changing time an -ac_adaptivepow=1 needs to be added. if a chain never wants it they can use -ac_adaptivepow=-1

[30-Jul-19 03:13 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

[30-Jul-19 03:16 PM] webworker01#3884
Great job @jl777c I hope that adaptivepow will be used for all on-demand chains eventually

[30-Jul-19 03:17 PM] webworker01#3884
There is one that's stranded atm

[30-Jul-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a hardfork, but at the next hardfork we can enable it for all 100% PoW chains

[30-Jul-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto what does zawy say about 50000x stranding and how to mine even just the next block?

[30-Jul-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
LWMA seems to need some blocks before the diff adjusts

[30-Jul-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
with such extreme diff stranding, the problem is that just one block is not practical to mine without some extraordinary measures

@dukeleto @Jl777News If difficulty dropping 15% per block is not sufficient, then my solution is the TSA which is a proper "linear" dropping of the difficulty during the block. TSA: https://t.co/Ip5b3D3EiS

i'm trying to create a rawtransaction that sends some coins from one address (using one utxo chosen from listunspent) to another address and that split the coins. I adapted @webworker01  's code but createrawtransaction returns ``TX decode failed``

Using sendmany and setting the first parameter to ``""`` it worked (I sent 4 small tx of 0.0001 to my mainet NN addy yesterday ^^ but the change also arrived on it). Using this success, I can try to put only a small amount on the ``""`` account (0.0011 KMD) then use sendmany to split it. I think that I can have more freedom with rawtx

@dukeleto Yes, that TSA article is too long.  I'm trying to make it easier to immediately apply a simple version of it.  But even if I had done that to begin with KMD's situation of > 50,000x hashrate leaving still would not have been addressed by it since I only ever considered a linear reduction in difficulty.

the mult is denominated in seconds

[31-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it only activates after about 13 minutes of no blocks, by this time everyone wants a new block ASAP

[31-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so it just goes up crazy fast to make sure a block is found in the 14th, 15th, 16th minute

if a million times diff stranding, then maybe it needs to wait for 20 minutes, but no amount of stranding survives against elapsed seconds * elapsed seconds

for chains with many miners, having it not stepped is better

[31-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but the use cases that usually get stranded probably have less than 10 miners

[31-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
these are really small chains

There's no risk of a big miner jumping back on once it drops?  The risk of catastrophic oscillations in normal POW coins with that kind of  drop is .... 100%.  Digishield with the MTP delay makes it worse.

really it only kicks in after 13 minutes without a block, so it should only be in really rare cases or diff stranding

[31-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we did a test of a 20000x stranding achieved with a Z11
