let me test it again.. just a sec

[10-Nov-18 06:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, need to work on this condition

[10-Nov-18 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```rpcuser====user1773837506
rpcpassword=980--=-999passbae43ecd576e0d3```
results in:

```RPC User: user1773837506
RPC Password: 980--=-999passbae43ecd576e0d3c02a95dcb567c1510852f1450d32af9ebd108ddf9390bf03b68
RPC Port: 27486
```

[10-Nov-18 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so seems only first condition need to fix

[10-Nov-18 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
second is fine

[10-Nov-18 06:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```RPC User: user1773837506
RPC Password: 980--=-999pa###ssbae43ecd576e0d3c02a95dcb567c1510852f1450d32af9ebd108ddf9390bf03b68
```

[10-Nov-18 06:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with `#`

[10-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
Is there a decoderawblock rpc or something similar?(with similar output to getblock)

[10-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
I have raw hex of a block that daemon is rejecting, need to understand why

[10-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
if I could at least extract the coinbase tx from it, that would be useful

[10-Nov-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not that I know of, would be a useful rpc call to add. maybe @blackjok3r

[10-Nov-18 07:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am litterally looking for the exact same thing right now 😂

[10-Nov-18 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
well in the meantime, I'll make the daemon accept it then do getblock

[10-Nov-18 07:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not so easy... there is a blockToJSON fucntion, but it deosnt take the hex as input

[10-Nov-18 07:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how do you force the daemon to accept it and do getblock?

[10-Nov-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
decode_hex or ParseHex will convert hex string to binary

[10-Nov-18 07:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still doesn't  really help ... it take shte actual block index as an input

[10-Nov-18 07:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think hoek does it though

[10-Nov-18 07:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fro migrate early testing @Alright

[10-Nov-18 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
joker, just take out the checks it fails until it accepts it

[10-Nov-18 08:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked out whats wrong with what Im trying anyway ... the coinbase getblocktemplate spits out is incompete 😦

[11-Nov-18 06:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi just want to ask about the iquidus again

[11-Nov-18 06:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
😃

[11-Nov-18 06:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if someone can help me out

[11-Nov-18 06:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks

[11-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Invalid or non-wallet transaction id  what does that men a?

[11-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
mean ?

[11-Nov-18 06:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because when i search for getblock 1 it shows the transaction hash but when i try to get transaction

[11-Nov-18 06:26 AM] Alright#0419
do `getrawtransaction <txid> 1` instead of gettransaction

[11-Nov-18 07:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[11-Nov-18 07:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks

[11-Nov-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
actually the blocks are being duplicated in the explorer

[11-Nov-18 07:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i guess its the transactions

[11-Nov-18 08:36 AM] at#4177
can somebody clarify for me what someone would be talking about if they say equihash chain can run out of transactions?

[11-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe they mean the block can get full?

[11-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it makes not much sense

[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Mylo#8306
are there any ways to get the hex from the result of `dicefund` without capturing the result?   `gettransaction txid` doesn't have the hex from the result.

[11-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
you just need the raw tx hex?

[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Mylo#8306
as in, the result is in my debug session, but i want to use an RPC command to fetch it programmatically

[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Mylo#8306
yep

[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
`getrawtransaction <txid>`?

[11-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand what you mean

[11-Nov-18 10:34 AM] Mylo#8306

[11-Nov-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to sendrawtransaction

[11-Nov-18 10:34 AM] Mylo#8306
that is the result from `dicefund` but `gettransaction` and `getrawtransaction` respond with hex
```
01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff03550101ffffffff011027000000000000232103511aab41ccdef8586a79460765c1f260b6082a52772dfb80054ba17c74652f81ac2603e85b
```

[11-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
getrawtransaction <txid> 1

[11-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
will decode it

[11-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
or you can just use decoderawtransaction <hex>

[11-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Mylo#8306
trying, thanks

[11-Nov-18 10:49 AM] Mylo#8306
if i don't capture the result of `dicefund` are there other ways to get the hex?   does the dapp developer need to capture that result?

[11-Nov-18 10:50 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Is there any way to setup ZMQ with Komodo? I can't find any help

[11-Nov-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
presumably the dapp dev is issuing rpc calls and processing the returned json

[11-Nov-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
extract the hex from it and sendrawtransaction

[11-Nov-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
in #cc-general many people have made scripts to automatically extract the hex and broadcast it

[11-Nov-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i think they use jq

[11-Nov-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
dicefund is not actually sending the transaction

[11-Nov-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
none of the contract rpc commands do

[11-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Mylo#8306
yep i'm using a script.  i'm halfway through porting to web app between `dicefund` and capturing the hex to broadcast.    i just haven't captured the hex and was wondering if it is mandatory to capture at this point, or there are alternatives to getting the result hex?
yep understood on all counts.  just want to know if alternative to capture and broadcast available.

[11-Nov-18 10:54 AM] Mylo#8306
for docs, those assumptions to convey to dapp devs

[11-Nov-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are many cases where the GUI would want to confirm tx details before sending

[11-Nov-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
with sendtoaddress, it just makes the rawtx and sends it and if there are any issues, no way to know what rawtx it created

[11-Nov-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so this create and send split allows a create, verify, send process

[11-Nov-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be trivial for some dapp level wrapper to issue the rpc, extract the hex and autosend it

[11-Nov-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but impossible to extract the rawhex if it automatically sends

[11-Nov-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
alternative would be to add a "broadcast":1 flag that would make the initial call broadcast it and I am not against that

[11-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Mylo#8306
yes understood.
1.  issue rpc
2.  extract hex (from result)
3.  broadcast

at step (2) if hex is not extracted though, there are no other ways to "recapture" it to verify it.  it has to be done there?

[11-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Mylo#8306
and thanks for going into details and reasons.

[11-Nov-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont capture it after it is generated, then you didnt capture it

[11-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no DB of all rpc results every issued and not used, as there is no way to know if it was used or not... well, I guess sendrawtransaction could be monitored and track which ones were used and then store all the unused ones so you can retrieve it, but I wont do that as it is 10x more complexity than just issuing the rpc call again

[11-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
issuing the rpc call to create the tx can just be done again

[11-Nov-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont broadcast it, basically nothing happens. the only exceptions are the rare rpc calls that have side effects, like dicestatus

[11-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Mylo#8306
beauty.  thanks.  makes heaps of sense and future developers will appreciate this stuff - it's gold for understanding 😄

[11-Nov-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the createrawtransaction model where it creates, but the rpc calls take care of automatically finding all the required vins, making all the required outputs, and signrawtransaction. If you ever dealt with raw transactions, it is really really quite a painful process to get everything right

[11-Nov-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
having a single rpc call that creates a valid and fully signed transaction ready to broadcast, it is quite easy to use compared to bitcoin rawtransactions

[11-Nov-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so for GUI that want to have a confirm step, they can decoderawtransaction and summarize the important parts for user confirmation or just display

[11-Nov-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
for GUI that wants to automate this, they would use a simple rpc wrapper that issues the rpc, extracts the hex, sendrawtransaction

[11-Nov-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, another advantage of this split method, is that it allows doing offline signing

[11-Nov-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
which for dice doesnt make much sense, but for other CC could be quite a nice feature

[11-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Mylo#8306
ok that's handy.  very handy.

and yes, read the create transaction stuff in mastering bitcoin book.  encapsulating it into higher level functions is one usability godsend.

the script i've got, had i implemented everything in one go and automating-in-gui wouldn't have this hex question.   helps heaps for explaining in docs.  much appreeeesh!

used the example unicode string in pass to test

[11-Nov-18 04:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, cool, so just tried unicode smiley too... seems to work fine 😁

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi i just came with an unfortunate issue this morning

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as my blocks are stopped at 4944

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
they are not generating

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
why it has stopped ?

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its 100% pos

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
do we need POS splitter

[12-Nov-18 05:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
currently the reward is generated to only one address

[12-Nov-18 05:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on the console this is what I'm getting "isPoS but meets PoW diff"

[12-Nov-18 05:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Also I changed my pubkey to a new generated address for staking but still no luck and stuck at 4944

[12-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to have more than one node staking.... with 100% pos/.... you cant even force mine blokck wit huge hash to unstick it

[12-Nov-18 06:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we already got two @blackjok3r

[12-Nov-18 06:19 AM] D.rabbani#9094
both node set generate true is 0

[12-Nov-18 06:19 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i even switched to 1 but no luck

[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not 100% sure hat you have done but `getbalance64` will show if any utxos are elegible to stake... if they r alll immature you need to start again making sure you have enough utxo plit into 64 segids

[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we havent put the POS 64 splitter
