> just give it a number?
I could, but all the other RPC accept numbers in the form of strings
we should have a consistent behavior for all the RPC

the musig curl command as you have given should work, but doesn't
@Alright

[21-Oct-19 01:56 PM] gcharang#6833
I think it is because there are two strings that could be method names
1. cclib
2. combine

we are sending combine as a parameter. not sure that is correct

[21-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
it is

[21-Oct-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
you have a musig chain running at the moment? Could you give me chain params for it?

trying to update the asn in cryptoconditions to the latest branch on vlm

[23-Oct-19 10:17 AM] Chris - Monkins#5278
not sure how to modify the `inherit type descriptor` to the new `asn_TPRE-DEscripter_t` structure

[23-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Chris - Monkins#5278
before it was ```c
static void
cost_3_inherit_TYPE_descriptor(asn_TYPE_descriptor_t *td) {
    td->free_struct    = asn_DEF_NativeInteger.free_struct;```

[23-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Chris - Monkins#5278
this however segfaults:

[23-Oct-19 10:20 AM] Chris - Monkins#5278
```c
static void
cost_3_inherit_TYPE_descriptor(asn_TYPE_descriptor_t *td) {
    td->op->free_struct    = asn_DEF_NativeInteger.op->free_struct;```

[23-Oct-19 10:20 AM] Chris - Monkins#5278
should it be ```c
 ... = &asn_DEF_NativeInteger.op->free_struct;``` ??

[23-Oct-19 12:25 PM] Chris - Monkins#5278
Follow up...  doing  `td->op = asn_DEF_NativeInteger.op;` has fixed it

Thanks!

[27-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, this is more of a noob question:

I'm trying to send a curl request to an asset chain. The curl request works perfectly fine in the terminal, but does not when executed from the source code.

[27-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's the request from the terminal:
```
curl --user $rpcuser:$rpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$rpcport/
```

[27-Oct-19 05:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's the source code:

In `int main()`:

```
    string launchCmd = "curl --user rpcuser:rpcpassword --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:rpcport/"; 
    vector<string> syncRes = consoleCmd(launchCmd, false);
    cout << syncRes[0] << endl;
```

In `vector<string> consoleCmd(const string & input,  bool bifurcate)`:
```
vector<string> consoleCmd(const string &input, bool bifurcate) {

    // Reference to this tutorial
    // https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/c-programming/how-to-capture-the-output-of-a-linux-command-in-c/

    string cmd = input;
    string data; 
    FILE * stream;
    const int max_buffer = 256;
    char buffer[max_buffer];
    cmd.append(" 2>&1");

    stream = popen(cmd.c_str(), "r");

    if (stream) {
        while (!feof(stream)) {
            if (fgets(buffer, max_buffer, stream) != NULL)
                data.append(buffer); 
        }
        pclose(stream);
    }

    istringstream instream(data); 
    vector<string> res; 
    if (bifurcate) { 
        while (!instream.eof()) { 
            string temp;
            instream >> temp;
            res.push_back(temp); 
        }
    } else {
        res.push_back(data);
    }

    return res; 
}
```

[27-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The response I get from the curl in the source code is:
```
curl: (3) URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL
```

[27-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The `consoleCmd` function works elsewhere in the source code, so it should work here as well.

[27-Oct-19 05:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
maybe its that `2>&1`, though...

[27-Oct-19 05:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
Ok I sent you what I mined its not a lot but should get you going.

[27-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, I think I may have found the issue...

[27-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, I don't need much. Just enough to test. Thanks!

[27-Oct-19 05:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
The curl has some quoting error I guess

[27-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, I was using some #define variables wrong in the header.

[27-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@Bryan_Beus KV is basically entirely deprecated by oracles CC

[27-Oct-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
not much reason to use it, is terribly inefficient compared to oracles

[27-Oct-19 11:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
just one command

[28-Oct-19 06:46 PM] mediast#1110
When launching a new smartchain, we used the parameters documented here:

https://komodoplatform.com/18-ways-to-customize-blockchain/

We included ac_Reward(s) parameter as documented in the above article, but it appears that the correct parameter should've been ac_reward...

The -ac_CCenable parameter does not appear to work, as ALL Antara modules have been activated (not just the ones we desired).  OR are these parameters case-sensitive?

[28-Oct-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
case sensitive

[28-Oct-19 06:57 PM] mediast#1110
The -ac_CCenable parameter may've also failed because we did this: -ac_CCenable=0xe3,0xeb,0xe4,0xf1,0xea,0xec,0xf0,0xf2 instead of ac_ccenable=227,228, etc..

[28-Oct-19 06:58 PM] mediast#1110
But also because the parameters are case sensitive..

[28-Oct-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
case sensitive, use decimal

[28-Oct-19 07:03 PM] mediast#1110
Thank you.  I was mislead by this "The eval codes can be found here" on the aforementioned article, but I found the ac_ccenable=227,228 example under docs

[28-Oct-19 07:06 PM] mediast#1110
Perhaps the article can be corrected (case sensitivity, ac_reward(s))

[28-Oct-19 07:07 PM] mediast#1110
So.. the big question is... Can I delete and re-create the smartchain using the same ticker?  I'm assuming the answer is "no".
