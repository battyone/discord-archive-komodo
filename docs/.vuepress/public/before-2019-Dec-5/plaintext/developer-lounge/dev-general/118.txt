[06-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Alright#0419
yes, but I think you would want to add a 3rd era with ac_reward as 0

[06-Feb-19 06:04 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i need to add 3 eras?

[06-Feb-19 06:05 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no i was talking about -ac_end

[06-Feb-19 06:05 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like for first 10 blocks

[06-Feb-19 06:05 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then for the rest 2000 blocks until my target is achieved

[06-Feb-19 06:06 AM] Alright#0419
ac_end acts differently when you use ac_eras

[06-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
`komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -ac_supply=10000 -ac_reward=10000000000,100000000,0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_end=10,100,0`
This chain has 10000 coin premine, 100 coin block reward for the first 10 blocks(maybe 9, would have to confirm with `getblocksubsidy` rpc command), then 1 coin block reward from blocks 10-100

[06-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Alright#0419
and no block reward after 100

[06-Feb-19 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
Also, if you're doing this to get around the ac_supply limit, you still have to keep overflows in mind. They are likely to happen if a UTXO has extremely large values, so be diligent to never combine more than about 10B coins into a single UTXO

[06-Feb-19 06:12 AM] Alright#0419
having chains with massive supplies is still untested territory, we recommend against using such large numbers for a reason

[06-Feb-19 06:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai sir not more than 10B coins in sing utxo thank you @Alright

[06-Feb-19 06:16 AM] Alright#0419
When you face problems, please don't say "Alright said it would work". I am definitively saying you should not do this unless you are very diligent in how you do it.

[06-Feb-19 06:19 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yup true indeed

[06-Feb-19 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you will hit MAX supply cap anyway...

[06-Feb-19 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ulikly to work any way you do it.. Why do you need such a large supply?

[06-Feb-19 06:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  task given by the boss i dont know whetehr they are making something like this or not just for testing

[06-Feb-19 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok no worries... If it imperative to amke that much supply you may need to modify the daemons code. I can point you in the right direction, but not sure of the concsequnces of doing that.

[06-Feb-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this is very dangerous territory. all throughout the code 64bit (63bit) limit is assumed to be enough

[06-Feb-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
once you can overflow nValue, then everything will break

[06-Feb-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
just say no to megabillions supply, it will not work

[06-Feb-19 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was able to make a chain with 77 Billion coins... but I didnt ause it for anything

[06-Feb-19 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was the maximum it went to... I was no able to get it to go any higher...

[06-Feb-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
just because you can make it doesnt mean it works

[06-Feb-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
do some tx, generate change that overflows/underflows. it will be a big total mess. dont do it, guaranteed to not add up as expected

[06-Feb-19 07:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yup true that its not working with giving two parameters in the mining reward but its strange that it does work with 1 parameter only

[06-Feb-19 07:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
anyways we shuld not try

[06-Feb-19 07:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it

[06-Feb-19 07:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it gives the max error

[06-Feb-19 11:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
` ./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -ac_supply=10000 -ac_reward=10000000000,100000000,0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_end=10,100,0 -gen -genproclimit=4 ` 
this is the command i ran but i didnt get any balance  on the node

[06-Feb-19 11:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
even with the low balance ?

[06-Feb-19 11:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can someone help

[06-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
start both nodes with `-gen -genproclimit`

[06-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
make sure they are connected by checking `getpeerinfo`

[06-Feb-19 11:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[06-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
then do `setgenerate true $(nproc)` on one of them

[06-Feb-19 11:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes thyey are connected

[06-Feb-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
do `tail -f ~/.komodo/EXAMPLE/debug.log` for more info

[06-Feb-19 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[06-Feb-19 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks

[06-Feb-19 11:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
still unable to get any balance

[06-Feb-19 11:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
6 blocks are mine :/

[06-Feb-19 11:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and they are connected as well

[06-Feb-19 11:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
`"balance": 0.00000000,
  "blocks": 25,
  "longestchain": 0,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "tiptime": 1549452738,
  "connections": 1,
  "proxy": "",`

[06-Feb-19 11:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
debug log shows nothing wrong :/

[06-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
Ahhhh, something I forgot about

[06-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
ac_eras makes the coinbase maturity 100 blocks

[06-Feb-19 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
oh üòÑ

[06-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
you won't be able to spend coins until they are 100 blocks old

[06-Feb-19 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
oh so i can get the balance after 100 blocks üòÑ

[06-Feb-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[06-Feb-19 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[06-Feb-19 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill check

[06-Feb-19 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thank you

[06-Feb-19 11:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so its basically the era will start from 101th block

[06-Feb-19 11:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[06-Feb-19 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
use `komodo-cli -ac_name=EXAMPLE getblocksubsidy <height>` to verify it works as expected

[06-Feb-19 11:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hey, I'm working on gateways CC support for other coins. I need some relatively small chain (<=1GB) that is on bitcoin protocol and has bootstrap data so I do not need to wait for sync.
Any suggestions?

[06-Feb-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
An assetchain won't work?

[06-Feb-19 11:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well, AC is in komodo ecosystem and uses komodo-cli, I need something else...

[06-Feb-19 11:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the block subsidy is returning the mining reward on every hiehgt

[06-Feb-19 12:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
And I would need some small amount of coins on that chain...

[06-Feb-19 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
pm'd you

[06-Feb-19 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it's the best option, but it's *a* option

[06-Feb-19 12:48 PM] TUBEFATHER#8574
does anybody know if there was ever a dPoW implementation for chain security for CN based protocols? We are interested to do this.

thanks

[06-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
RNDsendmany64.py

[06-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is the one you want.

[06-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
use importlist.py to import the list

[06-Feb-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the readme is quite good.

[06-Feb-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont use the staking script on jl777 komodo its missing some RPC calls that enable ti to work properly

[06-Feb-19 02:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai ill use this one seems better

[06-Feb-19 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjoker

[06-Feb-19 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i need to know the values of the commands in RNDsendmany64.py

[06-Feb-19 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like i have 90 billion balance

[06-Feb-19 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and i want to split

[06-Feb-19 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it

[06-Feb-19 02:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its says about percentage variance

[06-Feb-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just use 10 always

[06-Feb-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@D.rabbani

[06-Feb-19 03:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai but what about percentage variance 10 ?

[06-Feb-19 04:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have a query again that

[06-Feb-19 04:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i use -ac_staked =100 parameter with it the blocsks stopped at 100

[06-Feb-19 04:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r

[06-Feb-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure

[06-Feb-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could be many things

[06-Feb-19 04:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i checked it without the paramerter it was going smooth

[06-Feb-19 04:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
liek the blocks were fine

[06-Feb-19 04:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but i want it as 100% POS

[06-Feb-19 04:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is it because of 10billion value ?

[06-Feb-19 04:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like the balance

[06-Feb-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea sorry
