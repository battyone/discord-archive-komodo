or just plain vouts/vins?

[29-Aug-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, good to know

[29-Aug-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Large op-return data makes the xtn take longer to move around the p2p network

[29-Aug-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you are pushing a lot of data, take that into account

[29-Aug-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a concept of "locked funds" as well

[29-Aug-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure if that is coming into play

[29-Aug-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
`listlockunspent`

[29-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to call that RPC and make sure stuff isn't locked, maybe?

[29-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is mostly for shielded stuff

[29-Aug-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I think taddr utxos can be locked, too

it was a little thing I saw, from working on all this zstats stuff

[30-Aug-19 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I figured I should see what it's like to contribute to BTC, and for small trivial things, it was quite painless, at least in this case. Just adding on new key to a relatively new RPC, it was low-risk and not contentious

Hi,
If I wanted to 'digitalize' a physical asset, my house for example, for trading what kind of advantages/disavantages would there be to using 'tokens' rather than a '-ac_name=MYHOUSE' chain?

[31-Aug-19 01:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Would both methods allow trading through `mm2` and `channels`?

[31-Aug-19 06:56 AM] CMaurice#1685
depends what you want to do with it, I guess: if you want to sell the legal title outright, then it could be represented by a single non-fungible token. If you wanted to sell shares in it, perhaps as rights to future rental income or something, then many tokens or a whole chain might be abetter idea

[31-Aug-19 07:17 AM] gcharang#6833
the main obstacle to digitize physical assets is the need for an "Enforcer"
if that problem is solved, i.e., a trusted enforcer agrees to enforce a trade of digital representations of physical assets on a specific blockchain in the real world
then, 
using '-ac_name=MYHOUSE' will look like:
you could start the chain with say 10,000 supply and each coin represents 1/10000 th share of the house
these coins  can traded with cryptos or other similarly digitised assets using mm2 without much effort
 
using tokens:
the house is represented by a NFT
it can be traded for other tokens. these tokens can be similar NFTs that represent assets or other cryptos brought on chain through gateways

[31-Aug-19 07:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
trading on mm2 would be single chain

[31-Aug-19 07:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a realestate portfolio where renters have to mine as a condition of lease would ensure full nodes active (maybe redeemable for discounts on rent like a free week per year, along with founder rewards to keep supply balanced)

[31-Aug-19 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
I was thinking along the lines of selling 'shares' in the house.
The 'shares' would be tradeable with other digital assets and crypto.

[31-Aug-19 11:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CrisF interesting idea, but you need to have laws to protect you and laws require people with sticks to enforce them. I have dealt with people squatting illegally on my property and it's not something you want to deal with, and then add in a blockchain. It would be interesting to only sell shares to very well "vetted" people that have some type of collateral they don't want to lose (like their reputation) for screwing you over in this experiment

[31-Aug-19 11:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. try it out with KMD core people that are "trusted", that could be interesting

[31-Aug-19 11:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @dukeleto üëã
This would be the `"Enforcer"` that @gcharang mentioned right?

[31-Aug-19 11:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
not really

[31-Aug-19 11:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
you need an enforcer with the law on their side

[31-Aug-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
otherwise, you will have people living rent free for 6+ months, before you have the legal right to remove them

[31-Aug-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
so if your "agreement" is "not understandable" to the local police, that is not good

[31-Aug-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
you *will* need a "house enforcer" but it's more like somebody that takes on extra duty to help people get along, they don't have a huge amount of power to "enforce" somebody leave if they stop paying rent

[31-Aug-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
many AirBnB's have a person like that

[31-Aug-19 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
In this case I wouldn't have to do this myself.  
What I'm trying to do is make a simple demo showing off Komodo technology through a basic example.
This topic has come up in almost every serious conversation I've been having with people over here (Japan, but European and Middle Eastern projects) recently.
A simple run through showing off our platform and tech would be very powerful in moving these conversations to the next level.
I've heard that there are some projects working on this in Japan and will be finding out more about this next week.

[31-Aug-19 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
There is some very big interest in 'tokenizing' assets, and I've had specific questions relating to real-estate and precious metals.

[31-Aug-19 12:11 PM] CrisF#3405
I've been looking through Tokens, Assets, Gateway, Prices, Channels etc an there seems to be so many tools available.

[31-Aug-19 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't have the knowledge or understanding to put things together, so slow going.

Any body here

[01-Sep-19 01:09 AM] miraculu#8334
Good day guys, Please I need help. 
I've been thinking of how to make a pool on a smart Chain. 
The aim is to allow users vote for each other, And once the vote is complete I'll make an airdrop based on the vote. (I need to be able to query what users were voted for and how much votes they each got) 
NB: I don't want to learn any advanced KMD development, I want to achieve this as a normal Dev, who is building on a smart chain via RPC calls.

Any contribution is highly appreciated.

[01-Sep-19 02:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Komodo run a voting chain where all KMD holders are airdropped 1:1 with the VOTE coin. Then airdrop your actual coin manually based on the winners or however the voting works. You could use a similar method to this?

[01-Sep-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
@miraculu #kmdlabs uses an oracles dapp for our notary node votes. Can easily be adapted for other purposes. It's a set of known pubkeys, and 1 pubkey has 1 vote

No cost apart from your servers, and can have nothing to do with Komodo (apart from running on Komodo software).

It only took me 30 minutes to set up my own chain the first time I tried.  (I was familiar with using komodo ‚òù at the time)

[02-Sep-19 06:03 AM] CrisF#3405
`increase the size of the pool` this may be referring to the SmartChains' ability to form clusters.

[02-Sep-19 06:16 AM] CrisF#3405
No worries, @CryptoMedication .
Following the SmartChain setup tutorial will have chains up for you in no time.  You can experiment and ask questions here.

[02-Sep-19 06:47 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@CryptoMedication
1. Asking same things at different channels doesn't help to get the `proper` response faster. DMing random team members neither does.
2. Komodo team works on many various projects so there're people that do not have contributions to `komodod`.
3. Check the disclaimers: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/614104760076730455/614379743420219393
