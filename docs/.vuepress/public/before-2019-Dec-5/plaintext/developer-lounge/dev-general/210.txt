anybody who install that app, who is Chinese, will be hunted down

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Regnar it can be done. but security is first priority of course. and for major Mesh network like this some challenges needs solving, like routing problem for such network.

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it's run by a US company that doesn't care

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] Regnar#6164
Any app installed on Chinese phone is likely known to the state anyway, agree there

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar no, it's bluetooth

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
Bluetooth is a disease

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
turning it on is like using a glory hole in a trucker stop

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
Rough analogy, but true.

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is from 2017

so fucking boring. Please, just don't recommend anybody use bluetooth ever, and they will be safer

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] Regnar#6164
So stay away from bluetooth. Got it

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
People using BT apps on phones in china, while it will work a bit, is so scary

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
Chinese govt will hack into every one of those phonese

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
They already have.

Do not recommend this shite.

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] Regnar#6164
That's the difference man, I don't think any of these people does think it is secure

[04-Sep-19 01:19 PM] Regnar#6164
Same reason Twitter and Facebook have been used to coordinate revolutions and protests

[04-Sep-19 01:19 PM] Regnar#6164
They're public.

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] Regnar#6164
The concern it appears is not whether they are secure, but whether they are censorship resistant. Blocking Twitter in an area is easy if you control the ISPs.

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
They are using telegram because they think their phone number won't be given out

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
but China already figured that out

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
and TG had to put out another release, but still, can you really fight with China?

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Can you imagine the exploits they sit on?

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
0dayz, that nobody knows about?

[04-Sep-19 01:20 PM] Regnar#6164
We are discussing different points

[04-Sep-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar the thought that you would start talking about this stuff and add in KMD, on twitter, scares me

[04-Sep-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
plz don't

[04-Sep-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
So many current protestors just haven't been rounded up yet. Their metadata was leaked

[04-Sep-19 01:21 PM] Regnar#6164
We are discussing different points

[04-Sep-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar sorry, what point did you want to make?

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
Without really learning the basics of OPSEC, no technology will save you

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Regnar#6164
I concede it is not secure, hardly any of it is, certainly not Twitter and FB, Telegram or this. But they aren't being use because they have security or faux security, they are being used because they are effective at getting information out to the public. This is just another step in that non secure public information area that is an attempt at not being censored

[04-Sep-19 01:24 PM] Regnar#6164
The KMD point is no longer valid. I agree, security is priority for us, and we shouldn't use insecure tech like BT.

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
The sticking point is, why not send info out to the public while keeping your anonymity and life?

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I see news stories about this BT app, and people think it's more secure or something and that "china can't block it"

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] Regnar#6164
If they can do it, I would suggest the same

[04-Sep-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
Average people are already being FUD'ed

[04-Sep-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. "hey China can't stop this, I will use it"

[04-Sep-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
Just be very careful to make tech recommendation to people where life + limb is on the line

[04-Sep-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
I guess is my TLDR

[04-Sep-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326

[04-Sep-19 01:28 PM] Regnar#6164
To be fair Duke, I never made a recommendation to use this app, I even said I wasn't trying to sell it to us, I asked if you could rain coins on people using it. I did mention the Hong Kong article because that is how I learned of it.

[04-Sep-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar yes, and to me, that insinuated using it in HK with KMD, which is where maybe I misunderstood you

[04-Sep-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
unfortunately, just turning BT on, not even "pairing" with another BT, is enough for most exploits

[04-Sep-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it's just not secure at all to allow another device to talk to your BT

[04-Sep-19 01:31 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea my initial question was about the ability to rain coins on people using it (walk into a store and you receive coins, or airdrop coins to people at concerts etc) 

I learned of it from the Hong Kong article.

[04-Sep-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's also possible without BlueTooth

I was thinking about the bluetooth crypto a while back, probably a safer way to do offline mobile payments than bluetooth. I was thinking of on an airplane or in rural areas without reception.

[04-Sep-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar QR codes

[04-Sep-19 02:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cheap wifi routers and QR codes should be a solution

interesting!

[04-Sep-19 02:23 PM] Regnar#6164
Guess I'm not sure how that would work, the QR code for offline. Does it contain a signed tx or something?

[04-Sep-19 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
basically your get the latest blockchain data to your offline system and generate a signed transaction which you want to broadcast to online blockchain.

[04-Sep-19 02:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
signed transaction can be made into a QR code, and that can be transmitted.

[04-Sep-19 02:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
how the blockchain data is given to the offline computer is a matter of following security

[04-Sep-19 02:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it can be via USB etc

[04-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Regnar#6164
The issue I was thinking is how do you know the sender has funds, what if their wallet has been offline for an hour flight, and they spend the funds from an online source, and spend again with you. When you go to broadcast the TX, its already spent

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... that's interesting situation. I don't know answer of this.

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Regnar#6164
Or I give you a qr code and get internet access first, and spend those funds before you do

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be I have

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Channels CC

[04-Sep-19 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the funds can be only accepted if its from Channels CC.... If I'm getting it right....
