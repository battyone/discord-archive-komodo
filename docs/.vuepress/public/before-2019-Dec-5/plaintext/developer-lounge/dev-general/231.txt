Wish I had the coding knowledge and better cmd skills you guys have , takes me forever  to get anything done.  Going to start putting an hour or so a day at it got a lot of rust to shake off

can't get  the g++-multilib to install on raspbian (debian linux) on a pi_1. see conversation here http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=134930 

however, g++-5 installs fine:
sudo apt-get install g++-5
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following additional packages will be installed:
  cpp-5 gcc-5 libasan2 libgcc-5-dev libisl15 libstdc++-5-dev libubsan0
Suggested packages:
  gcc-5-locales gcc-5-doc libstdc++6-5-dbg libgcc1-dbg libgomp1-dbg
  libitm1-dbg libatomic1-dbg libasan2-dbg liblsan0-dbg libtsan0-dbg
  libubsan0-dbg libcilkrts5-dbg libmpx0-dbg libquadmath0-dbg libstdc++-5-doc
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  cpp-5 g++-5 gcc-5 libasan2 libgcc-5-dev libisl15 libstdc++-5-dev libubsan0
I guess my question is, do I need the full g++-multilib to run KMD or  is there a work around?

multilib is needed if you don't know which one you need (covers i686,32/64bit everything)

[16-Oct-19 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
on raspberry pi you need something else

`sudo apt-get install g++-aarch64-linux-gnu ` if i recall correctly

[16-Oct-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007
it worked fine. only issue is the oil travels through those cables if i leave them like this and makes things wet

[16-Oct-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
but, if the pi was hanging from the cables, that wouldn't happen

[16-Oct-19 04:49 PM] PTYX#6840
maybe something like an extension that you can connect to the actual usb cables might keep them dry, i'm not actually sure how the oil travels, i've never tried it

[16-Oct-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
i was surprised to see that too. the power and hdmi cable was wet even out of the box and it was on the table too.

[16-Oct-19 05:30 PM] PTYX#6840
so the oil travels all the way up the cable

[16-Oct-19 05:32 PM] PTYX#6840
i wonder if somethign like this taped to the side of the plastic would stop it from travelling https://www.amazon.com/zdyCGTime-Extension-Connector-Supports-Charging/dp/B07SN9DJ5G/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=metal+usbc+extension+cable&qid=1571247126&s=electronics&sr=1-19

[16-Oct-19 05:50 PM] SHossain#0007
i tried USB OTG cable, it does't stop as long as the cable goes up and down at the end

[16-Oct-19 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007
i removed everything once i found out that my table surface had a lot of oil via the cable. only way i can think it will not happen is if the pi is hanging from top via cable. but, don't want to experiment that for now

@gcharang looking at these rpcs now, what exactly is the problem with getNotarisationsForBlock? When I initially read it, I thought you meant it wasn't working via curl at all.

[18-Oct-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
```
curl --user $rpcuser:$rpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "cclib", "params": ["combine", "18", "["0225f1cbbda1a0c406bb8f6dc7a589d88b2f9e28cd4fdb3f59139f8aff1f5d270a", "02d3431950c2f0f9654217b6ce3d44468d3a9ca7255741767fdeee7c5ec6b47567"]"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$rpcport/

think this should work for the musig one

yes

[19-Oct-19 08:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright did you verify that  getNotarisationsForBlock doesn't accept a number as string?

the musig combine command as you have written it, gives
```json
{"result":null,"error":{"code":-32700,"message":"Parse error"},"id":null}
```
