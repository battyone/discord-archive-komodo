(If you need to Reindex the wallet, add the parameter -reindex at the end of the target field)

[30-Sep-19 07:42 AM] lc123456#5516
-reindex

[30-Sep-19 07:43 AM] lc123456#5516
only add this param?

[30-Sep-19 08:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nope, you need the launch params for pirate. guide shows how to add reindex launch param. instead of `-reindex` put `-ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 -addnode=78.47.205.239`

[01-Oct-19 09:11 PM] dude#6062
for pos64stake - is it based on UTXO - if i created 64 addresses one for each segid and used z_sendmany and sent balance to each 64 with a single TX - would that have any negative impact on staking versus using individual TX's to each of 64 addresses?

[01-Oct-19 09:13 PM] gcharang#6833
@dude no difference
it just considers a utxo

https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/rewards.html#rewards
in the rewardsinfo - there is an attribute "locked" - is this total coins locked for rewards? ^doc doesn't mention it

[02-Oct-19 09:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@dude locked should be the number of coins that are currently locked in the rewards plan

komodo ocean wallet is primarily for the Komodo (KMD) blockchain
for arr, you can use PirateOcean
<https://medium.com/piratechain/pirateocean-wallet-guide-1cb80f70364c>
or any other wallet the Pirate community suggests
<https://pirate.black/discord/>

[07-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Oszy#5734
you can use komodo ocean but you need to launch pirate chain not kmd

[07-Oct-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
KomodoOcean launches for PIRATE like:
`komodo-qt-linux -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1`
or whatever your OS version is (linux,mac,win.exe)

how to setup  wallet for smartchain

[07-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
running the chain is you "wallet"

yes how

i have already run a smart chain now i want to learn how can i build a wallet for my smartchain for client best expperience

[07-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Oszy#5734
you could code your own, or fork an existing and modify to your chain

[07-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Oszy#5734
you can launch most of the KMD chains with KomodoOcean wallet if you just want a "quick" GUI wallet

[07-Oct-19 03:35 PM] Oszy#5734
`komodo-qt -ac_name=YOURCHAIN -yourparams`

KomodoOcean has a branch or two in its repo as to how to integrate a specific coin without a shortcut (although they are older and would need the chain specific bits in the 'static' branch)

fee is outside the array

Well did you download komodo qt?

[08-Oct-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`./komodo-qt no such file or directory`
means that `komodo-qt` is not a file in the directory you have open in the terminal
just like you can't go to your driveway and get in your car if your car is elsewhere

I have just published a nodejs client for Komodo and Smart Chains <https://github.com/gcharang/node-komodo-rpc> ; can be thought of as a fork of stdrpc that supports Smart Chains and multiple instances
>>> Supports on-the-fly RPC methods using Proxies; all the RPC methods supported by a daemon (including the Antara API) are available
Supports multiple instances (different daemons) in the same program

you need to choose what language you want code in and have a Komodo RPC library that you can use to communicate with an electrum server that you should also have already set up before you want a lite wallet.

@pandaanu73 you either pay someone to do it for yo, or you have to be specific here about development questions. "how to make web wallet" is not a specific question and no one will have the answer you are looking for. I think mine is close to the best you can get.
