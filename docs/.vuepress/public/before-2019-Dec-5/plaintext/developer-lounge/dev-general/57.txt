[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
or is that stuff just gone?

[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's not a big loss, but I was hoping not to lose it.

[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I know which z address it was supposed to go to, but I don't remember which one I sent it from.

[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes.

[13-Nov-18 12:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There's only like 10 in this wallet.

[13-Nov-18 12:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I redownloaded the blockchain from scratch already, with the z address in the wallet.dat file that was supposed to receive the funds. YOu think if I reimport the private key, it will show up?

[13-Nov-18 01:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no luck so far

[13-Nov-18 01:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, there's no way of pulling from the wallet.dat file any information about that transaction I made that never went through?

I sent a bit of cash from z address A to z address B.

Both z address A and B were in this wallet.dat file.

Before I backed up and erased the wallet.dat file, I made sure that the money was received in z address B, and it was there.

Then, I imported the private key for B into another computer, and the funds were not there.

Tried deleting all the blockchain data, and redownloading and reindexing. 

Still no luck. Address B is empty. I have to wonder if I was mistaken in what I saw for address B.

It's not a large about of money, but I at least want to be careful not to repeat the same mistake.

[13-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've tried two separate computers, and both report address B as empty.

[13-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've left one computer running with the daemon for days and address B is still empty.

[13-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, I don't believe it's a calculations thing.

[13-Nov-18 01:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds like the money is not lost, it's just not being imported/recognized on the imported node

[13-Nov-18 01:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus if the transaction was never confirmed, it stayed in the mempool, and there is no permanent record

[13-Nov-18 01:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
opids are like process id's on your unix machine. Useful numbers on your machine, completely useless on another

[13-Nov-18 01:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
they are also transient, your local node doesn't even keep them around between restarts and things like that

[13-Nov-18 01:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus your wallet.dat stores all pubkeys+private keys, as well as transactions for both taddrs and zaddrs, even if those outputs are spent. that is most of the data in there, along with some metadata

[13-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
>  `even if those outputs are spent.` 
This is what Im trying to make it forget üòÑ

[13-Nov-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it works better

[13-Nov-18 02:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, just copy all data from wallet.dat to wallet2.dat, and leave out whatever transactions you don't want to import into the new node

[13-Nov-18 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
this code just prints out key data, no transactions, so the next step would be to write that data to a new wallet.dat: https://github.com/leto/wack/blob/master/wack.pl

You can delete the transactions from inside the daemon

[13-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT it doesnt remove the data from the wallet.dat

[13-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still speeds it up 1000x though

[13-Nov-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know exactly how to do it properly .. like the algo to make it work, but I dont know exactly to go about codeing it on C++

[13-Nov-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Loop over all txs... sort into a list of txids by blockheight (or depth in main chain ) then iterat down this list from newest to oldest checking if the tx vout that is yours is spent/uspent. Everything unspent add total value to a variable, when the variable you are adding to == getbalance, stop counting here, and start deleting txs... everything before this point can go, it has no unspent vouts of yours. üòÉ

Doent matter its slow as buggery, as once yo urun it the first time, a call each 1000 blocks will be very very fast.

[13-Nov-18 02:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
why write 300 lines of error-prone C++ when you can write a few lines of Perl to make a new wallet.dat? Just saying üòÉ

[13-Nov-18 02:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r you can probably use one of the indexes, like timestamp index, to get the data to sort by block height

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
you might need to write some custom code around the indexes, like `getsnapshot`, but the raw data is there

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because if yo umake a wallet.dat

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you still need to stop the deamon

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Partivcularly for notary nodes ... stoping the dawmone fucks them

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can clean it un runtime

[13-Nov-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and not remoce utxos igiana is trying to use

[13-Nov-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt slow the node down, or get it banned for a few hours after doing he clean.

[13-Nov-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The data is already there in that code ... it has .GetDepthInMainChain()

[13-Nov-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I  just ahev no idea how to sort the vector ... mayve I can make a struct/vector with the txid and the depth, then sort the structureby depth ?

[13-Nov-18 02:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
valid point, restarting nodes is a huge pain

[13-Nov-18 02:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are boost things to sort standard data structures

[13-Nov-18 02:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
you might need to write a custom "comparator" to tell it how to compare a custom data structure

[13-Nov-18 02:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
you could have an array of 2 element arrays

[13-Nov-18 02:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
[depth, txid] in each

[13-Nov-18 02:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
sorting by the first element of a vector/array is default

[13-Nov-18 02:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
it makes the code easier

[13-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool thats exactly what I need to do... inside the loop there piss off everything and just add txid and depth to a new array then sort by depth.

[13-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
=while your here, I need to do something with verus

next job to do

[13-Nov-18 02:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
block height is exact, that script gives an approx timestamp given avg block time

[13-Nov-18 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just nede the height

[13-Nov-18 02:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
so you are automating the staking process?

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
to stake immature blocks, i meant

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh shit, the wallet.dat he bought?

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
i heard a bit about that, some massive wallet.dat, he bought timelocked blocks

[13-Nov-18 03:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
and the seller is now stealing them before hollowman can redeem, i imagine?

[13-Nov-18 03:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is just a dick move

[13-Nov-18 03:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
also shows off the problems with transfering ownership of timelocked utxos

[13-Nov-18 03:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe cryptoconditions can fix this problem

[13-Nov-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh he cant do it

[13-Nov-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trust me

[13-Nov-18 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he wil be oyt played here

[13-Nov-18 03:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
at least it becomes a 50/50 chance instead of him constantly stealing it

[13-Nov-18 03:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
and yeah, don't give all the details to the secret sauce

[13-Nov-18 03:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
"he" being attacker or hollowman?

[13-Nov-18 03:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
what is attacker nick, by chance?

[13-Nov-18 03:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
i like fucking with attackers

why would anyone that's spent more than 10 minutes around here be sucker enough to buy a wallet.dat

[13-Nov-18 03:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's not a good idea, in general. but hollowman said he trusted the dude, i believe

[13-Nov-18 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Sorry, I stepped away for a bit. 

Some of this stuff makes sense, some of it not. I'm going to put it on the shelf for the rest of the day and come back tomorrow. It's not urgent, and i haven't been able to get as much work done today as I would like. Thank you for being willing to help.

On another note, for the `channelsinfo` call, the returned value is this:

```
output of channelsinfo:
{
  "result": "success",
  "name": "Channels Info",
  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 8 satoshi - 200013b8e0a770b359a46689e3b457a4ac0fe48f9586728726e6f697d70715ae",
  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 800000000 satoshi - 33a0d659acde3caf7f9b81fd6e0621924365fe58a9fc7ce772a2c54d795f010a",
  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 1 payments of 10000000 satoshi - 9d65e79eba3e37fd473b7053f993694053f806f38b8795aa10ee0a47b878e46e",
  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 10000000 satoshi - 2f95b0f4e3dbe7f5ebc0f9479800c9ff3f44e76f5378313c9406ab5a92ff4631"
}
```

[13-Nov-18 04:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What does the `name` property relate to? Is that the name of the rpc call?

It wouldn't make sense for it to be the name of a channel, since there's several channels in there.

[13-Nov-18 04:44 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus I guess it's just name of call duplicating here (like a title of list). But @Mihailo can correct me if I'm wrong

[13-Nov-18 05:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, what are each of the pieces in this part of the response:

`"Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 10000000 satoshi - 2f95b0f4e3dbe7f5ebc0f9479800c9ff3f44e76f5378313c9406ab5a92ff4631"`

[13-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It looks like "Channel: ChannelCCaddress, No. of Payments - Payment Amount - channel_payment_txid"

[13-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is that right?

[13-Nov-18 05:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or maybe, channel_payment_txid should be described `open_txid`

[13-Nov-18 06:52 AM] TonyL#3577
RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - to which address it's opened, 10 payments - how many payments left in this channel, 10000000 satoshi  - denomination (dividing of payment amount on 10000000 satoshi should be integer > 0)

[13-Nov-18 06:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, so that's the destination address

[13-Nov-18 06:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, this address in name now

[13-Nov-18 06:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what's the last one?

[13-Nov-18 06:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
is it open_tx_id?

[13-Nov-18 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be CC address so, last one - if it's match with id which you used in `channelsinfo` it's open_tx_id

[13-Nov-18 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems this output was reworked a little bit so better to clarify with @Mihailo

[13-Nov-18 06:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[13-Nov-18 06:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mihailo 

When you get back, please ping me

[13-Nov-18 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus  Just re-checked code. For your example:
"name": "Channels Info" - just fixed text
RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj -  ChannelCCaddress
 10 payments - number of payments left in this channel
10000000 satoshi  - denomination (dividing of payment amount on 10000000 satoshi should be integer > 0)
2f95b0f4e3dbe7f5ebc0f9479800c9ff3f44e76f5378313c9406ab5a92ff4631 - channel txid

What do you guys think of a Komodo only pegged asset/stable coin, that can be atomic swapped for when one wants to. They can be a source of securing holders of KMD to help mitigate worrying over price fluctuations. And if it's a stable coin, to help keep price volatility down there can be a Komodo foundation that will trade KMD back for the stable coin, once every quarter to keep price secure. The importance of pegging your own asset is to avoid the problems with usd pairs, and gives weight to the ecosystems main asset, just some random ideas

[13-Nov-18 07:23 AM] TonyL#3577
As I know there is a possibility to swap ERC-20 stable coins (gemini should be intergrate to BarterDex)
With assetsCC and gatewaysCC crypto-conditions smart-contracts it's possible to create stable token inside assetchain just by `tokencreate` (but it should be backed for something for sure) or transfer existing stable coin to stable tokens via gateway and secondary trade - it's in case if someone will want to create it.
But any stable coin need very very high liquidity to be really useful and stable. And for sure there should be confidence that it's backed by something.
If someone selling back to keep price secure it's not stable coin in my understanding but some manipulation  - stable coin should represent something relatively stable (e.g. USD) so market set this rate kinda automatically
