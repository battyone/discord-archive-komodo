[17-Aug-18 07:20 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
So it's a way to speed up block propagation, especially useful for coins that use big blocks. Kmd has less need for it

[18-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Regnar#6164
Just a thought but considering Komodo has the same wallet addresses as AC, it might be a good idea to build an explorer that shows you full balances of all coins in an address. like when you look up an ETH address and it tells you the tokens that are stored in that address as well. This might also be a good feature for starting up Agama or BarterDEX (Start up by auto loading all coins with a balance). I think in the future we could see more AC startups and performing Airdrops, and its possible people don't realize they have these coins from the airdrops because they never heard of it, or just weren't paying attention, so they wouldn't activate the wallet. 

I also understand that technically all these addresses would be using different blockchains which adds more complexity to it, but I'm not sure on how much more complex this would be to view AC addresses too.

@bonedaddy which Linux? I'm on arch and an update to glibc broke all electron apps I had to install a patch for it. Also try the portable version not the installer

[18-Aug-18 01:31 AM] bonedaddy#1337

isit possible to stake with ledgers without having to manually enter the mnemonic phrase?

[18-Aug-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure about ledger, I know thru don't set nlocktime so there is some special process there. Its not staking BTW its just free coins for sending transactions.

[18-Aug-18 01:34 AM] bonedaddy#1337
haha yea it doesnt that was ticking me off for awhile until i figured it out. oh wat? i thought it was a DPoS type staking method

[18-Aug-18 02:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no... The vote is held via an airdrop of a new blockchain. This year it was called VOTE2018 and was dropped 1:1 with KMD, then everyone sent the coins to the notary they vote for, top votes got notary spots.

[18-Aug-18 02:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 5% is just extra 5%...

I'm trying to create an asset chain with 100% premined coins. People that mine blocks for this asset chain will get tx fees, but no mining reward.

It was easy to create a new asset chain using the following configuration:

`./komodod -pubkey=<pubkey> -ac_name=<myCoin> -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=0 -ac_end=0 -addnode=<ipOfNode>  &`

But there's still one problem I cannot solve: With this configuration miners still get `0.00010000` mining reward, and the total amount of coins is growing. 

Q: How can I make an asset chain in which the total amount of coins does not increase over time / what am I missing here?

[19-Aug-18 01:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
I believe 0.00010000  is the minimum it has to generate to make a block. If you don't want your supply to increase just send the extra generated coins to the burnadress

[19-Aug-18 01:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
example: BEER was premined with 100m and how has 99'996'985 supply which indicated that 3015 BEER was burned

[19-Aug-18 01:28 PM] bartwr#6773
How would this work? Everyone can be a miner. So every miner gets 0.00010000 for every mined block. How can I configure that extra generated coins go to the burn address automatically?

[19-Aug-18 01:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
you as the dev of your chain keep a supply of x coins setup a cronjob thatsends the extra coins to the burnaddress

[19-Aug-18 01:29 PM] bartwr#6773
Or is this a manual process, by the project team that created the coin?

[19-Aug-18 01:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes 'manual'

[19-Aug-18 01:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
that's the only way I think of you can control the supply maybe thereis a possibility to generate 0 block rewards blocks

[19-Aug-18 01:30 PM] bartwr#6773
Ok üòÉ Thank you very much for this. Is this the same configuration as the DEX coin has?

edit: Ah, I can see that is the case in `~/komodo/src/assetchains.old
`. So manual burns are common here as well.

[19-Aug-18 01:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
DEX was issued with 1m coins and now has now 1'000'030    so 30 DEX where mined from on demand blocks

[19-Aug-18 01:31 PM] bartwr#6773
Nice. Then this will be the configuration for my coin: `./komodod -pubkey=<pubkey> -ac_name=<myCoin> -ac_supply=100000000 -addnode=<ipOfNode>  &`

[19-Aug-18 01:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes thats sounds like a standard chain like DEX SN etc

[19-Aug-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is ac_reward was 0

[19-Aug-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
set ac_reward to non-0, otherwise it uses the default 0.0001 reward

[19-Aug-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and set the -ac_end to be 1

[19-Aug-18 01:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
@bartwr ^ here is your solution

[19-Aug-18 02:35 PM] bartwr#6773
I set `-ac_end=1` and removed `-ac_reward=x`. This works: No default mining fee is given for miners that mine blocks. Perfect, thank you @jl777c @CHMEX . My final coin setup is:

`./komodod -pubkey=<pubKey> -ac_name=<coinName> -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_end=1 -addnode=<IP> &`

Works well!

I wonder who burned 100 kmd

you can use op_return as an alternative

#cc-general 
jl777c Last Thursday at 3:16 PM
yes, that is the only way to burn assets
unless there is a bug. every satoshi for assets are supposed to be preserved

yes op_return  makes it unspendable.

interesting development about full homomorphic encryption

[20-Aug-18 06:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
too high level for me, but I found this part interesting:

[20-Aug-18 06:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
"The difficulty is that smart contract privacy isn‚Äôt compatible with having one global shared state for all contracts and users like in Ethereum. Each user is only able to decrypt what is encrypted for them and FHE doesn‚Äôt support working with random access memory‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone needs to pass all the state through a circuit. Thus, a practical implementation requires more diligent thinking than merely continuing to accelerate FHE (which we plan to continue doing)"

[20-Aug-18 06:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it sounds as if Kmd, with contracts in their own smartchains, is a better match

How do you fully decode a tx hex (i.e., get the same JSON as from daemon) with `bitcoinjs-lib`?
more than just the buffers that `Transaction.fromHex` gives

`komodo-cli decoderawtransaction <hex>`

`komodo-cli help` has all commands

@Mylo I know how to do it from the daemon, I need to get the same result in nodejs

[21-Aug-18 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush-NG uses something similar, maybe it's not exactly bitcoinjs-lib, but all these libs works similarly. Just wrappers around existing RPC calls

One thing i had to do in the hush-ng codebase was try to make the RPC connection a singleton, only have 1 around at a time. It's easy to accidentally create multiple rpc objects that keep open multiple RPC connections and slows everything down

[21-Aug-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
currently most stratums use the blocktemplate to gather minimal data and "fake" the new cb tx from the ground up. I want to, instead, get the template and just substitute the proper info.

[21-Aug-18 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
seems reasonable

[21-Aug-18 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
remember, as James reminded me recently, RPC operations are single-threaded, so having more than 1 RPC connection open per application is a big waste

[21-Aug-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yeah, that's why I wanted to use a lib, that way less calls
