Q: I try to see the rewards for a multisig address, though can't get information on this. Should multisig KMD addresses get the 5%/year rewards as well, or is this only for non-MS addresses?

[02-Dec-18 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@bartwr do you have an explorer link or txid of a transaction?

[02-Dec-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
msig should also accrue rewards, it is based on utxo age

[02-Dec-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
use gettxout

[02-Dec-18 06:10 PM] bartwr#6773
Ok, good to know that msig should accrue rewards as well.

[02-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
needs locktime set I think?

[02-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
there's a chance you may have to explicitly set it

[02-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
just check it after tx is sent before you leave it for a month

[02-Dec-18 06:15 PM] bartwr#6773
Hm, ok.

[02-Dec-18 06:16 PM] bartwr#6773
Thing is: If I run the 

`./komodo-cli gettxout "TXID" 1` command, I get nothing back from terminal.

Maybe that's normal behaviour. I have to check with an older UTXO

[02-Dec-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
plz look at docs for gettxout

[02-Dec-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to add vout after txid

[02-Dec-18 06:40 PM] bartwr#6773
Ok. Via DM I learned some things. Most importantly:

- This morning I had an UTXO of 10+ KMD
- This morning I could have claimed the rewards for this UTXO

Though, I emptied the UTXO by doing a 100% UTXO value `sendtransaction`. Therefor I cannot claim the reward for this UTXO anymore.

__

Lessons learned:

1. (It's only possible to claim rewards for UTXO's with > 10 KMD value)
2. Make sure you always claim rewards before you do transactions that split UTXO's with rewards to UTXO's having less then 10 KMD of value

[02-Dec-18 06:41 PM] bartwr#6773
__

If there would be still rewards to claim, what would be the _CLI command_ to claim it? I couldn't find this. Saw that it was asked before in Discord (but no answer yet)

[02-Dec-18 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you get all rewards for a given UTXO when you spend it

[02-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
claiming for multisig is probably a bit tricky. you need to construct the tx and add an output for the rewards

[02-Dec-18 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@bartwr  `createrawtransaction`

[02-Dec-18 06:47 PM] bartwr#6773
Is the reward a normal vout?

`./komodo-cli createrawtransaction '[{"txid":"THE_TXID","vout":1,"scriptPubKey":"PUBKEY","redeemScript":"REDEEMSCRIPT"}]' '{"RECEIVER_ADDRESS":x}'`

I'll test with a non-MS address.

[02-Dec-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
reward is normal

Hi...I'm interested in setting up an asset chain...I've read the process..have vps servers running kmd...ready to set this up but would like to discuss with someone the details of this chain

[03-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
@jl777c is there anything I need other than dev instructions?

[03-Dec-18 01:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Captain_Jack it all comes down to you choosing your -ac_* parameters. For instance, Pirate (ARRR) uses `-ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1`

[03-Dec-18 01:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
with 10 new ac parameters in the latest KMD, yes, it can be overwhelming

[03-Dec-18 01:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
and no, all of them are not completely documented

Is there a "decentralized bank/payment system"  or similar project based on Komodo? 
There are cryptocurrency projects like bankera, crypterium (not sure they will be decentralized) 
I also checked ethereum dapps : https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/tagged/banking but ethereum is slow, and I think is not appropriate for a true financial system.

https://www.stateofthedapps.com/og-default.png

[03-Dec-18 11:02 AM] all2#1432
Is komodo technically appropriate for a system I tried to describe below?

A decentralized + transparent bank: (Looks like a classical, but please read on.)

-
The main point is transparency. 
All transactions of "public" accounts are visible by everyone or at least related communities. 

-
There are many use cases. 
Charity organizations, foundations, local governments, societies, associations, artists, authors, singers, projects, software developers*, software projects*, ...
can open accounts on this platform.

If I donate sth to a local foundation or society etc, I can see if they are using money as they promised.

I listen a song on youtube, read a book on the web, use on open source software. 
But nto easy to send money for support.

Transparency is default but configurable. 
Accounts can be public or anonym.
Transfers also can be public or anonym.

[03-Dec-18 11:04 AM] all2#1432
+
A 1 level more detail:

-Ids:   
    Individuals, Identities. Real People.
    ::Name Surname Nationality National Id Number, Profile Picture, BirthDate, Phone, Email, Password related info
    Identities can be verified by a hierarchical +p2p (friends) notary/verification model. 

-Non Person (Collectives, Joints, ..)
    Companies, Foundations, Funds*, ...
    ::Country, CompanyId, Name, ..
    Shareholders, Participants {id, numberOfShares, entryTxId}

-Accounts
    Will store curencies.
    ::OwnerId, AccountId, Currency, Balance, Name, Type (Public, Private)
    
    -Transactions:   
        From Account, To Account, When, TxId, Explanation, Amount
        Transactions can be public, private also

-Transfers
    A sends amount X to B with explanation E. (can choose public, private)

-Deposit, Withdrawal
    Like sending receiving cryptocurrencies to / from exchanges

-Exchange
    barterDex

-Credits
    (Simple Credit:)
    A sends Amnt to B as credit offer. 
    A sets an expiry duration for the offer (lets say 10 minutes or 2 hours..). The amount is blocked.
    If B accepts, blocked amount sent to B s account. If rejects or at expiry time, money goes back to A.
    ..
    B can partially or completely close this credit by paying back amount.


Of course not this simple, these are minimals. 
(I have 15-20 years of banking IT experience. Systems are basically as above.)

Thanks

[03-Dec-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
all but the credit aspect seems pretty much built in functionality

[03-Dec-18 11:25 AM] all2#1432
Then let me read more technical docs on komodo.  thx very much.

[03-Dec-18 01:43 PM] riddler18k#0791
Hi guys, slightly random question... if I was to limit the number of master nodes  (max 600 for argument sake)  via a crypto condition contract and say a few years down the line I realised I need more masternodes to help complete the transactions.... would I be able to do that via crypto conditions?

[03-Dec-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
masternodes are not supported at this point

[03-Dec-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a rewards contract that allows people to lock funds and get rewards

[03-Dec-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems to be most of why people like masternodes, without any of the centralizing problems

@Deleted User 

Let me know how the new documentation works for you.

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/komodo-docs-vuepress/

This is the same documentation that you see on `komodoplatform.com/developer-docs/`. The latter link has temporary url masking on it, so you can't copy/paste links as easily yet. I'm working on fixing that right now.

I'd be very interested to hear your feeback. Based off your above comments, I believe you are in the exact target audience for this documentation, so if you get stuck somewhere, I would really like to know. Thank you!

[04-Dec-18 05:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Captain_Jack asset chains have DPoW built in, you don't need to write any code. What you need to do is coordinate with KMD notary nodes, to start running your AC + notarizing it

[04-Dec-18 09:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
since we are migrating everybody to sapling and not allowing to have both for very long, maybe it's not a big issue. It was an annoying bug on zec 2.x full nodes

do parens make the difference in location?
`(int)10`

[05-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
`JSON error is not integer as expected` is what you'll get if the rpc command is expecting a json and you give it a string or integer

[05-Dec-18 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
(int) '10' should be `amount` using the line above

[05-Dec-18 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its asking for an int

[05-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alright#0419

`komodo-cli getaddressutxos '{"addresses": ["RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87"]}'` works
