@ca333 there is a fix for `getblock` rpc in KMDLabs so it will properly display the segid of the coins that staked the block. It'd be nice if this were in the next packaged release, sorry if this is too late notice. I'm getting a windows machine up now to test pos64staker on it, and parts of this rely on that fix

[30-Jan-19 10:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd say the fix is in KMDLabs komodod already because I haven seen such crashes here

[30-Jan-19 10:32 PM] Alright#0419
it is in KMDLabs/komodo, don't think it's in jl777/komodo or komodoplatform/komodo

[30-Jan-19 10:33 PM] Alright#0419
I'd PR it myself if I had any idea where it was 😅

👆🏽 

[30-Jan-19 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
think I found a way to throw pools out of wack for a few minutes at a time on pos64 chains

[30-Jan-19 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
in debug.log getting `AcceptBlock from future error` but then the node accepts it anyway

[30-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Alright#0419
and nomp goes crazy with `Cannot get block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!`

[30-Jan-19 10:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not nomp that goes crazy, it's the daemon (that's a pass-through error notice)

[30-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] ca333#0118
sure - will ensure its in the next release. i am currently building a release for QA/testing so this is not affected yet. do you when approx. this has been integrated into KMDLabs??

[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
I will find it

[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] ca333#0118
tks!

[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
the problem is that I'm not sure if it was all added at once

[30-Jan-19 10:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright I know that whatever commit has the fix for when `setgenerate false` didn't turn off `setgenerate true 0` will run OUR for 38 hrs, not sure beyond that

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
Oh

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
you have uptime of 38 hours on that build?

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I did, yes

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
that's good to know, thanks

[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Alright#0419
and it was staking?

[30-Jan-19 10:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, because of the prints I've only used the labs builds for OUR

[30-Jan-19 10:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
~~I haven't staked a block since yesterday, but I think that has to do with weights and poor UTXO choices on my part~~ seems I just staked 16 blocks ago with newest

[30-Jan-19 10:56 PM] Alright#0419
are you managing utxos at all or just letting it do it's thing

[30-Jan-19 10:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used some silly numbers and that TUI you asked me to test

[30-Jan-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=OUR getbalance
481.01221928`
spread over all 64 segids, so I'm not going to stake too much

[30-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
yea I need to think about how best to handle staking if you don't have enough coins to cover all segids

[30-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Alright#0419
you'd probably be better off with larger UTXOs in some segids

[30-Jan-19 11:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah I think 12-20 is as small as one can go and get more than 1 or 2 per day with the weights these guys are swinging

[30-Jan-19 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
have you been pow mining?

[30-Jan-19 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not since they dropped the trade value by 98%
it tends to stay ~ 92-93% so PoW will burn that elec bill up

[30-Jan-19 11:02 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think many people are staking at all

[30-Jan-19 11:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
doesn't take "many" people doing it when they have weights of 10s of thousands/millions

[30-Jan-19 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
45 addys were vout0 in the last 100 blocks
80 addys were vout0 in the last 200 blocks

[30-Jan-19 11:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure there's any easy way to tell if tied together by not using pubkey without a lot more code than my counter has

[30-Jan-19 11:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
13185 blocks and 1554 unique vout0 addys

[31-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need me to PR all the changes to the staker? I changed a lot, this won't be an easy task..

[31-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[31-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can do it tho I guess

[31-Jan-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Is this needed right away? Can I make a branch on my repo that someone can test first?

[31-Jan-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
No

[31-Jan-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
if the segid display in getblock is simple enough to PR, that is what I need

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Isn't it crashing in jl777 repo?

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
if not, no worries

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's not hard to do

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its two places in the code

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But what about the crash?

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs doesn't have that

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] Alright#0419
I don't know

[31-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe it related tho

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
I don't know how to reproduce it other than leaving it while I sleep and hoping it crashes

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So get back trace when it crashes... I think it will be related tho...

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
scroll up

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will do branch today

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And u can test it

[31-Jan-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

[31-Jan-19 02:43 AM] Alright#0419
see pin

[31-Jan-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks... Kind of helps I think... I think best is to just PR all changes and them test it for a few days before making a release... Latest labs staker has about 20 bug fixes... As long as it works for our then its should be fine.. Mgnx not syncing is to do with assets cc changes

[31-Jan-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Man this is difficult... I dont know how to use git enough to do this... I think I have to add verushash1.1 and everything in to do this... I mean the LABS staker is stable and working... So I guess this is needed... Cant see easily what changed that stops the crash so everything is going to need to be merged in.

[31-Jan-19 04:25 AM] Alright#0419
if it's a problem, don't worry about it

[31-Jan-19 04:25 AM] Alright#0419
I was hoping that our pos64staker would work with the next Agama build, so noobies could stake OUR without their wallets going out of control

If someone tests that all chains work with that I can make a PR... Its possible to disable the is_STAKED on komodo_connectblock and the wallet filter.... But they only get used if is_STAKED returns true.

[31-Jan-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I have some minor changes to build.sh and Makefile.am ... Just to reorder when CClib is built so that it builds from a fresh clone.

[31-Jan-19 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really dont knwo git well enough to try and merge just the relavent commits... a lot of this code was from when i was new, and was liek 200 git commits of 'test` foer a single change 😂

[31-Jan-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also cant just copy paste the entire functions because @dukeleto siad you cant do commtis liek that because its impossible to see what has changed.

[31-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
I will just add an option to staker.py to compensate, no worries

[31-Jan-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am much mroe concerened about the crash

[31-Jan-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to just fix PoW segid is trivial

[31-Jan-19 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But if the daemon is crashign somethign else is wrong and I dont know what commit fixes that

[31-Jan-19 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just make OUR pplks use that build to stake :troll_cool:

[31-Jan-19 05:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
problem solved

[31-Jan-19 05:29 AM] Alright#0419
more worried about the people asking "what button do I click to stake?"

[31-Jan-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[31-Jan-19 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it crashes they cant stake anyway

[31-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
yea understood, was that backtrace not helpful?

[31-Jan-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not helpful.... because its already fixed in LABS

[31-Jan-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no use even testing it.... as the fix already exists

[31-Jan-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My suggestion is for someone who knows whats what to tell me what exactly they DO NOT want from the commitu abopve so I can disable it... Then jsut merge the whole thign in

[31-Jan-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe just make is_STAKED alwasys return 0 ? That effecvly disables everything

[31-Jan-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  @ca333

[31-Jan-19 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as it can sync every chain (not MGNX or SEC I think due ts assets changes) then it should be fine.

[31-Jan-19 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  There are more thigns the staker needs than just getblock btw.. segid is in listunspent, and it uses the getlastsegidstakes RPC, maybe even other things.

[31-Jan-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
maybe this is a stupid suggestion, but could we add an exception to ac_staked to allow the coinbase vout to be spent in the same block then have the daemon combine coinbase output and coins used to stake the block into single output?

[31-Jan-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
this would keep the wallet from becoming bloated after a week or two

[31-Jan-19 05:40 AM] Alright#0419
from a user perspective, they'd just need to create UTXOs and leave it. This can be handled by script like pos64staker, but maybe it's better to have it as default behavior in daemon

[31-Jan-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No you cant

[31-Jan-19 05:41 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[31-Jan-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because the staking utxo has to be teh last tx in the block thats how it validates it

[31-Jan-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would be unsafe to create the tx ins the daemon... Maybe where it detects it stked the last block, to reset ram staker, it could create this tx...  but I dont think that will be  any better than just useing extermal script

[31-Jan-19 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe even worse as things could happen... that you do not expect lol

[31-Jan-19 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
yea it's a massive change

[31-Jan-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If youw ant to do that.. I think you would need to sue the VerusPoS

[31-Jan-19 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
but I imagine most pos coins don't require external scripts to stake properly

[31-Jan-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that has a differnt block verison for staked blocvks, and determines it that way

[31-Jan-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you even need an exernal script

[31-Jan-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It just makes you stake better using one..

[31-Jan-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
*you* don't need external scripts, but a noob surely does

[31-Jan-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only to distribute coins to segids

[31-Jan-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once you do that (and you dont need to)

[31-Jan-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just stake
