For Komodo's scaling test how many nodes on average secured each child chain? (not counting notarization)

[11-Jul-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it was just a proof of concept, i think we optimized resources used and mined on a single node, but that is an indpendent part of the process and could have been mined by many nodes

[12-Jul-18 02:03 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
@jl777c doesn't that mean the 45,000 tx/second figure being marketed doesn't account for inter-node latency that would be present in each of the child chains?

[12-Jul-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by internode latency?

[12-Jul-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and these are parallel chains, not child chains

[12-Jul-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the assumption is that most transactions will be within the same chain, as a caching effect will get the coins to the chain they are most often used. it does require some preparation when traveling, like changing currency, but with the vast majority of people transacting in their local currency, there is not a need to go cross chain with every tx

[12-Jul-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the key point is that all coins on any of the chains are able to be automatically converted to any other chain

[12-Jul-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this fungibility will allow vendors to arise that do a swap immediate

[12-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think he's talking about the time needed to propagate transactions through nodes

[12-Jul-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
those happen pretty fast, mining the blocks is the bottleneck

[12-Jul-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we are filling mempools 5x faster than they are confirming (mined)

[12-Jul-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
these are totally independent chains, what is happening on one does not affect the other. so just imagine any normal coin and sending a transaction

[12-Jul-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the same

[12-Jul-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool transmission in a few seconds

[12-Jul-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
confirmed next block

[12-Jul-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the scale is just hard to grasp, but divide by 1000 and we get 45 tx/sec per chain. All of a sudden nothing special at all

[12-Jul-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
theoretically with a hardfork upgrade, we could link together any existing chains into a fungible group. as an overlay. each chain's normal tx sending will still work the same

[12-Jul-18 02:27 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
Since Komodo allows the deployment of many independent chains, my understanding is that each node needs to verify transactions on the independent chain before the state of the chain is notarized onto the bitcoin chain through dPOW. Because confirmations are reported across nodes, there's a period of time between when a node confirms a transaction and when the confirmation is communicated to the network. I know that each of the independent chains doesn't need to be quite as distributed as the bitcoin network, but they'd still be hosted on multiple nodes, meaning each of them experiences a degree of latency. If they're all mined on a single node, it would be much faster than if the independent nodes were distributed as would occur in the real world.

[12-Jul-18 02:30 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
Basically, I'm asking why that 45 tx/sec per chain wouldn't actually be lower in the real-world because those chains don't consist of just one node - they're distributed to a degree

[12-Jul-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if the blocktimes are one per minute, all the propagation delays are included in it

[12-Jul-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and at one block per minutes, that is easily more than 45 tx/sec

[12-Jul-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is not expected that any computer will be connected to all nodes at the same time, the idea is you connect to only the chains you care about

[12-Jul-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the cross chain process piggy backs onto the notarization process, so you end up with 2 or 3 notarizations to do a cross chain transfer

[12-Jul-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i just dont understand where you are seeing any meaningful latency

[12-Jul-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
also, confirmations are not communicated... each new block increases the number of confirmations

[12-Jul-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
automatically. so if a node is getting new blocks, it is adding confirmations to all prior transactions

[12-Jul-18 02:40 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
sorry didn't mean the confirmations, meant the blocks

[12-Jul-18 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks propagate to all nodes in several seconds, maybe 10 seconds if it is a very large network

[12-Jul-18 02:41 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
^right, that variance is mainly what I was asking about

[12-Jul-18 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not much in the overall scope

[12-Jul-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
remember the blocks are advancing at one per minute, including all the propagation latencies

[12-Jul-18 02:44 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
I see, even if not every node is able to dedicate the same amount of computing power in a large network?

[12-Jul-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if a node cant keep up with the network, it cant keep up with the network

[12-Jul-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if it can keep up, it stays in sync

[12-Jul-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using standard off the shelf blockchain tech, so no need for crazy fast bandwidth or CPU

[12-Jul-18 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes can keep up with bitcoin (for the most part), why would there be trouble keeping up with a parallel chain? I think you might be trying to find a problem where there isnt. Basically if the parallel chains have a problem with propagating, that would mean that existing coins have the same problem

[12-Jul-18 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
are you aware of any coin where the nodes are not able to keep up?

[12-Jul-18 02:56 PM] AnuragHydro#9274
gotcha,  as long as propagation time for communication of blocks to nodes is under the amount of time it takes for a block to advance, I guess that means there isn't a problem?

[12-Jul-18 02:56 PM] AnuragHydro#9274

Has anybody used the `getaddressbalance` RPC (which requires addressindex=1) on a KMD asset chain?

[13-Jul-18 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
trying to run the example from `help` for the RPC gives a syntax error

[13-Jul-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
if anybody has any coin with addressindex=1, I would be interested to see if the same bug exists

[13-Jul-18 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 you probably have some servers with addressindex=1 already, could you run `zcash-cli getaddressbalance '{"addresses": ["RY5LccmGiX9bUHYGtSWQouNy1yFhc5rM87"]}'` to see what you get? The address isn't important, but whether the error is about an invalid address or is a JSON parse error *is*

[13-Jul-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
to my knowledge, only komodod has the -addressindex built in

[13-Jul-18 07:04 PM] filmmakers#8374
Cipi mentioned via email that there is support for ERC20 tokens with a minimum of 2 decimals. Any future plans for tokens with 0 decimals?

[13-Jul-18 07:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@filmmakers you probably want to ask @cipi directly. I know that number of decimals is specified for each coin, but I don't know about the limits for min decimals spaces.

[13-Jul-18 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
very interesting, I assumed kmd inherited addressindex from Zcash or BTC, but I guess not

[13-Jul-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo is the upstream for this, but it was a pull request by thetrunk

[13-Jul-18 07:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i understand now. addressindex is in Hush as well, because it was originally written/merged by madbuda , and then thetrunk probably took that and ported to kmd. A long time ago madbuda told me it took him 200 hrs to port the latest bitcore to Hush, it was not an easy undertaking. (He was paid $10K USD in Hush at the time to entice him to finish it). So at least Hush + KMD have addressindex

[13-Jul-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and btch has it too

[13-Jul-18 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wonder if anybody has ever used addressindex with Hush, it sure will take a long time to reindex

Hello, I'm the lead author of ERC-721 (the "Non-fungible Token Standard" or "Deeds") which is how collectable crypto-assets can work interoperability with crypto-collecting wallets.

I believe this is the technology that is implied to power MLB Crypto Baseball.

Right now I am skeptical that this project is real. First all of the news is related to ICO/blockchain news/nerd news. Can anybody point to a press release or Tweet FROM Major League Baseball that confirms this licensing deal is authentic? I have seen other crypto companies that announced a deal with Visa and Mastercard, later to find out that those companies did not actually authorize any deal.

Also the website here https://www.lucidsight.com/ [lucidsight.com] does not have a trademark symbol next to MLB Crypto Baseball. Nor does it have a registered trademark symbol next to the MLB logo. Nor does the bottom of the website say "The MLB logo is a registered trademark of Major League Baseball." So I'm going to say this is pretty much bullshit. I went to the LIMA licensing conference in Las Vegas this year -- entities like MLB don't draft rookies like Lucid Sight.

In other news, the 0xcert promo video (I'm an advisor to them) did just release a promo video listing collectable baseball cards as a target use case. So we are planning to make this work. And if MLB is reading this, call me.
