[22-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
are you getting segfaults or core dumps?

[22-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
and what is your open file limit? that could maybe have something to do with it

[22-May-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ ulimit -n
1000000
`

[22-May-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`are you getting segfaults or core dumps?`
it doesn't explicitly state segfault like other issues have, if that's what you mean

[22-May-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 run `ulimit -c unlimited` in the shell that starts komodod, and that will allow it to make `core` files, which help in debugging. Not sure if that is exactly what we need, but it's good for our debugging

[22-May-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can do `gdb komodod core`

[22-May-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then get lots of debug info, if we get a coredump

[22-May-19 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```Reading symbols from komodod...done.
//core: No such file or directory.```
So, the answer is "no, no core dumps"

[22-May-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
not yet!

[22-May-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
without setting `ulimit -c unlimited`, they won't be created at all

[22-May-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 when you say "it crashes", what is the exact behavior?

[22-May-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
a crash should make a core file

[22-May-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the exact behavior is that komodod (for KMD) is no longer running (or no longer outwardly doing anything but still running) and there's nothing happening in debug log or std out

[22-May-19 01:27 PM] cipi#4502
btw, `sudo dmesg -e` will likely show a `segfault`

[22-May-19 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, sounds like a hang

[22-May-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sometimes it hangs other times it dies

[22-May-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
now that you have ulimit -c unlimited, when it next dies, it should make a `core` file in the current directory

[22-May-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
if it's hanging

[22-May-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i would attach to that PID with gdb

[22-May-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
and look at the values of some variables with `x`

[22-May-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
when you are inspecting variables in gdb, you are reading the matrix

[22-May-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i would try to look at important variables, like block height or chain tip and see if something is corrupt. I don't know. You are swimming into the ocean and the other side can't be seen

[22-May-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
basically, every day in open source software maintenance :troll_lol:

[22-May-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 another way to play this game, is switch to different branches of KMD, see if that changes anything

[22-May-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 FSM branch is pretty stable, are you running on `dev` branch?

[22-May-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
currently dev branch, but have tried all through the hierarchy but master

[22-May-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_played that game already_

[22-May-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
lol

[22-May-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a weird issue

[22-May-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 my guess is that only your specific pool config and usage pattern is tickling this, and most full nodes don't experience this

[22-May-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is my guess

[22-May-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and for good measure, make sure `dmesg` isn't reporting HD failures and shit

[22-May-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 one of my favorite stories of why I love Git, is that Git started to freak out on an old laptop of mine. Giving me the strangest craziest internal errors you never want to see

[22-May-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
I thought I had discovered a git bug!! Was so happy

[22-May-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
Turns out, my SSD was failing and Git noticed and said wtfbbq

[22-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
My guess, is a failing HD could cause some really weird issues in KMD. Especially with full disk encryption enabled (which I did have enabled)

[22-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
imagine reading a block from disk and a few bits are flipped

[22-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
much bad such wow

[22-May-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my guess is that only your specific pool config and usage pattern`
I'm inclined to agree, but since I can't figure out what "this" is, I don't know what to alter in the pool
It's a maddening catch22

[22-May-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 maybe "bisect your config"

[22-May-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
start making your config simpler, until the bug goes away? Turn off some features?

[22-May-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not sure if that is possible, but maybe

[22-May-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
turn everything off and see if you can make the problem go away, then slowly turn features on

[22-May-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it's not the config itself, it has to be a call (or several) that's the issue

[22-May-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
can I get a tl;dr of what you're trying to do?

[22-May-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i assume that maybe this is related to calling getblocktemplate a bajillion times?

[22-May-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you can simulate what your pool is doing and trigger the issue

[22-May-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't run pools, so I am just guessing, and telling you what I would probably do

[22-May-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe there is a missing LOCK somewhere and this is a real bug, nobody knows

[22-May-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`can I get a tl;dr of what you're trying to do?`
Figure out why the crash/lock up that only you and I have ever experienced with komodod

[22-May-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and have a pool that runs for more than 4 days

[22-May-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is a rare, organic, shade-grown bug

[22-May-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
only the best Fair Trade bugs for CG

[22-May-19 01:44 PM] Alright#0419
`gdb --args ./komodod -pubkey=<pubkey> <any other args>`
wait a second 
`run`

[22-May-19 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
that doesn't work?

[22-May-19 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
need to make sure komodod *is not* running

[22-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright thanks for jumping in, my arms are tired of swimming

[22-May-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright no, that doesn't work; gdb exits back to the gdb cli command prompt and later trace returns "no stack" or similar after crash

[22-May-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yes, I'm sure that komodod isn't otherwise running after a reboot

[22-May-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
what happens to debug log when you do that?

[22-May-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
where does it end?

[22-May-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
or does it not update it at all?

[22-May-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it either ends visually as if pkill -9 was used (just stops) when komodod dies or the final entry is the one that has `ERROR: ContextualCheckBlock: contains a non-final transaction` when it hangs

[22-May-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
non-final error seems like a clue, but it could be a red herring

@jl777c @dukeleto 
`std::numeric_limits<uint32_t>::max()` could you explain what this is?

[22-May-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
joker came up with a patch that stops those bits from entirely crashing, but it hangs instead (which is the reason for needing the trace)

[22-May-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is some sort of c++ way to do 0xffffffff

[22-May-19 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have experianced the lock with mining.... it does it when I use really fast block times... IMO the lokc, for staking chains may have a bug.

[22-May-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright "largest number that will fit in a uint32"

[22-May-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the c++ way to do it

[22-May-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also what james said, it gives you the largest uint32_t possible

Simple scripts to create a Komodo assetchain using a single node for testing, inntalls **explorer** too if needed
Instructions:

- This repository automates the steps described in the doc: docs.komodoplatform.com/assetchains/create-asset-chain-single-node.html
- Assumes Ubuntu desktop environment, may need tweaks for other environments

Clone the repository and navigate into it.

Step 1:
Create a file named data and add the following contents:
```
name=<ASSETCHAIN-NAME>
srcdir=/home/<USER>/komodo/src
launch="komodod -ac_name=$name -ac_supply=10"
datadir=/home/<USER>/coinData
```
- name is the assetchain's desired name
- srcdir is the absolute location of the directory which contains komodod and komodo-cli
- launch is the custom launch parameters of the assetchain, don't include -pubkey or -addnode
- datadir is the directory to which the datadirectories of the second daemons are saved, no need to create it, the script will do it for you
Step 2
Create a file named keys and add the following contents:
```
pubkey1=02xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
pubkey2=03xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
privkey1=Uxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
privkey2=Uxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
- pubkey1 and privkey1 are a pair of keys used to launch the first daemon
- pubkey2 and privkey2 are a pair of keys used to launch the second daemon

Step 3

```
./create-assetchain.sh explorer
```

[24-May-19 06:57 AM] Mylo#8306
@gcharang this is great.  i just installed 4 explorers with no fuss on new chains.

[24-May-19 06:58 AM] Mylo#8306
i also made a mining node crash for some reason.

[24-May-19 06:58 AM] Mylo#8306
step 1. create seed node.

[24-May-19 06:58 AM] Mylo#8306
step 2. install explorer.

[24-May-19 06:58 AM] Mylo#8306
step 3, reindex seed node, no blocks

[24-May-19 06:58 AM] Mylo#8306
step 4. start mining node, crash on connect to seed

[24-May-19 06:59 AM] Mylo#8306
error message no longer in my buffer

[24-May-19 06:59 AM] Mylo#8306
not in debug.log either.

[24-May-19 07:00 AM] Mylo#8306
FSM branch too, so could be super exceptional way to make it break.

[24-May-19 08:04 AM] gcharang#6833
I think reindexing without mining blocks and before initial connection to any other node is an exceptional case
The repo: https://github.com/gcharang/create-assetchain automates it all and takes no time
it starts two daemons, takes care of their ports
optionally , installs explorer and reindexes the 1st daemon  all automatically
