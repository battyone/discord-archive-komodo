The google doc doesn't have a sheet on it. I checked already.

[13-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Unless there's a separate google doc. But the one with tokens, channels, etc., doesn't have a tab for gateways.

[13-Nov-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
setting up the gateway is quite complex

[13-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm

[13-Nov-18 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
using the gateway is much simpler

[13-Nov-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
to use the gateway, you send a deposit transaction to the gateway deposit address

[13-Nov-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this will have the amount you are depositing and also a claim vout, which just has the destination address and a txfee amount

[13-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
once you have a deposit txid from the external chain, then you make a gatewaysdeposit transaction with all the details about it. many different things and end users wont understand it

[13-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok. 

I will need the exact inputs and ouputs that a user would see in the terminal.

[13-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but once you make a gatewaysdeposit tx, then when it confirms you will do a gatewaysclaim to claim the tokens

[13-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, I'm wondering how best to approach this

[13-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
after that you use the tokens, maybe transfer them, DEX them whatever. whoever owns the token can withdraw them

[13-Nov-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the withdraw process, requires to convert the token, doing a withdraw. then the gateway nodes process it and you get coins in the withdraw address

[13-Nov-18 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
notice the deposit side, the depositor has control over the process, it is the depositors tx that gets the freely tradeable tokens into their claim address

[13-Nov-18 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
for withdraw, you need to wait for the deposit address custodians to do an automated multisig withdraw

[13-Nov-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is best to describe things at a high level first, as realistically there will need to be automated GUI/TUI to do the gatewaysdeposit tx

[13-Nov-18 06:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, that is a much more digestible explanation...

Do we expect a dApp developer to want documentation for this? 

Or is it just a CC-level developer that will want it?

[13-Nov-18 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we would want to have various implementations of code that uses the gateway, in different languages

[13-Nov-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so the dapp developer could then issue the deposit, generate the gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim tx on the external coin -> token side and a withdraw on the token -> external coin side of things

[13-Nov-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
being able to automatically tokensize external crypto is quite useful

[13-Nov-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
setting up the gateway is a whole different involved thing that is of interest to those that want to setup a gateway for a specific coin for their chain

[13-Nov-18 06:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
how deep do you think I need to go in this documentation that's streamlined for new devs?

[13-Nov-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
dapp devs or core CC devs?

[13-Nov-18 06:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
dapp devs

[13-Nov-18 06:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
not core cc's

[13-Nov-18 06:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not working on the latter -- too far over my head

[13-Nov-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
just the general usage and maybe we can use tonyL TUI as an example of how to use it

[13-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, let's do that. We'll just have an explanation for how to use an existing gateway that's made available to them, and then have a link to some other documentation that teaches how to set one up from scratch, and mention that it's more challenging.

Does that work?

[13-Nov-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
sure

[13-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[13-Nov-18 07:46 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Hey all!

[13-Nov-18 07:46 PM] IndieBlock#3081
I am back ^

[13-Nov-18 08:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hey!

[13-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@IndieBlock 

The people you will want to talk with to get started are @dukeleto @emma @jl777c @ca333, @TonyL, @blackjok3r, @Alright, and a few others.

JL777 has put together a good documentation guide to get core CC developers started.

[13-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's the link.

What is it you're trying to do?

[13-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Read through that and that should get you the basic idea. 

From there, JL777 is the lead, but if you can find others who can help, it's good to involve them, so we don't use too much of his time.

[13-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright, @IndieBlock is looking to see if he can write the Auction CC.

[13-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, very cool. Are you familiar with C/C++?

[13-Nov-18 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus there is a step by step gateways guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/gateways/scenarios/tutorial.html

[13-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I have it, thank you.

[13-Nov-18 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui aslo there is a TUI (possible to setup gateway for a minute or so https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWs7YLWVk3E - atm gatewaysbind implemented but not on video)
User part (deposits/withdrawals) is under re-working atm

@TonyL 

I don't have another node available at the moment.

[13-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you are able to create one of those tabs in the google doc that has all of the rpc calls and all of their full responses, that would be great.

[13-Nov-18 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm there is a other parts in gateways setup needed (like a an oraclefeed dAPP) but list with only gatewaysCC RPC calls maybe useful as well yep

[13-Nov-18 08:30 PM] IndieBlock#3081

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

For the documentation I'm working on, do you think it would be better that I just take the step-by-step from the gateways documnetation and put it in? Or should I just do the unique rpc calls for gateways, and link to that step-by-step elsewhere?

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've never used it, and don't have the hardware at the moment to do so.

[13-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(Laptop is in an in-between state while changing operating systems, and is currently unusable.)

[13-Nov-18 08:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually only RPC calls don't have much sense since you anyway need to create oracle, create and to convert token only for bind gateway

[13-Nov-18 08:52 PM] TonyL#3577
But RPC calls needs to be documented anyway

[13-Nov-18 08:56 PM] IndieBlock#3081
^^ To clarify ide be happy to work on the Auction CC just reading documentation and picking around in repositories ^

[13-Nov-18 08:57 PM] IndieBlock#3081
bare with will jump back in when ready.

[13-Nov-18 08:57 PM] IndieBlock#3081
who was it that said they would work on a design?

[13-Nov-18 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
me

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Brilliant happy to work with you on this then üòÉ

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
there are two main types of auctions that need to be supported

[13-Nov-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
one for the nonfungible tokens, which have a supply of 1

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
another would be for the ICO type of scenario where there are X amount of tokens for sale

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
there would be an auctioncreate rpc call to start the auction and based on its opreturn parameters, people can lock funds to bid

[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Ill get a spec written/drawn up with the details you give me then you can confirm etc.

[13-Nov-18 09:04 PM] IndieBlock#3081
then ill work to that ^

[13-Nov-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
cancel to unlock the funds and at the end of the auction either get back their losing bid or whatever they bid on

[13-Nov-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
something like that

[13-Nov-18 09:04 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Sounds fairly straight forward.

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, once you are familiar with how to lock/unlock funds in the CC context

[13-Nov-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know when you are ready for more details

[13-Nov-18 09:34 PM] IndieBlock#3081
No problems

[14-Nov-18 12:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

I'm working through the tutorial, cleaning it up etc. I will include it in the new streamlined docs. 

I will still need you to document every rpc call available on the gateways contract, with a description of what it does, and a full example of its use, and the full returned value in the terminal.

[14-Nov-18 01:04 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus added it to to-do list üëå

The streamlined documentation is almost complete:

Please review.

Also, if you've visited this before, make sure to clear your web browser's cache, as the temporary website I'm using doesn't do a good job of updating.

Developers, if you can please start using this and pointing out errors, that would be great. It just needs to be proof read and spot checked.

@IndieBlock 

Keep in mind, the notary node elections come up again at the end of Q1 2019.

Notary nodes are elected by an ecosystem-wide stake-weighted vote, and vote are typically cast in favor of engaged and contributing developers, such as yourself!

For their services, notary nodes receive a mining advantage on the KMD main chain.

let me know if you have questions or would like to run.

[14-Nov-18 07:31 PM] IndieBlock#3081

@IndieBlock stop by #kmdlabs when you have some time, we're doing some cool things. I made a chat dapp, @blackjok3r made "streamer" chains which allow permission chains for streaming arbitrary files, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator made a dapp that tracks his dog via GPS and posts location data on chain via oracles
