[15-Oct-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
can you link to one?

[15-Oct-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
sendtoaddress is building txs with 0 fee?

[15-Oct-18 02:08 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@Alright

[15-Oct-18 02:09 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I think better point NN to create tx with 0 fees

[15-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
you did that with sendtoaddress?

[15-Oct-18 02:09 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
no, with spv wallet

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but guess should be doable with sendtoaddress

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
what spv wallet?

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
agama?

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ours

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
pungo

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
is it an electrum desktop app fork?

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
pungo wallet

[15-Oct-18 02:10 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
android one

[15-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
Ahh, I'll have to try it out

[15-Oct-18 02:11 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
on google play

[15-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
to make sendtoaddress do 0 fee txs, I think you need to source code fork

[15-Oct-18 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
or just not use it and use createrawtransaction instead

[15-Oct-18 02:12 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm well guess its done via electrum tx signature

[15-Oct-18 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have invited our latest 51% attacker here, everybody be nice!!!

[15-Oct-18 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not sure if they will show up, but they were invited: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1051836608268226560

forkwitch could very well be one of our own

[15-Oct-18 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
i won't say who my guess is 😉

[15-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jorian#4555
but he seems confident

[15-Oct-18 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
"dpow is flawed by design" is a pretty strong statement

[15-Oct-18 02:12 PM] jorian#4555
indeed

[15-Oct-18 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
back in the old days, you would get an email, or a patch, or a Github Issue, or Pull Request

[15-Oct-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
but now it's an attack livestream

[15-Oct-18 02:13 PM] jorian#4555
at least we are getting attention

[15-Oct-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
and they use the #devsfixyourcoins hash tag, and I am wondering "Have you ever submitted a bug report?"

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
it sure is hunting season for small PoW coins

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am waiting for the metasploit and nmap addon modules

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
then we have reached plaid

@geocold51 @KomodoPlatform i gonna present to you on oct 17 without nicehash
Twitter

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
he is using 3 7's in the time the stream goes live

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] jorian#4555
_checks current date_

[15-Oct-18 02:14 PM] jorian#4555
that's in 2 days! 🍿

[15-Oct-18 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
this person might have some "beef" with James, or just a good humor

[15-Oct-18 02:15 PM] jorian#4555
```4:14 PM] dukeleto: he is using 3 7's in the time the stream goes live``` yes, saw that too. he knows a thing or two

[15-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The irony of '#notasocialmediawhore' and livestreaming such claims makes me giggle, though 😁

[15-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>I'm not a social media whore, I just play one one the interwebz

@forkwitch

[15-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think I saw them post that tweet earlier

[15-Oct-18 02:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
what if it's one of our own that wants to play it up so that it fails and looks good for Komodo? :mindblown:

[15-Oct-18 02:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
eager to find out what the "without nicehash" is all about 🤔

[15-Oct-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
me too, I could use a few extra blocks this week 😛

[15-Oct-18 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Witch is female or male? 
I would call this attacker her/she

[15-Oct-18 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Based on username

[15-Oct-18 03:15 PM] PTYX#6840
Warlock is male

[15-Oct-18 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
No offence

[15-Oct-18 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
The attacker is probably a "they" or a "shim"

{Reactions}
😂 😝 

[15-Oct-18 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto  I saw this instead of PR or bug report
but the situation has exhausted itself as I understood

We never know

[15-Oct-18 03:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see it’s new Twitter account

[15-Oct-18 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
From my point of view it was 51% f-word attack

[15-Oct-18 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Made just for that attack announcement?

[15-Oct-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my rule of thumb:
Everyone on the interwebz is a dude until video proves otherwise

[15-Oct-18 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will not follow that rule 😂

[15-Oct-18 03:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anyway important thing is attack and our tech, instead of gender

[15-Oct-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Waits for $1B attack bounty rather than twatter "fame" to even try

[15-Oct-18 03:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
@TonyL so you believe forkwitch is geocold or weren't aware of new attacker?
i was actually thinking it might be geocold coming back abiding to the 'getting permission' that everyone was telling him in #talk-trading 
something like "i figured out how to attack dPOW and i don't even need nicehash..."

[15-Oct-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't see both being the same person, prior actions vs new claims

[15-Oct-18 03:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't know. Just hope that everybody will happy in the end and no stress 😃

[15-Oct-18 03:25 PM] TonyL#3577
#safespace

[15-Oct-18 03:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Beef or not, I value this attack if it proves to work. more work for team to do to improve

your cant reorg past a notarisation, and I am quite sure that even if you fill the blocks, so that the notarisation cant get confirmed (and thus applied) it will just skip the queue.

[15-Oct-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and be applied

[15-Oct-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to prevent dPoW working in all cases is ver expensive

[15-Oct-18 03:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
What if attacker can afford expensive? 🧐🤔

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what economic incentevie do they have to do so ?

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
@blackjok3r what's your take on the "without nicehash"?

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is no gain, except demonstration

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Probably just attack chips

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

{Reactions}
😂 abusedsmily 

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
the attacker said "token" so perhaps they are planning to attack an asset chain

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
oh

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Which chain will be attacked?

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that too... I mine most AC with like 0.5 sol ...

[15-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any GPU would destroy that

[15-Oct-18 03:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, some of them have a big lag, so...

[15-Oct-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but still, you cant reorg past a notarisation ... Alright tested this a LOT ... I have helped him on staked chains, even with just 6 notary nodes.

[15-Oct-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once one has happened... thats it

[15-Oct-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but t has to have happened.

[15-Oct-18 03:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
"KMD and the runtime forks" - are runtime forks the assetchains?  brain-freeze

[15-Oct-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Oct-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
many things are posible with KMD run time forks

[15-Oct-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are the coolest

[15-Oct-18 03:38 PM] snowdamn#2414
awesome, they're included in the upcoming betterment! 🍾

[15-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Patziggy#9371
As a non-developer I love learning what I can from you guys. You always have super informative and helpful discussions! Does anyone have info regarding run time forks and what benefits they offer to the ecosystem? Thanks in advance, friends 😄

[15-Oct-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
a runtime fork is an independent chain that uses the same komodod binary

[15-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
coins like VRSC and PIRATE are just two such

[15-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC's lead dev already integrated sapling among half a dozen other technical advances and this codebase will come back so it will then be available to the other runtime forks

[15-Oct-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is an all zaddr chain and it is getting an external infrastructure in place to support all zaddr environments and once that is done other coins in the ecosystem benefit

[15-Oct-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
each new project in the ecosystem adds some unique value and the entire ecosystem then gets the benefit of this directly or indirectly

[15-Oct-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is called ecosytem for a reason

[15-Oct-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
we have many coins that are mining coins, that creates a group of miners in the community, who when asked have helped chains that got diff stranded to get back to normal difficulty

[15-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I could go on and on and on
