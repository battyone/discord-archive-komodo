is there a preferred OS to build kmd apps ? Or can I also run everything on OSX ?

Hey everyone, kind of new here. Are paid projects a thing here at all? Any ideas who to talk to / places to visit?

[13-Sep-19 09:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@chrissound maybe speak to  @Angelina to see if there is any position openings for Komodo.

[14-Sep-19 06:25 AM] redp1ll#3268
Quick question guys: apart from the dPOW protection and setting up nodes, launching Smart Chains is completely for free, correct?

[14-Sep-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can do it on your own, then correct

[14-Sep-19 06:44 AM] redp1ll#3268
I see, thanks

[14-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey

[14-Sep-19 09:56 AM] redp1ll#3268
is it possible to dynamically increase payment size and number of payments in a channel as needed? Or is it necessary to open a new channel with allocation once a channel is exhausted?

[14-Sep-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
You’ll need to open new channel with different capacity and denomination if needed

[14-Sep-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
If I’ve understood correct that’s your question is related to channelsCC 🙂

[14-Sep-19 10:58 AM] redp1ll#3268
yes exactly,  thanks for the answer

[14-Sep-19 11:36 AM] redp1ll#3268
I've opened a payments channel and it has 61 confirmations but i still get this return when trying to send a payment:

[14-Sep-19 11:36 AM] redp1ll#3268
"result": "error",
"error": "channelsopen tx not yet confirmed/notarized"

[14-Sep-19 11:36 AM] redp1ll#3268
any ideas?

[14-Sep-19 12:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
confirmations but no notarizations?

[14-Sep-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
channels without notarization needs 100 blocks, unless you built with TESTMODE

{Reactions}
👍 

[14-Sep-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
61 confs should mean notarized if dpowconfs are in use, unless you are quoting raw confs from an explorer

[14-Sep-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@redp1ll the most costly part of starting and running Smart Chains is having the knowledge or paying people with the knowledge. We are not like other projects that try to tax you in every way for using our stuff, gas costs and chain creation fees and all kinds of scammy stuff

[14-Sep-19 01:45 PM] redp1ll#3268
@dukeleto  I've got no notarization activated so need to mine 100 blocks then. Is the fastest way to generate blocks to just send txs to myself as it's an on demand blockchain?

[14-Sep-19 01:47 PM] redp1ll#3268
@dukeleto I think it's an awesome and very refreshing approach that you guys have. One of the things that sets this ecosystem apart from the competition and I'm sure it will pay off in the future

[14-Sep-19 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@redp1ll yes, the normal way is to always have 2 nodes, one seed node and another peer that is mining. You are using a new feature that allows doing it one one node. You should use `setgenerate` to turn mining on

@Sentrail Ask your questions here dude

[16-Sep-19 12:13 PM] Sentrail#6141
Hello there, i was wondering. We have created a possible blockchain using 2 ubuntu servers. How can i see if they have linked to each other? for now my 2 servers has given me 2 outputs :
Server 1 [Static] : [1] 3584
Server 2 : [1] 31958

@Sentrail `getpeerinfo`

[16-Sep-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STRIKETWODEMO getpeerinfo`

[16-Sep-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
will show all peers and their IP's and some metadata about them

[16-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Sentrail#6141
well, im definitely doing something wrong because console didnt found the command

[16-Sep-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=STRIKETWODEMO getpeerinfo`

[16-Sep-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sentrail try that

[16-Sep-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
the initial `./` is important

[16-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Sentrail#6141
Nothing on either servers

[16-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Sentrail#6141
:c

[16-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Mylo#8306
```
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodo-cli -ac_name=STRIKETWODEMO getpeerinfo
```

Your screenshot earlier shows you are in `~/komodo` directory, however the executable `komodo-cli` is in the `~/komodo/src` dir

[16-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Mylo#8306
`getinfo` will also show the number of connections.  Likely to be 1 when both your seed and 2nd node are connected to each other

[16-Sep-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 1st 3 questions would be:
is it running on 165.22.197.198?
does 165.22.197.198 have open ports?
can you ping 165.22.197.198?

did you run zcutil/build.sh first?

[16-Sep-19 01:53 PM] Sentrail#6141
Nope, Going to do that now

[16-Sep-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you're working with raw source code, you always need to compile it before 1st run or after any code edits (otherwise there's no executable *to* run)

[16-Sep-19 02:04 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okay im back

[16-Sep-19 02:05 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I'm now going to assist @Sentrail

[16-Sep-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sentrail make sure you have 4GB of RAM or it will likely fail in weird ways

[16-Sep-19 02:16 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
ohw

[16-Sep-19 02:16 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
well we can scale its ok

[16-Sep-19 02:20 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
resizing now

[16-Sep-19 02:25 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
note: @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 The build.sh script is now working even though I changed nothing (another fresh server)

[16-Sep-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is the error?

[16-Sep-19 02:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I think the connection was indeed down

[16-Sep-19 02:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
or something

[16-Sep-19 02:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I have no idea :S but its the exact same server (digital ocean) just a fresh one

[16-Sep-19 02:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
afraid I have failed to learn from that error :/

[16-Sep-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I think the connection was indeed down`
well, if it cannot download the dependencies, then there's nothing that can be done to "fix" it aside from fixing the connection issue(s)

[16-Sep-19 02:29 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Yup

[16-Sep-19 02:29 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339

You're the first person that I've ever met who lives in Arkansas. 😄

there aren't many of us 😛

[16-Sep-19 02:30 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
when its all up and runnin, do you have a guide how I can send money etc?

[16-Sep-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure if there is anyone that wrote a guide or not, but the `help` function is a good place to start
`komodo-cli -ac_name=SOMENAME help`
will give you a list of all of the features/functions and
`komodo-cli -ac_name=SOMENAME help some_function_name_here`
will give you specific details and examples for that thing

There's a good number of folks around that don't use their given name too often

[16-Sep-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And there's a large number of projects, so sometimes it makes it hard to follow/remember who's who

[16-Sep-19 03:40 PM] Sentrail#6141
one small question. It appears that executing the getpeerinfo are missing my conf files. while i do have them. where do you actually store the komodo.conf file?

{Reactions}
👌 

[16-Sep-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810

looks like you dont have peers

The weird part is, on my first server i get "error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)" and on my second server i recieve :

maybe you wiped the COIN.conf file? sounds like it can't talk to the daemon
