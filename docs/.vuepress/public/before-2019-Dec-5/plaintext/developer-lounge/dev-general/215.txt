@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how to clean komodo

[08-Sep-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the easiest way is to just delete the dir and reclone it

[08-Sep-19 03:25 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Deleted User i want to use bridge to setup 2node

[08-Sep-19 03:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can do on single node also, using -datadir launch param

[08-Sep-19 03:27 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ok i have exist the daily limit so i need to do it tomorrow.

still will need enough ram to build tho

[08-Sep-19 03:28 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator yes i need to use vps

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 daily limit 1.5gb data

[08-Sep-19 03:29 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 mean

[08-Sep-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, with that limit it will take you 2+ days to get the chain data if you run KMD

[08-Sep-19 03:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
syncing the chain takes 10+gb, will take you a week

[08-Sep-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess it depends on what he's doing (zcashparams alone is more than 1 day with that rate)

my code needs a bit of work to support chains with sprout joinsplits, then it can be merged to kmd

since Hush doesn't have those, it's not very interesting to me

👌 

[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush only needs to download 49.5MB of files to start syncing, but actually, we embed it in our Git repo

[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also in our binary zips, and our GUI wallets look for it locally

[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
so basically, Hush has 0 download requirements before syncing 😎

How to fork komodo

[08-Sep-19 04:16 PM] bartwr#6773
@pandaanu73 It's all in the docs. On Windows you build `komodod` like this: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html#windows You don't fork Komodo, but you'll use komodod to launch your own blockchain.

Make sure you have at least 4G of memory.

[08-Sep-19 04:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@bartwr yes in window i have 4gb. Of ram

[08-Sep-19 04:26 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@pandaanu73 why i need to fetch zcash parameters if i need to build smart chain

[08-Sep-19 04:27 PM] bartwr#6773
@pandaanu73  For now you need it. If you can't do this, you can ask a company to launch your chain for you. This will cost money, but will spare you time.

[08-Sep-19 04:29 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@bartwr but in doc there noted no need to download blocks to build smart chain

[08-Sep-19 04:30 PM] bartwr#6773
@pandaanu73 Downloading blocks is something else. If you want a blockchain, you'll create & download blocks. That's the core concept blockchains.

[08-Sep-19 04:31 PM] bartwr#6773
@pandaanu73 You'll need to fetch zcash parameters because that's the way the build process now works. After succesfully making a build of the komodo deamon, you are able to both create blockchains with ZCash-like private transactions, as well as public blockchains like Bitcoin.

[08-Sep-19 04:32 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@bartwr but fetch zcash taking lots of time

[08-Sep-19 04:33 PM] bartwr#6773
True. Still, it's needed to launch your own blockchain using `komodod` yourself 😉

[08-Sep-19 04:33 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@bartwr ok

[08-Sep-19 04:34 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Do any idea to fetch the compile version

hey guys, does it make sense to start playing around with antara on Windows or is it easier with a Linux VM?

[09-Sep-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
linux is always better

[09-Sep-19 07:57 AM] redp1ll#3268
got it. what`s the main difference between them in the context of the komodo environment? would I use the komodod.exe (and cli) the same way via cmd as in the Linux terminal?

[09-Sep-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes they act the same, or should do. Just linux is much faster... I use a VM for all my testing, even though I run native linux. If something goes wrong its contained.

[09-Sep-19 08:04 AM] redp1ll#3268
I understand. I might use Windows for starting out then and if I run  into speed issues switch to a VM for testing..

can I use a Raspberry pi as second device (node) to create a smart chain?

[09-Sep-19 08:14 AM] redp1ll#3268
the RPi 3B+ only has 1GB RAM, not enough, is it?

[09-Sep-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yopu can use `-testnode=1 ` to just use 1 node

hi guys, after building the komodo deamon on linux there is no komodod in the komodo/src folder.. any ideas?

if there are no errors, then check your permissions for the dir

guys, could you confirm something? As far as I am aware Agama was discontinued. My questions is: If I want to build a branded wallet with over 200 assets for any OS via Komodo today, can I ? (I know that there is Agama still on github, but I would be looking for a more ready to go solution)

@redp1ll we don't recommend running  the regtest mode to test KMD for most cases

@redp1ll regtest mode is good for testing KMD internals itself, but if you want to play around with your own test coin, follow the directions above. If you truly want to mess with regtest stuff, give me a holla'. It's a bit wild westy but the scotch is good

[10-Sep-19 10:20 AM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto does the accrued rewards work on regtest ?

[10-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
probably works, but there are block height triggers you would need to lower to activate it

@redp1ll zaddrs do not work correctly on regtest, most other things should work

[10-Sep-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 interest only applies to chains with `KMD` as their ticker

[10-Sep-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 so, not by default, but if you made a regtest chain *called* `KMD`, it might try to do interest stuff

if you have `docker` installed, you can just type `docker run -i -t -p 127.0.0.1:9253:9253 komodocakeshop/dev-allinone-learn-kmd` and it will drop you to a shell with all necessary kmd & zcash-params stuff in a 2GB download precompiled.   then type `learn-kmd` and you will have a text interface to create chains, or just use the command line as normal.

[10-Sep-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty cool

[10-Sep-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo if it interested you, i could help you make a pure-sapling version of that, which only needs 50MB of sapling downloads, and would only support pure-sapling chains

if it's just for creating your own blockchain to test, it fits the bill perfectly because the other 1.5GB is wasted for tinkering
