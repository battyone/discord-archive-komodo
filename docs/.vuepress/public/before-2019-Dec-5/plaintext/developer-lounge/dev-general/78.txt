which is why i always forget to fiddle that dumb table, and have pulled hair out for hours on that same error message

[05-Dec-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
so that is why it's very familiar to me :abusedsmily:

[05-Dec-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
can anybody get z_importkey to work when specifying what height to rescan from?

[05-Dec-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it works for me from curl, but I couldnt get it to work from cli

[05-Dec-18 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should add the height to importprivkey while your at it 😉 there is no technical reason it cannot be there...

[05-Dec-18 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c have you tested with sprout and sapling addrs? they are different codepaths, i think

[05-Dec-18 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
i know that Zcash upstream has had problems in the past with not updating the correct number of RPC args in some *import* RPCs

[05-Dec-18 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
perhaps the latest merge with 2.0.2 did something like that

[05-Dec-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it kept giving parse errors.

[05-Dec-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
since curl worked i didnt spend too much time on it

[05-Dec-18 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c did you get `JSON error is not integer as expected` ?

[05-Dec-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
error: Error JSON:yes

[05-Dec-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
kcli -ac_name=RKT z_importkey secret-extended-key-... yes 10000

[05-Dec-18 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i am looking at latest KMD FSM branch, is that correct?

[05-Dec-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
FSM is latest

[05-Dec-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i changed yes to true, now it says: JSON value is not a string as expected

[05-Dec-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
tried: "{\"rescan\":true}"

[05-Dec-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
I just make all args to my rpc as strings

[05-Dec-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c what about `kcli -ac_name=RKT z_importkey secret-extended-key-... "yes" 10000`

[05-Dec-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
error: Error JSON:yes

[05-Dec-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, same

[05-Dec-18 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, i see a bit what is going on

[05-Dec-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
{ "z_importkey", 2 },
it is trying to convert it

[05-Dec-18 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
```    // Whether to perform rescan after import
    bool fRescan = true;
    bool fIgnoreExistingKey = true;
    if (params.size() > 1) {
        auto rescan = params[1].get_str();
        if (rescan.compare("whenkeyisnew") != 0) {
            fIgnoreExistingKey = false;
            if (rescan.compare("yes") == 0) {
                fRescan = true;
            } else if (rescan.compare("no") == 0) {
                fRescan = false;
            } else {
                // Handle older API
                UniValue jVal;
                if (!jVal.read(std::string("[")+rescan+std::string("]")) ||
                    !jVal.isArray() || jVal.size()!=1 || !jVal[0].isBool()) {
                    throw JSONRPCError(
                        RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER,
                        "rescan must be \"yes\", \"no\" or \"whenkeyisnew\"");
                }
                fRescan = jVal[0].getBool();
            }
        }
    }```

[05-Dec-18 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
`auto rescan` is not something I see in KMD codebase a lot, i think that is the line that is failing

[05-Dec-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be in an array

[05-Dec-18 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think some kind of c++ auto-conversion is adding to the problem

[05-Dec-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
older API is that JSON stuff, but newer api is what you are trying to tell it

[05-Dec-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
`get_str()` is failing on params[1]

[05-Dec-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c it's arg 1, isn't it?

[05-Dec-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
0 is privkey, 1 is rescan

[05-Dec-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the second one, yes

[05-Dec-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see this: ```   { "z_importkey", 1 },
    { "z_importkey", 2 },
```

[05-Dec-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
in the conversion array

[05-Dec-18 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
so argument 1 and 2 are converted

[05-Dec-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it the conversion the problem?

[05-Dec-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was in my case .. I just added my RPC there with 1 for param 1 and now it works Thanks 😃

[05-Dec-18 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c look at z_importviewingkey. It does not convert the rescan argument

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
it only does `{ "z_importviewingkey", 2 },` in the conversion table

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c my guess is to remove the `1` entry from the conversion table, but i haven't looked into git history to see why it's that way

[05-Dec-18 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
perhaps it changes upstream and that didn't get pulled in

[05-Dec-18 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
whenever i am in doubt, i see how a working rpc declares it's arguments and parses them

[05-Dec-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i am compiling/testing a potential patch now

Weren't these the guys who forked KMD and had no clue of how the notary nodes worked, nor did they audit the code they used?

[05-Dec-18 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Then blamed KMD for "maliciously attacking" the chain when really, they were dismissing the warnings from KMD and ignoring the statements, calling them attacks.

That's how I saw it all go down back then.

[05-Dec-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes 🙄

[05-Dec-18 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Well they're working on dPoW 😛

[05-Dec-18 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[05-Dec-18 05:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Let's let them screw that up on their own yea?

[05-Dec-18 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they're also the guys that **still** refuse to admit that their entire chain can be stuffed up with a 30 line bash script 💤

[05-Dec-18 05:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A bunch of clowns was all I took them for when it all unfolded.

[05-Dec-18 05:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Angry and defensive over nothing

[05-Dec-18 05:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bitter and retalitory

[05-Dec-18 05:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they blame komodo for what I did but claim what I did can't be done

[05-Dec-18 05:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes, some KMD people mined your chain with notary powers.

[05-Dec-18 05:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You all didn't listen and someone proved you wrong

[05-Dec-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and they confuse a split funds with a notarization

[05-Dec-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but its safe to trust them that they can do BTC notarizations for free

`splitfund` that's where you take 2 SAFE and turn it into 1 SAFE and 1 SAFE, right? :trollface:
