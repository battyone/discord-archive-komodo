[09-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Emilis#3454
you mean the getbalance call?

[09-Jan-19 10:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
for example yes

[09-Jan-19 10:53 PM] Emilis#3454
that call doesn't really work for me, as with my implementation I'm not going to use the actual wallet on the daemon, but rather provide my privkey where needed (signrawtransaction)

[09-Jan-19 11:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Emilis are you sure you are running the CLI/RPC against the correct coin?

[09-Jan-19 11:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
you must give `-ac_name=COIN`

[09-Jan-19 11:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
or it assumes KMD

[09-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Emilis#3454
Yeah, it's on a separate port and getinfo shows the exact correct current height

[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't fully understand your setup

[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] Emilis#3454
app -> komodod

[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] Emilis#3454
via RPC

[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you say you have an address, which has utxos, confirmed by an explorer

[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but local RPC says no utxos?

[09-Jan-19 11:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, which explorer. Various kmd pools and maybe some explorers are on forks

[09-Jan-19 11:02 PM] Emilis#3454
Yes. This address is not in the wallet.dat, however. I don't know if that would be an issue for listunspent

[09-Jan-19 11:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it is

[09-Jan-19 11:02 PM] Emilis#3454
Ah, so it has to be one of the wallets in wallet.dat

[09-Jan-19 11:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
listunspent only tells you about utxos of addresses that the local node has privkey for

[09-Jan-19 11:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
except for watch-only addresses, which are special

[09-Jan-19 11:03 PM] Emilis#3454
Right, right. Thanks 😃

[09-Jan-19 11:03 PM] Emilis#3454
One more thing though

[09-Jan-19 11:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
you could watch the address, then local node could see some stuff

[09-Jan-19 11:04 PM] Emilis#3454
I've been biting my head off trying to find docs for this (even on btc docs), but for P2PKH, I don't understand what hash it's supposed to be hashed with. Ripemd160? sha256-double and then ripemd160? Any idea?

[09-Jan-19 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
hash160, most likely, that is what all btc address stuff uses

[09-Jan-19 11:06 PM] Emilis#3454
Right, thanks 😃 I'll try that

[09-Jan-19 11:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
use the internal hash160 functions, which is ripemd160(sha256(x)), iirc

How can I test sending transaction?

[10-Jan-19 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"an original"?

[10-Jan-19 11:28 AM] psd#8786
I thought BEER and PIZZA is like token

[10-Jan-19 11:28 AM] psd#8786
Is it right?

no

[10-Jan-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
assetchains are runtime forks and their own individual chains, not tokens

[10-Jan-19 11:30 AM] psd#8786
I understand, thanks. Where can I get BEER or PIZZA?

[10-Jan-19 11:30 AM] psd#8786

[10-Jan-19 11:32 AM] psd#8786
Do I need to use the same public and private address?

[10-Jan-19 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
public addys start with R and priv addys start with z
they are different creatures

[10-Jan-19 11:35 AM] psd#8786
No, I said is it the same for mainnet and for BEER (or PIZZA)?

[10-Jan-19 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can use the same key/addy for any chain, but you have to export/import the key
there is no "central key" that's automatically across all chains without importing

[10-Jan-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER getnewaddress
RVVFaexpASLVirWk33je4MU5phZW4JUNyr

$ komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER dumpprivkey RVVFaexpASLVirWk33je4MU5phZW4JUNyr
UuFPD7wAZd8dznn72e46hp6gUfpQANSmsh4XYbUJYFsNjunRFJSB

$ komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA importprivkey UuFPD7wAZd8dznn72e46hp6gUfpQANSmsh4XYbUJYFsNjunRFJSB "" true```
Like that, if those were real

[10-Jan-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There is no "mainnet" and "testnet" in Komodo
All chains are live and BEER and PIZZA are assetchains that are used as test chains because they carry the same functionality and will never have any cost/exchange value

[10-Jan-19 12:12 PM] psd#8786
I've sent a transaction. 
And I also need to check claiming. But faucet doesn't work

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 As I know for claiming we need an input with 10 coins

only the KMD chain carries rewards

[10-Jan-19 12:21 PM] psd#8786
And I can't test it on BEER or PIZZA chain?

[10-Jan-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, but there's nothing to really "test" since it's consensus code and automatic

[10-Jan-19 12:24 PM] psd#8786
I wanted to test my transaction builder in a light wallet

[10-Jan-19 12:24 PM] psd#8786
I've already lost about 20 KMD 😃

[10-Jan-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As far as the rewards go, as long as you have it creating a valid locktime your creation template will carry over to KMD

[10-Jan-19 12:32 PM] psd#8786
Ok. I think I've fixed that bug. I'll try it on mainnet

Hi, does for example this explorer https://kmdexplorer.io/ have public API ?
My explorer somehow ended up on a splitted chain and it did not correct itself and tricks with invalidating blocks did not work. So I am reindexing completely but having a quite a few crashes

Any reason why I even ended up on a different chain?  Like it started somewhere between blocks 1175600-1175650 and I managed to have like 100 different blocks later but then I guess noone was mining the chain

[14-Jan-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there was a small fork that happened when we were updating the chain

Sorry for asking again. Is there a simple way to get Komodo address(Rxxx...) from pubkey (starts with 02 or 03). I am looking for a script/ RPC call to komodod or marketmaker/A website that has the converter

[17-Jan-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
base58(60 & rmd160(sha256(pubkey)))

[17-Jan-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but it does seem hard to find. one way is if you think you know the address, validateaddress

[17-Jan-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess another way is -pubkey=02.....

[17-Jan-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and then make a sendtoaddress transaction. the change will go to the pubkey address.

[17-Jan-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, do any of the <CC>address rpc calls, it will display the various addresses associated with the pubkey

[17-Jan-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah thats perfect thanks!

[17-Jan-19 07:23 AM] Alright#0419
@gcharang can give you a python script to do it if that helps
