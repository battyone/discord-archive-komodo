in the blockchain community, everything is default trustless. You need to specify if you a service is exiting the security of the trustless blockchain consensus to use traditional trusted infrastructure like a bank.

[22-Mar-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
when there is a publisher of data, it seems pretty clear there is a single publisher of that data?

[22-Mar-19 04:17 PM] zack#6467
Why would a person use a blockchain for a trusted application anyway?
Just use a normal centralized service. then they accept USD.

[22-Mar-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you are agreeing that "data publisher" means it isnt trustless by default

[22-Mar-19 04:18 PM] zack#6467
the nash equlibrium is for the trusted data provider to steal the money.
A trusted oracle using cryptocurrency is a scammers dream come true.

[22-Mar-19 04:18 PM] MyName#0491
` then they accept USD.`
seems someone missed the memo on the entire point of crypto**currency**

[22-Mar-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there was a demand from people that wanted to post data onchain, that url I posted talks about it. it is a random google search result and nothing directly to do with us

[22-Mar-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so how do these trustless oracles achieve the trustlessness without starting with data that is of unknown quality?

[22-Mar-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the oracles CC creates a data market where subscribers can prepay for some data

[22-Mar-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if they like the quality of data, they would continue to prepay, if they dont, they would stop

[22-Mar-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
at scale, this would create a trustless data source as the bad data providers wouldnt get continued payments. the payments we are talking about are of very small value, as these are on application specific chains. enough to cover server costs of a month, if a month of data is provided

[22-Mar-19 04:28 PM] zack#6467
creating a trustful tool on the blockchain is so easy.
I could create a blockchain where you email me your contracts, and then I make on-chain signatures to say the result of each contract.
If I called that a "smart contract blockchain to compete with ethereum", you can see how that would be a scam, right?
I could do this with bitcoin today, but we don't call bitcoin a "smart contract platform to compete with ethereum".

So why can't you see that building a centralized version of oracles on blockchains, and advertising them as an equivalent alternative to the trustless ones, is also a scam?

[22-Mar-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using the definition of oracle to mean getting offchain data onchain

[22-Mar-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we are not claiming trustless oracles are magically created

[22-Mar-19 04:30 PM] zack#6467
and I am using the definition of "smart contract" to mean that Bob runs your contract and signs the result to the blockchain.
This is the old joke of "Bobchain". 
A centralized blockchain where one guy signs over the results of every transaction sent to him.

[22-Mar-19 04:30 PM] MyName#0491
Core fanboy needs to use the word "scam" more often, that's just not enough

[22-Mar-19 04:32 PM] zack#6467
A lot of people have dedicated so much effort into the game theory of blockchain oracles.
To claim that a trusted feed is equivalent is insulting.

[22-Mar-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
can you explain how the trustless oracles go from having no data of any type at all to having a trustless oracle level of data?

[22-Mar-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
when did I claim it was equivalent???

[22-Mar-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
you say we make claims we dont make and then say the claims we didnt make are not true

[22-Mar-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
can you answer how trustless oracles can be created without any data at all? as that is what you seem to be saying

[22-Mar-19 04:33 PM] zack#6467
trustless oracle without data? no idea what you are talking about.

[22-Mar-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise, the data starts out as not trustless, then some consensus logic is applied to it and a trustless data stream can be extracted from ut

[22-Mar-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
you said it was impossible to make a trustless oracle if any of the data is trusted

[22-Mar-19 04:34 PM] zack#6467
Are you trying to give an explanation for why you are advertising Komodo's trusted feed as if it was an oracle?

[22-Mar-19 04:34 PM] zack#6467
you are worried about some mathematical consequences unrelated to your false advertising?

[22-Mar-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
since you make these claims of impossibility, I am trying to understand how it is possible at all for any trustless oracle to exist at all

[22-Mar-19 04:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
do you own rights to the "oracle" word or something?

[22-Mar-19 04:35 PM] zack#6467
whether or not it is possible to build an oracle out of trusted feeds is a fun math problem, but it is ultimately unrelated to the fact that you are falsely advertising Komodo as if it had an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if my assumption that given a set of sybil/manipulated data consensus logic can be applied to it (be it stake weighted, correlation to majority, etc)

[22-Mar-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
to extract a trustless data stream from it, then it seems what I claimed earlier is true

[22-Mar-19 04:36 PM] zack#6467
so once you write that logic, and you prove that it works, then you can advertise Komodo as having an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you have done nothing to illuminate why it is impossible

[22-Mar-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
a trustless oracle

[22-Mar-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime we have just the general oracle that gets offchain data onchain

[22-Mar-19 04:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, KMD itself doesnt have oracles.

[22-Mar-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt correlation to majority within an error factor come close to being trustless?

[22-Mar-19 04:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Only chains built within the ecosystem have the capacity of activating them at will.

[22-Mar-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can do a bit of teaching if you are so wise, instead of just calling names?

[22-Mar-19 04:38 PM] zack#6467
Bitcoin is can be used as a trusted smart contract platform, if we all trust Bob to run our smart contracts and keep track of the data.
But that doesn't make bitcoin a smart contract platform.

By default, all on-chain stuff is supposed to be trust free, and you need to clearly specify if you are doing something trusted on-chain. Because in general, people don't want to use trust on-chain.

[22-Mar-19 04:39 PM] MyName#0491
@zack 
are you saying:
a) The Oracles CryptoConditions (CC) module doesn't allow a user to make off-chain data available on-chain.
b) Those who publish data to an oracle aren't called publishers.
or
c) There isn't a fee-based model to serve as an incentive for publishers.
with the "false advertisement" claim ?

[22-Mar-19 04:39 PM] zack#6467
https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/
Voting protocols are very bad for being used as oracles.
The total amount of money in bets needs to be less than the stake of the reporters in being honest.

[22-Mar-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why correlation to majority (randomly selected)

[22-Mar-19 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Looks like James is asking to justify how the contradicting statements being made are applicable across both concepts equally.  
You cant look at the data origination and immediately claim trusted/trustless.    

ALL Data has to originate from somwhere, and this data is or is not to be trusted, even if it's by the tools being used for measurement, from a Sphignomanometer to horse race results.

Then to say, "My data makes trustless oracles but your's doesn't" seems awkward at minimum ðŸ¤·

[22-Mar-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
why couldnt that work with many publishers to extract a trustless data stream from it?

[22-Mar-19 04:41 PM] zack#6467
correlation to the majority is used a little in Augur and Bitcoin hivemind when the redistribute votecoins after each oracle result.
It can be a part of a trustless oracle system.

[22-Mar-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if stake weighted

[22-Mar-19 04:41 PM] MyName#0491
`Voting protocols are very bad for being used as oracles.`
even if that were true, "very bad" doesn't support your claim of either "scam" or "false advertisement"

[22-Mar-19 04:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
(PS - My two favorite smart people in Blockchain having a discussion.    This is awesome.)  ðŸ’“

[22-Mar-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
can you just describe in general what it takes to get a trustless feed out of a bunch of random quality data sources?

[22-Mar-19 04:42 PM] zack#6467
I say "scam" because Komodo advertises itself as an oracle platform, but does not have any working oracle.
You have tools that you claim might be somewhat useful in building an oracle, at some point in the future.
But there is no oracle now.
Advertising as if you have one is a lie.

[22-Mar-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so you wont explain what it takes to make a trustless oracle to your standards?

[22-Mar-19 04:43 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c  I wrote the MVP for the oracle in Augur, and I wrote the oracle for Amoveo, so I can describe those.
Neither involves trusted feeds at any level.

[22-Mar-19 04:44 PM] zack#6467
I know a little about some gnosis oracles too

[22-Mar-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but there has to be  data coming into the system

[22-Mar-19 04:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
KMD doesnt advertise as an oracle platform.  In fact, they rarely discuss it.   Just FYI.
Pirate only posted about it in support of the work VEO does.
Sorry if this rubbed you the wrong way @zack

[22-Mar-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
please explain

[22-Mar-19 04:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
ðŸ‘†

[22-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you say there is no trusted feed, which means all data starts as trustless? immaculate conception?

[22-Mar-19 04:45 PM] MyName#0491
`so you wont explain what it takes to make a trustless oracle to your standards?`
fwiw, @zack if you can make a persuasive, valid claim (rather than spewing vitriol) I have no doubt that it will be addressed and that's why he keeps asking you that

[22-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can explain a specific easy to understand case, so my limited skills will be able to still understand it

[22-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
how can the data start as trustless?

[22-Mar-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
when it is offchain

[22-Mar-19 04:46 PM] zack#6467
in Amoveo reporters are doing bets on a single bit of  data, whos value is ultimately determined by nakamoto consensus.
In Bitcoin Hivemind there is commit-reveal voting followed by rebalancing of votecoin ownership based upon how much you followed the median opinion.

[22-Mar-19 04:46 PM] zack#6467
What does it matter if data "starts as trustless"?

[22-Mar-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ok. so there is data (the individual bets, data that is being committed) that isnt trustless

[22-Mar-19 04:47 PM] zack#6467
The fact is that Komodo does not ever produce a trust free source of data external to the blockchain. So it does not have an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
why cant then there be data publishers, each acting like a single bettor

[22-Mar-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and then trustless oracles logic using that data?

[22-Mar-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you say this is impossible, but that implies there there needs to be some immaculate conception

[22-Mar-19 04:47 PM] zack#6467
if you add a commit-reveal mechanism, then  you could build up a bitocin hivemind oracle out of your data feeds.

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] zack#6467
but you also need the votecoin subcurrency, and a lot more stuff

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the oracles CC is a LOW LEVEL mechanism

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows to put offchain data onchain

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and also allows to easily access the recent data samples

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
thats all it does

[22-Mar-19 04:48 PM] zack#6467
yes, that is called a "trusted feed", many blockchain projects use those.

[22-Mar-19 04:49 PM] zack#6467
it is not an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:49 PM] zack#6467
it should be the "trusted feed CC"

[22-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the definition of oracle itself seems to mean offchain data -> onchain

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
which oracles CC does, it creates a data market

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] zack#6467
yes, of course. 
Just like the definition of smart contract means some software to determine the outcome of a contract

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
a trustless oracle can be created out of this raw data

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a publishers / subscription / datafee system

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] zack#6467
but if I sold Bobchain as a smart contract blockchain platform, and didn't tell people it had trust, that would be a scam.

[22-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it has publishers

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] MyName#0491
@zack I can't help but ask, how personally vested in hivemind are you? You seem to keep referring to that project as if it's the "one, true way" and the only way a thing can exist

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
which means a single pubkey posting data

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@MyName  hence the name hivemind

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] zack#6467
I think you will have to change your trusted feed mechanism on-chain quite a lot before it can be useful for an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] zack#6467
I own nothing of hivemind. I built the Amoveo blockchain.

[22-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, how do you suggest it needs to be changed?

[22-Mar-19 04:52 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo's oracle is way better than Hivemind's

[22-Mar-19 04:52 PM] zack#6467
My suggestion is that you advertise this as a trusted feed, until you actually have a trustless way to bring data onto the blockchain.

[22-Mar-19 04:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Have you given a look to cryptoconditions? Maybe you find something of your interest or help on fixing what you may be able to fix.

[22-Mar-19 04:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He says that he knows the way to import data into blockchain trustlessly but wont explain it.

[22-Mar-19 04:54 PM] zack#6467
A trusted way to bring data onto the blockchain is useful just like a trusted way to put the results of a smart contract onto the blockchain is useful.
Creating a trustful tool, and then combining it with a blockchain and not warning people that it is actually a centralized trustful tool just like a bank, that is a scam.

[22-Mar-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a prices consensus code that takes N publishers data to extract a consensus price uses a randomly selected data point and finds the first one that has majority consensus within an error factor

[22-Mar-19 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just so everyone knows, Zack IS a smart dude and is very capable with these things.   I hope that a communication breakdown doesn't negate an awesome discovery session here.

[22-Mar-19 04:55 PM] zack#6467
random sampling cannot make a voting mechanism into a secure oracle. it is still vulnerable to bribery because of tragedy of the commons.
