notaries that are controlled can eventually push the network to the notarized chain

[22-Mar-19 11:57 PM] jl777c#5810
since nodes can go from being on a non-notarized chain to a notarized one, but not the other way, it is a one way migration\

[22-Mar-19 11:57 PM] jl777c#5810
however, in a bad chain split, the nodes end up banning the other nodes

[22-Mar-19 11:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so they would stay split

[22-Mar-19 11:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and the longest chain would need to resolve the fork

[22-Mar-19 11:58 PM] zack#6467
so lets say I controlled more than half the notaries, and had 1% hashpower on an asset chain. Could I mine a fork using my 1% hashpower, ignore blocks made by anyone else, and use my power in the notaries to make sure that my miner finds 100% of the valid blocks?

[22-Mar-19 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
1 % hashrate wont propagate blocks to the network, a notarization that doesnt match is ignored

[22-Mar-19 11:59 PM] zack#6467
I don't understand what you mean by "wont propagate blocks to the network" or "notarization that doesn't match"?

[22-Mar-19 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
you can publish notarizations for your 1% chain all you want, but the rest of the network would just ignore such

[22-Mar-19 11:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Could I mine a fork using my 1% hashpower, ignore blocks made by anyone else, and use my power in the notaries to make sure that my miner finds 100% of the valid blocks?`
In theory, yes, but a single "legitimate" miner validating a single notarized block tx would take you off it

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
at 1% that means 99% of the blocks are by honest nodes

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] zack#6467
so that means notaries can't force one side of the fork to win over the other?

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
not at 1% hashrate

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] zack#6467
or only if the percentage of hashpower is in some range?

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe at 40%

[23-Mar-19 12:00 AM] zack#6467
what determines the amount of hashpower needed to do this?

[23-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the network is allowed to reach consensus normally

[23-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
then notaries agree with each other and publish it

[23-Mar-19 12:01 AM] zack#6467
@Deleted User  voting is not cryptoeconomically secure. Game theoretically, i think it wouldn't be difficult to control the majority of notary nodes. It might even be inevitable that one person controls the majority.

[23-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
then all the nodes update the notarized height, only if they already had the same chain

[23-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
wait, how can one person control all the KMD?

[23-Mar-19 12:02 AM] zack#6467
https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/01/28/p-epsilon-attack/ voting is not secure.

`what determines the amount of hashpower needed to do this?`
Whether of not honest miners see it happen.
If you time it right, x sol/s; if you time it wrong, ~100M sols

[23-Mar-19 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
people send to their selected notaries

[23-Mar-19 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
rich list determines notaries

[23-Mar-19 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
how is this something that is controllable by minority stake? (other than voter apathy)

[23-Mar-19 12:03 AM] zack#6467
it is cheap to bribe voters to vote how you want.

[23-Mar-19 12:04 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Not sure how "cheap" it is to bribe someone with a million dollar investment

[23-Mar-19 12:04 AM] zack#6467
if each voter has an interest of $1000, and there are 100 voters, I think your total bribe works out to be $10 per voter, or something similar.

[23-Mar-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
so you will bribe the whales to select an inferior candidate that is controlled by you

[23-Mar-19 12:05 AM] zack#6467
if the notaries can't force the outocme of a fork in any chain, I guess it doesn't matter if one person controls all the notaries.

[23-Mar-19 12:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the economic value of controlling notaries is more a sabotage value, to stop notarizations

[23-Mar-19 12:05 AM] zack#6467
the way to do bribes correctly, is by making them trustless.

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
ha ha

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
real people own KMD

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
My vote holdings are small compared to many and I bet you can't afford to bribe my vote

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] zack#6467
you can use a smart contract to do the bribe for you, so you can't cancel the bribe even if you wanted to.

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and they wont be voting for evil notaries for some small amount

[23-Mar-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and how much are you willing to pay in bribes?

[23-Mar-19 12:07 AM] zack#6467
it sounds like it doesn't even matter if one person controls the majority of notaries though, so this attack doesn't matter for komodo

[23-Mar-19 12:07 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries have very limited powers

[23-Mar-19 12:07 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_goes back to üì∫_

[23-Mar-19 12:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but very important nonetheless

[23-Mar-19 12:07 AM] zack#6467
so what is the most profitable thing you can do with majority control of notaries, and what is the most destructive thing you can do?

[23-Mar-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
one other factor maybe changes the equation is that KMD pays 5% per year

[23-Mar-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just for holding it

[23-Mar-19 12:08 AM] zack#6467
that is meaningless.
I could delete 5% of everyone's balances every year, and it would be equally meaningless

[23-Mar-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you can stop notarizations

[23-Mar-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
for active users, they need to do monthly claims

[23-Mar-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and it seems just over half are doing it

[23-Mar-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more active users are gaining

[23-Mar-19 12:09 AM] zack#6467
would stopping notarizations matter?
I guess once the notarizations started up again, you could undo some blocks?

[23-Mar-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
until things are notarized, it is subject to normal consensus rules

[23-Mar-19 12:09 AM] zack#6467
Paying people to do on-chain spam seems bad.

[23-Mar-19 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the only profitable use the majority control of notaries gave was if you were mining at 40% the hashrate, you can make it have the effect of 50%

[23-Mar-19 12:10 AM] zack#6467
How can that work?
Normally every 10th block is notarized. if it has been 100 blocks since the last notarization, what stops me from going 90 blocks into history to notarize the normal next block?

[23-Mar-19 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
these 100 blocks are mined and propagated normally, you would need a longer chain to rewrite it

[23-Mar-19 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so i think if you already have a lot of hashrate, you can boost it by 10% to 20% if you controlled majority of notaries, basically by orphaning competing blocks with timely notarizations. but this will leave evidence and it wont be something that goes undetected for very long. considering the difficulty of obtaining majority control, it is just more economic to buy more hashrate

[23-Mar-19 12:13 AM] zack#6467
If I had >50% hashpower on one of the assetchains, but did not control any notaries, then I could censor any txs on that assetchain, right?

[23-Mar-19 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes for as long as you sustain it, and really 51% is probably not enough for a prolonged censorship attack

[23-Mar-19 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
we have experimented with 90%+ hashrate attacks

[23-Mar-19 12:15 AM] zack#6467
if you can censor the txs, then you can trap any KMD on that assetchain

[23-Mar-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
that level of hashrate and you can disrupt a network for the duration

[23-Mar-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is this dpowconfs that we have where until a tx is notarized, it shows as 1 confirmation

[23-Mar-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you wait for 2 or more confirmations, then you know it is notarized

[23-Mar-19 12:16 AM] zack#6467
if the purpose of KMD is to make low-hashrate blockchains secure, but i can still censor txs with 51%, then is Komodo really helping?

[23-Mar-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[23-Mar-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it becomes clear that there is an attack happening

[23-Mar-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and automatically exchanges wont honor deposits

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[23-Mar-19 12:17 AM] zack#6467
I am thinking they can trap the KMD until enough people on that assetchain capitulate and sell the KMD at below market value

[23-Mar-19 12:17 AM] zack#6467
then reconnect and sell the high value KMD

[23-Mar-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
people will just wait until they get 2 confirmations and things are notarized

[23-Mar-19 12:17 AM] zack#6467
sure, with atomic swaps

[23-Mar-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and who would buy when the chain is being attacked?

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] zack#6467
what if it has been months though?

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] zack#6467
the attacker would buy

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] zack#6467
because once he buys enough, he will stop the attack

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] zack#6467
the attacker could lower the price he buys at every day

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
he is buying a low value assetchain though

[23-Mar-19 12:18 AM] zack#6467
can't you put KMD onto any of the assetchains?

[23-Mar-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
no, only ones that setup a gateway

[23-Mar-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but we wont be making these KMD sidechains 100% PoW

[23-Mar-19 12:19 AM] zack#6467
so he would just be taking some native tokens on an assetchain that he is destroying the value of. not a very good attack.

[23-Mar-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it will have a PoS component too

[23-Mar-19 12:19 AM] zack#6467
what flavor of PoS?

[23-Mar-19 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS64

[23-Mar-19 12:20 AM] zack#6467
reminds me of the 64 notaries. I am not seeing anything about this on google, so is it custom to Komodo?

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
each address is in one of 64 segments

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] zack#6467
segments of what?

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
each height one of these segments is the one that can stake first

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
addresses are grouped into 64 different groups

[23-Mar-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
group0, 1, 2,...

[23-Mar-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so first group0 gets to stake first, then 2 seconds later group1, then group 2,... so after 2 minutes all segments are eligible to stake

[23-Mar-19 12:23 AM] zack#6467
the groups are also called "segments"?

[23-Mar-19 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
simply spreading your stake across all 64 segments will get a lot of blocks compared to a single blob

[23-Mar-19 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes segments group, interchangeable in this context

[23-Mar-19 12:23 AM] zack#6467
every address on the assetchain is divided into one of these 64 segments?

[23-Mar-19 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
sha256(address) & 0x3f
