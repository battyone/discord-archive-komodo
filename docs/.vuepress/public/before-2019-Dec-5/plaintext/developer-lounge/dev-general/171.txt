[30-Apr-19 06:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
Is there a way without a DB what I can find out how many blocks per 24 have been created?
For chains with fixxed blocktimes ( I call KMD fixxed at 1440 blocks a day) it's clear but for ondemands assetchains?

[30-Apr-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
scan backwards up to 1440 blocks until you find a timestamp one day ago

[30-Apr-19 06:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes I guess I will have to do it that way... with getchaintxstats BLOCKS a simple 24hour stats for the eco system is possible to do...

[30-Apr-19 10:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX maybe i could modify getchaintxstats have a "24hr mode", something to make it better for on-demand chains

@SHossain have you ever seen komodod "get stuck" when starting up, i.e.: no debug.log output, no stdout/stderr, nothing?

[01-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
previously a daemon crashed, leaving a .lock

[01-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then i deleted all chainstate and necessary files, to do a fresh sync

[01-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't realize .lock was there, so I started it. And it seems to be stuck, in an infinite loop of waiting. It's not using the CPU

[01-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
this seems like a bug. Instead, it should tell me there is a lock file, somewhere

[01-May-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
and probably exit

[01-May-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i haven't seen this behaviour as far as i remember

[01-May-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just merged the latest FSM into hush dev branch, ran into this sync issue (still debugging that too): https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/issues/15

[01-May-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then ran into this lock issue

[01-May-19 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
for the issue 15, did you try deleting peers.dat and try again?

[01-May-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
HUSH3.conf
db.log
debug.log
fee_estimates.dat
old_empty_wallet.dat
signedmasks
wallet.dat
```

[01-May-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the list of files I left behind

[01-May-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
deleted everything else, which I thought, should work

[01-May-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
but because of maybe `signedmasks` or fee_estimates, it goes into an infinite wait loop

[01-May-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i did try deleting peers.dat, didn't seem to help

[01-May-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am going to look at the code that finds ".lock"

[01-May-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is that it has an edge case

[01-May-19 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
did you restart the daemon too fast?

[01-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
how fast is too fast?

[01-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
usually if you do it too fast, it complains

[01-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
this gets stuck before even that

[01-May-19 01:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, if you restart too fast it would complain about couldn't lock dir, already running

[01-May-19 01:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is what should happen

[01-May-19 01:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is my expected behavior

[01-May-19 01:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
the current, unexpected behavior, is nothingness

[01-May-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User give me a tldr

[01-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain my current guess is that CreatePidFile() in init.cpp is going wrong, or something very close to that

[01-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User pretty good tldr. wen vc moon?

[01-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326

[01-May-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
alright, i like this guy when he said "blockchains are just linked lists"

[01-May-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i stopped watching soon after that üòÉ

[01-May-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's cool to see nonscammy people recognize the tech for what it's worth, tho

[01-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am improving some error checking in various code that creates/touches files in -datadir

[01-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
CreatePidFile() doesn't seem to have error checking on pid file creation

[01-May-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
working on a branch here: `https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/tree/stuck`

[01-May-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
really odd bug, i just started with a completely fresh datadir and things seem to work

[01-May-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
if i hit it again, i will dig deeper

Just curious: what does the 'overwintered' in  a decoded transaction tell?

[03-May-19 02:16 PM] barv#0867
what does it tell if it is let's say 'false'

[03-May-19 02:17 PM] barv#0867
that it doesn't include new fields and stuff?

[03-May-19 02:25 PM] barv#0867
we are playing around with a rogue fork

tx to start a new game

[03-May-19 02:25 PM] barv#0867
> decoded the raw tx

[03-May-19 02:26 PM] barv#0867
we found 'overwinter'=false

[03-May-19 02:27 PM] barv#0867
ok. so the tx is post sapling > overwinter=false

[03-May-19 02:27 PM] barv#0867
if the tx is pre sapling > overwinter =true

[03-May-19 02:27 PM] barv#0867
something like that?

[03-May-19 02:30 PM] barv#0867
okay. that is no problem. just playing anyway. at least we now have a clue where it comes from

[03-May-19 04:07 PM] barv#0867
I think it is because we have no balance and the faucet might not work? Any idea @Mylo ?

@SHossain should I remove the `install nanomsg` part from the Komodo installation doc?

you can.

it's been there because it was a spin off for notary nodes install instructions

i'll get them removed.

@barv "overwintered" means Zcash transaction format version 4, the current, which Sapling requires on all known ZEC forks. nExpiryHeight was added to transaction format, a few other small things
