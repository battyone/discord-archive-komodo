@grewalsatinder Used only MacOS with Postman so far 
As I know there is Postman native app for Linux as well

[16-Oct-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh let me check on native then

[16-Oct-18 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates they are offering Linux installation at least 😃

[16-Oct-18 04:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh em gee! that damn go iris routing issue sorted 😃

[16-Oct-18 04:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna progress on that now 😁

[16-Oct-18 04:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
such a silly rule.
I was having this code:

`calcRoutes := app.Party("/maths")`
it compiles but never renders the path http://localhost:8080/maths and just gave 404 error.
I changed it to:
`mathsRoutes := app.Party("/maths")`
and it works!

[16-Oct-18 04:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅

[16-Oct-18 04:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not sure rule is silly or me... but however... I got past it now 😛

[16-Oct-18 04:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for all your help with cheering up and stuff...

[16-Oct-18 04:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL thanks mate... I tested using insomnia looks cool. will try postman later. 🙂

postman native is just a electron app wrapped with google chrome

[16-Oct-18 04:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna keep using insomnia for now.

"attack"

[17-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
expected behavior is now attack 🤔

[17-Oct-18 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
did they not look up what the letters in DPOW stand for?

I think with bullet proofs XMR bloat is reduced to about where zcash is, but still zero knowledge is more private

[18-Oct-18 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
now XMR ends up with yet another upgrade and it still falls short, they should just fork zcash and be done with it

The tl;dr; is 
Vuepress = markdown + vue SSG

like CC library, it would be nice to have vue-components (or react) that can work with KMD ecosystem to expedite front end PoC.

Here is info on vuepress https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#life-cycle

@grewalsatinder thanks for that vue component.  might be useful in docs.  i'm experimenting with vuepress to include vue components (and including using the komodo-rpc-lib wrapper).  there is an equihash-verify library, if my testing works out might have to make a need-to-have list and nice-to-have list

[19-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone know the maximum size of a string that can be fed by an RPC call ?

[19-Oct-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What I am working on here needs a certain size, but its pretty small in the scheme of things, so I want to make the RPC call take multiples of this size and then split it internally.

[19-Oct-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like can you have in the json `"data": "abcdef02133"` and the hex string like 2MB or 10MB ? 20MB

[19-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Mylo#8306
no idea, i can't imagine there being a limit - only the buffer size of the server's implementation of serving - if you were to make a maximum buffer 64MB that would be it's limit.    maybe there is a timeout on the TCP connection which would be the limit for socket open.

[19-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Mylo#8306
have you got a link to the socket open LoC (line of code)?

[19-Oct-18 07:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Also, if there are any ppl interested in making a java rpc client to go along with our javascript and python efforts, i had a little look last night and these would be the 1st two things i'd look at for basing a kmd one from - i dont' know if there are any more recent or more commonly used ones though, so still investigating https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/a5f6e26db56d1c5b028e00429545928d

[19-Oct-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at first I guess I will just limit to the TX chunk size to get it working... then play with it later on, dont want to overcomplicate it, struggling as it is. Definaly a good way to learn 😅

[19-Oct-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a 60 line c program that can add to a queue and grab the first thing in the queue, and then remove it.... that seems to be the hardest aprt solved, as I have no idea what I as doing there.

[19-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah, what worked first was hardcoding data.   now move the hardcoding part further away.  it worked the first time.  use same technique "further upstream" so to speak.  send 8kB chunk to RPC, then 50kB chunk i guess.   if you can get it to work with 50kB chunk with RPC, i can look at sending real video from browser next week in <50kB chunks (10ms time chunks) at a time.  so you'll have packets arriving every 10ms this way, at least you'll get movement 🤷

[19-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah .. not really concerned with having video exactly... I will probably start with just some random file and make sure it can be reassembled...

[19-Oct-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once the RPC calls work, then someone can make a dAPP that works with video.

[19-Oct-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Keeping it super simple so it can be used for any data at all, is my plan here.

[19-Oct-18 08:26 AM] Mylo#8306
ok.  i'm going away for weekend so will not be on the tools.

[19-Oct-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubtful it will work beofre next week, this is slow going for me lol

Is there a global registry for asset chain names?

[19-Oct-18 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
~/komodo/src/assetchains is as close to it as we have, those are for the notarized chains

[19-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Alice#9607
ok, how can I protect an asset chain name? Get it notarized?

[19-Oct-18 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, once it is being notarized we dont allow duplicate names for obvious reasons

[19-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Alice#9607
do you charge for notarization?

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there are txfee charges and some more a new price plan is coming out

[19-Oct-18 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
what coin?

[19-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Alice#9607
Working on a project, I might want to integrate with komodo platform

[19-Oct-18 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, the sooner you get things started the lower the cost and you can ensure the name. contact #chainmakers or #chainzilla

[19-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Alice#9607
ok, great.

[19-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Alice#9607
takes some time to get into all the Komodo platform tech

[19-Oct-18 09:31 PM] Alice#9607

[19-Oct-18 09:31 PM] Alice#9607
or lets say towards agi

[19-Oct-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
many possibilities. alphazero was an eye opener

[19-Oct-18 09:32 PM] Alice#9607
oh yes

[19-Oct-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but I think the power of the google processors was understated

[19-Oct-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems they must have a lot of computing power to get the neural nets to converge so fast

[19-Oct-18 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
gamify something and throw alphazero at it

[19-Oct-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I know, easier said than done for a lot of things

[19-Oct-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
real world especially is a lot messier than an abstract game with set rules

[19-Oct-18 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but using oracles CC you can get a globally agreed upon dataset

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and do some sort of distributed training for the mining

[19-Oct-18 09:35 PM] Alice#9607
yes, mining is being replaced by learning

[19-Oct-18 09:36 PM] Alice#9607
at least to a good degree

[19-Oct-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be a cool blockchain
