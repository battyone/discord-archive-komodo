is there a reason you cant use a 90% PoS chain?

[28-Nov-18 08:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its the boss requirement we want to use 100% POS chain  thats why we did it

[28-Nov-18 08:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so do i need to start from the beginning ðŸ˜¦

[28-Nov-18 08:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 99% PoS?

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] D.rabbani#9094
at certain point it does like that

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
100% PoS just creates a lot of edge cases

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai but i cannot change or switch right ?

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i need to make it from the beginning again

[28-Nov-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I will need to reproduce the problem with the 100% PoS

[28-Nov-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I should be able to fix the problem if it is happening all the time

[28-Nov-18 08:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
please if you can fix it

[28-Nov-18 08:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i cant start it again from the beginning

[28-Nov-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I need the chain parameters to connect to the network

[28-Nov-18 08:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes  once my boss is here ill let you know sir

[28-Nov-18 09:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
currently the scenario is we have two staking nodes 
both with the specification of  1core 4gbram and 40gb ssd

[28-Nov-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is likely some bug specific to 100% PoS, or one masked when there is PoW to be there to find blocks. so I need to duplicate this condition of always getting an error and troubleshoot it. it really should not be getting into this state at all

[28-Nov-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
plz send some coins to: RHV2As4rox97BuE3LK96vMeNY8VsGRTmBj

[28-Nov-18 09:05 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes yes mr @jl777c

[28-Nov-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that way it can start to age and be eligible for staking

[28-Nov-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
cant promise I will be able to fix today as it sounds like it takes a while for it to getinto this state

[28-Nov-18 09:06 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes mr @jl777c  let my boss come in and i let him know

[28-Nov-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but as long as you have more than 100 utxo, it should never get permanently stuck

[28-Nov-18 09:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can i check my UTXO length

[28-Nov-18 09:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again and let you know

[28-Nov-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and you have utxo in each of the 64 segments?

[28-Nov-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
meaning having 64 different addresses that have funds in them

[28-Nov-18 09:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes all the 64 address are having funds in them

[28-Nov-18 09:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i restarted the daemon

[28-Nov-18 09:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
sir

[28-Nov-18 09:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
10277 --- >

[28-Nov-18 09:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is what i  got

[28-Nov-18 09:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
in unspent UTXOS

[28-Nov-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that is quite a few.... on a low end system it might be too many...

[28-Nov-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, plz send me 100 different payments to RHV2As4rox97BuE3LK96vMeNY8VsGRTmBj

[28-Nov-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt have to be for large amounts, i just want to have enough utxo to always be able to stake a block

[28-Nov-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
no need for 10,000 that is overkill

[28-Nov-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have 100, across 64 addresses (eg 1 or 2 in each address) on 2 nodes, that should be plenty to keep the chain going. unless bugs

[28-Nov-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes mr @jl777c  it is like the on each of 128 addresses

[28-Nov-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it is like that

[28-Nov-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the amount is distributed equally among all of them

[28-Nov-18 10:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its 10279 now

[28-Nov-18 10:09 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know what is the bug

[28-Nov-18 10:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
there are plenty utxos but i dont know what is the problem

[28-Nov-18 10:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my boss hasnt come yet

[28-Nov-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the bug is not anything you can solve if you have these utxo

[28-Nov-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
did you send me the 100 payments?

[28-Nov-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to make sure they are aged sufficiently to start staking when i load the chain

[28-Nov-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully it will display the staking bug

[28-Nov-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes mr @jl777c waiting for the boss we cant transfer anything unless and until he says so

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i just did set generate true 0 and it worked fine

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i didnt stop the daemon b

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i just did set generate true 0

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because it was a lengthy error of invalid blocks mined

[28-Nov-18 10:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[28-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so setgenerate true 0 and everything is working fine?

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its working fine again

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to do a setgenerate true 0 after each time you restart, otherwise it isnt staking

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
was that the problem?

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[28-Nov-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but this time

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i didnt stop the daemon

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i just did set generate true 0 again with the cli command

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and it starting generating blocks

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
dont know how long will it go

[28-Nov-18 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
now its not giving any error regarding

[28-Nov-18 10:33 AM] D.rabbani#9094
invalid block mined

[28-Nov-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
interesting!

[28-Nov-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
next time it gives errors, do the same

[28-Nov-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a workaround. doesnt really make sense as that setting should just spontaneously change... but it could be that running it kick starts whatever is getting stuck

[28-Nov-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
also errors happen, it is whether the chain keeps advancing or not that matters

[28-Nov-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and sometimes you might have a while between blocks

[28-Nov-18 10:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but the problem is mr @jl777c  that do i need to sit and look for the explorer to go off  and then do that again after every half an hour ðŸ˜„

[28-Nov-18 10:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
at the moment

[28-Nov-18 10:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on both staking nodes theere is no suc error of invalid block  mine d

[28-Nov-18 10:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
mined

[28-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
you can always just check for the most recent blocktimes and if it is hours ago, then there is a problem. what is your memory and CPU usage?

[28-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this could be due to out of resources. maybe to create some VM for swap space might make things better

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if you run out of system RAM, then it wont work very well at all. my guess is on my server it will work fine, though we need to verify that

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the memory usage mr @jl777c

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so 90% RAM used?

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have virtual memory?

[28-Nov-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I would create at least 4GB of virtual memory

[28-Nov-18 10:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont think so the servers we bought give us the option of virtual memory

[28-Nov-18 10:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have set cron

[28-Nov-18 10:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
jobs to clear the buffer cache

[28-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
is the paper wallet creator affected by any means by the recently discovered malicious node.js?

[28-Nov-18 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks

[28-Nov-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this time it stopped again after 100 blocks

[28-Nov-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then i again setgenerate true 0

[28-Nov-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
did that fix it?

[28-Nov-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes  ðŸ˜„

[28-Nov-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it did but the problem is i am doing that every hour ðŸ˜„

[28-Nov-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe make a cron task that issues a setgenerate true 0,  every hour

[28-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is harmless to do it over and over

[28-Nov-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes thats what i can do
