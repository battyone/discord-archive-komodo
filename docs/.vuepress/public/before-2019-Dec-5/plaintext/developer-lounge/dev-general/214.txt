If anybody can buy a 3900X from a local store, you should

[06-Sep-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't had an AMD rig in "forever"

[06-Sep-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$750 is still less than I paid for my i9

[06-Sep-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and they are under $500 now 😭

[06-Sep-19 02:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i added that role and never removed it :abused_smiley:

[06-Sep-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to dumping Debian 10 onto his dev box_

[06-Sep-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 get a 3900X and thank me later for not having to do all the research

[06-Sep-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
fucking RandomX miners won't let any stay on the shelves, tho

[06-Sep-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
and so they are selling for 50% over MSRP on amazon and ebay

[06-Sep-19 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ryzen 3rd gen can do 3200mhz DDR4 by default now, as well!!!!!

[06-Sep-19 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
And it's said that 3733Mhz is their "sweet spot" for OC'ing

[06-Sep-19 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
so get faster ram

[06-Sep-19 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it actually matters now

[06-Sep-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`get a 3900X and thank me later`
If only it were that simple
I'm 100% certain that it will not fit into anything I own 😛

[06-Sep-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the last AMD board I bought was for a bulldozer

[06-Sep-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it wasn't until "recently" that AMD could pack a good amount of RAM (speed aside)
That's why the market drop stopped me from going back to CPU, it's not a "small" investment for me to enter

[06-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, mobo formats

[06-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
that being said, AMD STILL supports AM4, which is like 6 generations

[06-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
How many MB formats did Intel go thru since then?

[06-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Over the long term, AMD is the more efficient use of funds, which is why all cpu miners use ryzens now

[06-Sep-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got 4 different kinds now with the i9 😛

[06-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
That data was not known in the past, and yes hindsight is 20/20

[06-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
But building a CPU farm today, it's insane to not use AMD

[06-Sep-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
agreed, which is why I don't have one 😛

[06-Sep-19 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
No stock of 3900x in Amazon UK

[06-Sep-19 04:21 PM] SHossain#0007
Same at another site where they accept BTC

[06-Sep-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
yep, miners bought them all

[06-Sep-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
RandomX miners

[06-Sep-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's the #1 best CPU to use on RandomX

[06-Sep-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, #1 best CPU for gamers and devs

[06-Sep-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
So AMD has really spanked Intel

[06-Sep-19 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
Intel has no hardware response, and everybody expects them to slash prices to compete

[06-Sep-19 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
for a dev machine, a 3800X is probably fine, but 3900X has 12 cores vs 8 cores, it's a lot more beef. For mining, it blows away 3700X/3800X. And make sure to buy 3200-3600mhz ram for your dev (or game) machine, it will be utilized

[06-Sep-19 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
What I hear, is random Walmarts/Fry's/Best Buys/Targets have some 3900X's and people are going crazy driving around buying them all

[06-Sep-19 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not sure of the equivalent stores in other countries

[06-Sep-19 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
"big box" stores

[06-Sep-19 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_remembers when 2 cores was the thing to have 👴🏽_

[06-Sep-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
12 cores that top out at 5Ghz!

[06-Sep-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
I memba my first computer, 486DX 33Mhz. 2 cores was a distant dream at the time 👵

[06-Sep-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
"DX" means it could do floating point math *on the hardware*, for the kids in the back

[06-Sep-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
486SX and everything below did FP in software *shudder*

tiny bit more learning :P
the next parts are feeling easier now that the basics are clear for creating address. updated this go practice code with WIF calculation code:

@Cryptoon did you try it or build it own blockchain

[07-Sep-19 04:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Follow the steps it will work

[07-Sep-19 05:09 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Cryptoon but after compiled  not get komodod file

[07-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
@pandaanu73 it either didn't compile or you're looking in the wrong place

[07-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
~/komodo/src/komodod is where it'll be

[07-Sep-19 05:12 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Alright same bro i have forked litecoin so i known that it will find on src folder

[07-Sep-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
you're using build.sh or just make?

[07-Sep-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
what's the output of either?

[07-Sep-19 05:12 PM] pandaanu73#7907
But i need a person who have fork the coin

[07-Sep-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[07-Sep-19 05:13 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Ok

[07-Sep-19 05:13 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Alright did you build smartchain  using komodo

[07-Sep-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
yes, plenty

[07-Sep-19 05:19 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Alright so are you using WhatsApp

[07-Sep-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
no

[07-Sep-19 05:21 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@Alright ok

[07-Sep-19 05:22 PM] pandaanu73#7907
I'm finding business partner. Do you.

[07-Sep-19 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand

[07-Sep-19 05:37 PM] PTYX#6840
@pandaanu73 can you please send us an email at hello@chainzilla.io in order to learn more about your project. We are Komodo tech providers and can assist in the creation of blockchains and applications.

[08-Sep-19 03:00 AM] pandaanu73#7907
@PTYX any charges for tech help

[08-Sep-19 03:17 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes we have different pricing and packages. It all depends in what you need. The documentation is free of charge though.

[08-Sep-19 03:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_remembers when folks used to help one another just because they felt it was "the right thing to do" 🤷🏽_

[08-Sep-19 03:36 AM] pandaanu73#7907
@PTYX need help in blockchain creation

[08-Sep-19 12:57 PM] bartwr#6773
@pandaanu73 For creating your 'smart chain' you can follow the instructions at https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html.

If you want to outsource the creation of your chain (and everything that's needed as well, like electrum servers, blockchain explorers, etc), you can use the services of @PTYX of ChainZilla, ChainMakers & others. PTYX mentioned ChainZilla's email address that you could use to send info to & get a quote. There's also https://composer.kmd.io/, a paid service for 'automating' creating a smart chain.

If you want to create the blockchain yourself: Follow the guide linked above & please let us know at what exact step or command you get stuck. Also mention the operating system you're using.

[edit] I missed that you @pandaanu73 messaged in a lot of Discord channels. Please choose the channel that fits your question most and from then only use that 1 channel for your questions.

[08-Sep-19 02:44 PM] pandaanu73#7907

check your directory permissions

[08-Sep-19 02:55 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@pandaanu73  please keep it to one channel. We cant help if you are all over the place, and we also cant help without seeing what error messages you are getting - like what it says on screen after you type `./build.sh`

[08-Sep-19 02:56 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator no such file or derectory

[08-Sep-19 02:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well, then you're in the wrong directory

[08-Sep-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

how much ram?

[08-Sep-19 03:09 PM] pandaanu73#7907
1gb ram

[08-Sep-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that little ram on that old of a 32bit cpu, I'm not sure building is even possible

[08-Sep-19 03:10 PM] pandaanu73#7907
64bit cpu

[08-Sep-19 03:11 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator then any idea

[08-Sep-19 03:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
install more ram, or use a prebuilt binary

[08-Sep-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you need to rebuild your vm differently, it's seeing itself as 32bit (I had to google i686 because my brain doesn't go back that far)
