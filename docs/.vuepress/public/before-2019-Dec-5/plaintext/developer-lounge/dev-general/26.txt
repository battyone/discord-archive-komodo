@Deleted User 

I've done that with most of these. I think all the ones I'm posting here are ones that I was spinning my wheels on trying to solve.

[18-Sep-18 01:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh wait, I didn't see the echo thing...

[18-Sep-18 01:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Interesting, yes, I need to try that.

[18-Sep-18 01:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks.

Here's yet another one:

```
curl --user user2398463324:passf4bab3f0e4330392d885ed1a108fa09e640590b1f05d2da00181756bb3b93414b7 --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "listunspent", "params": [6, 9999999, "[\"RPS3xTZCzr6aQfoMw5Bu1rpQBF6iVCWsyu\",\"RBtNBJjWKVKPFG4To5Yce9TWWmc2AenzfZ\"]"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8032/
```

Result:
```
{
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "code": -3,
    "message": "Expected type array, got string"
  },
  "id": "curltest"

```
I think this is the one that Alright and Dukeleto and I spent some time on.

[18-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I tried it

[18-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I missed something about how to get the json broken down in echo... let me see..

[18-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, you're using jq with it, that makes sense

[18-Sep-18 01:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@Deleted User 

Can you explain to me the logic behind putting `<ORIGIN ADDRESS>` in there?

Is that supposed to have something else substituted, or is that a comment, or something else?

And then, still looking for answers on the issues with `estimatepriority` and `getbalance`, and might find more, still looking through all my notes.

[18-Sep-18 01:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, looks like that's all I have in my notes. Just those last two.

[18-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, wow.

[18-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I must have substituted for it earlier. I"ll put a note in the documentation.

[18-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's weird.

[18-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I wonder why it doesn't have any issues when you submit it as a normal terminal command.

[18-Sep-18 01:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, you can just delete the `<ORIGIN ADDRESS>`?

I should have you look over what I have written down, as I may be confused.

[18-Sep-18 01:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, that worked.

[18-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Any ideas on `estimatepriority` and `getbalance`?

[18-Sep-18 01:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
On `estimatepriority`, I don't know how to make the daemon "observe" enough transactions and blocks to be able to return a response other than `-1`

[18-Sep-18 01:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And on `getbalance`, I just can't put in any parameter, or I'll get an error.

So, this works:

```
curl --user user2398463324:passf4bab3f0e4330392d885ed1a108fa09e640590b1f05d2da00181756bb3b93414b7 --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbalance", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8032/
```

But this doesn't:
```
curl --user user2398463324:passf4bab3f0e4330392d885ed1a108fa09e640590b1f05d2da00181756bb3b93414b7 --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbalance", "params": [6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8032/
```
although it will work as a terminal command, like so: 
```
komodo-cli getbalance 6
```

[18-Sep-18 01:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Try adding in param `[6]` and see what happens.

[18-Sep-18 01:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ahh, okay

[18-Sep-18 01:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, weird how the terminal line doesn't need it.

[18-Sep-18 01:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, interesting. Thanks.

[18-Sep-18 01:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, just the `estimatepriority` command, and that's the end of my flags, for now.

[18-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, hmm, that's another error in the text then. Fixing.

[18-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nice, yep, that was a good catch.

[18-Sep-18 01:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I wonder if I deleted it.. but I don't seem to recall deleting it.

[18-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Nope, I must have deleted it, as it's in the other file... weird.

[18-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@jl777c 

Do you know if the `estimatepriority` method works in KMD?

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it should

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but you need to have some blocks with transactions for it to return anything

The (typeof) and following description are mine, the properties are from the returned object

[18-Sep-18 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus yes, those are accurate. I don't believe that RPC has changed at all in KMD from Zcash upstream

[18-Sep-18 05:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thanks.

[18-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In `z_gettotalbalance`, I see we've added an `interest` property.

I'm assuming this is the KMD rewards interest, correct?

[18-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
{
  "transparent": "9.98794883",
  "interest": "0.00",

Ah cool, github site has instructions once I made the PR

[18-Sep-18 09:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus correct, KMD added a interest key in the response of that JSON

[18-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks, @dukeleto 

I suspect we need to add the following to the documentation, let me know also if this is correct.

```
While the `interest` property is returned for all KMD-based coin daemons, only the main KMD chain utilizes the interest feature. KMD-based asset chains will always return a `0.00` interest value .
```

[18-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another question:

The example in the documentation doesn't work for the optional parameters on this method.

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDDA z_importkey "ST17DVj1BhA4uisNpxHeFfX4DLYwJG3R81mhyia1pqrxQj3XPm8s" yes 10

error: Error JSON:yes

/komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDDA z_importkey "ST17DVj1BhA4uisNpxHeFfX4DLYwJG3R81mhyia1pqrxQj3XPm8s" "yes" 10

error: Error JSON:yes
```

[18-Sep-18 10:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This one gets a little closer:

```
komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDDA z_importkey "ST17DVj1BhA4uisNpxHeFfX4DLYwJG3R81mhyia1pqrxQj3XPm8s" '{"rescan":"yes"}' 10
error code: -1
error message:
JSON value is not a string as expected
```

[18-Sep-18 11:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This is from the Zcash documentation on the `z_shieldcoinbase` method.

Is the transaction size limit the same in KMD? Just checking.

```
Any limit is constrained by the consensus rule defining a maximum transaction size of 100000 bytes
```

[19-Sep-18 06:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus your `interest` documentation is correct

[19-Sep-18 06:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus yes, transaction size limit is currently the same as Zcash, it's a Sprout size limit (which all Zcash forks currently use). Currently Zcash is planning to upgrade to Sapling at the end of October and there will be no more max transaction size, and Komodo will become that way when James decides to merge all that stuff in at a future date üòÉ

[19-Sep-18 06:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
max transaction size will only be limited by block size

[19-Sep-18 06:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus not sure what is up with z_importkey, note that as a potential bug

[19-Sep-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I am not sure i like a single transaction that is the size of the block...

[19-Sep-18 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
the more I read about Zcash Sapling, the more work it sounds like it's going to be

[19-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is a lot of work

[19-Sep-18 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
to integrate into KMD and every other zcash fork. It almost feels like a "lets be incompatible to make to make it hard on others", or at least "we don't care if we make your life hard"

[19-Sep-18 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
all mining pools must change their stratum implementations, for instance

[19-Sep-18 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
all raw transactions must change, a lot

[19-Sep-18 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a lot of stuff

[19-Sep-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand why they changed the tx serialization format to add support for mempool expiration

[19-Sep-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
once it gets confirmed, who cares about what the mempool expiration was?

[19-Sep-18 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
they evidently thought expiring/stuck-in-mempool xtns are a big problem

[19-Sep-18 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
`hashReserved` is changing, and also for 2way replay protection you now always have to include a branch-id in raw transactions. it's a lot of changes

[19-Sep-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
James will love this part ... ``` Signature hashing
There are new SegWit-like features in this upgrade, such as transaction signatures committing to values of the inputs. We suggest reusing code from SegWit (e.g. for hashing transparent outputs) when implementing the new SignatureHash function. See ZIP 143 .```

[19-Sep-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i found this site which has been updated a lot and lists so many low-level changes: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/nu_dev_guide.html

[19-Sep-18 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
the zcash ecosystem itself will be updating stuff for months, many zcash forks will never have the resources to update and will stay on Sprout, most likely

[19-Sep-18 03:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
network upgrades go live on Oct 28th and new private key format still isn't saved to disk....... üòø

[19-Sep-18 03:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, and they changed the format of Sapling addresses

[19-Sep-18 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
every bit of Zcash code in the world that tries to verify what a valid ZEC address looks like, that needs to change, and downstream code that expects a certain base58 prefix or length
