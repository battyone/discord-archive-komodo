@Mylo If you want, this can be used instead of regtest mode in the guide you were preparing

[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Mylo#8306
regtest mode will stay, gcharang mode can be modified, docker mode can be modified, 2 real nodes can be modified.   courses for horses as they say 😄

[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Mylo#8306
i personally like docker mode once you go to the trouble of creating an image 😃

[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] gcharang#6833
but we aren't creating any image here? just different launch params to the daemons on the same machine, I thought using 2 daemons will give more realistic asset chain creation experience than regtest

also I am not sure every new feature that has been added to KMD works with regetest rightaway until some modifications are done to it

[19-Apr-19 10:54 AM] Mylo#8306
totally understandable, regtest mode may not be the best option moving forward - i like using it because it's cheap.

✅ 👍 

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang pretty sure shielded xtns are broken in regtest

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don' t think average users should be told to use regtest mode

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is really no reason for it, it's more devs to use in test suites

[19-Apr-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not against it, mostly it might be confusing, and it's not exactly the same as a testchain in "mainnet" mode

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang i haven't tested this lately: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/issues/1247

sapling addrs have a diff address format on main vs regtest vs testnet, which makes so many things break

[19-Apr-19 12:50 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah, I think it was your posts that made me think twice about regtest for intro stuff

[19-Apr-19 12:51 PM] Mylo#8306
it's my fault.  i use regtest mode for testing things - it's gcharang and company trying to find equally cheap alternatives so i stop pushing my narrative

[19-Apr-19 12:52 PM] gcharang#6833
noone's fault mylo 😅 , as you said courses for horses

[19-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah my docker course hasn't got a horse atm, just needs a neater setup to save hard drive space 😄

Do we have blake2s hashing function in KMD?

[19-Apr-19 03:38 PM] Mihailo#5902
I see there is blake2b, but not sure for 2s...

[19-Apr-19 06:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo is "2s" actually a thing?

[19-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
Looking at wiki it is ;)

[19-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
BLAKE2b (optimized for 64-bit performance) and BLAKE2s (optimized for smaller software architectures).

[19-Apr-19 07:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe it is just an optimization but gives same hash...

[20-Apr-19 09:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
Anybody know where I can find the code to the latest Komodo web wallet ? I am looking for how it sets `overwintered=1` in the transaction

welcome to unix world

[20-Apr-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
STDOUT needs to be directed

[20-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Mylo#8306
hers's my question

[20-Apr-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
command &> log.out &

[20-Apr-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
instead of letting it spam your STDOUT

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah been using vim for 15 years on-and-off....still a rookie

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Mylo#8306
it only happens when i setgenerate true

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Mylo#8306
and start mining on a node

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
it happened because you backgrounded a process, but did not send it's STDOUT to a file

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Mylo#8306
happy to see you recognize it 😄

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it's doing what you asked

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
you asked it to spam your STDOUT

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
so that is what it is doing

[20-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Mylo#8306
beauty.... yeah i did it inside of backticks

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
other things can spam your stdout, but you are noticing that mining creates some STDOUT prints

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
>/dev/null i guess

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
other things do as well

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, you could send to /dev/null too

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
but a log file will allow you to debug things

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
it's curl command and i want the result, so i'll have a play with it thanks

[20-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
curl has a -q or --quiet option

[20-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
turns off progress bars and such

[20-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Mylo#8306
ok got a cpl options to investigate cheers

[20-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Mylo#8306
curl -s i'm using for silent.

[20-Apr-19 10:23 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah.  learned something handy after all these years!!!    never had anyone be able to say XXX why it happens....so i'd just log out and log back in 😛

[20-Apr-19 10:25 AM] Mylo#8306
My seed node started with
```
hide_output komodod -ac_name=.....
```
and `hide_output` is
```
function hide_output {
        # This function hides the output of a command unless the command fails
        # and returns a non-zero exit code.

        # Get a temporary file.
        OUTPUT=$(tempfile)

        # Execute command, redirecting stderr/stdout to the temporary file. Since we
        # check the return code ourselves, disable 'set -e' temporarily.
        set +e
        $@ &> $OUTPUT
        E=$?
        set -e

        # If the command failed, show the output that was captured in the temporary file.
        if [ $E != 0 ]; then
                # Something failed.
                echo
                echo FAILED: $@
                echo -----------------------------------------
                cat $OUTPUT
                echo -----------------------------------------
                exit $E
        fi

        # Remove temporary file.
        rm -f $OUTPUT
}
```
a very handy function

[20-Apr-19 11:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
so we have https://wallet.myhush.org/ but sending does not work, because `overwintered=1` is not being set somewhere, the old Hush chain was not overwintered

somewhere close to this file, it's missing and needs to be set somewhere

[20-Apr-19 11:19 AM] dukeleto#7326

isn't overwinter version number of tx?

[20-Apr-19 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto am I missing something or does that not have the new end bits after lock time to even support the new chain?

[20-Apr-19 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't see a place for nExpiryHeight and/or valueBalance

[20-Apr-19 12:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 both of you sound right, this is pre-overwinter code trying to work on an overwintered chain, that is the bug. What is the fix?

[20-Apr-19 12:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
send PR, get 100HUSH

[20-Apr-19 12:32 PM] dukeleto#7326

[20-Apr-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can try version 4 and 12 bytes of 0s padded at the end, it might work
