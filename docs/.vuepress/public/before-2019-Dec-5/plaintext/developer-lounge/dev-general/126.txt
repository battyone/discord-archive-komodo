```tcp        1      0 127.0.0.1:43158         127.0.0.1:38427         CLOSE_WAIT  8548/python3        ```
After script executing and daemon stop Python still have connection to RPC port of daemon but I dont have tcp6 connection from daemon RPC port (38427 is rpc port of chain)

[17-Feb-19 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Just interesting - will after machine reboot and only single daemon running on this machine it behave the same way?

after daemon stopped (but script isn't stopped so proxy object is alive):
```

```

[17-Feb-19 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Then started manually without problems and script stop

[17-Feb-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh you just waiting here and poking 😃

[17-Feb-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
it waits until the daemon stops responding

[17-Feb-19 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
So is it works now?

[17-Feb-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
yep yep

[17-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh ok, maybe before you not waited before daemon is down

moved the sleep inside the try and it's good now

[17-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
problem was that it would wait just before the try than spam the hell out of the daemon with `getinfo` as it was booting up

[17-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Alright#0419
this seems to be the problem

[17-Feb-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
I see 👍 Problem was not in network connections yep, since when system assigned port to client there is no reason to reassign port of server to client (and you even not creating new proxy)

[17-Feb-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Nice that it works now 😃

oh lol, a whole client in rust. i just made the rpc layer

[18-Feb-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt it could be done in less than a few years even if you knew what you were doing.... There is so much code and its a bit of a maze lol.

[18-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jorian#4555
true, and it means there are 2 komodo codebases

[18-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jorian#4555

[18-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jorian#4555
the biggest problem being james only knowing C

[18-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
C isnt that bad anyway...  Its extremly powerful and fast, just have to get used to it. 😃

[18-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still blows me away what you can do with it.

Which is why some people call it "high level assembly" 😉

you can write C++ in C

or any sort of data table driven code, in C

[18-Feb-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
why is it such a problem that I only code in C? I can pretend to code in other languages, just prefer to be 100x more efficient

[18-Feb-19 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
i also prefer James to be 100X more efficient

[18-Feb-19 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[19-Feb-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
what are you trying to build?

[19-Feb-19 04:03 PM] gcharang#6833
do you want the software related to komodo blockchain
or dPOW and DEX?

yes dPow

No, I just want to have a working builds that I can debug and follow in the code

[19-Feb-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
builds of what?

[19-Feb-19 04:05 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
> notaries only run on unix
Maybe that's why I have no problem building in Ubuntu

[19-Feb-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
komodod is in the komodo repo not the SuperNET repo

[19-Feb-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW notarizer only needs to be run by notaries

[19-Feb-19 04:06 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh okay I was just curious how dPow notarizer works in code, like do code stepping when debugging, don't know if that's possible to do locally

[19-Feb-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you can certainly run it locally, but it wont participate in any notarization unless you setup a notary testnet

[19-Feb-19 04:08 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh okay, well, I think that's my roadblock then, maybe its not possible in my current situation.

[19-Feb-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you will need 2+ unix nodes, then create a testnet description (based on elected)

[19-Feb-19 04:11 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Is there like a Wiki to do that? Sorry a bit more of a step by step guy.

These are new lines that I must have missed. Oracles is a tough one.

[19-Feb-19 08:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There's something wrong with this documentation, I'll need to take a deeper look. Thank you for pointing it out.

[19-Feb-19 08:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
special characters somewhere might be getting interpreted in an unexpected way, and changing markup/etc

[19-Feb-19 08:33 PM] dukeleto#7326

thx! havent checked github interface, will take a look

[19-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There was a whole section that was somehow cut out from the original tutorial. 

It looks as though I haven't even worked over most of this material. I don't know how this was missed. I looked through the Github contributors, and it's primarily me on this page, so I guess it's a mystery.

Anyhow, fixing it all now. Thanks!

@TonyL 

Hi Tony, I spent some time today working over the documentation for Gateways. If I recall correctly, I believe you are the dev expert on this cc module?

If so, can you please look through this documentation and review?

I did as much as I could today to ensure accuracy, but I am certain there are still several mistakes.

The easiest way to handle revisions is if you would please make a fork of the repo to your repository, make any changes you want locally by just writing right over the top wherever you need, and then when you are done, submit all revisions as a single pull request.

You can take a look at the above linked documentation, if you like. I think there are still errors, and I am working on uprooting those, but in the meantime, it can probably get you through.

[20-Feb-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus Hi! I think It's better to consult with GatewaysCC developer @Mihailo on this matter since few parameters in gatewaysbind and two new RPC  were  added. 
I've not tested reworked gateways yet because working on rogue testing atm.

[20-Feb-19 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus new `gatewaysbind` requires 4 new args, `pubtype p2shtype wiftype <depositaddress>`

for KMD and R address based coins this is `60 85 188 <address>` I believe
