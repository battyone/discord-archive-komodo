@blackjok3r @Alright hooking up a LABS thingie (maybe the gps oracle thing)  to spam a twitter account would be really good marketing,  for both LABS + KMD

@dukeleto I'll explore posting ROGUE data to a twitter feed when I'm finished with some other tasks

[25-Feb-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
I think simplest solution would be to link twitter feed to any arbitrary oracle

[25-Feb-19 09:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
oooooh @Alright   üòÆ

[26-Feb-19 02:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright what about some kind of ROGUE leaderboard, where every X minutes it tells the top N people, something like that

[26-Feb-19 02:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, you can ask the twitter bot for specific info about a ROGUE character/etc and it replies with data from the chain. That would really help people understand

[26-Feb-19 02:17 AM] Alright#0419
I'd rather do this all via trollbox, but i will try it via twitters for the noobs üòõ

[26-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Alright#0419
what I imagine is something like this
every 5 blocks, tweet games played, the result(bailout or death), print character data, print any updates to orderbooks, print the cli command to replay each game

[26-Feb-19 02:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
or a Telegram bot, people love those, and the API is pretty sweet. Something that people can use easily

[26-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Alright#0419
may as well do trollbox as users are running a cc enabled chain anyway

[26-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
have -pubkey set already and such

[26-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
they already did all the hard work to setup trollbox when they setup ROGUE

[26-Feb-19 02:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, 28th being the second deadline of my extended self goal on my CC based golang app, seems gonna extend to 3rd time.
I find this kinda updates here making me responsible and not to procrastinate and deal with the things where I stuck and move on, unstuck and do something on making things progress.
I progress far far more on learning and grasping the understanding of my new programming language stack than I ever did in last 2 years I just about 2 months. That's a big thing for me at least. :P
Still practicing, and now gonna extend at least a week more to my rogue golang app.

[26-Feb-19 02:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright the goal is something like https://twitter.com/tweet_stamp but showing off a KMD dApp. Something that can be use completely via Twitter, with no other complex setup

[26-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
I think the simplest solution is make a twitter bot that just tweets any time an oracle is updated

[26-Feb-19 02:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
an interactive bot, that shows off KMD tech

[26-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Alright#0419
then we can build custom oracles for any kind of twitter bot

[26-Feb-19 02:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
sure, "baby steps to the market" as they say

[26-Feb-19 02:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The point where I last stuck was the redirection from GoTTY showing the rogue game on web terminal window back to he web form controls. Since I had troubles with gotty control properly, I took alternative route to solution, and that lead me to advance my learning on go langauge a bit more. to do concurrent programming in Go and that is still syncying in my understanding, to manage Go routines, Channels, Context, Mutex etc.
So, will use that in my next iterations of go practice code and write a PoC of rogue. üôÇ

[26-Feb-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto do you have experience with twitter bots?

[26-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
if I whip something up that posts all this data to an oracle and give you a way to see each time this is updated, could you handle the actual twitter api side of it?

[26-Feb-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make a commentary twitter bot for ROGUE tournaments üòÑ

[26-Feb-19 02:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would be very interesting!

[26-Feb-19 03:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i haven't messed with twitter API in a long time, but i could guide somebody that wanted to help

[26-Feb-19 03:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
my available time is essentially negative in the near-term

[26-Feb-19 03:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
i used to do twitter automation via Net::Twitter perl module, it was dope back in 2009

@jl777c it think the above means, in theory, we can do CCs with zaddrs (not easily, but it's possible)

[26-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419

[26-Feb-19 04:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
i can't keep up with all these KMD channels

[26-Feb-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
even if ETH is broken and Zether is expensive on it, they invented new ZK math thingies

[26-Feb-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
those thingies, are generally useful

[26-Feb-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
cryptoconditions could use them

@Bryan_Beus i have some suggestions for improving KMD ac creation docs

[26-Feb-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
so i will braindump here

[26-Feb-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am researching all the params i want to use for the new HUSH chain

[26-Feb-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I am pretty sure I want to use -ac_ccenable, but the number of each CC is undocumented

[26-Feb-19 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
it would be awesome to see a table of each CC name and number, so it's possible to read docs and then come up with your AC creation command, without reading source code

[26-Feb-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus also, you can add `-ac_blocktime` to the experimental list

[26-Feb-19 05:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you! I am out of the office today and on my phone with limited internet. Could you please create a GitHub issue? I will try to get ac_blocktime added in the next push to master and we'll brainstorm on the best way to create a full table of all CC's.

[26-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto do you expect ac_blocktime to have issues? I tested it pretty thoroughly, and I can't see why it's not ready for production

[26-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
it's so simple, I can't see what could go wrong with it

[26-Feb-19 09:30 PM] TonyL#3577

[26-Feb-19 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Ouch, on first node I can't start mining as well

[26-Feb-19 09:36 PM] TonyL#3577
On latest jl777 started chain with same params and `-gen` param without issues, blocks started to generate
It seems mining not working on latest FSM

[26-Feb-19 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, definitely can't start miner on FSM daemon on my side and can on jl777 with same chain params

[26-Feb-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I can see changes in `src/miner.cpp` in latest PRs into FSM so I wonder it's not a coincidence

[26-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL on second node do `sudo netstat -nputw | grep 41293` and see what process is using the p2p port

[26-Feb-19 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
No processes on this port

[26-Feb-19 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I can start same chain on same machine with mining but with daemon built from latest jl777

[26-Feb-19 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
Oh sorry it'd be the rpc port I think

[26-Feb-19 09:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Can you try to start fresh chain on your side with same params which I used with latest FSM daemon ?@Alright

[26-Feb-19 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
`sudo netstat -nputw | grep 41294`?

[26-Feb-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
i dont have any daemons running, and nothing is on 41294

[26-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
I can try later today, in the middle of dilthium testing

{Reactions}
üëå 

[26-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
`Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See debug log for details.` this almost always means that there is a process using the rpc port already

[26-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
did you try netstat with sudo? sometimes a zombie process won't show unless sudo is used

[26-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why

[26-Feb-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL

[26-Feb-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I can start it if not using -gen param

[26-Feb-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I wrote it

[26-Feb-19 09:54 PM] TonyL#3577
It's only not starting with -gen param, and setgenerate true not enabling mining

[26-Feb-19 09:54 PM] TonyL#3577
On both nodes

[26-Feb-19 09:55 PM] TonyL#3577
On latest jl777 I can both start same fresh chain with -gen param, and enable mining with `setgenerate true` and it's mine blocks

[26-Feb-19 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
it's almost certainly a problem with the LABS merge, I'd say wait for joker

[26-Feb-19 09:56 PM] Alright#0419
the `Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See debug log for details.` thing seems strange though

[26-Feb-19 09:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it confused me first too. Then I understood that problem is in miner when daemon started without -gen param and `setgenerate true` not started to generate blocks as well

[26-Feb-19 09:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if you can check this on your side later

[26-Feb-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
I'll do it now. I need a break from dilithium. The sigs are very frustrating to work with due to their size. Consistently crashing text editors and terminal windows üò´

[26-Feb-19 10:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! Oh, overflows buffer?

[26-Feb-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419

[26-Feb-19 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
tried without -gen and doing `setgenerate true` after it started and that seems to work as well

[26-Feb-19 10:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it fresh chain?

[26-Feb-19 10:38 PM] Alright#0419
yes
