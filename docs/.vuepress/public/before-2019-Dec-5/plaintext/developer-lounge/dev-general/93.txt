Still getting these check_deposit errors on KMD sync... It wont let me have more than 1 peer.

[17-Dec-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it syncs , but during sync its banning most peers.

[17-Dec-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even if they are known good nodes that are are on longestchain.

[17-Dec-18 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[17-Dec-18 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They happen well before sapling activation block.

[17-Dec-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  is this still happening for you aswell... Its pretty much constant for me now, on every sync.

[17-Dec-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be easy to reproduce.

[17-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, it's been happening since at least 1M

[17-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
try doing `-connect` to that peer @blackjok3r

[17-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
does it sync just fine?

[17-Dec-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. I didntr actually use -connect becaue it ends up using 1 peer anyway by banning all the rest

[17-Dec-18 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to resume sync with FSM equal ( was testing staked before, althoug its the same, need to make sure)

[17-Dec-18 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need some pointers as to what I should be trying to get data wise to track the cause down... I started sync at about 970k blocks and it happened soon after

[17-Dec-18 06:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this seems the last remaing bug I can find that affects labs launch... havernt tested any cc's here, but sync of AC's is perfect now, full sync 0 errors.

[17-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
FSM branch is exactly the same

[17-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the more peers you get the more often it occurs, until it bans everyone, and just does 1 peer, until that reaches 100 ban points, then it selects another.

[17-Dec-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the blocks are arriving out of order and its trying to process them before the one before is received ?

[17-Dec-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO this really needs to be fixed and I can do whatever is needed to help that happen.

[17-Dec-18 08:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@Deleted User  you there ?

[17-Dec-18 08:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just needed to ask you in case of insight explorer without docker file ?

[17-Dec-18 08:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like no docker is installed

[17-Dec-18 08:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its just the normal

[17-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
do i need to update the komodo on that only right >

[17-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[17-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and  it will work ?

[17-Dec-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i dont need to do anything inside the insight

[17-Dec-18 08:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just need to update the komodo

[17-Dec-18 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and it will automatically update ?:)

[17-Dec-18 08:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its with deckers

[17-Dec-18 09:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have no idea :/

[17-Dec-18 09:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
please can you elaborate

[17-Dec-18 09:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094

💯 

[17-Dec-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Testing now

[17-Dec-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thank you!

[17-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it only happens in some systems (but a large percentage of them) and usually only on a full resync

[17-Dec-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its only on a full sync

[17-Dec-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and only on KMD, which I found strange

[17-Dec-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  did you push it cant see it yet?

The sapling height is calculated near the sapling activation timestamp.

hmmm no I think this is a diffrent problem

[17-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already had this fix

[17-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It fixed ZEX syncing over sapling activation.

[17-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but not the KMD bannign peers

[17-Dec-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you sync from 1 peer its fine.

[17-Dec-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the more you have the more of this error happens
