it's easy to accidentally create more than 1, even with a lib. The codebase I inherited created 1 RPC connection per file that needed to touch RPC, it wasn't cached somewhere globally

[21-Aug-18 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i noticed stuff was really slow, it was creating new connections and  they were fighting each other, locking each other, since they were polling

[21-Aug-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but when it gives me:

[21-Aug-18 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
weird

[21-Aug-18 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
gives you a Buffer of hex values, instead of one string

[21-Aug-18 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
which are decimal numbers, lol

[21-Aug-18 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need to convert all those to hex and concatenate

[21-Aug-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

i maybe tried to look at bitcoinjs but my codebase already uses `bitcoin` when I inherited it, which is deprecated but also more battle-tested, imho

[21-Aug-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I mainly went with it because it's what znomp already has/uses

i haven't actually used raw xtns from the lib I am using, and I just looked at the tests of bitcoinjs-lib and didn't see anything relating to raw xtns, fyi

[21-Aug-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well the issue is that the template has cb tx as hex
with the use of `-ac_perc` and `-ac_pubkey` there's a specific required cb tx out like:
`    {
      "value": 0.11705480,
      "valueSat": 11705480,
      "n": 1,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "03bd221868abc063b54a3fceafb9898b1931ed767298a17ac0c9923500a7c60e4b OP_CHECKSIG",
        "hex": "2103bd221868abc063b54a3fceafb9898b1931ed767298a17ac0c9923500a7c60e4bac",

        "type": "pubkey",
        "addresses": [
          "RBvk8QYW1o7ArCMdQEJJNP64DxUFbAoZr9"
        ]
      }
    }`

[21-Aug-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if that isn't included in the block, the block is invalid

[21-Aug-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I may just add 1 more daemon call per block and be done with it, before I drive myself insane with trying to get libs to decode it

Q: If I launch an asset chain today without `-cc=1`, can I easily upgrade to `-cc=1` later ?

[21-Aug-18 04:16 PM] bartwr#6773
(I think it's mostly miners that decide if they run the flag or not, right?)

[21-Aug-18 04:17 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm pretty sure it requires a hardfork. James just added a -cc height activation yesteray though. I don't see why not just launch it with `-cc=2` from the start so you don't have to worry if you want it later

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[21-Aug-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_ccactivate is in testing now, it will allow to enable CC contracts after a certain height, but keep in mind it is a hardforking change even if it is a runtime hardfork and all nodes must update or go onto a fork

[21-Aug-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes must have the same -ac_cc or -ac_ccactivate

[21-Aug-18 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
that sounds useful to ease-into CC contracts after a pre-determined time 👍

[21-Aug-18 05:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
`-ac_cc=2 -ac_activate=HEIGHT` where HEIGHT gives you enough time to prepare for CC contracts, would be a reasonable default for new asset chains

[21-Aug-18 05:47 PM] bartwr#6773
Re: jl777c & dukeleto:

Clear. So if I want smart contract capabilities for my asset chain I have to add `-cc=2`. It seems better to start immediately with smart contract capabilities enabled.

Q: Are there any disadvantages for running an asset chain with smart contract capabilities? For example security wise?

[21-Aug-18 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is there any reason to not recommend that new AC's use `cc=2` by default?

[21-Aug-18 05:47 PM] bartwr#6773
^

[21-Aug-18 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
James probably has a better answer than me

[21-Aug-18 05:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think it's very small risk to enable CC and not need it or want it, than to not create your AC and then down the line want to enable it

[21-Aug-18 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are things that you will want to access, as an asset chain, where you will need to have `cc=1 or cc=2` to do certain things

[21-Aug-18 05:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
for example, BTCH will store BTC headers in the future, and an asset chain with cryptoconditions will be able to utilize BTCH information, while those without it will not. If i understand correctly

[21-Aug-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
now the initial CC contracts are tested, it seems reasonable to just enable it, -ac_cc=2 will allow cross chain things if notarized

[21-Aug-18 05:53 PM] bartwr#6773
Great, thank you for your advice @dukeleto @jl777c 😃
(I will enable smart contracts immediately when creating my asset chain, using the `-ac_cc` parameter)

@Mylo you dont have to do anything special to sign it. when you call faucetget,it returns an already signed transaction, ready to be broadcast.

[22-Aug-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the only thing about rawtransactions you need to do is sendrawtransaction. I have it not do it automatically, so during testing you can decoderawtransaction to make sure it looks ok

cool! didn't had to do anything. just ran `./zcbuild/build.sh -j6` command it compiled on mac without any issues. 🙂
