but I worked it out .

[18-Dec-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing I can see that might affect it is that the chain tip has the be captured before the lock is applied...

[18-Dec-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like the line above it... there would need to be some conflit within a nano second or even less to cause an issue and so far it seems ok.

[18-Dec-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
glad it was something that makes sense

[18-Dec-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if the worst that happens is an occasional bad mined block, it seems fine

[18-Dec-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah its like 100% better so far... before maybe 25-30% of blocks mined were invalid... havent seen a single one yet since change

[18-Dec-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
few varables needed to be delcared further up so they were avalibe to all palces but that should not affect anything.

[18-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
probably less than 1% of blocks will be invalid now

updated or outdated? I would say outdated at first glance but maybe someone can check

[18-Dec-18 07:35 PM] jorian#4555
why does `getrawtransaction` give ```"vout": [
    {
      "value": 12.00990000,
      "valueSat": 1200990000,
``` and `decoderawtransaction` give ```
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 12.00990000,
      "valueZat": 1200990000,
```? what is the difference between Sat and Zat?

[18-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
"value" vs "valueZat"

[18-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
both there for backward compatibility. NEVER BREAK USERSPACE!

[18-Dec-18 07:37 PM] jorian#4555
yes, ok, as i can understand its need, i don't understand why the first one is Sat and the second is Zat

[18-Dec-18 07:37 PM] jorian#4555
what is Zat

[18-Dec-18 07:37 PM] jorian#4555
Zatoshis?

[18-Dec-18 07:38 PM] jorian#4555
maybe i should ask zcash peoples

[18-Dec-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is a typo

[18-Dec-18 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian @jl777c Zcash calls their "satoshis" as "zatoshis", and Hush calls ours "puposhis", after Hush Puppy

[18-Dec-18 07:46 PM] jorian#4555
zcash doesn't use them anymore in both their decoderawtransaction and getrawtransaction

[18-Dec-18 07:47 PM] jorian#4555
muh muh backwards compatibility?

[18-Dec-18 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian i think the fact they are using valueSat and valueZat looks like a bug on their part, unless they added that new key to one of the RPCs recently. Maybe they didn't want to break backcompat of valueSat, but called the new key valueZat

[18-Dec-18 07:48 PM] jorian#4555
zcash doesn't use them anymore in both their decoderawtransaction and getrawtransaction

[18-Dec-18 07:48 PM] jorian#4555

not that we have to copy everything zcash does

[18-Dec-18 07:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
just because it's not in the docs, doesn't mean it's not used anymore 😃

[18-Dec-18 07:49 PM] jorian#4555
mmh, would be weird, need to check that

[18-Dec-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are no tests for either, i can tell you that

[18-Dec-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
valueZat is still returned by zcash api, not valueSat

[18-Dec-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
```src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp
182:        out.push_back(Pair("valueZat", txout.nValue));
```

[18-Dec-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the only reference to that key in the entire codebase

[18-Dec-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
zcash master codebase, that is

[18-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jorian#4555
interesting.. that letter is the only difference between get and decode

[18-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jorian#4555
at least, in KMD it is

[18-Dec-18 07:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
zatoshi does not make sense in KMD codebase

[18-Dec-18 07:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
almost everything in our codebase and everyone else's says `satoshi`, some people change user-facing docs/etc

[18-Dec-18 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
```commit c66c731adf766b5085eefe0008b7c83fe02f5162
Author: Jack Grigg <jack@z.cash>
Date:   Thu May 11 18:00:15 2017

    Add a benchmark for calling ConnectBlock on a block with many inputs

    Requires placing block-107134.tar.gz (containing the block, and a fake CoinsDB
    containing its inputs) into the base directory of the repository. This can be
    generated using qa/zcash/create_benchmark_archive.py (see the script for usage
    details).

    To facilitate generation of the fake CoinsDB, an additional field 'valueZat' has
    been added to 'getrawtransaction' containing the integer number of zatoshis
    instead of a decimal number of ZEC.```

[18-Dec-18 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the backstory

[18-Dec-18 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
seems like valueZat was a hack for an old script with no tests that nobody uses anymore

[18-Dec-18 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
clean it all with 🔥

[18-Dec-18 07:53 PM] jorian#4555
aha, but KMD uses valueSat in getrawtransaction

[18-Dec-18 07:53 PM] jorian#4555
so probably someone forgot to change valueZat to valueSat in the decoderawtransaction?

[18-Dec-18 07:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
is this causing a bug of some kind?

[18-Dec-18 07:55 PM] jorian#4555
no, just wondered the difference.. i would need to account for the difference in my code though

[18-Dec-18 07:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't think anything actually uses valueZat which was inherited from zcash

[18-Dec-18 07:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
```src/rpc/rawtransaction.cpp
212:                in.push_back(Pair("valueSat", spentInfo.satoshis));
240:        out.push_back(Pair("valueSat", txout.nValue)); // [+] Decker```

[18-Dec-18 07:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
valueSat is used various places, and @Decker put his name in a comment 🎉 about it

[18-Dec-18 07:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i would say change valueZat to valueSat, but that is for James to decide. Seems to be of low importance

[18-Dec-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
just use "value"

[18-Dec-18 08:03 PM] jorian#4555
yes, i'm ignoring Sat and Zat already

[18-Dec-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
those are bad names as it is not satoshis but in floating point COINS

[18-Dec-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is no way to know what code is being written that uses those fields

[18-Dec-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and since it is no big deal to keep it around and not break anything that might have used it, i kept it in there

[18-Dec-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
think of it as the total opposite of bitcoin core, who go out of there way to make sure they break as much as possible

there are enough giant changes that happen to add the burden of an ever changing JSON syntax

[18-Dec-18 08:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
agreed, only introduce backward incompatibility rarely and strategically

the 1st part was a joke (can delete so no one get wrong idea)
the 2nd part was true
it runs fine after button forced reboot killed joker miner "fix" 😣

not sure I was suggesting anything 😕

[20-Dec-18 10:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the button for "BarterDEX" links to the HyperDEX github repo
when did HyperDEX become BarterDEX?

[20-Dec-18 10:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, if you click the "based on MNZ wallet" link in "About" it takes you to the MNZ gitLab with no way to get back to the OOT wallet without killing the app
