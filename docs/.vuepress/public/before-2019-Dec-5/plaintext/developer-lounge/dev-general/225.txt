Hi guys, today I launched a chain with 2 localhost nodes and set the pubkey parameter after getnewaddress. When launching again and starting to mine, I¬¥m not the owner of the coinbase transaction address and basically cannot access the premine coins. Does that mean that ownership of the coinbase coins is lost after setting a new pubkey when launching?

[24-Sep-19 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if you created a private chain and mined it yourself, then one of those nodes has the funds unless you deleted the wallet.dat file

[24-Sep-19 03:24 AM] redp1ll#3268
hm that`s weird because none of them has the coins when using the getbalance command. when using getsnapshot I can see an address that has the coins which I don't own the privkeys to

[24-Sep-19 03:25 AM] redp1ll#3268
never deleted anything nor sent coins anywhere

[24-Sep-19 03:26 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I can see an address that has the coins`
if you run validateaddress for that addy on the mining node "ismine" comes back as false?

[24-Sep-19 03:28 AM] redp1ll#3268
yes

[24-Sep-19 03:29 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'm lost for ideas

[24-Sep-19 03:34 AM] redp1ll#3268
damn I think I found the issue: my terminal for some reason is deleting or adding characters when copying commands so the pubkey I set at launch changed from the original one.. but the funds should still be here no matter if the pubkey parameter changes right?

[24-Sep-19 03:36 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
well, if you sent it to a pubkey that you don't own then you down own the address or the funds in it

[24-Sep-19 03:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@redp1ll genesis block does not mature until block 101

[24-Sep-19 03:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to mine enough blocks such that it's matured

[24-Sep-19 03:46 AM] redp1ll#3268
Ok well I didn't send any coins but I guess by unintentionally defining a wrong public key (where I don't own the privkey) on launch it somehow prohibits me to access the coinbase coins.. does that make sense in any way?

[24-Sep-19 03:46 AM] redp1ll#3268
@dukeleto alright will try that

change keys here, and should be good. You'll need to change this as well https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/7518764c14add3dc5d3e1a22c2fa4649369014bd/src/notaries_staked.cpp#L13

When I use the wallet API , I found one problem with sendmany command . I have set the account to a new account, it still sends money from the default account. Anyone  knows how to fix this problem ?

[24-Sep-19 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
That is by design
Accounts are no longer used and the placeholder only exists so that it doesn't totally break backwards compatibility for older scripts
```Arguments:
1. "fromaccount"         (string, required) MUST be set to the empty string "" to represent the default account. Passing any other string will result in an error.
```

[24-Sep-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
`unintentionally defining a wrong public key (where I don't own the privkey) on launch`

[24-Sep-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@redp1ll that means you set fire to your pre-mine

[24-Sep-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
do it all again

ThanksÔºå but if I want to send out money from a specific address in the account other than the default one , Which command can I use Ôºü

[25-Sep-19 08:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@ERIC there are no accounts, only addresses
```
to send out money from a specific address, which command can I use?
```
use `createrawtransaction`
Note that it is easy to messup and lose coins when using this command. You have to consume all the balance in a utxo and after subtracting fees, send any remaining amount to yourself

@pandaanu73 ask your question

[27-Sep-19 12:03 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang did create a blockchain using komodo

[27-Sep-19 12:03 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, I did
many times
which part of the process are you stuck at?

[27-Sep-19 12:04 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang yes i have done all process and download the blocks also but i don't known what to do next

@gcharang after create a smart chain can i get smart contract feature also

[27-Sep-19 12:09 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Like ethereum

[27-Sep-19 12:10 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, just select the value for `-ac_cc=1` <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-cc>

[27-Sep-19 12:11 PM] gcharang#6833
our smartcontracts are not like ethereum's
we have the standard contracts like tokens developed already
they are exposed through api calls <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html>
many more contracts are in development

[27-Sep-19 12:11 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang can i need to st block reward or it automatically set

[27-Sep-19 12:13 PM] gcharang#6833
block rewards are controlled by the parameters: `-ac_decay, -ac_reward, -ac_halving, -ac_eras, -ac_end`
you don't need to use all of them, just select the ones and their values that you need
all of their details are here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html>

[27-Sep-19 12:14 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang ok

[27-Sep-19 12:15 PM] gcharang#6833
more advanced params that control block reward: `ac_founders, ac_founders_reward, ac_perc,ac_staked`

[27-Sep-19 12:16 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang how can i set txfee when a client make a transaction i get back the whole fee

[27-Sep-19 12:17 PM] gcharang#6833
the default txfee is `0.0001 coin`, whoever mines the block will receive the txfee for all txns + block reward

[27-Sep-19 12:18 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang i find that there is an options to setup owner public key what is the feature

[27-Sep-19 12:22 PM] gcharang#6833
if you mean the `ac_pubkey` param, it is used by `ac_perc, ac_founders`
you can have a founders reward which will inflate the normal block reward by the value of ac_perc
the pubkey set by ac_pubkey will receive all these extra rewards

[27-Sep-19 12:23 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharangyes i want to known about this feature

[27-Sep-19 12:24 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharangwhat are the features for using this -ac_cc=1

[27-Sep-19 12:25 PM] gcharang#6833
using ac_cc=1 enables the Antara modules(our version of smart contract functionality)

[27-Sep-19 12:26 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang if i use this do i get smart contract function

[27-Sep-19 12:26 PM] pandaanu73#7907
And how can i create .exe file

[27-Sep-19 12:27 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, using ac_cc=1 will enable smart contract function

[27-Sep-19 02:41 PM] gcharang#6833
`./komodod -ac_name=PANDAANUCOIN -ac_supply=1000` in one terminal
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=PANDAANUCOIN getnewaddress` in another terminal
komodod is the daemon; it is the main program that controls the blockchain
komodo-cli is a program used to send commands to komodod

[27-Sep-19 02:44 PM] pandaanu73#7907
Pubkey when i add after coin creation

[27-Sep-19 02:46 PM] gcharang#6833
just start a chain like this:
```
./komodod -ac_name=TEST -ac_supply=1000
```
get an address + pubkey + privkey
using
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST getnewaddress
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST validateaddress <address>
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST dumpprivkey <address>
```
start your new chain using the pubkey from above
then use importprivkey to import it in your new  chain
@pandaanu73

[27-Sep-19 02:47 PM] gcharang#6833
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST stop
```

@gcharang after launch can i modify

[27-Sep-19 02:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant modify launch params after launch (except -earlytxid, but thats another rabbithole)

[27-Sep-19 02:53 PM] gcharang#6833
changing any of the `-ac_` params will be a new chain

[27-Sep-19 02:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all smartchains haver same address/wif/pubkey tho, so you can make an address on KMD or another smartchain, import it into your smartchain, and use its pubkey

[27-Sep-19 03:06 PM] pandaanu73#7907
can i use this type, ./komodod -ac_name=rogCOIN -ac_supply=21000000 ac_cc=1 ac_reward=1000000000 -ac_founders_reward=100000000 -ac_founders=10 -ac_pubkey=034916536402c0c4cf53b05e3b5d948aacafede47df640b33cb89bd28179cd2d3f

[27-Sep-19 03:08 PM] gcharang#6833
yes
all the params start with `-ac_`
@pandaanu73 
-ac_name should be ALLCAPS

[27-Sep-19 03:31 PM] pandaanu73#7907
ok

[27-Sep-19 03:40 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang I'm using it on single node can i need to use 2terminal

[27-Sep-19 03:44 PM] gcharang#6833
you need to use atleast 3 terminals
2 for the `komodod`'s
1 for the komodo-cli
komodod has continous output and occupies a terminal
once you have followed the doc and understand how to give commands to both the daemons, my recommendation is to use: <https://github.com/gcharang/create-smartchain> it makes managing two nodes on the same system easier

[27-Sep-19 03:46 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang how to use response

[27-Sep-19 03:47 PM] gcharang#6833
what do you mean?

[27-Sep-19 03:51 PM] pandaanu73#7907
@gcharang where i get my coins

[27-Sep-19 03:55 PM] gcharang#6833
the initial supply(premine coins) will be on the daemon which has mined the first block
use `setgenerate true 1` to start mining with 1 processor
use `getinfo` to see number of blocks in the chain
use `getbalance` to check the balance of a daemon
starting the daemon with `-pubkey=03xxxxx` will send the premine and every block reward for that daemon to the address of the pubkey
notice the difference between `-ac_pubkey` and `-pubkey`
`-ac_pubkey` is part of the chain params, changing it changes the chain
`-pubkey` is just the daemon's owners's pubkey, can be different for every daemon

@gcharang how much time it take to mine a block

[27-Sep-19 04:26 PM] gcharang#6833
10 - 20 sec depending on your processor

[27-Sep-19 04:35 PM] gcharang#6833
@pandaanu73 10 -20 sec to mine the initial block
after that, blocks will take 1 minute to mine on average
or you can change it using `ac_blocktime`
