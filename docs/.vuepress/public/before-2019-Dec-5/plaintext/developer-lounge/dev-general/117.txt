is that the problem with the FSM branch ?

[04-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be... I havent pulled it down in some time...

[04-Feb-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are using LABS komodo for msot things these days lol

[04-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`
KomodoMiner runtime error: CreateNewBlock(): TestBlockValidity failed`

[04-Feb-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the problem... but why lol

[04-Feb-19 11:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so what is the solution  üòõ

[04-Feb-19 11:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
lol

[04-Feb-19 11:00 AM] D.rabbani#9094
why its refusing the connection :?

[04-Feb-19 11:06 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can i switcht to master branch again

[04-Feb-19 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  think i need to switch to master branch again

[04-Feb-19 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[04-Feb-19 11:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for doing that

[04-Feb-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not idea... Try dev branch or beta first or just try o tupdate FSM to the latest

[04-Feb-19 11:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
FSM is already latest

[04-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think unless I have anything else come up I will try to create a branch with just the PoS changes and other things that need to the PR to komodo, tomorrow. I will look at this bug then and see if I can reproiduce it. Took tired right now to do much.

[04-Feb-19 11:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yup

[04-Feb-19 11:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai okai do the rest

[04-Feb-19 11:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill try with dev branch

üëç 

[04-Feb-19 11:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
or master will be the best possibly

[04-Feb-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe tehre have been many changes and fixes lately... some of which have caused more issues lol... kind of a lottery atm

[04-Feb-19 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai üòÑ

[04-Feb-19 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no lukc iafter going thorugh each of the branches

[04-Feb-19 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its the same error ?:

[04-Feb-19 05:39 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hi i have the query  i want to change ac_supply = 100 billion premine  how can i do it ?

[04-Feb-19 05:39 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have tried but its giving me error upto 10 billion i am not facing any problem

[04-Feb-19 05:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is the exact value you are giving?

[04-Feb-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant to 100 billion, its too big

If a cryptocoin says they have "instant" transactions which are also secure against 51% attacks and double spends, they are lying.
Choose one or the other, not both.

[04-Feb-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto are you familiar with channels CC?

[05-Feb-19 02:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright not very much, i think Tony is, and @Mihailo wrote some of the recent code, I think?

[05-Feb-19 02:31 AM] Alright#0419
from what I understand, it's `"instant" transactions which are also secure against 51% attacks and double spends`

[05-Feb-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but u need to open a channel first, so the deposit is secured by dpow.

[05-Feb-19 02:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i am talking about coins that use masternodes to instantly verify transactions, because we all know that masternodes would never be evil, right?

[05-Feb-19 03:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
i was trying to explain to a potential new coin today, "instant transactions" must wait for notarization, with dpow

[05-Feb-19 03:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
so, they are not instant

[05-Feb-19 03:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
either you have the security of dpow, or instant-ness, but not both

[05-Feb-19 03:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you let masternodes do "instant" tx'es, and skip dpow consensus rules, that would be defeating the point of dpow

[05-Feb-19 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
channels is both once you have a channel open

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
not the best person to detail how it works

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
it is payment channels though

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
channels CC is *kind* of like a lightning network concept build on cryptoconditions

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
similar to LN

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
via CC

[05-Feb-19 03:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
once all the work is done to open the payment channel, then you can have instant tx's with dpow

[05-Feb-19 03:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure how much coordination needs to happen between alice and bob to make that instant tx, i think one needs to give their channel id to the other/etc

[05-Feb-19 03:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
mostly it seems like dash/pivx forks that allow masternodes to do "instant" xtns, and when they want to add dpow, they get a reality check, that allowing masternodes to pick the valid chain/block/etc, is risky

[05-Feb-19 03:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
it becomes a problem of whether masternodes or notary nodes choose the valid chain

[05-Feb-19 03:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
some coins think that notary nodes are masternodes, still. Like, that notary nodes take over the duties of their coins masternodes. I think I need to add a massive <blink> tag to Mastering DPoW that says "Notary nodes are not masternodes"

That would be a decent idea... LABS notary nodes are like master nodes... but not normal notary nodes üòâ

[05-Feb-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you can send funds in a noninteractive way. the destination address is a 1of2 CC address of both publkeys.

[05-Feb-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so open a channel and send, without any action by destination

[05-Feb-19 06:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
` you cant to 100 billion, its too big `

[05-Feb-19 06:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its big and i have come to know that int 64 is being to calculate the value so yup the max i can do is 10billion

[05-Feb-19 08:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright @dukeleto Channels CC is a payment mechanism like LN but on-chain. There is no coordination needed between Alice and Bob. Think of channels CC as a gift card for some store. You top up the card with funds (open a channel to Bob which will add funds to that channel on a 1of2 address), and then you use the card for paying (make a payment to Bob - releasing funds from channels address to Bob). And it is instant, no need to wait for confirmations/notarizations for a payment, as when opening channel with funds that tx needs to be notarized and from that point Bob is sure that he will get the funds as soon payment is made (gets in mempool).

@blackjoker

[05-Feb-19 11:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  i have a query regarding about the mining rewards to be decreased like after the initial 10 blocks i want my mining reward to be 0.001

[05-Feb-19 11:10 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is that something to do with -ac_halving

[05-Feb-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really... why would you need it to decrease after 10 block... if you want to do that, then best thing to do is use eras

[05-Feb-19 11:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
-ac_eras ?

[05-Feb-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Feb-19 11:11 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okay yehs i need to to do that its just like i need to decrease the reward after 10 blocks

[05-Feb-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know how the work exactly... @Alright  is the one to talk to there...  We will use them for LABS to start off with no blokc reward and slowly ramp it up like Verus did... you can easily use it to go backwards also.

[05-Feb-19 11:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so currently -ac_eras will do that job

[05-Feb-19 11:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for me

[05-Feb-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html#ac-eras

[05-Feb-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it will.. They are doncumented there iwth examples hopefully you an work it out

[05-Feb-19 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not you will need to get in contact with Alright

[05-Feb-19 11:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai then

[05-Feb-19 11:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill try i ahve seen the document but  i dont understand that how after initial 10 blocks ill decrease the reward

[05-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to make 2 eras

[05-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one with the first 10 blocks be a very high reward

[05-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then the second era have 0 or very small reward

[05-Feb-19 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so yes i am assuming the first 10 blocks to be very high rewards but i dont watn the reward to be increased lineraly i want the exact reward in all 10 blocks

[05-Feb-19 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
first 10 blocks and then 0.001 on the next blocks

[05-Feb-19 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
lets say i want 10 million as block reward on first 10 blocks

[05-Feb-19 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
liek 10 million each block

[05-Feb-19 11:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then 0.001 on next blocks unless it gets to my desired value

[05-Feb-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so use 2 eras and set the block reward to the amounjt you want,

[05-Feb-19 12:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but it will increase linearly like if i set -ac_reward =100000000000000000 , 10000  for 0.001

[05-Feb-19 12:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
will the first ten blocks get thesame reward each

[05-Feb-19 12:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
for suppose i have put ac end = 10, 0

[05-Feb-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[05-Feb-19 12:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai and no need for halving or decaying ?

[05-Feb-19 12:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just eras

[05-Feb-19 12:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because in documentation it tells different story

[05-Feb-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo thanks for explaining about channels CC

[05-Feb-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo to clarify, alice + bob need to coordinate to be on the same channel as each other, correct? One has to share a "channel id" somehow with the other?

[05-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
@dukeleto No. Alice needs to open a channel (create a channelopen tx) and that is it. The channel term is used to describe the behaviour of CC, but basically Alice sends funds to CC 1of2 address and that is the channel. In order for funds to be spent from that address, the creator (Alice) supplies password (hash) when issuing payment. This prevents Bob from spending it like it would be on regular 1of2 address without CC.

[05-Feb-19 11:17 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani what's the problem?

[05-Feb-19 11:18 PM] Alright#0419
You shouldn't need halving or decay set if you just manually set reward and end

[06-Feb-19 06:01 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright  thanks for the reply actually for the first 10 blocks i need different mining reward and for the rest of the blocks i need different mining reward

[06-Feb-19 06:02 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like i need to set eras=2

[06-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Alright#0419
komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -ac_supply=<premine in coins> -ac_reward=<first reward in sats>,<second reward in sats> -ac_eras=2 -ac_end=10,0

[06-Feb-19 06:03 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont want to end inifitely so can i just put the blocks number ? instead of zero

[06-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Alright#0419
if you could tell me what is confusing about the doc, that would be helpful
