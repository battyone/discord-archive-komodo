i dont understand how this achieves trustlessness

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] zack#6467
which user are we talking about here? Most people only sync their light node a couple times per week

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it just create a lot of forks? and do users have some tools to mark the state of the oracles they agree with?

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
let us ignore the lite nodes as they presumably have no voice

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] MyName#0491
`It seems like his issue is semantics and not with what the Komodo CC Oracle does`
It seems to me that it's more of a feelz issue of competition to market and economics more than semantics

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so fullnodes

[22-Mar-19 05:22 PM] zack#6467
The miners are incentivized to mine on the version of history where they can sell the tokens for a profit.

[22-Mar-19 05:23 PM] zack#6467
miners, exchanges, and channel hubs are basically the only full nodes in Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
how do the users tell their node to not follow the mainchain?

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like the Toracles is cool when there are a few number of specific questions to be asked

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] zack#6467
they could sync with either one github profile or another, depending on which version of consensus they want to use.

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
only native nodes mining or staking could chose the true chain. Each oracle would need to be a full node at minimum, though done have to min/stake, but if no one does, no new blocks means no forks, so that solves that.

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] MyName#0491
`The miners are incentivized to mine on the version of history where they can sell the tokens for a profit.`
So, if I pay you more then my data is more "valid" than competing data that pays you less?

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that doesnt seem very practical

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] zack#6467
what is more important is how much the users are paying for the different coins on each side of the fork.
The miners can only mine if they are paid enough rewards to cover the cost.

[22-Mar-19 05:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
doesnt imply trust either

[22-Mar-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems a lot of users need to be actively voting with their node for the Toracles to converge to reality

[22-Mar-19 05:25 PM] zack#6467
the traders aren't running a full node, but their trades still have the biggest influence on the outcome of the fork

[22-Mar-19 05:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
why would I agree with what is less profitable, regardless of truth?

[22-Mar-19 05:25 PM] zack#6467
in Amoveo a *oracle*is an on-chain datastructure. like an account or a channel.

[22-Mar-19 05:25 PM] zack#6467
each person is expected to make the most profitable decisions for themselves in Amoveo. we don't assume anyone is altruistic.

[22-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems easy to use mechanism for users to disagree with any specific oracle is needed, otherwise there is zero force pushing things toward the actual reality

[22-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so users can select from N forks, each with a displayed value of the various oracles states?

[22-Mar-19 05:26 PM] MyName#0491
`each person is expected to make the most profitable decisions for themselves in Amoveo. we don't assume anyone is altruistic.`
You do see the ability for that to create manipulated data, right?

[22-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
Neither do we assume that they are not altruistic. It is a secure oracle mechanism.

[22-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is trusting that people will pay more for the more true chain

[22-Mar-19 05:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
better to disincentivize  inaccurate data than to reward shared delusion

[22-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems there is not any convenient way to select the chain you agree with

[22-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
A basic assumption of Amoveo is that the version of history that is more accurate will have more valuable coins.

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] MyName#0491
` It is a secure oracle mechanism.`
Both cannot be true, either it's "secure" or it's "up to the highest bidder"

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can you trust an assumption?

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] zack#6467
if that isn't true, then Amoveo might not work.

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
does amoveo have forks all the time?

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
like all the time

[22-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it would need to have competing forks pretty much all the time for there to be a chain with the more valuable coins

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise there is just one mainchain

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] zack#6467
Every engineering solution makes some basic assumptions.
Bridge designers have assumptions about the maximum possible load, and the years until the bridge will be replaced.
Bitcoin's basic assumption is that it is always most profitable to mine on the top block.

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] MyName#0491
If I say "grass is blue" and history says "grass is green", then what you describe dictates that I can pay miners to agree that "grass is blue"

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo hasn't forked yet

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
why not just resync onto the more lucrative chain?

[22-Mar-19 05:29 PM] zack#6467
There is a balance of powers between traders, exchanges, miners, mining pools, and developers

but traders dont seem to know (or care) about what fork has what oracles state. I am confused how there is any reinforcement of the truth

[22-Mar-19 05:31 PM] zack#6467
what traders are you talking about?
People gambling in the channels before we know the outcome, or people reporting to the on-chain oracle after we know the outcome?

ty @FishyGuts

[22-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe theoretically it does, but the current implementation doesnt seem to have all the required things

oh, you mean btc/veo traders

[22-Mar-19 05:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
These conversations are what I long for in the ecosystem.  Thank you guys for having this discussion of minds.

[22-Mar-19 05:31 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what does `bad question` mean?

[22-Mar-19 05:31 PM] zack#6467
the oracle mechanism has an on-chain tool for moving your money back and forth between each side of the fork

[22-Mar-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but you said there hasnt been any forks

[22-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419

so there is nothing to choose between

[22-Mar-19 05:32 PM] zack#6467
right, the nash equilibrium is for one side of the fork to quickly go to zero value and die.
In most cases, it is a fork of 0 blocks long.

[22-Mar-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
how do the miners know the right state for all the oracles?

[22-Mar-19 05:33 PM] MyName#0491
_really wants to be in "jam/fold" mode every time you type that_

[22-Mar-19 05:33 PM] zack#6467
Before the oracle resolves, you can use it to make a bet. 
If the blockchain does fork, then you would win the bet on one side, and lose on the other.
This allows us to move the money between the forks.

[22-Mar-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so you have had such forks?

[22-Mar-19 05:34 PM] zack#6467
we have had contentious oracles, but none resulted in a fork

[22-Mar-19 05:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so its the miners that lose out for being"wrong"? are all miners oracles?

[22-Mar-19 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
how can the miners know the right state for the oracle?

[22-Mar-19 05:34 PM] zack#6467
the miners just process txs, they don't have to think about oracles generally.

[22-Mar-19 05:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but what if they end up on wrong chain?

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] MyName#0491
`In most cases, it is a fork of 0 blocks long.`
Meaning a race situation with an orphan?

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
passive investor is never on wrong chain?

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] zack#6467
if an oracle is about to lie, I would release a hard update and tell the miners about it, and they would verify the lie is coming and do the update to make sure that their mining pool will not follow the lying version

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so why mine instaed of buy?

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
a hard update? you mean hardfork?

[22-Mar-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
who is policing all the oracles?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seems only practical for events where you have enough time to do so

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so everyone is trusting you to be the policeman for all the oracles?

how do you know a oracle is about to "lie"?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] zack#6467
it would just prevent the mining pool from accepting any block that closes the oracle in a state we have agreed is lying.

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is manual intervention?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm just trying to figure out who gets puniched, who doesnt and what thier incentives for participation are

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] zack#6467
The people who bet in an oracle would notice that it is going to lie, and alert me

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
with blockchains isnt it assumed that it runs autimatically?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
without needing manual oversight?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] MyName#0491
`if an oracle is about to lie, I would release a hard update and tell the miners about it`
How is that "trustless" if _you_ get to decide what's a "lie" and what isn't?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant trust a lying oracle

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what if you die?

[22-Mar-19 05:36 PM] zack#6467
no one is going to waste so much money to make us actually have to do this manual intervention.

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lies everywhere with no policeman around?

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Donâ€™t be so sure

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] zack#6467
this is the theoretical scenario where someone wastes hundreds of thousands of dollars to test the limits of Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] zack#6467
It would be a wonderful day, since those hundreds of thousands of dollars would be distributed among everyone who participated in defending the truth of the oracle.

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
why would it cost so much

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If it is successful, wouldnâ€™t a competitor be incentivized to mess with you

[22-Mar-19 05:37 PM] zack#6467
if you make a bet on an obvious lie, other will come to bet against you to take your money.

[22-Mar-19 05:38 PM] zack#6467
so you have to bet quite a lot until everyone else runs out of money

[22-Mar-19 05:38 PM] zack#6467
Am an honored that you all have such an interest in Amoveo's oracle

[22-Mar-19 05:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm still tryna figure out how a non mining better loses more than aniner on the wrong chain

[22-Mar-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but who determines its a lie?
