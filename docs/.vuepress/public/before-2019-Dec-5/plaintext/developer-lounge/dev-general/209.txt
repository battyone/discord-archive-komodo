@CryptoMedication justified and productive feedback and criticism is welcome and highly appreciated. But there is no reason to become insulting and rude. Posts like `[...] as much of a dick as this guy [...]` are insults and will/can not be tolerated. **Take this as a final warning!**

IF you do think you have a good idea that justifies a Komodo Improvement Proposal then please do open a ticket on https://github.com/komodoplatform/komodo/issues - if you have such basic questions plz contact support next time which could have resolved your problem faster by answering directly or referring you to the right person.

step 1 - read the docs.
step 2 - ask a question in the appropriate channel, and be patient. search discord, read more, and you might figure out who is working on what you are interested in.
step 3 - avoid insulting devs, you might need their insight later - and it wont make other devs inclined to interact.

@Deleted User these problems plague all insight explorers I have seen on all chains I have seen

[02-Sep-19 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you fix them, plz send patches to KMD 😉

[02-Sep-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, every insight explorer instance uses different code

[02-Sep-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
So you actually need to say which versions of which explorer software you mean

[02-Sep-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
which insight version on which coin? Every repo is different code.

[02-Sep-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
"unparsed address" is common, many explorers don't render multisig output correctly, or show unparsed address for other reasons

[02-Sep-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have no idea what this particular chain is doing

[02-Sep-19 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it's problems are not "KMD"'s problem, this is 3rd party software trying to integrate with KMD software

[02-Sep-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are saying the `vin` of `0 DP` is invalid, it's actually a non-zero amount?

[02-Sep-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
explorer bugs are not komodod bugs. this is not a bug in KMD core. This is a bug in a 3rd party explorer

[02-Sep-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yeah, it sounds like a rendering bug

[02-Sep-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
i.e. the code which renders the UI of the explorer is not smart enough or something changed

[02-Sep-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
tiny changes in every chain make every explorer need slight changes

[02-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User I say this lovingly: All these problems are the problems of the DP coin, not KMD

[02-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
it would be nice if they didn't exist

[02-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
but KMD core people do not "own" that code, I don't know who does. Maybe @Decker if it's his explorer code

[02-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can't expect Decker's code to work perfectly with every single AC

[02-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a starting point

[02-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
verus had to make extensive changes to make their explorer compatible with 50/50 pos, so I expect many changes would be needed to make the explorer not shitty

[02-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
we don't have many pos64 chains doing advanced stuff with explorers, do we?

[02-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, the problem is pos64 + explorers

{Reactions}
💯 

[02-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
nobody ever cared, @Deleted User gets the prize! :troll_king:

{Reactions}
😅 

[02-Sep-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
likely that Deckers explorer repo still needs to learn about pos64 chains

[02-Sep-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
he is a busy guy

[02-Sep-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you can send a patch, that really will make things go faster

[02-Sep-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, sometimes you need to modify both sides

[02-Sep-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
insight explorer codebase scares me and i try not to touch it

[02-Sep-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
last time I did, I broke explorer.myhush.org for 6 months

[02-Sep-19 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User since you are more of a nodejs ninja, it should be much easier for you

[02-Sep-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the "only bitcore code" inside komodod is the addressindex, spentindex, timestampindex support. how it is used is external to the komodod

[02-Sep-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if the explorer is requiring some specific timestamps, then maybe remove that requirement

[02-Sep-19 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
how

[02-Sep-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain actually doesnt care about timestamps very much

[02-Sep-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only used for filtering out invalid blocks with invalid timestamps

[02-Sep-19 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User insight codebase is written poorly, and so for instance, for every new bit of data you want out of an RPC response, you need to write getters+setters and update various UI elements. It's horrible. Mostly likely, you have a rendering bug, which might need some help from the "middle-end"

[02-Sep-19 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
if there is any type of new RPC data or changed format, I would expect this kind of bug

[02-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
why should the explorer reject a valid tx due to timestamp

[02-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is good enough for the blockchain to be valid, the explorer needs to be able to display it

[02-Sep-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
without a specific tx/block that is valid that the explorer is rejecting, we can only guess

[02-Sep-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
even with that it is in the explorer that is being too strict

Hey just read an article about this being used by Hong Kong protesters, it's basically a bluetooth powered Meshnet to send messages and data to one another or broadcast to large groups of people nearby. <https://bridgefy.me/>

Anyone know if we would be able to broadcast transactions over it some how, or some other way to make KMD work with it.  Would be some cool to send directly or even "rain" coins onto users. Here's the article I read. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/09/02/hong-kong-protestors-using-mesh-messaging-app-china-cant-block-usage-up-3685/#242f7451135a>

[04-Sep-19 12:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar it's just a way to share files with bluetooth, run by a centralized US company

[04-Sep-19 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
broadcasting network messages is possible as long as there is connection established between devices.

[04-Sep-19 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the first thing to solve is to have stable strong connection between devices

[04-Sep-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
bluetooth is used in this case for the smallest payload to transmit over as much network of peers as possible

[04-Sep-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the text message.

[04-Sep-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't know how fully p2p it is, or centralized. The company makes a developer kit, to add to your android/iphone apps

[04-Sep-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the more load the network will have the more it will become difficult to manage.

[04-Sep-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also bigger network routing things is a hard challenge as I understood from previous findings.

[04-Sep-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
just because "X can't block it" doesn't mean you are not leaving a trail of metadata that will lead to bad things in the future

[04-Sep-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
Please be very careful of trusting these kinds of apps, or recommending them to people

[04-Sep-19 12:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you are interested then give this setup a try

really nice to see that now they are also utilising yaggdrasil in their setups 🙂

@grewalsatinder mesh with SBC's is cool

[04-Sep-19 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I never could setup 802.11s setup within my RasPi devices with various WiFi dongles I bought

[04-Sep-19 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll try to make it again

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if I could I can re start my old SuperMESH project

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but that is nowhere my priority on current tasks

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but sometimes I get board of current tasks and try to find something else to do 😄

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so will see 😄

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder what is on the top of your priority stack?

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to make a descriptive documentation of my attempts to make btc address from no 3rd party libs in golang

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder fun

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and extend it to further with various address generating BIPS standards

amongst 99 other things. But that is close to the top.

[04-Sep-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, I have a question about `gradle` for people

[04-Sep-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
who is a `gradle` ninja?

[04-Sep-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have a gradle build script that works fine with Gradle 5.x on OS X, but `gradle` that comes with Ubuntu is too old

[04-Sep-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
comes with 2.x, lulz

[04-Sep-19 12:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I can write a script to download gradle binaries, but is there a better solution?

[04-Sep-19 12:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
is there an apt-repo I can add to get new gradle binaries, that are trusted by debian?

[04-Sep-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙋 I'm not! 😁

[04-Sep-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326

I'll need to buy 2-3 of these to play a bit with 802.11s mesh network with RasPi4 🤔

[04-Sep-19 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
already has 2 RasPi4 🤔 and RockPi64 and NanoPi 🤔

[04-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh I wasn't trying to sell the app to any of us, or proclaim it is great or even good. I was just saying it would be cool to somehow get KMD working with it and ride some marketing coattails/broaden the KMD capability toolkit

[04-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar well, you are asking to allow bluetooth talk to your wallet

[04-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
the security implications are grave

[04-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
bluetooth is a cesspool of CVEs

[04-Sep-19 12:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
China will use CVEs/0-dayz against that shit

[04-Sep-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
Seriously, be safe and be paranoid. People will lose their lives over trusting some of these apps

[04-Sep-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
being cool and trendy is not worth people dying

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
So the answer is Yes it can be done, no it shouldn't because the security shouldn't be trusted as is. Reality is people are using this, 60k new downloads mostly from Hong Kong in the past week, their lives are already at risk with or without it. The current method of communications are not working because the traditional avenues are censored and/or aren't capable of talking in mass to people. Again, not trying to sell this, just think if people are looking for other solutions, and this being one of them, it would make sense if we can make our tech work with it (safely).

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Regnar#6164
"Being cool and trendy is not worth people dying" I dont know if you are saying us adding support is being cool and trendy but will lead to these people dying, or that the people using this are just using it to be cool and trendy and will lead to them dying. I think this just isn't written correctly, I think I understand what you are getting at though

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Regnar#6164
People trusting this as a true security solution to replace encrypted communications can be in danger, however using this knowing what it is (an app where anyone can see public messages, probably the meta data, and apps like WeChat can see who has this app downloaded anyway) is effective at what it is doing currently, spreading information to those around you quickly.

[04-Sep-19 01:12 PM] Regnar#6164
But the CVE part answered my question, thanks Duke

[04-Sep-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Regnar people will die because of that app

[04-Sep-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
because they trust it

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] Regnar#6164
Because they trust it to do what?
