What I meant by exchanges is when I withdraw from an exchange if the ntimelock is set or not and so is the utxo eligible the earn the reward

[08-Aug-18 02:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I would think all exchanges are using komodod, so yes it would be set

[08-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Nabob#5004
when transaction comes from exchange nlocktime is set, and here exchange is eligible for reward, so, we ask users to send  all amount to himself in  order that your transaction which earn   rewards based on utxo size

I am looking to pay a developer to package up Hush-NG binaries for Windows/Mac/etc: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng . A lot of the work is done (we have a yarn.lock) but it needs to be completed.  Name a bounty, can be paid in either HUSH or BTCH

@jl777c   it gives errors  of 179 blocks  when 240 expected.     (Explorer).  I counted.  I got 237

When creating a new assetchain, how much control does one have over the inflation model.

[10-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
is it possible to throw out the halving mechanism and replace it with something a little more, complicated?

[10-Aug-18 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What do you have in mind?

[10-Aug-18 09:59 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
its already running in my pow chain... but i want to have it going on a komodo assetchain as well so i can well.. im not sure yet... just thinking of future ideas for my roadmap

https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/assetchain-params.html lists the parameters but to do your function above would require a bit of custom code.

out of curiosity how to do assure consensus when using floating point?

[10-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I would have to ask my math guy

floating point is not consensus safe across all OS, compilers, etc

[10-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
huh.

[10-Aug-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it could easily end up off by a satoshi on different nodes

[10-Aug-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and then fork

[10-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I'll bring that up with him the moment he's up again. I have Peter Bushnell rebasing me in a few weeks. He was going to audit the code for me too so maybe he would have picked up on that but thank you for bringing it to my attention..

[10-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
yeah i understand that even just 1 sat could throw everything out..

[10-Aug-18 10:15 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
If this were to happen, how soon would it occur and under what conditions?

I'm more than 2 months into my 60 month inflation period and so far we have had no issue's.

Why not use Double or Float to represent currency?
I've always been told never to represent money with double or float types, and this time I pose the question to you: why? 

I'm sure there is a very good reason, I simply do not know what it is.

[10-Aug-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it would depend on how many different nodes end up with slightly different floating point libraries

[10-Aug-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
either as a software lib or from CPU

[10-Aug-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not guarantee to create problems

[10-Aug-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but you cant guarantee it wont

[10-Aug-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so unless you are very very careful, it could create a fork in some rare cases, but a simple thing would be numbers that dont divide evenly and how rounding is handled. with your massive equation above, it seems the risk for ending up being off by 1 satoshi is there, but would need some intensive verification across all the likely node floating point variations, Intel CPUs, AMD CPU and if you run on androids natively (this is likely where issues can happen) and also across OS

[10-Aug-18 10:21 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ok cool. well not cool, but its good i know this.

[10-Aug-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is usually much less work to avoid all this by not using floating point, but in your case it seems it is needed. Maybe some pregenerated table of uint64_t is the way to go

[10-Aug-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
assetchains can do linear interpolations of a variety of slopes

[10-Aug-18 10:22 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
all i want is something matching this curve.. it can be step changes. doesnt need to be smooth so too speak..

[10-Aug-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can experiment with a variety of parameters and use the getblockreward height rpc call to verify

i can do that though...

[10-Aug-18 10:23 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
instead of the block halving system. Ive been screamin for someone to try this instead... since 2013 in fact..

[10-Aug-18 10:23 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181

ok

[10-Aug-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
probably need multiple eras to approx that curve closer, but soon we should get the VRSC support for different eras

[10-Aug-18 10:24 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
neat...

[10-Aug-18 10:24 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
well as you see.. only need 5. right?

[10-Aug-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and I think with some experimentation you can get very close, maybe with fewer, just depends on how closely you need to match that curve

[10-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
5 would be fine but more the better.

[10-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ill keep playing with the idea and see what Hiyatus has to say

[10-Aug-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the decay iterates a fractional multiplier so you can get exponential decays of most

[10-Aug-18 10:29 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
in my current coin, is there different function i can use aside from double? uint64_t was it you said?

[10-Aug-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but it wont be able to do such calcs, so you need to approximate it with some sort of table of integers for different heights

[10-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ah k

[10-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
hrm maybe something to work on for when we rebase. bugger.

[10-Aug-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
or it might be easier to use the decay parameter to curvefit the decaying half, the increasing half might require a change in the assetchains code

[10-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
its interesting that this inflation model really isnt all that weird in regards to standard er, functions?, yet, no one has touched it basicaly.

[10-Aug-18 10:33 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
what are your thoughts on the inflation model itself

[10-Aug-18 10:33 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
from an economic standpoint

[10-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
the blockreward is has always been about artificial scarcity. like gold. and we now have the ability to map it. so.. why did crypto go down the road of using the legacy econmic models?

[10-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
i never understood why satoshi didnt use a sigmoid curve from the beginning

[10-Aug-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the complexity of doing it without floating point is likely one reason

[10-Aug-18 10:35 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
heh... I would find it pretty sad if that was the main reason satoshi didnt do bitcoin right.. and failed to ever mention it was something needing solving

[10-Aug-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
also being totally unknown before hand, it wouldnt have mattered if the rewards grew in the early years and now we are in the second half of your curve anyway

[10-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
1% of the global population has touched bitcoin. and thats rounding it up. 80% of bitcoin has been mined with 20% coming out slowly over the next 100 years.

[10-Aug-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
VRSC had an increasing,then decreasing block reward also, i dont think there is any single correct answer to coin emission, it seems there are a range of decent coin emissions

[10-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
oh really?

[10-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
i know of 2 others that tried and they failed

[10-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I know theres a few now with rewards that wax and wane with the networks health so to speak

[10-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
theres a million ways to do that and i decided a long time ago that a solid curve would be best.

Hi Guys, apologies for my question, but is there a info page where I can learn about Komodo and Komodo Platform and contribute on issues and other stuff as well?

[10-Aug-18 02:11 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Hi, I have additional question regarding the komodo interest (5 % reward). The time elapsed is counted from nLockTime so if I put nLockTime lets say a few days before current time do I get a bigger interest? I see that in Agama you are setting nLockTime as currenttime - 777

[10-Aug-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant backdate nLocktime very much, and nLocktime needs to be more than the median time of the 17 block window, which is about 8 minutes in the past

[10-Aug-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
I rounded to 777 to give a bit of room

What kind of support does Komodo have for golang tooling

[10-Aug-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
none yet. but if you can help create CC bindings for golang that would be very good and a bounty can be created

[10-Aug-18 06:45 PM] bonedaddy#1337
I know golang but don't know CC however I believe you can still implement the bindings without having to learn CC

[10-Aug-18 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@bonedaddy if you can read python and know the basics of RPCs, this should teach you about the CC API: https://github.com/letolabs/komodo/blob/cctests/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py
