that error means "you did something wrong"

[25-Jul-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
something against consensus rules

[25-Jul-19 01:39 PM] qqil#7977
i will try same but with synced node, just to make sure

[25-Jul-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
try `decoderawtransaction`

[25-Jul-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
and see what it gives you

[25-Jul-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
how are you building the raw transaction?

[25-Jul-19 01:42 PM] qqil#7977
strange thing is that first signature went ok, but throws when i'm trying to sign with second keypair

[25-Jul-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD `createrawtransaction` has various mods from BTC + ZEC

[25-Jul-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you found a bug, or maybe something is different from what you expect

[25-Jul-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
we need full raw xtn to tell

[25-Jul-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
make a github gist of `decoderawtransaction` and that will tell us something

@qqil I would like to see the exact RPC command you are using, as well as the output of `decoderawtransaction` on the raw hex that you give to `createrawtransaction`

[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
createrawtransaction will gladly make garbage for you, that signrawtransaction will later tell you about, if you are lucky

[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil are you using CLI RPC or using the HTTP API via some language binding?

[25-Jul-19 01:51 PM] qqil#7977
http rpc call

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] qqil#7977
it is result of createrawtransaction

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] qqil#7977
and i'm trying to sign first input with two wifs, that were involved (their pubkeys) in multisig address generation

[25-Jul-19 01:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is what I wanted in the gist 😅

[25-Jul-19 01:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's ok

[25-Jul-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil exactly which commit of KMD are you using? There were some recent changes to createrawtransaction

[25-Jul-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Decker your expansive raw transaction knowledge may be called upon soon

[25-Jul-19 01:55 PM] qqil#7977
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/dev-multios-0.4.0a-alpha/linux_0.4.0a.tar.gz

[25-Jul-19 01:55 PM] qqil#7977
this one

[25-Jul-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, June 10th

[25-Jul-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't think that has @Decker 's most recent changes, which makes me think this bug is on your side, not on KMD side

[25-Jul-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil can you show the exact full RPC command used to create the hex?

[25-Jul-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you use `komodo-cli` you won't need to deal with user/pass stuff

[25-Jul-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
`komodo-cli -ac_name=MYCOIN createrawtransaction ...`

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] qqil#7977

interesting, are you running kmd inside of docker or something?

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] qqil#7977
yes

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
lulz

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] qqil#7977
i have huge setup with online node, offline node for multisig, external signer endpoint

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] qqil#7977
etc..

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
very interesting

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] qqil#7977
electrumx also

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
which user does komodod run as?

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need to have ~/.komodo/komodo.conf exist and be valid

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
looks like your unix user setup is preventing that

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] qqil#7977
it exists, but it empty

[25-Jul-19 01:58 PM] qqil#7977
but currently it is not the point of discuss, i'm ok with passing user/pass

[25-Jul-19 01:59 PM] qqil#7977
instead of holding it inside .conf

[25-Jul-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok

[25-Jul-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
using `-rpcuser`/etc is fine, that is what the regtest test suite does

[25-Jul-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
what exact `createrawtransaction` command are you using?

[25-Jul-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
I haven't done a lot of multisig/raw transaction stuff, and using the RPCs is definitely very "picky". They are very particular about getting input values in a certain way

[25-Jul-19 02:02 PM] qqil#7977
yeah, i will try to debug more.. i will comeback with result a bit later..

[25-Jul-19 02:03 PM] qqil#7977
main pain is that different coins use different method to sign/create tx

[25-Jul-19 02:03 PM] qqil#7977
some use signrawtransactions... some use signrawtransactionwithkey...

[25-Jul-19 02:03 PM] qqil#7977
i'm already tired of integrating that utxo zoo

[25-Jul-19 02:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@qqil see if this works for your purpose: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/gui/agama/create-multisig-address.html
https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.5.7-4

[25-Jul-19 02:09 PM] qqil#7977
i will try to check if it will produce same address as my js wallet for multisig address

[25-Jul-19 02:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@qqil it has signature function too
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/gui/agama/sign-multisig-transaction.html

[25-Jul-19 02:13 PM] qqil#7977
cool, thank you

[25-Jul-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil as a general rule to understand KMD, you can understand that ZEC (and KMD) forked from BTC 0.11.2 and have changed very few internals to taddrs since then

[25-Jul-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
So latest BTC docs might not apply, you might want to look how things were done in BTC 0.11

[25-Jul-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then, we have all our tweaks/additions, but I don't think we make backward-incompat changes to createrawtransaction

[25-Jul-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil make sure that `validateaddress` on the addresses in your xtn says that the addrs are actually in your wallet

[25-Jul-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
do not use "accounts"

[25-Jul-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
It will make many things break

[25-Jul-19 02:18 PM] qqil#7977
what do you mean in 'your wallet'?

[25-Jul-19 02:18 PM] qqil#7977
i'm not using wallet mode for node

[25-Jul-19 02:18 PM] qqil#7977
i'm just passing private keys (wifs)

[25-Jul-19 02:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil you have `disablewallet=1` ?

[25-Jul-19 02:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
or whatever it's called

[25-Jul-19 02:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i need to see full config and/or CLI flags used to start komodod

[25-Jul-19 04:28 PM] qqil#7977
@dukeleto yes, i will post a bit later when i will be near pc

[25-Jul-19 04:28 PM] qqil#7977
disablewallet is working ok for other coins, btw

[25-Jul-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil disablewallet is incompatible with DPoW and therefore KMD and all KMD asset chains

[25-Jul-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
unless you don't want DPoW, i guess you could use it on a non-dpow chain, but it still won't work

[25-Jul-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not tested much and very few people ever used it

[25-Jul-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
When HUSH converted to a KMD asset chain, one mining pool reported a bug about disablewallet not working anymore, nobody else noticed

[25-Jul-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
disablewallet probably works in ZEC, tho I don't see anybody testing it much. I think they have regtests for it, inherited from btc

[25-Jul-19 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
Pretty sure `disablewallet` is considered unsupported in KMD world, @jl777c can you verify?

[25-Jul-19 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil not having a wallet is most likely causing your problems

[25-Jul-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not one of the mandatory test points from what i can remember. too many things assume a wallet

[25-Jul-19 04:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody could probably make it work in some cases, maybe @qqil can hack it together. But some things will never work, such as dpow, and nSPV needs dpow

[25-Jul-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil KMD also turns on txindex=1 by default and others. We don't subscribe to various BTC beliefs about nodes not having full indexes. Various reasons come together and make `disablewallet` a real pain, and it's not extensively used. So it was thrown under the bus, basically. It might be possible to revive, but nobody seems to care

[25-Jul-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
Maybe you are the person that cares 😃

[25-Jul-19 04:42 PM] qqil#7977
also i did not tried yet to sign multisig twice with synced node, because i have like wallet that works with synced node and external signer api that simply sign input using offline node... and first call signrawtransaction to synced node went ok.

[28-Jul-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326

One is unfinished and other is pre-release

what's this thinking... Which one should the exchange adopt?

This is written on the link that you provided @TonyL

"This is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage!"

🤔 I don't think it will be safe for the exchange to start using it or is there any change made recently?

[29-Jul-19 07:51 PM] vbhvsth#7915
@TonyL

[29-Jul-19 07:55 PM] TonyL#3577
It's standart disclaimer, all software in the crypto industry by nature experimental and unfinished

[29-Jul-19 07:56 PM] TonyL#3577
This release passed trough a lot of QA tests and code security reviewing/auditing

[29-Jul-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have concerns about some specific changes since last release or specific part of the code feel free to open github issue or pull request

[29-Jul-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if it is the right channel to report a small issue:
Using jl777/komodo beta branch, I launch one kmd instance without issue with one user
I create a new user, I compiled again kmd, download a bootstrap and launch it with default komodo.conf
I realized that I forgot to change the rpcport (there is already one instance of kmd running on the default rpcport launched by the first user) : the error displayed is correct but there is a technical error at the end:
```Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See debug log for details.
komodod: scheduler.cpp:45: CScheduler::~CScheduler(): Assertion `nThreadsServicingQueue == 0' failed.```

[29-Jul-19 10:03 PM] phm87#7395
and about running my second instance, I had to do this:
```bind=127.0.0.1:7772
rpcport=12345
p2pport=7773```
7770 and 7771 are already used by the first instance
