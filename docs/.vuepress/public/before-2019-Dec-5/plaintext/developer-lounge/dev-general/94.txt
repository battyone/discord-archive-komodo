[17-Dec-18 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until you end up bannign all nodes... I have a node that is doing it constantly right now

[17-Dec-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I stopped it with this issue until I could find out where to look ..

[17-Dec-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is a new one then

[17-Dec-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its old ... but getting it to happen has proven difficult

[17-Dec-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this node does when ever I start it

[17-Dec-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I think I can copy the chain, and then start it as many times as we need to track it down.

[17-Dec-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
thanks

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  i need some help

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
regarding  another asset chain

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have just updated the komodo on that server

[17-Dec-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like the staking node 1 and 2

[17-Dec-18 01:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i tried to get info the longest chain is 0 😦

[17-Dec-18 01:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
blocks are  22345 ?

[17-Dec-18 01:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can someone help

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have started the daemon

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
or do i need to wait for the longest chain to be synced

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
???

[17-Dec-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
longestchain is advisory

[17-Dec-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if the chain is in sync, then the chain is in sync

[17-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the longest chain is 0 for that mr @jl777c

[17-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
what to do ? and i can get info directly on it

[17-Dec-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like it took time for DION to get info :/

[17-Dec-18 01:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i havent started staking on that  Mr @jl777c

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
longest chain is the longest chain consensus among peers

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont have more than 1 peer, it would just be 0

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
what height are you on?

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
what height is the blockchain?

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if the same, then you are in sync

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
22345

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the staking is stopped

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on that

[17-Dec-18 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can you please check in case

[17-Dec-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
both nodes are 22345?

[17-Dec-18 01:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes mr @jl777c  sapling is now activated

Is there any downside to doing this? I couldnt figure out exactly what this is checking, but adding an INSYNC check to it has stopped my node banning peers on sync.

As far as I could tell in testing, the blocks between 814000 and 1 million didnt have any issues. But as soon as it got over 1M it started to flood errors and bans. This has fixed it perfectly.

[17-Dec-18 06:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I also fixed the ram staker, but its still locking up RPC calls, any advice on how to make it not do that would be appriciated.

[17-Dec-18 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all I know is none of my Intels have that

[17-Dec-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
do you ahve 12,000 utxos and the ram staker activated ?

[17-Dec-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on latest master anything over 1000 utxos is using it... it was 10,000 before.

[17-Dec-18 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I did when I was running MGNX, but not in the last couple weeks

[17-Dec-18 06:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in any case tomorrow I will consolidate CFEK to a new address that doesnt take 1H to rscan the chain and the try eith less utxos and see where it starts to lock... but there is clearly an issue... a minig thread shouldnt affect RPC calls.

[17-Dec-18 06:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I got around somethig similar on the streaer in marketmaker by just adding a second RPC thread and port 😂

[17-Dec-18 06:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think thats going to help here though

[17-Dec-18 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
with KOMODO_INSYNC it basically skips that validation until your node is in sync. are you 100% sure valid blocks are being rejected?

[17-Dec-18 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as deadlocks go maybe you are doing a recursive LOCK() on some mutex?

[17-Dec-18 11:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes 100% sure valid block are being rejected

[17-Dec-18 11:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It syncs just banns peers the entire time

[17-Dec-18 11:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What doe that check even do?

[17-Dec-18 11:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess I'll look at it again today, I have the chain just before a million. Maybe I can print out what blocks are failing

[17-Dec-18 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, please. valid blocks shouldnt fail. it indicates a data error

[17-Dec-18 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i had to write that code so it wasnt easy to figure out what it does

[17-Dec-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it makes sure that a notary mined block has the notary signed 0.0001 -> 0.00005 tx

[17-Dec-18 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a multipart puzzle

[17-Dec-18 11:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh I thought it had something to do with that, but wasnt by sure. Will do

[17-Dec-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately if a valid block is failing, that means it is not seeing a notary pubkey or getting the wrong scriptPubKey or corrupted coinbase

[17-Dec-18 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
just print the various values and it should show why it is failing

[17-Dec-18 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
though if it is a timing related thing (blocks processed async being too slow for when it is being used) then adding the printouts could slow it down enough to make it work

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It appears to be a timing thing yes, but will investigate.

[18-Dec-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  
When your online please msg me, I am kind of very confused as to whats happenign with this sync issue. The function returns a valid block as long as the block is not a notary mined block, but only does so when its received in advance, and the height is over 1 million. Maybe as a fix this check can be moved so it only checks when joinging the blocks together rather than in the CheckBlockHeader ?

`return(-1 * (komodo_electednotary(&num,script+1,height,0) >= 0) * (height > 1000000));`
I know exactly why its happening but I dont know what the reasoning behind this code is^^^^ multiplies by 1 if the height is over 1 million blocks. Instantly starts failing. It will still sync (but much slower and goes though nearly all of the avalibe peers, unless you keep doing clearbanned).
Disabling this check during sync, lets it sync to the longest chain without any issues.

[18-Dec-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c Dont worry about it I fixed it 😄

[18-Dec-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Not sure where to put this, but I figure everyone should get to learn from my stupidity.....
Never forget that if you deal with raw transactions and set nlocktime:
sapling opt-out chains (such as OOT) need to use the old format
sapling chains need to use the new format (including nExpiryHeight)
if you use the new format on an opt-out, since signrawtransaction sees the hex as valid, you will have the vins you want but alter the vout and send your funds to the wrong address!

[18-Dec-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Litterally every issue with the staking loop is fixed because of this one thing

[18-Dec-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Before it was inside a LOCK(cs_main)

[18-Dec-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the daemon couldnt even receive blocks!

[18-Dec-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is most likely why it shits out bloks like it does too.

[18-Dec-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For now I'm keeping this to myself, as it changes how the whole mining loop operates

you can put LOCK() in an inside loop, so it locks/unlocks many times, the important thing is to not be locking for long periods at a time

[18-Dec-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was locking the cs_main for the entire CreateBlockfunction

[18-Dec-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its wasnt easy to make it release the lock half way down
