[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
as we need to generate the mining reward on one address only

[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
too late for that now

[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] D.rabbani#9094
oh ðŸ˜®

[12-Nov-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
juts use -pubkey

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to mine everything to a single address ðŸ¤·

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we used the -pubkey thouhgh

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes we did that

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but it stopped at 4944

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you nede 64 seg ids ... and at least 2 node sot stake

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
go getbalance64

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and chek your utxos are eleigible

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] D.rabbani#9094
getbalance 64?

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are all immature .. the chain cannot progress and you will need to restart it following the directions

[12-Nov-18 06:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its an rpc call

[12-Nov-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo-cli help

[12-Nov-18 06:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ye

[12-Nov-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is your best friend

[12-Nov-18 06:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
haha thanks @blackjok3r  indeed i learned so much from you ðŸ˜ƒ appreciated

[12-Nov-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries ... we tested this a LOT but didnt really document it too well

[12-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it ususally not a great idea to use 100% PoS .. because even at 99% you can hit it with massive hash rate to "unstick it"

[12-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not to say you cant do 100% .. just split the funds and amke sure yo uahev enough utxos

[12-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one thing

[12-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
miniing to the -pubkey

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
id would adivse not to stake ont hat node at all...

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have 2 nodes with 64 address each with 2 utxo

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and a 3rd receiving all the mined utxos... and not staking

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
should we create an address on another staking node ?

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the full balance is on one node

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the other node balance is zero

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You dont need to stake the entire balance

[12-Nov-18 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ahan then what?\

[12-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need enough utxos that they are always elegible to mine a block ... it take 100 blocks after a utxo finds a block

[12-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for it to be able to find another

[12-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they all end up waiting for a block, it cannot find any more blocks

[12-Nov-18 06:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
true that is what is happening now

[12-Nov-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... it happens often on our test chains, with just a single node staking

[12-Nov-18 06:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  still the same issue can we use pos splitter now ?

[12-Nov-18 06:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt it .... without blocks happening you cant amke any transactions

[12-Nov-18 06:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
any suggestions what is the best thing to do now ?

[12-Nov-18 06:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
finding my self  sinking in the middle of nowehere ðŸ˜¦

[12-Nov-18 06:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i think need to delete the asset chain now

[12-Nov-18 06:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and make a new one with the similar nam

[12-Nov-18 06:50 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i gues

[12-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just start with the same name ðŸ¤·

[12-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can as long as you dont have other copies out there

[12-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or change the supply by 1

[12-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
or you can invalidateblock on all nodes 110 blocks behind

[12-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
then send funds to more than 1 address and more than 100 utxos

[12-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if the entire chain has less than 100 utxos, it is guaranteed to stall a 100% PoS chain

[12-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
think about it

[12-Nov-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if it needs 100 blocks to mature and there are less than 100 utxo....

[12-Nov-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
or make it 99% PoS, then you can always mine if things get stuck

[12-Nov-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be good if the documentation makes a special warning about 100% PoS chains. It is assumed that any 100% PoS chain will have some sort of distribution and not be all in one utxo

[12-Nov-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS chains are vulnerable in the early days, totally unlike PoW chains

[12-Nov-18 08:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
unfortunately now i have delete it ðŸ˜„

[12-Nov-18 08:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but thanks @jl777c for your kind advice  i will for sure follow these steps next time

[12-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@jl777c  currently we have removed the directory using rm -R

[12-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but the thing is we dont know how to clean it

[12-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
properly

[12-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we delete the COIN  thorugh rm -R in .komodo

[12-Nov-18 08:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we have two nodes and on both nodes we have done the same

[12-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
now we are doing the procedures 5 blocks have been built but unfortunately havent recieved any balcne yet

[12-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its 0.0000  on both the nodes

[12-Nov-18 08:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if you can please help us out here

[12-Nov-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure you imported the private key ðŸ˜‰

[12-Nov-18 10:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes ðŸ˜„

[12-Nov-18 10:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094

can you please help me out someone

[12-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its giving waiting for the blocks from the past one hour ?

[12-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
process is 103% complete in the status

[12-Nov-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[12-Nov-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[12-Nov-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not much experance with the explorers

[12-Nov-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
build it with the script

[12-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure the install-explorers.sh has teh name of your chain intead of KMD and the default AC

[12-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start it

[12-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop the daemon

[12-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start the daemon again with -reindex option

[12-Nov-18 11:48 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
What is default AC? where do we config that?

change that line to your AC and disable the rest

[12-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the explorer isnt working

[12-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to reindex your chain

[12-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with the explorer running

[12-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all I know ... and I dont know anything about NGNX lol

[12-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Can we reindex using cli?

[12-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Or from Daemon?

[12-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. just stop the daemone and restart it with -reindex

[12-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Alright thanks great help to me though

[12-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
while the explorer is still running .. it will flood errors . but you cannot start the explorer after the daemon sometimes.

[12-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its to do with the .conf the explorer will buid you

[12-Nov-18 12:33 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Can anyone explain in 100% POS why the staking stops if there  is only one address that is staking? As we have experienced no block is created after around 4500 blocks. What is the logic behind this number of 4500 blocks?

[12-Nov-18 12:35 PM] Mylo#8306
don't know but happy to try to reproduce if you can put list of commands on a gist in github.   the first 100 blocks need to have all 64segids with funds split into them.  other than that i haven't used a 100%PoS AC i'm sorry that's all i've got.
