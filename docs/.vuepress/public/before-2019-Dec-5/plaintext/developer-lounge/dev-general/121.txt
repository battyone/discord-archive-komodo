staraight awy

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What I do.

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is mine the first block

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the stop mining

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
split the utxos

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then start poW on the otehr node

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then wait for blok 9 to be mined

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then start staking

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
after 9 blocks shall i set setgenerate true 0 ?

[10-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never had it fail.. that said, 100% PoS never really worked for me... not aure why 🤷

[10-Feb-19 12:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
aahh okay

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should wrok finr on jl777 repo though, didnt work in myt testing on a diffrent code base

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have FSM branch

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should work... but maybe it doesnt..

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know after POS the confirmation goes to zero

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and i have 0 utxos to mine from

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
itsa sending it to stake maybe...

[10-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to split them before block 10

[10-Feb-19 12:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it worked 😄

[10-Feb-19 12:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks alot

@grewalsatinder so you had to make some edits to get it to work, I think, and mac is not yet working correctly on `dev` branch, right?

[10-Feb-19 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just one more thing even though now i am staking only with 10000  the difficulty is 46

[10-Feb-19 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now its 106 :?

[10-Feb-19 01:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the blocks are smooth :/

[10-Feb-19 01:29 PM] D.rabbani#9094
any specific reason ?

[10-Feb-19 01:48 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright

[10-Feb-19 01:48 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r

[10-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
difficulty on PoS chain is ttally random and means nothing, if there is only one staking node

[10-Feb-19 01:50 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i have only one staking node

[10-Feb-19 01:50 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am concerned about the chain

[10-Feb-19 01:50 PM] D.rabbani#9094
as if it will stop

[10-Feb-19 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the difficulty is 750

[10-Feb-19 01:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
at the moment 😦

[10-Feb-19 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Anyone know what would cause or how to fix
`ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64`
error on a mackbook?

[10-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
compiled for non x86_64 architectures?

[10-Feb-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, but I can't figure out how/why
I thought I was getting it because I moofed something in the customization of qt wallet for pirate, but I get the exact same error on a clean build of both decker's repo and ip-gpu's

[10-Feb-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using build-mac.sh

[10-Feb-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about building on mac, nor ocean

[10-Feb-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
me either ☹

[11-Feb-19 12:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto I did not try dev... haven't compiled jl777 brqnch since then. The only edits I did are there in that mag I shared.
Will try both dev and jl777 branch again and let you know 
🙂

[11-Feb-19 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I had similar error when messed with `brew` dependencies (had `curl` package installed by brew)

[11-Feb-19 03:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TonyL any idea how to get it right?

[11-Feb-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`brew uninstall curl`

[11-Feb-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
If you get this `ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64` error in similar place as I had for sure

[11-Feb-19 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tnks, will try

[11-Feb-19 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no such keg

[11-Feb-19 04:11 AM] TonyL#3577
In which place of build you get this error?

[11-Feb-19 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looks like when the dependency script is trying to link curl

[11-Feb-19 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
try to remove `libcurl` from end of  komodo/depends/packages/packages.mk file

[11-Feb-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it was `brew uninstall libcurl` not `curl` - I had same error which possible to solve with this workaround in `packages.mk` - one day I've cleaned my brew dependencies totally on my Mac and  it helped to resolve this issue permanently

[11-Feb-19 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ty ty ty, that seems to have fixed that bit

You tipped @TonyL **20 KMD**

[11-Feb-19 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally spent 12 hrs scouring the internet trying to find a solution

[11-Feb-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, happy that issue resolved now on your side 👍

[11-Feb-19 04:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL now to fix the bits that I likely screwed up trying to brand it 😛

😂 

[11-Feb-19 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ironically I just realized that this was the exact same issue I had with building komodo 3 weeks ago (I was so mentally blind to it that I didn't even realize that you wrote 'komodo') 🤦🏽 
#IthinkIhaveAlzheimers

[11-Feb-19 04:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Happens 😃

[11-Feb-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
That feeling when looking for problem in code around 1 hour and issue is that " ' " != ' " '

[11-Feb-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😅  
Its always something tiny and small 😄

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can anyone help my ac chain is not syncing on my 3rd node

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
in FSM branch

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have tried dev branch as well

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have two nodes

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
now i have setup the third node

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but the blocks are not syncing

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[11-Feb-19 11:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  anything i am missing ?

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
naje sure the params/port.magic all match

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
they are matching 😄

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its showing connections as 2 as well

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but it synced till 17 blocks

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on FSM branch and dev branch and master branch

[11-Feb-19 11:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
😄

[11-Feb-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are blocks happening../.. ive seen in the past it wont sync unless it sees block happrening when the chain is short

[11-Feb-19 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes the blocks are happening

[11-Feb-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are those your IPs?

[11-Feb-19 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
sorry yes

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
them its not connected

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no these werent my ips

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they aere not your ips then its just trying to connect to KMD seed ndoes.. its a bug.. I fixed it in LABS

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh 😮

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it requires specific source code changes for each china to stop it conencting... so its not something KMD can have merged

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can have users needing to change source code lol

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so what i need to do  😄

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh 😮

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its an ignorable error.. its just annoying that it fills he logs up

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh god 😄

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i need to wait

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
for hours for it to sync

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😄

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not what should be ahppening.

[11-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
