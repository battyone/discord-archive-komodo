basically I ended up with a dual install of 2 and 3 and both are broken

[29-Dec-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... I have come to love arch for this stuff as you can always install mostly the very latest versions... although for `komodod` the newer g++ usisally wont compile it.

[29-Dec-18 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I guess I had nothing better to do today than an entire reinstall ☹

[29-Dec-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first time that happened to me, took 2 days to get laptop back online. Only machine I have that can get into notary server aswell.. never again... made a seperate home partition now. Need to make a csv of all my packages still, so I cna reinstall in a few hours with a script I found.

[29-Dec-18 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I use 1 partition, but I have a 2nd drive for storage, so most of my reinstall time is waiting for folders to copy back

[29-Dec-18 10:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When I set this PC up I did it very wrong... It has 2x 1TB nvme 970's... The OS runs off a partition on 1, and then the VM's all run off the toher one... but I found out after wards, you can partition the drive and pass though the partitions directly negates teh nvem a bit using a HDD file 😦 really cannot be arsed to fix it now though... Although need to migrate all my virtual box VMs to QEMU/KVM anyways so might have to change it

[29-Dec-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It has 2x 1TB nvme 970's...`
After this build, there is no part of me that is ever using identical drives again

[29-Dec-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The OS runs off a partition on 1, and then the VM's all run off the toher one..`
That's pretty much what I do, but also use "VMs" drive for storage

[29-Dec-18 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
made a RAID1 ZFS on a pair of 8TB drives for storage aswell... like movies and music and pictures n shit... not sure I needed to raid it tbh... but its safer that way and 8TB is a farily large amount of space. Not using even ahlf of it yet.

[29-Dec-18 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my RAID setup on my server (where I put long-term storage) was a feken nightmare, one RAID for operation and one for data

[29-Dec-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah aftwer the amount of time i spent getting all this working... once it did, I wanted to start agin and so it diffrently... maybe a second time around wont take so long lol.

[29-Dec-18 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, the main part was trying to sort out the BIOS settings because the server board has built-in Intel sw RAID capabilities, but it's a pile of shit

[29-Dec-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep IMO just use ZFS ... it was super easy to get working apart from some silly depedany issues with the manjaro package manager, using the AUR directly to build it worked fine, pretty sure you can do that on any distro. but not 100% sure.

[29-Dec-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
due to licensing issues, it cannot be compiled into the linux kernel directly 😦

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the tribal wisdom is "never modify a system Python/Perl/Ruby" outside of the package system, because so many system scripts are written in those languages and things break really bad when you do that. It's very common in the Perl world to break everything, just from updates some modules, not even the Perl binary.

[29-Dec-18 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
all dynamic languages have these nice things now (pythonbrew, rbenv, etc..) to isolate things. It didn't exist when I was coding with dinosaurs in the 90's

[29-Dec-18 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never could get it fixed and did a OS reinstall after 4 hrs of trying

[29-Dec-18 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
that may have been the best bet at that point, unfuckulating it gets to be NP-complete

[29-Dec-18 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the best thing about this setup is that my mouse gestures aside, a reinstall doesn't take very long 😃

[29-Dec-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
very often in the past, at $work, i would git version control my module libraries, so I could fix this kind of thing, but you need pre-planning for that

[29-Dec-18 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
that way, if I installed a module + deps that broke shit, I could undo the breakage with git somewhat easily. That requires common checkpoints of known good working setups, which I would do once a day or so, when things changed

[29-Dec-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I need to put a 2nd non-matching drive in here anyway, so I'll order it on Monday and just dd a backup onto the server and then a "reinstall" will only take like 30 minutes

[29-Dec-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it blows when you have bios showing you the "options" of
`CT1000MX500SSD1
CT1000MX500SSD1`
and trying to figure out which is OS and which is data 😛

[29-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Mylo#8306
I did that *once* to an rpm based system.  Exactly the same.  Same great idea, same fekedness, same reinstallation fix.

[30-Dec-18 12:55 AM] Mylo#8306
Some gamedev wants insight-api abilities to getUnspentUtxos for any address on the blockchain, from the daemon alone, no insight.  How much work would this be?

Also, they are enquiring about it on a non-komodo blockchain - basically want to highlight that what they want is heaps of work, best to write to insight-api and make game blockchain agnostic.

[30-Dec-18 12:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
you can 
importaddress
and than listunspent

[30-Dec-18 01:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
maybe duke can do that in a short period of time it looks like getsnapshot already has knowledge of all the utxo's
bool CBlockTreeDB::ReadAddressUnspentIndex(uint160 addressHash, int type,
                                           std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue> > &unspentOutputs)
so a 
getutxos ADDRESS might be possible with just an additional rpc call?

[30-Dec-18 01:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks @CHMEX - address of other ppl, so cannot importkey.
It’s for a dude working on digibyte integration - thanks for super detail response

[30-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Mylo#8306
Interesting if possible anyway, could be handy on kmd.  Will follow what gamedev is doing anyway

[30-Dec-18 01:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
just fyi
importaddress does not need the privkey it just imports the address but of course you dont want to import all addresses 😃

[30-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Mylo#8306
I didn’t know!

[30-Dec-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't use the wallet and import address for that

👍 

[30-Dec-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean u could but it would be unreliable and slow. You really want an addressindex.

[30-Dec-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At the very least

[30-Dec-18 06:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo @CHMEX i think it would be possible with addressindex

[30-Dec-18 06:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
that would require merging bitcore into GAME, to be able to use an addressindex. KMD + all asset chains + HUSH already have these indexes

[30-Dec-18 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i believe the internals functions exist at the C++ level, there would need to be an RPC wrapper to get access to them

[30-Dec-18 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
to add such an RPC to KMD or HUSH

[30-Dec-18 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
merging bitcore is a lot more work than writing the RPC wrapper, so if a coin doesn't already have an addressindex, bitcore is the big hurdle

[30-Dec-18 07:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
actually, it's already an RPC

[30-Dec-18 07:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD and all asset chains also have that RPC, it comes with bitcore

[30-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Mylo#8306
ah cool....pooor digibyte game dev then.... thanks for dbl checking @dukeleto handy for gamedev marketing

[30-Dec-18 01:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
thank you very much duke! I tried it with addressindex and it works!

[30-Dec-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX no problem, i vaguely remembered that there were already various RPCs that sounded like what was needed

[30-Dec-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
getsnapshot RPC is like a summary of running getaddressutxos on every address with utxos

[30-Dec-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo the fact that KMD has bitcore, maybe that is a reason for some coins to migrate to a KMD AC, so they can get all these indexes. Something to mention when people are wondering if they should be an AC or not

[30-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Mylo#8306
Noted.  Already in a draft for tech Tuesday and will go into dev portal. Eg game devs may want this functionality from a blockchain as has been seen over the weekend!!

it supposed to be a regular wif key because computergenie was able to derive the pubkey. I didnt even expect that because the wifkey is so different to a zc privkey...

[01-Jan-19 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@klunex I got the address by importing the privkey you posted through cli

I'm having difficulty finding API endpoints for Insight explorers. Iquidus explorers aren't a problem and Utrum has simple docs on site like this <https://ootexplorer.com/info> but I was wondering if we can add similar docs to some of the Insight explorers like <https://kmdexplorer.io> and <http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info> It seems to me they would be helpful, though I may be missing something.

[01-Jan-19 11:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I used this one <http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD>  to submit circulating supply to various coin sites to get market caps updated, but it was a pita to find (I didn't find it, CHMEX gave me it)

[01-Jan-19 11:39 PM] Regnar#6164
Might also be good to add in that same information here <https://docs.komodoplatform.com>

for dexstats.info `insight-api` becomes `insight-api-komodo`

@D.rabbani 
Are you still having wallet corruption issues? 
I have managed to engineer a fix! It is not merged to KMD at this stage. If you want I can push this change to a new branch of komodo for you to test it. 
Instead of rescanning the entire wallet on load, it simply removes the corrupt txns and then adds them back. about 7 trillion times faster 😉

[04-Jan-19 03:02 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@dukeleto would need to ask

[04-Jan-19 03:15 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
probably calling a non sapling C library

[04-Jan-19 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what happened before was it would trigger a -rescan with `SetSoftBoolArg`

[04-Jan-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that would take hours one these wallets with over 100k txns

[04-Jan-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the corrupted tx would still be there

[04-Jan-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead it removes the corrupted txns ... then does `GetTransaction` on them, and if the exist it adds them back to the wallet

[04-Jan-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
leaving the rest of the 99k txns alone

this was the easiest solution/dodgy work around

[04-Jan-19 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r ok, interesting. so it has slightly a different goal. Have you tested your code in dealing with wallets that have more than just a tx corrupt?

[04-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The code to "fix" corrupt txns was already there./... It just dint work in this case and it was horribly slow

[04-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it needed a full rescan

[04-Jan-19 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
you have to look at every xtn to know if it's corrupt, right?
