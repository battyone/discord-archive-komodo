@CHMEX how can i fork the code and change it my smartchain values

[10-Oct-19 06:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
gilardh was the dev who did it for hush
there is a config file github.com/MyHush/myhushwallet/blob/master/src/components/lib/hushjs/config.js
github.com/MyHush/myhushwallet/blob/master/src/components/pages/Wallet.jsx#L1066
has the explorer urls

[10-Oct-19 11:47 AM] gcharang#6833
@zhang the hush web wallet might help you github.com/MyHush/myhushwallet/

[10-Oct-19 11:48 AM] zhang#4216
Thank you, let me see

[10-Oct-19 02:39 PM] zhang#4216
@gcharang Successful, thank you for your help, I will create a new library to help others use

[10-Oct-19 03:03 PM] Oszy#5734
@Mylo is this docker image still up do date? imylomylo/jl777-komodo-dev

[11-Oct-19 02:08 AM] gcharang#6833
@zhang tyvm, we will be glad to add it here <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/resources/third-party-repos-resources.html> once it is ready

[11-Oct-19 04:51 AM] Mylo#8306
@Oszy if you build it yourself it will pull the latest, however the one on hub.docker is better to use https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-0.html#the-unique-nature-of-the-docker-image-tutorials

@jl777c can you tell me what is wrong with this signed tx hex
```
0400008085202f8901d62f7590b126e356425d47de81e26bcb8075db873991315c04d0ce5ec677e828010000006b48304502210095c3c6e66b1405e8ee62a0ce1417886df0bd781a26e0630b2ce8886af3a64f0202203cb40e62a5fe64877fa7918df6b9b39dac8d4d68071b1e46b7f363e071b618850121020161a7874c79e267947fcb64b1714ba150b6fde60acde8bcfd84adaeb487b1bdffffffff01f0874b00000000001976a914dad677b1a2cab64e28e67466ac0ab60e1b0fa70188ac00000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
decoded: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/KTtK9qRdCC/

the cli output for sendrawtransaction:
```
error code: -25
error message:
```
prints in debug.log
```
ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found
```
I've checked that the txn input is present on the blockchain

I have created the hex by modifying a library that can create txns for zcash

[11-Oct-19 06:45 AM] gcharang#6833
sorry, nvm
the lib didn't deal well with scriptPubkey of type:
```
020161a7874c79e267947fcb64b1714ba150b6fde60acde8bcfd84adaeb487b1bd OP_CHECKSIG
```

I got it to build a correct txn for the type
```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 06b84b69179dd150e1bf0fee17e06797df413961 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

[11-Oct-19 06:46 AM] gcharang#6833
may be the error message could be improved? it should maybe say that the signature is invalid?

[11-Oct-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
that is from BTC code and likely it would mean if tx inputs are not found, it would show the new error

@zhang it looks good
did you test if it works for signing a vin of type p2pk ?

[11-Oct-19 02:37 PM] zhang#4216
No, I only did the case inside test.js

[11-Oct-19 02:38 PM] gcharang#6833
I was messing around with https://github.com/gcharang/bitgo-utxo-lib and managed to get it sign a p2pkh txn
the fork you have of bitgo-utxo-lib seems to already have KMD
I will try using it
anyways, great work

smart chain ÔºüI haven't heard of it.

[11-Oct-19 02:48 PM] gcharang#6833
A Komodo Smart Chain is an independent blockchain that you can launch with custom parameters
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html>
@zhang 
they also have support for utxo smart contracts
ex: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/channels.html>

[11-Oct-19 02:51 PM] gcharang#6833
@zhang the ISC lisence is as permissive as the MIT one correct?

[11-Oct-19 02:53 PM] zhang#4216
Yes

[11-Oct-19 02:53 PM] zhang#4216
This is the default of npm.

[11-Oct-19 02:54 PM] zhang#4216
@gcharang I won't use smart chain for the time being.

[11-Oct-19 02:55 PM] gcharang#6833
np, just wondered why the interest in a Komodo txn builder

[11-Oct-19 02:55 PM] zhang#4216
Well, I'm making a multi-chain wallet.

[11-Oct-19 02:56 PM] zhang#4216
I have completed 47 main chainsÔºåThis is something that makes me feel interesting.

[11-Oct-19 02:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@zhang that's great. please notify us once it is ready

you might want to know that komodo has a thing called active user rewards
this package can explain how they are calculated <https://github.com/atomiclabs/get-komodo-rewards>
explanation: <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/coin-emission.html#rewards>
the summary is that, in the KMD chain, under certain conditions, the sum of vins can be less than sum of vouts

[11-Oct-19 03:00 PM] zhang#4216
OK

[11-Oct-19 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r @Alright do you know of any changes to the KMD mempool code that could trigger this weird assertion? As far as I understand, this assertion is being triggered on Hush mainnet in xtns which spend utxos from the same block, i.e. "spending from the mempool". I am trying to figure out the exact xtn that triggers it: https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/issues/36

TLDR: it's a bug in spending UTXOs from the mempool that themselves came from a z=>t xtn

[12-Oct-19 12:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ this is a bug in KMD and all KMD asset chains. That guy is still alive and well and thinks you are a waste of time, as always, so blocked you are

`came from a z=>t xtn`
is not a "bug in KMD" (as you can't even do that in KMD), but OK

can `getNotarisationsForBlock` be made to accept integers as strings also?

```
fails with the error `{"code":-1,"message":"cclib method [evalcode] [JSON params]\n"}`
not sure what to change

my guess is that combine is not a parameter

[14-Oct-19 11:48 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright @jl777c ^

[14-Oct-19 12:27 PM] Oszy#5734
Let's prettify
`{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "curltest",
  "method": "cclib",
  "params": [
    "combine",
    "18",
    "0225f1cbbda1a0c406bb8f6dc7a589d88b2f9e28cd4fdb3f59139f8aff1f5d270a",
    "02d3431950c2f0f9654217b6ce3d44468d3a9ca7255741767fdeee7c5ec6b47567"
  ]
}`

So the first one from CLI runs fine, and the curl call with same params fails?

no, just a curl directly
@Oszy

[14-Oct-19 12:35 PM] Oszy#5734
ah okay, there's no combine in that just that's why

[14-Oct-19 12:38 PM] gcharang#6833
I think the problem is with the modules that are loaded through ac_cclib
to give them commands, the method names are preceded by the word cclib
so, it looks like there are 2 method names
