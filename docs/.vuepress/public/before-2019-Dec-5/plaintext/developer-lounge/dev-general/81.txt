[10-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i will validate address and ill get private key is that what you mean ?

[10-Dec-18 08:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like how does the mechanism works?

[10-Dec-18 08:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and in which address it will import priv key

[10-Dec-18 08:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean i am concerned about that

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes'

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
iued POS splitter

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
used *

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so  i means i will have to rerun the command

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
64 times

[10-Dec-18 08:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for storing all the private keys

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and it will store to particular address as well

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so when i runt he daemon it will

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
create a new wallet.dat file

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then i can import priv keys in that

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks for that

[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i will do that 64 times

[10-Dec-18 08:30 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks for the help @webworker01

[10-Dec-18 08:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[10-Dec-18 08:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill do that

[10-Dec-18 08:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks alot @webworker01

[10-Dec-18 08:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094

just to confirm i'm doing this correctly for an article: 
i want to know what time sapling activation for Verus was done:

1.  Find block height for activation:  227520 (src code)
2. Get blockhash of 227520 using https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/blockchain.html#getblockhash

```
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getblockhash 227520
0000000000003848c00178d5787cc9c8bbc30f87d65d511bbb0b7e567634d0a1 
```

3. Get blockheader using https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/blockchain.html#getblockheader

```
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getblockheader <<HASH>>
{                                                                                                                                                                                                             
  "hash": "snipped", 
  "confirmations": 56114
  "height": 227520,  
  "version": 4,  
  "merkleroot": "...snipped...", 
  "finalsaplingroot": "...snipped...",                                                                                                                     
  "time": 1540954856,    
```

4. Use date command from cli to convert from unixtime to readable format
```
$ date --date="@1540954856"
Wed Oct 31 03:00:56 UTC 2018
```

VRSC was height activated

[10-Dec-18 10:13 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks, yep just wanted the date this height was reached, looks like oct 31 @ 0300UTC

[10-Dec-18 12:56 PM] radix42#3743
@grewalsatinder yeah I was gonna work on it yesterday, which was eaten by migraines, it‚Äôs top of list today

[10-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani https://github.com/stakedchain/pos64splitter
use the `importlist.py` script here

Just did it yesterday, don't have readme updated yet. Just run `./importlist.py` in the same directory as your list.py, it'll ask you which chain you want to do it on, and it'll import all the keys to the daemon

[10-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
Ah wait I changed the format, clone that repo and replace `importlist.py` with this
https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64splitter/blob/9487f58f8d3427e064cd3debe4be70a8332d2da6/importlist.py

In the middle of the first test build after merging the FSM branch into my arm64 dev branch rn @grewalsatinder and @jl777c

[10-Dec-18 05:27 PM] radix42#3743
Although I may have forgotten to pull over some stuff arm wants from my Zcash arm branch....we shall see shortly!

coolpirate 

[10-Dec-18 06:46 PM] radix42#3743
Ugh, yes I forgot to fix the rust compiler it downloads, that was quick....now I‚Äôm wading into VerusHash stuff....which is pretty x86 specific but I think I found a way around that with examples from when Monero added arm64 and used what looks like many of the same proc features

would have multiple addresses?

[10-Dec-18 08:04 PM] Alright#0419
single vout = single address always, yes?

[10-Dec-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
original style multisig

[10-Dec-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
where the multisig redeemscript is the vout

[10-Dec-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
all msig uses p2sh now, so not those

[10-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
So safe for scripts to assume there will only ever be one?

[10-Dec-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean old ancient legacy style

unless someone is doing some really weird things

[10-Dec-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
not even sure if it will be mined

[10-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
"really weird things" <- yes this

[10-Dec-18 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@radix42 excellent!! Plz keep us updated with updates. Thanks mate üôÇ

[10-Dec-18 09:34 PM] radix42#3743
The verus stuff is very x86-y

{Reactions}
üòû 

[10-Dec-18 10:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@radix42 I think you can just exclude the x86 stuff and compile the portable only... Or just disable verushash all together lol.

[10-Dec-18 10:50 PM] radix42#3743
I was wondering if I can just easily disable verushash

[10-Dec-18 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
for now its fine, verushash is being updated anyway

[10-Dec-18 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the portable version should compile for any processor though

[10-Dec-18 10:51 PM] radix42#3743
Oh there ALL KINDS of x86 shit that doesn‚Äôt look it at first glance

[10-Dec-18 10:53 PM] radix42#3743
Also, at least in the FSM branch it‚Äôs building libsnark In depends and in-tree in src/

[10-Dec-18 10:53 PM] radix42#3743
portable.....isn‚Äôt

[10-Dec-18 10:53 PM] radix42#3743
üò¢

[10-Dec-18 10:55 PM] radix42#3743
well I mean yeah it is within x86 family

[10-Dec-18 11:01 PM] radix42#3743
I lost some sanity points reading the  library that the Monero code uses to wrap those x86 aes calls into arm64 equivalents

[10-Dec-18 11:01 PM] radix42#3743
(external to Monero library not bagging on them)

[10-Dec-18 11:04 PM] radix42#3743
Their shit is actually a handy Rosetta Stone for converting stuff using x86 vector and crypto extensions to arm64

[10-Dec-18 11:05 PM] radix42#3743
The sanity draining library was a contrib by nvidia

*goes to look for ‚Äîno-verushash knob*

[10-Dec-18 11:18 PM] radix42#3743
Unless I‚Äôm not forcing it to use the portable version @jl777c , is that possible?

[10-Dec-18 11:22 PM] radix42#3743
Ohhh it WAS dying in the non portable one

[10-Dec-18 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not familiar with the build process at all

[10-Dec-18 11:22 PM] radix42#3743
I am reading makefiles

[10-Dec-18 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but i know it builds on CPU without the fancy AES instructions

[10-Dec-18 11:29 PM] radix42#3743
Ahhhh it looks like it builds both and figures out which to use at runtime fml

[10-Dec-18 11:31 PM] radix42#3743
And uses x86 only build flags for both in Makefile.am

[10-Dec-18 11:32 PM] radix42#3743
Gotta deal with family stuff, back to this tonight or in the morning

[11-Dec-18 12:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm 99% sure it does not build the AES stuff on a CPU that does not have it ... this was changed some time in the last few months. Maybe ask mike about it ?

[11-Dec-18 12:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@@radix42 M not sure if @miketout is around here, but maybe he can be of help best for Verus stuff.
Would really appreciate your help Mike. In tries to solve compilation issues of komodod for arm64. üôè

[11-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Mylo#8306
The x86-ness in VerusHash came from a wintel man :trollface:

[11-Dec-18 12:49 AM] Mylo#8306
Be interesting if VH can work with arm.  Maybe some arm chips have the x86 stuff licensed, but not all?

[11-Dec-18 01:39 AM] radix42#3743
I‚Äôll ask Mike later

[11-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unlikley arm chips have AVX and AES instructions, but there are portable VerusHash functions that are used in older CPUs that should work on arm just fine.

[11-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cannot use them to mine.. but at keast it builds and runs.

[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi there again  i have sme unusual question

[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
which i

[11-Dec-18 09:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is there any way we can know the balance in the corrupted wallet.dat file

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
though i have stored the priv keys of the 64 addresses but i need to confirm with the balance

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
of the previous wallet.dat file

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is there any way i can know

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r my friend üòÑ

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hello

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
üòÉ

[11-Dec-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No as the balance is not stored on the wallet.dat

[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the keys are stored on te wallet.dat

[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then it reads the balance from the blockchain.

[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if you imported all the keys.

[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you have all the balance

[11-Dec-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try -salvagewallet

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean i have got the balance restored but i am not sure as if it is same with the previous balance

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i need to do the salvage wallet command on the corrupted wallet.dat file ?

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need to... but it cant hurt

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just incase there were any extra keys.

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
nope

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
there werent

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
copy the wallet.dat you ahve now after stopping the daemon.

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have used the POS splitter

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then start it with -salvagewallet option with the old wallet.dat in place.

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant hurt to do this... but if you are 100% you have all the private keys, then there is no reason to do it.

[11-Dec-18 09:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so do you mean shall i copy the file and paste it into previous wallet.dat?
