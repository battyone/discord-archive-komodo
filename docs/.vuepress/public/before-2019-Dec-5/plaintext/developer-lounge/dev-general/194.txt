can you make a PR into dev?

jl777/FSM is currently isolated due to the massive changes from brand new CC and nSPV

    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {

I first read about this idea almost two years ago, the concept has been expanded a lot but still incomplete. Is it interesting? `A third alternative... is to use the usual zero-confirmation payment approach, but add a special feature to the transaction that will act as a forfeit, should the scammer attempt a double spend of the money that he sent to the merchant`  https://gist.github.com/awemany/619a5722d129dec25abf5de211d971bd I know channel-cc but for using with many recipient needs a system of liquidity hubs that don't exist yet, isn't it?

@jl777c "10X engineer" is a very very divisive term in US silicon valley tech world

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
never heard of it

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
some people use it plainly, to mean a dev that is 10X or more productive than others

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
but usually, it's used negatively

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a big backlash against "rockstar devs" aka "10X engineer"

i.e. somebody that gets special treatment

10x engineers are rare, if you find one don’t make eye contact. Approach slowly with eyes lowered and hands faced up. When you’re within 1.5 meters the 10x can’t observe you.

If everybody sits at their desk 8 hours, and reads all the company emails, why should they be treated any less than somebody that is 10X or more productive? That is their reasoning.

[13-Jul-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
When 99% of your employees are not 10X, you must keep the majority happy

then reconsiderblock on the first block of the real chain

> why should an order(s) magnitude more productive dev not be treated like an entire 10 dev team?

As a species we are incapable of treating ourselves fairly, or even in seeing ourselves fairly. 

Only when we're surrounded by and involved in pure Chaos do we ever approach true fairness.

 100,000 years of evolution and we total suck at manufacturing fairness.

I choose to punt. 

Let's colonize Europa, Mars, and Vega ASAP. 

The universe is but a trough of distractions for humans. 

There's probably some other parallel universe where all the aliens that can actually deal with facts live. They sent us here as a massive distraction to keep us from meddling in the affairs of inter-universal peace.
