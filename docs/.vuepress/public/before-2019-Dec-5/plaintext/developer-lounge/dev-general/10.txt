pyth <tab> <tab> you'll have other python versions installed probably

[15-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip==9.0.3
Requirement already up-to-date: pip==9.0.3 in /home/siddhartha/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages
You are using pip version 9.0.3, however version 18.0 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
```

[15-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Mylo#8306
don't upgrade, i went to v10 and nothing worked

[15-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
$ python
python             python2-config     python3.6m         python3m-config

[15-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
indeed

[15-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Mylo#8306
`python3 -m pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild`

[15-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
worked!

[15-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Mylo#8306
`python3 -m pip install --user sphinx_rtd_theme`

[15-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
well, a bit of a red river at the end

[15-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Mylo#8306
oh i'm root on this system!

[15-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Mylo#8306
`sudo su -` and just bludgeon it til it installs

[15-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
do you rec root, or not?

With npm, I try to stay off of it. It causes lots of issues. I lost some crypto, in fact, due to `sudo npm install`!

[15-Aug-18 11:25 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[15-Aug-18 11:25 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
```

[15-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Mylo#8306
sounds good

[15-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying it

[15-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Mylo#8306
`man sudo`

[15-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's working with sudo

[15-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm on a very very very dev server on a vps, even though there's these intel cpu vulnerabilities , so being root to me on this thing isn't important - yeah follow good sudo practise üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
didn't use `man sudo`. I've only recently encountered the `man` command.

[15-Aug-18 11:28 AM] Mylo#8306
`man date` comes in handy forreal

[15-Aug-18 11:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
lol, I'm a married `man`, not sure what I'd use it for.

[15-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Mylo#8306
a chuckle.  man date <space> <space> and you have options

[15-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Mylo#8306
`python3 -m pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild` and `python3 -m pip install --user sphinx_rtd_theme` and you should be okay then

[15-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, my wife is going to like my work obsession even less after this.

[15-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, I did the other command already and it worked fine, (I used sudo), but the `make html` command is buggy

[15-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Lots of these red warnings. Ok to ignore?

```

[15-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Mylo#8306
ok, so only some of these will install despite what sphinx docs website says
```
  990  python3 -m pip install sphinxjp.themes.bizstyle
 1009  python3 -m pip install sphinxjp.themes.nature
 1010  python3 -m pip install sphinxjp.themes.pyramid
 1011  python3 -m pip install sphinxjp.themes.*
 1012  python3 -m pip install sphinxjp.themes

 1150  cd /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/sphinx/themes/bizstyle
```
but you can see for the bizstyle theme, that's where you can customize it

[15-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
man date 
Display all 9774 possibilities? (y or n)
```

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so install all of the above, correct?

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(referring to your comment)

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Mylo#8306
weird, no don't bother

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
lol

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no, that was unrelated

[15-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Mylo#8306
this is what bizstyle looks like http://149.28.170.40/html/ this is what rtd theme looks like blockchain.businessapps.com.au

[15-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The sphinx theme is fine.

[15-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Mylo#8306
those red warnings.... well coins/list is a file i created.  bound to have errors ::P

[15-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the one on blockchain.businessapps.com.au

[15-Aug-18 11:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[15-Aug-18 11:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[15-Aug-18 11:34 AM] Mylo#8306
hehe

[15-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Mylo#8306
dw about the warnings, they can get fixed another day

[15-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The index.html file in the build folder seems to run okay.

[15-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
alright.

[15-Aug-18 11:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, so...let's see... I think from here I can play around some more. 

I'm not really sure if we need all the work I've done. 

That was mostly just my own personal capstone project...

[15-Aug-18 11:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But, I'm wondering where I would go from here that would be most useful.

[15-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Do you mind brainstorming over voice when you get some freetime? Doesn't have to be right now.

[15-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Mylo#8306
2moro would suit heaps more.  i was up 26 hours yesterday and had 4 hrs sleep today so talking will drain my last morsels of energy, i'm already lying down üôè

[15-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Mylo#8306
cool that's cool re you capstone thingy, i had a subject on my recent fling with a course some years ago - wasn't around the first time i went through (i think).  the sphinx stuff is pretty good.  just needs some re-org, which we're working on and getting the komodoshi's learning centre started with it too.

[15-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
of course

[15-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what's the komodoshi's learning centre?

[15-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Mylo#8306
"we're" <-- i haven't contributed to it for a few weeks now.  i should ask angelina/shossain.  i tried doing marketmaker stuff from our existing docs and it was a bit of `mare.

[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I'll see if I can grab one of them for a conversation, too.

[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Go get some rest

[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you for the help. Much appreciated.

[15-Aug-18 11:46 AM] Mylo#8306
some doc re-org and education stuff

[15-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let's chat tomorrow. I have a lot of questions.

It's possible that I may be in charge of some of the writing things coming up soon -- adding to the white paper and increasing the UX experience of Komodo documentation.

It's more writing stuff (what I'm already experienced in), but I've told Steve since I first started working here that I'm trying to shift into automation and coding. 

It may be a good fit for me to manage the documentation here and also to write simple tutorials in our education center. That's kind of what I think everyone was thinking.

I'd be happy, since it'd be coding related. I'm just hoping that I can have some kind of coding responsibility in the underlying code for the documentation center, if it would be useful for the team.

[15-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We're also looking at getting that quareterly notary node transparency report automated. 

Putting it together would be doable for me, now. I kind of have the hang  of things. But I'm not sure where it would fit in. We have so many disparate websites. The idea of "komodo resources" project is to bring a lot of the useful tools of our ecosystem into a one-stop shop.

So, there'd be some information pulled from dexstats.info, some from notarynodes.info, some from the docs/education center, and then some from atomicexplorer...

[15-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah check out the planning pic so far in the internal team chat above ca's CVE vulnerability message.  the most recent screenshot of stuff has "Online Resources" for each of the product/services (agama, barterdex, dico, plus assetchains, cc, dev, education to be added) - all that stuff needs QA _plus_ curation.  we've got docs, but trying to setup marketmaker from another coin community needs a bit more polish.  we've got the people for the polish, but we need more curation, few more fundamental tutorials for self empowered learning.  heaps to do in not a lot of time - all do-able.

[15-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
good deal.
I don't mean to keep you up.

Feel free to sleep now and we'll talk later.

I'll see if I can talk with Steve tomorrow, too. 

Going to just polish up what I have with the Komodo Resources project and then will call it done. 

First programming portfolio piece almost finished. üòõ Huzzah.

it seems all this GUI discussion is better in gui-development?

[15-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's just web app development.

Sorry if it's cluttering up the channel. Where would you prefer it to go?

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
is web app of interest to gui developers?

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
...depends, I guess?

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not sure.

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is #dev-gui

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You're the expert, i suppose. I'll take it there.

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I though web apps were guis

[15-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ü§∑

[15-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It depends on how we look at it.

[15-Aug-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there will be other gui devs there who can benefit from web apps

[15-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Most of what I was doing (on this personal project) was learning how to use a postgresql database.

Is that a GUI feature?

[15-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm happy to take it there.

[15-Aug-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, sorry, i thought it was a gui

[15-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's node.js

[15-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but it has a GUI

[15-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Not really sure where to draw the line, but I'll keep an eye on the other channel as well. I didn't know about it, so I'm glad you told me.

[15-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'd like to turn it into a React or Vue GUI, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. I've just about spent all the time I have to spend on it, for now.

[15-Aug-18 02:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
anyway, back to work. thanks.

[15-Aug-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe in he gui channel, some gui dev will be able to help make a gui

[15-Aug-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, node.js  is why i assumed it was a gui

[15-Aug-18 02:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, interesting. So you see Node as more of a GUI thing.

I thought it was mostly for server side applications. I'm just using ejs and express to render a gui, since I don't have time to make a rest api and then build a react or vue app.

[15-Aug-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
I just view anything not inside a coin daemon as "gui" üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, this is exactly what was going through my head. üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need 20 years of C dev exp so not call myself a gui developer, apparently. üòÉ
