I just started it again, takes a few mins to get going with TX's...

[31-May-18 12:47 PM] imylomylo#0000
no limit

[31-May-18 12:48 PM] imylomylo#0000
only limit atm is writes per second

[31-May-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] smk762#0000

I just added a pipe to my stats.txt from the curl to see if there is any error

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#0000
started again

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] imylomylo#0000
no log

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#0000
nothing is printing from the curl lol

[31-May-18 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#0000
weird

[31-May-18 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Disabled blaster, so I can check logs. maybe curl isnt installed in the container... its there in earlier layers, but maybe not the last one.

[31-May-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 01:05 PM] jl777#0000
you need the curl with SSL

[31-May-18 01:05 PM] imylomylo#0000
k one sec.  the note about -X is ignorable

[31-May-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah wrong curl. wont take long to change it.

[31-May-18 01:06 PM] imylomylo#0000
```libcurl4-gnutls-dev```

[31-May-18 01:06 PM] imylomylo#0000
on deb/ubuntu

[31-May-18 01:06 PM] imylomylo#0000
well, ubuntu 16.04

[31-May-18 01:07 PM] imylomylo#0000
and ```curl```

[31-May-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 01:08 PM] imylomylo#0000
you should subscribe to my install komodo guide, only $99 on sale now

[31-May-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#0000
marketmaker needs libcurl4-openssl-dev

[31-May-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#0000
which uninstalls libcurl4-gnutls-dev

[31-May-18 01:08 PM] imylomylo#0000
ah shit a brick.

[31-May-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I guess I need to compile marketmaker from source in docker build ?

[31-May-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#0000
where ever this executable came from its compiled with the wrong libcurl

[31-May-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ok, I got an idea. I will compile a marketmaker on empty ubuntu 16.04 using  libcurl4-gnutls-dev

[31-May-18 01:13 PM] imylomylo#0000
use the paris box

[31-May-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the vultr VPS is fine,

[31-May-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#0000
where the docker containers are hosted. all I installed was docker

[31-May-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#0000
tbh not sure if marketmaker will compile with that ssl but its worth a try.

[31-May-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#0000
nope ðŸ˜ž

[31-May-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#0000
guess this is why I was told to use 2 containers lol

[31-May-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I will figure it out, at least we know its working apart from this. ðŸ™‚

[31-May-18 01:19 PM] imylomylo#0000
compile curl?

How to build curl with the latest openssl?
So I build openssl

./config
make
sudo make install
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl `which openssl`
I build curl

./configure --with-ssl 
make
make install
OpenSSL looks installed correctl...

[31-May-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#0000
thats what I am going to try

[31-May-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#0000
just changing the ssl in the dockerfile from earlier on. it seems curl works with that openssl on normal ubuntu

[31-May-18 01:55 PM] imylomylo#0000
worst case, can setup a reverse proxy with http ->apache-> https

hey blackjok3r i've gotta zzzzz soon.  wanna just write to file and i'll import it at 5am?  i've got work at 8am tomorrow.

[31-May-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I dont think its a curl missing https problem

[31-May-18 02:19 PM] blackjok3r#0000
go ahead and sleep I am rebuilding the whole docker image

[31-May-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#0000
with the openssl-dev package instead of gnutils right from the start.

[31-May-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Google tells me it can be possibly the URL format that can throw this error too. The only difference from the script I used locally and the docker is that dock was ENV var.

[31-May-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I will work it out, probably something stupid

[31-May-18 02:22 PM] jl777#0000
you need the curl lib with ssl in it

[31-May-18 02:22 PM] jl777#0000
i said this already

[31-May-18 02:22 PM] jl777#0000
libssl-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev

[31-May-18 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#0000
you cant install `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` and libcurl4-openssl-dev` at the same time

[31-May-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#0000
so that can't be the problem. I used curl with no ssl installed on the same URL not inside docker and it worked fine

[31-May-18 02:24 PM] jl777#0000
libcurl4-gnutls-dev should be the one

[31-May-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#0000
marketmaker wont compile with that

[31-May-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#0000
tired it

[31-May-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#0000
quotes around URL

[31-May-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#0000
removed them and now its working :faceplm:

[31-May-18 02:32 PM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r do you need help with curl/docker or it was sorted out?

[31-May-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#0000
no it wasnt even that lol

[31-May-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it gave an SSL error because there was "" around the URL

[31-May-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#0000
wasted heaps of time

[31-May-18 02:34 PM] patchkez#0000
haha, ok

[31-May-18 02:35 PM] patchkez#0000
I will review your changes in that PR you opened. So the container works fine now, or any other issues to be solved?

[31-May-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#0000
We need 2 TxBlaster nodes for 1 payment TX. So I need to change some things.

[31-May-18 02:35 PM] blackjok3r#0000
1 blaster is not filling mempool for all blocks

[31-May-18 02:37 PM] patchkez#0000
I see, can you run 2 txblaster processes from one container?

[31-May-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ðŸ¤”

[31-May-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe, it would require running 2 marketmakers, but he issues is not maxed out CPU

[31-May-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the problem is you also need 2x passphrase etc

[31-May-18 02:38 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the list of ENV vars on the image is already huge lol

[31-May-18 02:39 PM] patchkez#0000
high number of vars should not be a problem

[31-May-18 02:39 PM] patchkez#0000
what do you mean by _maxed out CPU_?

[31-May-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah thats ok, just hard to track. I think I can use `sendmany` to fund 2 address at the same time.

[31-May-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The generation of transactions does not appear to be limited by CPU power

[31-May-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it is bottlenecked by something else

[31-May-18 02:40 PM] patchkez#0000
did you check # of TIME_WAIT connections?

[31-May-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#0000
no not yet. one sec,

[31-May-18 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it was over 20,000 on local tests

[31-May-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#0000
netstat not found

[31-May-18 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Guess I need to isntall it and rebuild conftainer?

[31-May-18 02:42 PM] patchkez#0000
yeah, there are no tools installed ðŸ˜ž

[31-May-18 02:43 PM] patchkez#0000
yes, somewhere near the end of Dockerfile you can add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools`

[31-May-18 02:43 PM] patchkez#0000
maybe `ss` tool is installed?

[31-May-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ss is there but ss on its own does not shot TIME_WAIT?

[31-May-18 02:45 PM] patchkez#0000
`ss -a`

[31-May-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#0000
16700

[31-May-18 02:47 PM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r may I have access to that node and see what is happening there?

[31-May-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
sure, I dont think on y local tests that it was saturating mempool with 1 blaster either.

[31-May-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
before I used docker

[31-May-18 02:47 PM] smk762#0000
how many records per sec are we anticipating to be added to the json?

[31-May-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
but it did actually get to 5mb in size eventually

[31-May-18 02:52 PM] smk762#0000
i heard rumours of 8192 chains?

[31-May-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#0000
we should be able to do unlimited once 1 is working perfectly
