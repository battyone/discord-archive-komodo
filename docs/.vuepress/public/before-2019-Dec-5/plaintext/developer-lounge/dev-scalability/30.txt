Can you tell me more about this cross chain transfers @blackjok3r ?

[11-Sep-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its how the scaling works.... each chain can send coins to another chain. It burns on the first chain, and then the other chain uses MoMoM tech to prove that the burn happened, and allows coins to be "created" on that chain. So a bunch of chains act as a single chain. So far we have run into quite  a few issues, but we have done a few hundred transfers in testing before trying to launch our actual cluster. I dont think its an issue with the MoMoM stuff as such, just how we implemented it.

@blackjok3r, the work you‚Äôre doing , which I assume is in part automating a lot of the deployment of chains. Do you expect these tools you‚Äôve developed will be directly used by komodo platform users (whoever has the need for this type of throughput) or do you see these efforts as primarily prototyping with the intent to rebuilt it all after successfully testing?

[11-Sep-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The STAKED repo can be used to deploy your own cluster  of chains with your own notary nodes. Although its still far from easy as the last day has shown us.

[11-Sep-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
By the time we have run it for a few weeks I would say it will be improved enough for others to have a go at it... I see it mostly being used by dAPP developers who might want to build a multi chain dAPP but cannot use KMD notary nodes due to practcal reasons of having them update every few hours testing etc.

[11-Sep-18 02:51 PM] tolken#2655
Software dev never ends it seems, but I‚Äôm just curious how much of a deployable package this will be for other projects or will it be quite some time before it‚Äôs all cleaned up as a sexy package for the masses.

[11-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
end users wont ever have to setup these clusters

[11-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically I would imagine we will get some projects in the ecosystem that will want to have a cluster created and the people doing the ground breaking work will be the ones consulting with them to get it done

[11-Sep-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
like dukeleto is getting a fair amount of consulting work from his dPoW experience, I would imagine that anybody who is able to get a new cluster going will be in demand

@blackjok3r @patchkez @jl777c  AWS just got back to me. The applications are stuck in the technical team review process and our partner manager has been asking for an update for 3 weeks. Just spoke to her and she is escalating through management so we can get an update on the partnership application and funding request. We should have a clearer picture of status next week.

I will check that AWS account and make sure that nothing is getting used up, on my end everything is ready to go, and we may have enough credits left to run a mid sized test. We will be stress testing the stats website again this weekend to make sure the last bug fixes have not broken anything at scale.

I have a question about the test, how many tx are on the same chain and how many tx are cross-chain? Is it planned to also push the limits of momom, like every chain sending a tx to every other chain ?

[15-Sep-18 08:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
how much additional funds would we need to hit say 2m tx/s

if 2m was possible, how much additional funding would be needed?

[15-Sep-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I don't think k the cross chain stuff will work so well with the scale test design. I am however testing it on staked and once we have somr reasonable chains going there I will figure out how to spam millions of cross chain transactions in another separate test.

Thanks, I think that will be even more interesting and truly show the scalability potential without possible objections by critics

[15-Sep-18 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Agreed, which is why I put the tx test on hold until we get the cross chain working great. 99% of the work is done for both sides now so its just a matter of time.

[16-Sep-18 10:45 AM] Seko#7408
How much TPS did we achieve in the last test? 24k or 45k?

[16-Sep-18 10:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Seko apologies, I added some CSP to nginx last night which was blocking some of the vis data from allowing load. back online now. 
recent tweaks seem to have slightly lowered the average over 1min/5min spans - yet to confirm if this is valid, but I think it is and better to underestimate than overestimate.
Vis does not have all test data. Some earlier tests with more than 64 chains I didn't have access to block source to validate afterwards, and those timespans were purged - they would have higher values. With 64 chains, as the validated sections on vis are, we'd expect about 9500tx/s and 60,000payments/sec on average, with some variation depending on how fast blocks were being solved.
We did a test with 256 cahins which is not on vis. That test pulled about 45k tx/s at peak

@Deleted User see how budget goes.   There are a cpl of naysayers about public testing - using AWS for infrastructure is good for somewhat public controlled engineering environment.
I‚Äôd like to have a community scaling project next because for raw tx it will be a completed task.  With enough documentation for anyone to participate it spreads the load, education, awareness and simplicity/accessibility out.
If community testing is possible, I‚Äôd like to use some of the experts to do other scaling tests like smart contract, consensus extending scalability and look into cross chain scaling factors.
If again this is doable, then get community participation. If community smart contracts or cross chain can be done in 12 months, be awesome.

[21-Sep-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its doable, just need time... I got horribly sidetracked off this project getting the Cross Chain stuff working, which IMO is far more important than raw TX, but now funding is secured, we can come back to this as sson as Patchkez is avalible.

yeah i got the "not real transactions" on my blog.   so if there's publicly deployable by anyone can participate in being a node, not just a game playing participant, it'll just be the "notaries are centralised" one to un-fud.  which is easy with some stats, pie charts, and comparisons....maybe....

[21-Sep-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont understand the "not real transactions" a transaction is a transaction... yes we are using a crazy trick to be able to send that many transactions, but the test is not sending transactions, its filling blocks with transactions, we are counting confirmed transactions.

[21-Sep-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the sending of transactions is totally irreleavent to what we are trying to measure.

Interesting they went from 660k in single zone to 30k across 18 zones.  I don‚Äôt think it is a public/open source project.
Depending on application needs, it‚Äôll be interesting the instant payment channels smart contract stuff can do across chains - different use case / technology on the same Komodo technology.

[26-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Mylo#8306
Streamable payments seems like the direction for high throughput

[26-Sep-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM is a CC transaction, and its easily able to fill blocks with transactions. I have got close already.

[26-Sep-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you send enough exports, once the notirization that happens for the import to be valid, you can get hundreds of them come through at once.

[26-Sep-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would assume all other CC TX are the same, so... tx are tx!

[26-Sep-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesn't really matter what type...

[26-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Mylo#8306

AWS is locked in and funded, the website and stats is complete just needs a few tests and verification. Notary nodes are done, but in the process of building staked I made a better system, and found some problems with the old one, so decided to move to that while we wait for AWS funding to come through. This has taken a little longer than I wanted but, extremely good progress has been made.
