oo, which KMD chain is it notarising to?

[29-May-18 05:53 PM] libscott#0000
aaaah... so we can get notarisations of TXSCL on kmd main?

[29-May-18 05:53 PM] libscott#0000
will they have 11 sigs? if they have less I can work around that locally

!

[29-May-18 06:05 PM] libscott#0000
ok so I'll see if I can find the TXSCL002  notarisation on KMD

[29-May-18 07:52 PM] libscott#0000
is there a notarisation on KMD?

[29-May-18 07:52 PM] jl777#0000
getinfo call would show that

[29-May-18 07:54 PM] libscott#0000
ah ok, not yet then.

[29-May-18 07:55 PM] jl777#0000
why not?

it should have added it to the notarized_checkpoint entry and display it...

the MoM are not matching?

[29-May-18 08:08 PM] jl777#0000
both nodes need to have the same values

[29-May-18 08:08 PM] jl777#0000
i dont have time now to troubleshoot this, bit it sounds like notarizations are started but not happening as there are not 2 nodes in agreement

[29-May-18 08:08 PM] jl777#0000
also myind.2 indicates there are at least 3 testnet notary nodes?

[29-May-18 08:10 PM] shossain#0000
i kept your node in there `"0_jl777_testA":"03b7621b44118017a16043f19b30cc8a4cfe068ac4e42417bae16ba460c80f3828"`

as 0

[29-May-18 08:10 PM] shossain#0000
the first one

[29-May-18 08:10 PM] shossain#0000
i can remove that and try only 2 chains

[29-May-18 08:12 PM] jl777#0000
no its ok

[29-May-18 08:12 PM] jl777#0000
no problem to have some idle nodes, just making sure the data was sane

[29-May-18 08:12 PM] libscott#0000
i only need one chain notarising to KMD to test

[29-May-18 08:15 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott started with 1 chain only. let's see what happens

[29-May-18 08:15 PM] libscott#0000
so I'll wait for a notarisation hash to appear? `./assets-cli getinfo | grep notarized`

[29-May-18 08:16 PM] shossain#0000
yes

[29-May-18 08:17 PM] shossain#0000
doing only `TXSCL` chain now

[29-May-18 08:17 PM] libscott#0000
thats fine... I can test by doing an export from TXSCL to TXSCL ðŸ™‚

[29-May-18 08:18 PM] shossain#0000
only KMD and TXSCL chains are running in the nodes with balance and UTXO for each. BTC not running.

[29-May-18 08:18 PM] libscott#0000
that's fine

[29-May-18 08:19 PM] libscott#0000
still not seeing any notarizedtxid though

[29-May-18 08:28 PM] shossain#0000
these are the console printouts happening

[29-May-18 08:30 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott do you have any funds in your wallet for TXSCL chains?

[29-May-18 08:31 PM] shossain#0000
probably, you could setup a cronjob to send funds to yourself every minute?

[29-May-18 08:35 PM] libscott#0000
No i dont

[29-May-18 08:35 PM] libscott#0000
hm, so stll not notarising?

[29-May-18 08:35 PM] shossain#0000
ok. i started a tx generator as well

[29-May-18 08:39 PM] jl777#0000
it needs to be mined of course, and it gets the MoM data from the komodod

[29-May-18 08:39 PM] jl777#0000
so if there is any mismatch between the MoM values on the two nodes, for some reason the komodod is returning different calc_MoM values

[29-May-18 08:40 PM] jl777#0000
the notarization is just passing through what it gets from komodod

[29-May-18 08:40 PM] jl777#0000
-> any mismatches, non-notarizing is likely due to issues in the momo branch

[29-May-18 09:18 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott KMD chain gets stuck from your `momo` branch

[29-May-18 09:20 PM] libscott#0000
can I help?

[29-May-18 09:20 PM] shossain#0000
i just had KMD chain stuck in one node.

[29-May-18 09:20 PM] shossain#0000
resolved now

[29-May-18 09:21 PM] libscott#0000
i still dont see a notarisaiton

[29-May-18 09:21 PM] jl777#0000
but you resolved it by switching to my dev branch and switching back?

[29-May-18 09:21 PM] shossain#0000
earlier, it was the other node that was stuckj

[29-May-18 09:21 PM] jl777#0000
seems some bugs in momo branch regarding syncing

[29-May-18 09:21 PM] jl777#0000
and calcMoM

[29-May-18 09:22 PM] libscott#0000
there was a bug in syncing, which was easy to reproduce and I fixed it

[29-May-18 09:22 PM] libscott#0000
KMD synced fine here

[29-May-18 09:23 PM] jl777#0000
ok, so it was fixed? @@SHossain

[29-May-18 09:23 PM] libscott#0000
have we observed different nodes returning different MoMs?

[29-May-18 09:23 PM] jl777#0000
if so, the issue seems that the MoM values on the two notarizing nodes are different

[29-May-18 09:23 PM] shossain#0000
i fixed it by re-syncing

[29-May-18 09:23 PM] jl777#0000
at least from the printouts that were posted they seemed different

[29-May-18 09:24 PM] shossain#0000
the earlier issue that i reported couple of days ago, libsoctt fixed that

[29-May-18 09:24 PM] libscott#0000
the issue was caused by me returning 1 from `komodo_checkPOW`, in order to make assetchain mining work in regtest mode

[29-May-18 09:24 PM] libscott#0000
i had to add a different workaround, but that was the problem

[29-May-18 09:24 PM] jl777#0000
it shouldnt get stuck in the first place though so this is a new bug captured in the backup of the ~/.komodo dir, right?

[29-May-18 09:25 PM] jl777#0000
so there is that and getting the MoM values to match on the two notarizing nodes. plz post the notarizing message from both nodes

[29-May-18 09:25 PM] shossain#0000
yes, i have backed up the `.komodo` dir

[29-May-18 09:26 PM] jl777#0000
ok, lets get a way for @libscott to duplicate that stuck condition

[29-May-18 09:26 PM] jl777#0000
and we can push forward on the notarization, first step is for both nodes to submit identical data

[29-May-18 09:27 PM] shossain#0000
they are displaying identical data now

[29-May-18 09:28 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott do you want the komodo data dir as zip?

[29-May-18 09:29 PM] libscott#0000
would I need that? is there a bug?

[29-May-18 09:29 PM] jl777#0000
it got stuck syncing the chain, seems a bug in momo

[29-May-18 09:30 PM] shossain#0000
i found a node was stuck for some time in the 2nd node, it caught up later on

[29-May-18 09:30 PM] jl777#0000
separately if the notaries are using the same data, it should get the 2 sigs and notarize

[29-May-18 09:30 PM] jl777#0000
so it would have fixed itself?

[29-May-18 09:31 PM] shossain#0000
yes, that is what happened on the 2nd node

i dont follow; the first getinfo has nearly the same number of blocks as the second

[29-May-18 09:33 PM] jl777#0000
oh, that is the stuck node print?

[29-May-18 09:34 PM] shossain#0000
the first output is when it was stuck

[29-May-18 09:35 PM] shossain#0000
it was almost 20 blocks behind

[29-May-18 09:35 PM] jl777#0000
when was the last time momo was rebased to dev branch?

[29-May-18 09:35 PM] jl777#0000
maybe it still has the stuck node bugs from a couple months ago
