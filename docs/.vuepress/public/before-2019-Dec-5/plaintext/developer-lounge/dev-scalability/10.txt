limited by TCP ports, but we can even reuse them and put them in seperate clusters

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#0000
could do 1 million chains

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] smk762#0000
just thinking in terms of handling the stream, will need to talk to mylo to see what the possibilities via aws are.

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah I think the DB should get all the data and add it together then push it your way, seems its amazon it should handle the load

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] patchkez#0000
so marketmaker process has ~33% CPU utilization

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#0000
👍

[31-May-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#0000
and its connected to barterdex, maybe we can firewall it and see if that speeds it up

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I think I did that on the first test and it seemed to make a diffrence

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] imylomylo#0000
ah....removed quote marks.

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] imylomylo#0000
damn....

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#0000
because it wasnt a bash script var

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#0000
they were in the variable still

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] imylomylo#0000
damn....

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] imylomylo#0000
so how many chains are you gonna run tonight/

[31-May-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#0000
just the 1.

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] imylomylo#0000
ok - i'll leave it at 1 write per second.

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
hte mempool isnt even full.. no point going further than this until 1 chain is runnign at max

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] imylomylo#0000
sweet....good night 🙂

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
catch ya

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r why there are 2 marketmaker processes running?

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] smk762#0000
cya

[31-May-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
there shouldnt be lol

[31-May-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
let me restart, maybe I didnt clear the blockchain before starting it

[31-May-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
and it got blockheight 3 twice.

[31-May-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I have never seen it start 2 before

[31-May-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#0000
for real test the blocks will be further apart, I just got sick of waiting to test it

[31-May-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#0000
restarted

[31-May-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#0000
single marketmaker this time, only 35% CPU used. I think maybe we try a 100 payment TX and see if that fills mempool?

[31-May-18 03:04 PM] patchkez#0000
sure

[31-May-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#0000
started with 50 payments TX

[31-May-18 03:16 PM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r where in the script do you change amount of payments within TX?

[31-May-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#0000
its an ENV var

[31-May-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#0000
OUTPUTS=

[31-May-18 03:17 PM] patchkez#0000
ah I see it now

[31-May-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I did it wrong

[31-May-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#0000
no quotes lol

[31-May-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#0000
and the URL quotes I only changed locally before, fixing

[31-May-18 03:22 PM] audo#0000
Hey guys, here are few questions from our marketing team that would need answering. I hope you guys can help.

http://pad.supernet.org/Scaling_questions_May312018

[31-May-18 03:28 PM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r are you restarting containers once again?

[31-May-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I'm not sure how to pass the array in the ENV var, its not working

[31-May-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#0000
had to kill them

[31-May-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I will kill all quotes

[31-May-18 03:30 PM] patchkez#0000
do you mean OUTPUTS var?

[31-May-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yes

[31-May-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#0000
its a JSON array,

[31-May-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#0000
`[{"RKV4MzePkH8H9N6K3RdC1JDDWBLbCE4H5p":0.0001}, {"RSzuS5dT5WYLxZekMwcoGXQjtcD9FufPaq":0.0001}, {"RA9aBVW2aDTyZn........`

[31-May-18 03:31 PM] patchkez#0000
isn't there extra `}` at the end?

[31-May-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#0000
shouldnt be.. for one it was exactly liek this `[{"RKV4MzePkH8H9N6K3RdC1JDDWBLbCE4H5p":0.0001}]`

[31-May-18 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#0000
but for more its like the example above, but because it has spaces does it need quotes? I tried '' but that didnt work.

[31-May-18 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe I need to store the arrays inside a file in the container and just pass it an index number for what transaction to use?

[31-May-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it works with no quotes or anything

[31-May-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#0000
guess because its all one a singe line

[31-May-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#0000
all blocks are full now

[31-May-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#0000
855 payments/s single chain

[31-May-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#0000
guess for 1 payment TX we just need more blasters

[31-May-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I have an idea on how to code this, I will try to do it from a single container first time.

[31-May-18 03:41 PM] patchkez#0000
i have to take care of my kids now, will have a look on it later today

[31-May-18 03:43 PM] patchkez#0000
we might also try to lower cpu shares for txblast container

[31-May-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah we can just see what it needs and calibrate it.

[31-May-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
for multi payment TX we only need one,

[31-May-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
its just all these people who demand this single payment TX, I guess I should figure out how to make them happy.

[31-May-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
😆

[31-May-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
mempool on 50 payment went almost directly to 5mb, and the blaster stopped.

[31-May-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
working just as its supposed to

[31-May-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#0000
or not actually, when it dropped under 60s wasnt enough. I need to calibrate that better aswell.

[31-May-18 04:04 PM] blackjok3r#0000

blackjok3r @libscott you have the best knowledge about these questions that @Audo asked. Please help him by answering. Thank you 🙂
http://pad.supernet.org/Scaling_questions_May312018

[31-May-18 04:19 PM] libscott#8867
Hey, will do

[31-May-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I filled out what I can.

[31-May-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Freaked me out, when you started typing there lol

[31-May-18 04:26 PM] shossain#0000
Thank you very much 🙂

[31-May-18 04:29 PM] libscott#8867
haha!

[31-May-18 05:24 PM] smk762#0000
P}

[31-May-18 05:25 PM] libscott#0000
All done

[31-May-18 05:26 PM] shossain#0000
many thanks @libscott 🙂
@Audo your questions answered. 💯

[31-May-18 05:36 PM] mark81#0000
Hmmm. I have been wondering that how TXSCL chains can be used as a payments channel? Or is it just s proof of consept?

[31-May-18 05:36 PM] mark81#0000
jl777

[31-May-18 05:39 PM] jl777#0000
they are just a testnet, but once a real cluster of chains are made, it can be used for whatever crypto can be used for

[31-May-18 05:45 PM] mark81#0000
Okay so those are different chains and technology out of komodo itself. Is there any way that komodo can use scaling chains to get boost to transaction scaling? Lets say all of those chains are payments channel and are settled in komodo after some time period wouldnt that in theory boosts komodos ability to do transactions through them?

[31-May-18 05:46 PM] mark81#0000
They would act in this sameway like lightning network in bitcoin are if i have understood it correctly.

[31-May-18 05:49 PM] jl777#0000
the next hardfork we can enable this for KMD itself, yes

[31-May-18 06:04 PM] libscott#0000
mark81 it doesn't have the same scalability characteristic as lightning. Creating assetchains is more expensive than creating channels.

[31-May-18 06:05 PM] libscott#0000
but I can see what you mean

[31-May-18 06:32 PM] shossain#0000
we have MoMoM working 🙂
```
TXSCL002 kmdheight.858718 CCid.3 MoMoM.["TXSCL002", "858718", "3"] -> {"coin":"TXSCL002","kmdheight":858718,"ccid":3,"MoMs":["ed0c93cedc473830391409defd9ff3d3d47ae583c748ffb6d8c5a9419449be53"],"notarization_hash":"e3f250ff2a8a076f7850575ebf2e0d65f84a5f1ca7149530841d8320d2e7fcd6","MoMoM":"ed0c93cedc473830391409defd9ff3d3d47ae583c748ffb6d8c5a9419449be53","data":"53be499441a9c5d8b6ff48c783e57ad4d3f39ffdde091439303847dcce930ced00000000"}
```

[31-May-18 06:34 PM] jl777#0000
well the first one yes, but 100% of them have to work, so a ways to go before we know it is working, as in 100% of the time

[01-Jun-18 02:00 AM] maegus#0000
So MoMoM is being recognized by the different chains

[01-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@Mylo

[01-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think this should do for stats unless there is anything else you can think of we need?

[01-Jun-18 03:42 AM] imylomylo#0000
`mempoolMB` & `mempooltx` - looks like two to me.

[01-Jun-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Do you think there is anything else we need?

[01-Jun-18 03:43 AM] imylomylo#0000
not for stats.  as long as we have the blockchains available for inspection by 3rd party to verify

[01-Jun-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Otherwise I'm commiting this repo and starting on getting 2xTxBlasters for single payment Tx working.

[01-Jun-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes they are saved into a shared data volume

[01-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the stats JSON is also saved there inside the .komodo folder incase anything goes wrong on the DB side

[01-Jun-18 03:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok - good idea

[01-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
🚀

[01-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok now to get single payment mempool full...

[01-Jun-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
this is going to be a lot harder lol.
