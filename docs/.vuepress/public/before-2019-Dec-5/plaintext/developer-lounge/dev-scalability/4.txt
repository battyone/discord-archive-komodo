sure

[30-May-18 10:50 AM] jl777#0000
and then notarizing 64 chains at freq of 2, would be the same load (almost) as notarizing 1024 chains at a freq of 30

[30-May-18 10:51 AM] shossain#0000
i can use your patch for main notaries yesterday

[30-May-18 10:52 AM] shossain#0000
blackjok3r please get the chains running when you are ready

[30-May-18 10:52 AM] jl777#0000
freq support has been there for a while, eg. GAME

[30-May-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I will have them up before I go to bed, but wont be super fast with these small children annoying me lol

[30-May-18 10:56 AM] shossain#0000
take your time. in the meantime, i'll rent a new server now and prepare KMD chain in there. so, you can keep the seed nodes up with mining, i'll keep notarizing with 2 nodes

it is being recognized as a valid notarization!

[30-May-18 10:59 AM] jl777#0000
MoM is also recognized, not sure about MoMoM data

[30-May-18 11:00 AM] jl777#0000
I am concerned at the unexplained sync issues momo branch has been having, plz make sure it is able to sync properly, KMD and assetchains

[30-May-18 11:02 AM] shossain#0000
yep, i'll monitor while doing the new server setup. resync from scratch worked fully

[30-May-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@SHossain @libscott I have pushed `momo` branch to scaletest repo. It should work as normal but using cc=3 and the seedip of the server they are on. There is also the `buildkomodo.sh` script that will clone and build komodo from momo branch.

[30-May-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the first 32 chains are on mining. I am installing the repo on second meshbits Hetzner server now for last 32 chains.

[30-May-18 11:36 AM] shossain#0000

[30-May-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#0000
If I can get away with it, I will generate the m_notary_scale file for all 64 chains, but it will have to wait until a fair bit later.

[30-May-18 11:43 AM] shossain#0000
my new server order ran into an error at the DC part. should resolve quick. it will also take about 2 hours to sync KMD from scratch. so, you have time for your kids

[30-May-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Got one to sleep I hope. Come to think of it, the m_notary_scale file we already made for 64 chains should work already.

[30-May-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
All 64 chains are mining and have blocks, so its working fine.

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] shossain#0000
`-ac_cc=3`?

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
there is 2 nodes with all 64 chains running. Just connect to the seedip and it should sync you up.

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes and on momo branch komodo

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] shossain#0000
cool

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I made a new user on each server and made new scaletest branch.

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] shossain#0000
OS being installed in my server now

[30-May-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Cool. I need to go offline for a while. I wil check back before bed incase there are any issues.

[30-May-18 11:55 AM] shossain#0000
üëçüèº

[30-May-18 11:55 AM] shossain#0000
are we doing 64 first, then 128?

[30-May-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah try 64, mining that many chains is hard. We will need more CPU's or deploy some docker miners in the cloud.

[30-May-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
see what the TIME_WAIT's are like with 64 on dPoW and we cna estimate how many more to add from that.

[30-May-18 11:57 AM] shossain#0000
Please send some funds for all the chains to 
`RSUMqZFwz7yPzTmyzEtH9VzH7LBoD7twSB`
`RFUN8XezmmZt47pzVmoz7aN5LtFNV9pyuj`

[30-May-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok

[30-May-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#0000
sent, you have first 4 chains already right?

[30-May-18 12:28 PM] shossain#0000
yes

[30-May-18 03:13 PM] libscott#0000
Morning all!

[30-May-18 03:13 PM] libscott#0000
Well, more like afternoon...

[30-May-18 03:13 PM] libscott#0000
Any progress on the notarisation?

it is being notarized

sounds right, last I heard only first 2 are being notarized

[30-May-18 03:40 PM] libscott#0000
im still not seeing any notarisedhash

[30-May-18 03:40 PM] libscott#0000
do I need to update the repo?

[30-May-18 03:44 PM] shossain#0000
i'm setting up the second server.

[30-May-18 03:45 PM] shossain#0000
for 64 chains notarizing

[30-May-18 03:45 PM] jl777#0000
komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCL getinfo should display the notarized info

[30-May-18 03:45 PM] jl777#0000
assuming you are running the right one. @SHossain plz make sure @libscott is onthe right chain, there was some confusion over seed nodes

[30-May-18 03:46 PM] libscott#0000
for this test we dont need alot of nodes

[30-May-18 03:47 PM] libscott#0000

[30-May-18 03:47 PM] shossain#0000
nope. i will use 2. current 2nd node is not capable of notarizing 64 chains

[30-May-18 03:56 PM] libscott#0000
any idea why my instance isnt showing the notarisation?

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] jl777#0000
are you in sync ?

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] jl777#0000
if not, then it needs to be troubleshot, hopefully you can get the txid on the TXSCL chain to get the OP_RETURN data

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] shossain#0000
currently i stopped notarizing, as i'm setting up both node for more chains. it was working with the first 4 chains earlier

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] jl777#0000
plz get the relevant txids, chain heights/hash so @libscott can fix the notarzation not being seen on his node

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] jl777#0000
one the first notarization is done, the others will hopefully be seen

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] libscott#0000
I am in sync... I don't know why the notarisation txid isnt appearing

[30-May-18 03:57 PM] jl777#0000
i guess need to resync the chain to see what it does when it processes that block?

[30-May-18 03:58 PM] jl777#0000
i make a backup some blocks before the critical in cases where it takes a long time to sync up

[30-May-18 03:59 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott please let me know if you want me to perform any specific command.

[30-May-18 03:59 PM] libscott#0000
ok I'm syncing again

[30-May-18 03:59 PM] shossain#0000
yes, deleted the chain data and sync from scratch, that should help

[30-May-18 04:01 PM] libscott#0000
got one!!

[30-May-18 04:01 PM] libscott#0000
amazon

[30-May-18 04:01 PM] libscott#0000
can someone send some test funds on TXSCL to RLog6T7dPoDqdVV5N3PWXQLTQM3aGWmkwG?

[30-May-18 04:01 PM] jl777#0000
one is good, but we cant be missing any... bugs I know

[30-May-18 04:03 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott sent 777 TXSCL

[30-May-18 05:19 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott jl777 do you need any monitoring info?

[30-May-18 05:20 PM] shossain#0000

some of them yet to get their first notarization

[30-May-18 05:43 PM] shossain#0000
13 more to get their first notarization

[30-May-18 06:13 PM] shossain#0000
6 more chains remaining

[30-May-18 06:29 PM] shossain#0000
4 more chains remaining.

[30-May-18 06:47 PM] shossain#0000
<!channel> we have 60 TXSCL chains notarizing üéâ. without mining & BTC running, seems like it uses very low resources. i'm waiting on the other 4 cahins to get their first notarization as well.

[30-May-18 06:51 PM] shossain#0000
with a lot of chains notarizing at high frequency, it consumes KMD UTXOs very fast.

[30-May-18 06:51 PM] shossain#0000
1 more chain for the first time. 3 more to go

[30-May-18 07:48 PM] libscott#0000
I can't reproduce the MoM result on TXSCL

but if I calculate it using the block merkle roots 4406-4399, I get a different result

in any case height_MoM is technically in your domain

i dont know, i have a list of leaf hashes and I can't reproduce the result from iguana_merkle

[30-May-18 08:15 PM] libscott#0000
is it possible that previously that calculation was being done inside Iguana and then it got moved to KMD?
