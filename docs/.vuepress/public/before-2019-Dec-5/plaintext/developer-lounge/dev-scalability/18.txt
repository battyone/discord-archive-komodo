Anticipation is killing at least 84 people in the world

[20-Jun-18 08:42 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
86 if you include us

[21-Jun-18 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... man I am getting pretty impatient now lol. Its been a long time in the making.  Good thing that the MoMoM stuff is confirmed working though. Give a bit more legitimacy to the whole thing. üòÑ

[21-Jun-18 02:46 AM] Mylo#8306
need me to do anything over the next few days?  i seem to have been made redundant on most aspects üòÑ  so can return to the game perhaps

[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> Hehe well if your stats thing with blackjok3r is cool and you don‚Äôt need me to fulfill that end, I‚Äôll get back to linking the game(s) to insight-api

[21-Jun-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> Either that or the txblaster api

[21-Jun-18 07:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I should be able to link up data and vis tonight for a bit more pretest testing, any probs I'll shout out

[21-Jun-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you want to add the game.. there is no insight API, as we ditched explorers... but I can give you access to the first 64 chains, you can host some deamons  on a small 4-8 core VPS and use that to send TX.

We just completed a working test with 64 chains. Website and blaster had a few bugs. We will run another test tomorrow. I need to move everything to a single AWS account, as I have some of the stuff hosted on my personal one.

[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> @blackjok3r:matrix.org: Komodoplatform AWS account should be working. There is 1000$ credit activated. I was doing some settings today (roles, policies) and created Kubernetes cluster (without worker nodes). I am having troubles connecting to the cluster endpoint, so I need to fix it.

[22-Jun-18 09:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm just curious on the cost per 1,000,000 payments / tx per second and how viable it is for banks and dApps.

[22-Jun-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
The burn protocol. Allows for a cluster of chains to maintain the same number of coins between them, but you can freely move coins from one to another

[22-Jun-18 09:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I wonder if the word coins should be changed to block data or something else that is more relevant in real world applications???

[22-Jun-18 09:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Dumb it down a bit

[22-Jun-18 09:23 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Like "shards of data" or "Merkel root data"

[22-Jun-18 09:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Doesn't really dumb it down but does explain it a little better in more words

[22-Jun-18 09:41 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
32 bytes per coin? - I'll go back to consuming R&D

[22-Jun-18 10:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

The HUSH messaging system could use this tech

[22-Jun-18 10:51 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
BTCH

[22-Jun-18 10:53 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
IPFS could use it too

[22-Jun-18 10:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It has nothing to do with coins - or TXs - it's private bytes per second

[22-Jun-18 11:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
How many bits or bytes per dollar can thus system achieve per second?

[23-Jun-18 12:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Have a good night and weekend boys

[23-Jun-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well a 64 chain test run up to about 350 blocks filled 97gb of the AWS ssd. But this includeed all docker stuff and the host os, I will get better metrics of data use and data created in next test now the shared data volume is fixed. 
If you mean the size of the transactions, they vary in size a lot, blocks just under 2mb, 1 payment fits 8859 transactions but 100payment fits 557.

[23-Jun-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If anyone is around a TxBlast is about to run using 64 chains. It will kick off at exactly: `GMT: Saturday, 23 June 2018 8:06:16 AM`

I think once you load the website, you cannot refresh it, otherwise it loses data, we are still looking at this as far as I know. looks like smk took the day off. I am also out now. Will check results later when I get back.

[23-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any rough estimate you guys put onto how far we are from the 1m tx? :O

[23-Jun-18 10:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I see an average of 1000payments/sec/chain

[23-Jun-18 10:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Correct?

[23-Jun-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
sustaining more than 100 per second per chain is not possible for onchain, butt the mempool can be filled pretty fast

[23-Jun-18 07:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah because I saw +-60k payments/s for the test

[23-Jun-18 07:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And it was 64chains

[23-Jun-18 07:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I figured

[23-Jun-18 08:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1000 payments per chin per second is about right

[23-Jun-18 08:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
928 is the expected number: (557x100)/60

[23-Jun-18 08:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the big bonus... is if you start the test a a low enough block height the block time is less than 1m...

[23-Jun-18 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, yes, payments per second can be very high per chain

What are you testing right now?

[24-Jun-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we may start again shortly, as we had a few issues again.

[24-Jun-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is now a countdown timer, I might also add a small random delay to the start timer, as the DB gets flooded when all chains start at the exact  same time.

[24-Jun-18 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
The stats page looks great.  With my poor system and connection the gauges didn't move though.

[24-Jun-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used it on a Galaxy S5 yesterday, and the bubbles didnt move, but it did work. I think you need about 5minutes for it to show a proper value

[24-Jun-18 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
It's spiking up now.

[24-Jun-18 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405
On the graph.

[24-Jun-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing to 100 payments... cannot sync chains to all switch at the same time due to random block times, some chains are just faster than others.

[24-Jun-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok added 30s random delay to start, should stop the initial burst of blocks. and lowered time to live on Dynamo DB to 5 mins so we use less read capacity.

[24-Jun-18 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
There she goes!

[24-Jun-18 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405

[24-Jun-18 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
debugging swebsite still.. I think its all workign as expected, values from previous tests could hav been wrong as they was some duplicates.

[24-Jun-18 12:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had issue where if I restarted the aggregation script after a change during a test run, it would re-read the history in dynamo table and possibly count them twice in the json which is output for the graph history. values stored in db were ok though.

[24-Jun-18 12:40 PM] CrisF#3405
How are you liking the AWS?

[24-Jun-18 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
added something to force predictable intervals and unique constraints so it should be sorted now

[24-Jun-18 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

DynamoDB and Lambda are awesome... the start trigger is actally only using free teir, and even with 8196 chains I doubt it will get over free tier useage... Dynamo DB even for 8196 chains is like max $200 USD per month, and we only need it for a day.

how expensive are the competing proposed scaling solutions?

[24-Jun-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yet to confirm costs for Kubernetes though, for chains above 64. The first 64 are a separate test and will have 4 NotaryNodes preforming notatizations during blast.  The costs for 64 chains for a 3h test with NotaryNodes and everything would be less than $50.

[24-Jun-18 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
That's an amazingly cheap investment to showcase the tech.

[24-Jun-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one chain per vCPU is pretty amazing in itself... and I was able to preform notarizations with 4 core servers, but they were hitting their limits so for big test I will use 8 core and 32gb ram.

[24-Jun-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that is to notarize 64 chains on each server. Bear in mind though in real world, the notary nodes would number 64 not 4. So this would increase costs a fair bit.
