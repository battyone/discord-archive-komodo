sounds like fiat with extra steps

[17-Dec-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
I already wrote the solution

[17-Dec-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but I have no interest to spend time to implement as simply issuing more and burned at the end of ICO is the simple solution

[17-Dec-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in either case, people need to trust the issuer for the coins/dilution

[17-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢
Trust is only makes value for any money, and cryptocurrency not exception.
In my case I am trying to nominate product price 1-to-1 with coin, in case of standard ICO product has variable price in coins

[17-Dec-18 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
He wants an ICO that never ends from what I understand @jl777c

[17-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
which again, @Nick Bk (YAF.fy) doesn't make sense unless existing coin holders are receiving the BTC directly

[17-Dec-18 03:58 PM] Alright#0419
Nick, if you actually want to do it, I can explain how to create an assetchain that allows you to create coins at will. Warning you though, it's not simple *at all*

[17-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
In standard ICO you nominate a COMPANY with X coins (max supply), I want to nominate a PRODUCTS with unlimited supply, only restricted by count of clients orders

[17-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
It will be cool

[17-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Alright#0419
You can do it via momom and the burn contract. You need to notarize a new fungible chain then transfer coins from it

[17-Dec-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
then what I wrote about the one way cross chain import is what is needed to be done

[17-Dec-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC -> newchain

[17-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
I dont need a scam time limited ICO and then burn and forget coins... I want continuesly grow it

[17-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
you realize that each additional investor dilutes the previous investors' coins?

[17-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
like the opposite of a ponzi 😛

[17-Dec-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you realize that each additional investor dilutes the previous investors' coins?` <- exactly what I was trying to say

[17-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
if value of produced (also in future)  items not reduces, then whole capitalisation grows 1-to-1 with coins supply
and you could exchange items and reflect it on chain

[17-Dec-18 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if value of produced (also in future) items not reduces`
So you're saying you will have the capacity to instantly produce orders on demand at a rate of 1:1? What if your production rate is 10 widgets per day and I order 10k?

[17-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢
eventually production rate should achieve demand
if not, the price will drop

[17-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
it is futures contract

[17-Dec-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_backs out slowly as @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  doesn't think @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 will ever understand this_

[17-Dec-18 04:12 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢
inflation will equal item wear

[17-Dec-18 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`inflation will be equal to item wear` <- literally *not* how value of a free-market currency works

[17-Dec-18 04:14 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢
but how real world items is

[17-Dec-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm lost as to how you think you can force coin value to match products in existence *and* the condition of those products, but I wish you the best of luck
_goes back to trying to fix his stratum_

[17-Dec-18 04:18 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢
👌 
ONE COIN - ONE ITEM
ONE CHAIN - ONE PRODUCT TYPE

[17-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
Seems I have understand what you mean. Would learn Komodo contracts..

[17-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
It's not well documented at the moment

[17-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
How technical are you? It's basically untested tech. We have one project planning to use it, but it's still in testnet

[17-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
again, by far the simplest way to do it would be print more coins than you could ever possibly sell in the premine then lock them up safely

[17-Dec-18 05:25 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
I have decade but in java programming.., have not much time for now, but will do it )

[17-Dec-18 05:26 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
is there any examples?

[17-Dec-18 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
#kmdlabs has it's testnet up right now which supports fungible chains

[17-Dec-18 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
about 8 months of constant development

[17-Dec-18 05:27 PM] Alright#0419
again, by far the simplest way to do it would be print more coins than you could ever possibly sell in the premine then lock them up safely

[17-Dec-18 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
if your investors can trust you enough to be able to print coins at will, they should be able to trust you enough with a large amount of coins that should never really come into circulation

[17-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
not my way.. ) and I would like to attract investors by that..

[17-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
if you wait maybe ~6 months, setting up fungible chains should be significantly easier

[17-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
right now, it's *hard*

[17-Dec-18 05:30 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
I need it for my future product: http://bkey.tech

[17-Dec-18 05:31 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
ok, will make some research and decide

[17-Dec-18 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
premine more coins than you could ever possibly sell, lock them up in a few multisig addresses

[17-Dec-18 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
That's all you really need to do. The momom thing I mentioned wasn't intended to be used as a way to print coins at will, it's just a consequence of how it works that it's possible

[17-Dec-18 05:37 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
Am I right?
I should make new assetchain by deploying couple of notary nodes, and then issue assets on that chain, like in NXT but with some magic coin conditions contract?

[17-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
Where is that contract executed, or it is like plugin for client node?

[17-Dec-18 05:40 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
Is any client, who would like to trade on barterdex should has that plugin installed, or it is propagated somehow..?

[17-Dec-18 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
YOu just need some noary nodes of your own yes ... then crate a NEW assetchain in the same cluster with the amount of coins you want... then migrate them to the otehr chain.. and kill the chain you created.

[17-Dec-18 05:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a bit of a process.

[17-Dec-18 06:41 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@blackjok3r
And how will I migrate them? They should be traded on market to have value, but then it will be very difficult to migrate

currently thats the only possible way to do it automatically....

[17-Dec-18 06:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its by no means perfect either.... it was made to find bugs not actualy be used by a user

[17-Dec-18 06:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basically you create a new blockchain every time you ant more coins

[17-Dec-18 06:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then send them from that blockchain to the main one.

[17-Dec-18 06:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is probably easier ways ... like you can write a custom consensus rule that a particular key can just crate imprt coins without a valid MoMoM hash.

[17-Dec-18 06:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont know how that would go ...

[17-Dec-18 06:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just means the chains has a GOD key ... if it was stolen the chain is dead.

[17-Dec-18 06:49 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@blackjok3r
I don't understand how coins could be migrated to another chain if we have a fixed amount of supply..
So there is some constant variable, but not fully constant as is ))
Looks like a PoS scam..

[17-Dec-18 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... its not a constant supply ... you said you wanted to create unlimited coins whenever you like this is how you can do it

[17-Dec-18 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For out project there are 25 notary nodes who all contreol the keys that make the process possible... so they al need tpo decide together to invent coins ...

[17-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
but when I created asset chain, should I set max supply constant?

[17-Dec-18 06:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than just 1 person

[17-Dec-18 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but doing this you can have 1000 chains if you rlike and they all act as 1

[17-Dec-18 06:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
coins are fungible accorss them

[17-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@blackjok3r
Having fixed count of notary nodes is main assumption that I see as point of control in Komodo chain, so it is permissioned blockchaon now..
I will look more to the scripts you mentioned

[17-Dec-18 06:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I dont understand what it is exactly your trying to do

[17-Dec-18 06:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Proof of burn

burn is transaction to me ) and all done without any hosted server

[17-Dec-18 06:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm it seems similar to what we are doing ... you need to burn coins to creat the coins back on the other chains.

[17-Dec-18 06:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it allows diffrent chains to have diffrent rules and contractsetc ... but use the same currency/token

[17-Dec-18 07:18 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@blackjok3r
What magic function "migrate_converttoexport" do?
Is it used to push coin supply value to "notary" nodes?

[17-Dec-18 07:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It burns the coins

[17-Dec-18 07:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Then the notary nodes create a notarisation of the merkle roots onto kmd and the other chains

{Reactions}
😁 

[17-Dec-18 07:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So that the import tx can verify the burn happened

[17-Dec-18 07:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In your case u could probably skip all that and just import

[17-Dec-18 07:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But again not quote are what your trying to do

[17-Dec-18 07:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The notaries power come from choosing what chains to notaries to allow this process to happen nothing more

[17-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
directive to centralbank.. sorry, notary nodes  to make some additional debt line in balance sheet

[17-Dec-18 07:24 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
is that how 5% in agama wallet appears?

[17-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ni

[17-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This had nothing to do with kmd notaries

[17-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
These are a separate thing

[17-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although kmd ones can do this aswell

[17-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They dont

[17-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
but that is function of komodo_cli

[17-Dec-18 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe u should read some of the blogs on hownit works

[17-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
I know, I should trust notary nodes..

[17-Dec-18 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You don't need to trust them for this, only that they dontbadd more chains

[17-Dec-18 07:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The migrate process is trust less

[17-Dec-18 07:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Only the notaries can choose to add more chains if they wanted to

[17-Dec-18 07:32 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
ok, deep problems we dig here.. 
I understand, that it needed for now to protect from 51% attack, because chain is not powerful yet
will hope notary nodes became PoW based in future..
anyway, blackjok3r thanks you show me the way!

[18-Dec-18 04:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@Nick Bk (YAF.fy) the actual Komodo notaries can't do this. Komodo has no other fungible chains. @blackjok3r is talking about the notaries for #kmdlabs which is a testing environment for new features and chains

[18-Dec-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM has been enabled on KMD notaries, there is just no chains that use it yet

[18-Dec-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well ... thats not exactly right .. the MoMoM deos not mean the chains a re fungible .. but it does enable cross chain contracts.

[18-Dec-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any chains with ccid > 1 (so 2 to 100) are using it already.

[18-Dec-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But they do not support migrate/import/export transactions.

@Nick Bk (YAF.fy)  this post might explain migrations for you - http://rant.cryptocartography.io/tokens-without-borders-migration/

It is basically a way to allow chains within the same cluster to be fungible. It only works if you have the migrations CC contract enabled on your asset chains, and the source/destination chain has the same ccid (i.e. are on the same cluster of chains).

5% comes from UTXO existing.  Just the existence of having a UTXO with >10 KMD entitles it to 5% per year after approx 1 hour.    The UTXO when spent then claims this reward, it's part of the blockchain rules (consensus) which every node can see and verify.
