Thanks Tony

[07-Mar-19 04:42 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Do i need to extract this somewhere specifically or just anywhere?

[07-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Tried extracting into Komodo/src and then running again and same error

[07-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Sdunbar#5064
no module named slickrpc

[07-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Sdunbar#5064
chain died again right away

[07-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i must have done something incorrectly

[07-Mar-19 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Just extract it anywhere

[07-Mar-19 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
And run daemon extracted from zip, and `./rogue_tui` executable from zip then

[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you will need re-sync from scratch. For it just delete blockchain which you have now: 
```rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/blocks
rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/chainstate
rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/database```
And start daemon again

[07-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064
sounds good will try when i get home from work tomorrow

[07-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064

Please, help boost the signal a a bit and RT/Share!

[09-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
weird, i didnt even start rogue_tui. All i did was try to run ./rogue from the new extracted files and it asked me to put my rogue.conf in the current directory

[09-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
so i did that and then ./rogue again and the game started up?

[09-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
seems to work?

[09-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
im guessing the chain is not running though?

[09-Mar-19 04:59 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i have no idea what im doing lol

[09-Mar-19 05:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Where is the rogue daemon in this package?

[09-Mar-19 05:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I believe you start with komodod

[09-Mar-19 05:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll take a look in a bit when I return  to my computer.

[09-Mar-19 05:23 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Double check the instructions from git hub in the meantime.

[09-Mar-19 05:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL is there anything additional to know about set up with the bundles?

[09-Mar-19 05:43 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist it's on github in releases page: just unzip, start daemon with rogue params, start tui

[09-Mar-19 05:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Tui will copy config, will ensure that rogue synced and set pubkey so unzip and start is all what is needed

[09-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Sdunbar ^

[09-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Thanks  @TonyL  !

[09-Mar-19 06:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Daemon is `komodod`, tui is `rogue_tui`

Please help, human!
if you launch with -maxreorg=2701 it might be able to resolve this automaticallyError: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 2691 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

[09-Mar-19 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
start with reindex or delete chain data (except wallet.dat & ROGUE.conf) and start again

[09-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064

When I name my character and then it shows my high score after it doesnt seem to have the name

[11-Mar-19 12:21 PM] TonyL#3577
For fresh warrior name will appear in warriors list after your warrior back - it's fine that rogue printing blank name on this stage
