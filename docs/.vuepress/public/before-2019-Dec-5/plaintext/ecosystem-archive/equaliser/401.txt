[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> nice line of work

[03-Sep-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Did I.T for 13 years, the office was killing me softly. Exceptional pay but not worth the stress and unhappiness. I'd rather leave a legacy and make a difference in the world even if I haven't paid myself. The long term is about showing what blockchain can do to make a difference and give struggling families and first home buyers a chance to own their own place to live without having to compete with property speculators

[03-Sep-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> After all when a bank makes a loan, they are printing money and inflating the broad money supply. Property investment is a non productive investment when it comes to the economy. In australia they need to get rid of negative gearing or wind it down to eventually nothing. Pre established property is allowed to be negative geared, at least cut that for now and only allow for new built houses

[dscrdeql] <jerickj> Hai

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yes, I've read though from some that want negative gearing that if it was abolished then investors woudn't invest in property anymore and therefore there wouldn't be enough rental properties.

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> which I think is crap.

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> investors will invest in property whether there's negative gearing or not

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> because it's one of the best most stable markets in australia to invest in

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I would like the government to abolish captial gains tax though.

[03-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if they abolish negative gearing then they also need to abolish capital gains tax

[03-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hi there @jerickj

[03-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> i think from memory, negative gearing was brought in to australia the same time as capital gains tax.

[03-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so if you have to pay tax on a gain, then you should get a tax cut if it goes negative

[03-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe negative gearing was brought in to stimulate house building creating more labouring jobs when cash rates were above 10% so people opted for saving cash in the bank.

[03-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yes, by penalising speculative investing

[03-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> speculative investing gains are taxed brutally.

[03-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> each year you hold the investment...the tax signifcantly decreases

[03-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> to get people to only invest in long term investmentss and less risky ones

[03-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Now cash rates are at all time lows, and mortgage fraud has been shown in the royal commission, that's been Australia's quantative easing. Australia is due for its own sub prime crisis

[03-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I feel that if I take all the risk then why should i have to pay tax on any gains from it, especialy when I paid tax on the money to begin with from my pay.

[03-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> maybe

[03-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if people start defaulting on loans in a big way

[03-Sep-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but that would only happen if unemployed really increased and/or interest rates increased drastically

[03-Sep-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> when i got my first mortgage interest rates were around 16%...back in the 1987

[03-Sep-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> now they're almost half that

[03-Sep-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if they went back up to 16%, a large number of mortgages woudl default

[03-Sep-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think capital gains should stop for people in lower socio-economic circumstances

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> adn thus start a housing crisis

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it already is,

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> because it's based on income tax rate

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so if you don't earn much

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> then your income tax rate is much less

[03-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and therefore your capital gains tax is less

[03-Sep-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You on linkedin? I chat alot of economics there on peoples posts, not sure if anyone here would know what we're on about lol

[03-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Thatâ€™s prob James accumulating for dividend funds

[03-Sep-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> or maybe it has to do with that BTC wallet that is subdividing into wallets of 100 :0

[03-Sep-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <ghÃ¸st> "KMD has a 100BTC buy wall on binance"
