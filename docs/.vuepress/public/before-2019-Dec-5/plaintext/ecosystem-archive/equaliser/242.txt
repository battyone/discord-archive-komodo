[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> everything is ok on Native 😄

[31-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hey all

[31-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' y'all. Just spoke with Chainmakers. The fix we have listed works for Windows, and should work (from that same page) for OSX. Komodo and Komodo Ocean will be pushing a new release shortly, they're aware of and actively working on the problem. It apparently affected more chains than just ours 😄

[31-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> At any rate, Linux is once again demonstrated to be the superior OS, and everything is back on track. Since exrates runs linux, it appears they were unaffected, so any withdraws you made should be fine.

[31-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Deposits made during block range 61428 to 61620(ish) might not have happened with the rollback from the fork.

[31-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If so, the balances will have returned to your wallet.

[31-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The above also applies if you had other transactions in that range, so anyone with a missing transaction during that time, don't assume something nefarious 😄 Just contact who you were dealing with, it probably will have to be resent.

[31-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In light of the above, I encourage anyone who has the bandwidth and HDD space to run in native mode. More nodes equal less chance of forking 😄

[31-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> good when everything is ok 😄

[31-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> tx for the update

[31-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Right? @!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽 thanks for being our guinea pig in the many MANY tests yesterday 😄

[31-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i saw siu and others talking about other issues in the komodo support chat. apparently other chains are being affected also

[31-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yep. And Windows, primarily.

[31-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nearly 30 years, and they still can't make a decent OS 😛

[31-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's probably more that they're getting away with it for 30 years haha

[31-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> right?

[31-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Let's see... on the fly updates without reboot:

[31-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Linux, check. Windows nope.

[31-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ability to reboot the kernal without full reboot.

[31-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Linux, check. CP/M, check. Unix system 2 (1979 version) check. OSX, check. windows, there's a way to use ram other than just filling  it up?

[31-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not in a good Windows mood today 😛

[31-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> not yet. just started to sync. 500/640701ish

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If it hangs, clear database, blocks and chainstate folders. That was the last thing I had to do, other than wait. Reindex took a while, but I have a LOT of transactions.

[31-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> download that komodo and replace @NWhiskeyTango

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> getting off wifi maybe go faster

[31-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Might. I'm hardwired, so no way to compare 😛
