[20-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> on exrates?

[20-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah but the block chain hasn't confirmed it yet

[20-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it is slow because they do it by hand currently.

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh that too

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but they do everything manually there.

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ah ok so takes longer

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that is the biggest complaint I have read on them

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ok well when i wake up it should be done lol

[20-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> which means btc must be clogged up

[20-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> last time i experienced this was january

[20-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and i thought i lost my btc lol

[20-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if they could adjust a few things on their exchange for example, make coins in a list with volume, price and gains/losses for 24 hrs where the chat box is and just remove that altogether.

[20-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep the design is poor

[20-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and automate the withdraws they could easily be a top 10

[20-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> My favorite band of all time is Rush.

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I hated that crap in the 90's, my sister loved it all. Now I have to admit if it comes on the speakers, I dont mind a bit of 90's pop, I must be nostalgic

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In second place, there's a lot of bands üòÑ

[20-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Linkin Park is my all time fave followed by system and then maybe sublime for the 3rd slot

[20-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hybrid theory was by far the best album they ever had though

[20-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yes, agreed. Particularly Pts. of Authority.

[20-Jul-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
