[dscrdeql] <c2k> im sure edison made many mistakes and had countless "oops" moments. but without failure there is no success

[31-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my kids are as excited as I am about this.

[31-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well that and we started working on some 3d printing stuff last night

[31-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so my son is gung ho ready to go with me on a mission lol

[31-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lots of anticipation around this project

[31-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> awesome! lol

[31-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghÃ¸st> good night

[31-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @CowboyCrypto great that your kids are helpful and supportive like that

[31-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Makes it easier to get them involved and helping and it's a good way of bonding

[31-Aug-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I do a lot with my kiddos lol

[31-Aug-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my son will be getting a crash course in changing oil tomorrow

[31-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> good

[31-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> good to get them to do practical 'jobs' like that

[31-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> my kids don't really do much of that type of skill other than some cooking

[31-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> They all do heaps of sport though

[31-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and I end up driving them all over the place

[31-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but it's different to doing a 'job' together

[31-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wanna teach my kids what I know

[31-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My son, 12, has a better portfolio than move investors I know

[31-Aug-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> He turned 5 or 10 dollars worth of Strat into a 300 dollar run last year

[31-Aug-18 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Hey Equaliser! How's it going today? Finally on my last 4 overnight shifts xD

[01-Sep-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> clocking on âœŒ

[01-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder yeah? for how much

[01-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder and will that convince you to build something out there?

[01-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> cause it was really dissapointing when I heard you say you wouldn't be building me an EQL house

[01-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's early stages at the moment, so we can look into it in the future, never say never ðŸ˜ƒ

[01-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> not too much here  @CowboyCrypto! how about you?

[01-Sep-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> to all those just waking up

[01-Sep-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> wake up and smell the coffee

[01-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Coffee is like a warm kiss in the morning lol

[01-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> A hot and steamy kiss ðŸ˜‚

[01-Sep-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There are a lot of options

[01-Sep-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And I donâ€™t recall saying I wouldnâ€™t lol I just said as far as what we had planned I couldnâ€™t start there

[01-Sep-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will build you a house wherever you want as long as we can get the permits

[01-Sep-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Well technically you will need to get the permits

[01-Sep-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are a contractor for hire at that point

[01-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I love it when you talk back to me. . come here. . let me rub your beard

[01-Sep-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Itâ€™s growing back ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

[01-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Beard rubs - 10k EQLI

[01-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

[01-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m such a rugged ol beard whore

[01-Sep-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> maybe getting the first permits through might have to be a collaborative process

[01-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Geodesic designs are very unique and it may take a little convincing to the council authorities to adjust their regulations or to just accept it.

[01-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I don't think it'd be a problem though

[01-Sep-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> like with most things, the first couple of times may be a little harder

[01-Sep-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> As long as the engineering designs are certified by an engineer then I don't think the council would be concerned.

[01-Sep-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I had to get a driveway plan through council AFTER it had been poured.

[01-Sep-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> The council basically didn't give a shit as long as I got the plans stamped by an engineer

[01-Sep-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so I paid my $200 and the engineer did nothing other than stamp them

[01-Sep-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I took them back to the council adn they happily approved them

[01-Sep-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think councils just want to cover themselves

[01-Sep-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> just in case anything goes wrong, then it'd be the engineers fault

[01-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ I was corresponding with the building permit guy

[01-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Itâ€™s all about the paperwork

[01-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> he already told me that there are already a few earthships in the surrounding hills

[01-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> and earthships are not exactly standard buildings

[01-Sep-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Those are absolutely amazing structures

[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder I sent you all the emails between he and I

[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you probalby still have em

[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yes I have them

[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I havenâ€™t forgotten you lol

[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you better not beard man

[01-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m finding multiple ways to help ppl achieve their goals

[01-Sep-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just gonna have to first prove it can be done

[01-Sep-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Thatâ€™s the most important part

[01-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> prove it on my 2 acres . .

[01-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you never mentioned though.  How much were those 50 acres?

[01-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Where are those 50 acres (generally)? Oh, yeah. And how much...?

[01-Sep-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I donâ€™t remember I have it all written down

[01-Sep-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Iâ€™m in bed relaxing lol

[01-Sep-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> hopefully with a cold beer

[01-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> nice one @MySoulisNotForSale  goo to start dealing with building permit guys

[01-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> get over that hurdle

[01-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that'd be a big achievement

[01-Sep-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> "earthships"

[01-Sep-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> lol
