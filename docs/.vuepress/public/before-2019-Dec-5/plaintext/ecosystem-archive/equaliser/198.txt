[dscrdeql] <adriana> owo

[26-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yep. You got in on the ground floor of the best crypto platform out, in my arrogant opinion.

[26-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> how does one sell is the question

[26-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> or buy

[26-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh boy. now u opened up a whole different cant of worms. lolol

[dscrdeql] <adriana> im curious

[26-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And now I really must go. Living on the edge of nowhere makes for long days on the road.

[26-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> you go

[26-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> learning curve...read komodo website. read both EQL and KMD whitepapers

[26-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Show her the ropes, guysüëå

[26-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and all about BDEX HDEX and UTXO's...then you will be a pro

[26-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Whitepapers are key to understanding the projects

[26-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Most are copy/paste

[26-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Some are full of big words and bs.

[26-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Few are great

[26-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> tfw they use wordpress

[26-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Researching is fundamental. Find github[ANN] for code and project develop and progression as well (later)

[26-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> It took me weeks scrolling through all the KMD sites and pages lol

[26-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <adriana> i need to be idle to collect rain?

[26-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> No, be active (talk every 60-90 minutes)

[26-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Go to your profile...you have an orange dot. Needs to be green too i think

[26-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> he gave me 10 but straight to my wallet

[26-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm still here ... I gave her ten. Soaks probably account for the rest.

[26-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> yee rest are from soaks

[26-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> When I get a minute in here, I throw a lot of rain üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And with that, one more and I'm out.

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Apparently you can't rain from telegram

[26-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> telegram knows we feel dirty after being in there...so its trying to give us a cleansing shower

[26-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[26-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
