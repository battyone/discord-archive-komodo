[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Is it 130sat ?

[08-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> is there any redditers here ?

[08-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> sad

[08-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 😰

[08-Aug-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> @Cypher i have reddit

[08-Aug-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> do you know how reddit bounties work or anything

[08-Aug-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Only reddit bounty ive ever done was for chainzilla but all we did was upvote the post and screenshot that for proof and send it in a private message to the mod

[08-Aug-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Private message in discord*

[08-Aug-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> right so a fruitless idea in that case?

[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Yeaa.. unless youre lookin for upvotes!

[08-Aug-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> 😉 something coming

[08-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> everyone loves a bounty

[08-Aug-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> You might want to consider changing the subreddit to /r/equaliser . Seems like it would be a lot easier to find and its also not already being used

[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol who dumped it down 😄

[08-Aug-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> does EQLI have a BTC correlation now?

[08-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Almost out of workkkkk

[08-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> BTC goes down, EQLI goes down?

[08-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Name three coins that don't have that correlation 😄

[08-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> None-whatso-ever

[08-Aug-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> USDT & TUSD

[08-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That's two 😄

[08-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Kind of a cheat, but still.

[08-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> NXT used to have an inverse correlation, but I don't even know if it's a thing anymore.

[08-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> over 20 something years old and it keeps rolling

[09-Aug-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> it "took a $hit" on me this morning, and all I had to do was replace the battery cables. .
