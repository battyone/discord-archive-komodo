[22-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just a question about exrates. Did you guy's test it out before beeing listed on there?

[22-Jul-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> How can you test a coin before it lists? That doesn't make sense 😂  we were meant to be listed start of august but they completed it early

[22-Jul-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> No I meant the exchange itself, I can't seem to withdraw EQLI but I don't know if it's the same with other coins

[22-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Has anyone mentioned they have been able to or not?

[22-Jul-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They take forever to withdraw

[22-Jul-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Had I known this was an ongoing incident and not a select few cases I would have never listed there

[22-Jul-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Yeah I think thats what Dragon meant had anyone tested the exchange

[22-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> like I said earlier has potential but needs to pick its game up

[22-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m waiting on a withdraw

[22-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> send tipsy dev for interview please

[22-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> @CowboyCrypto- Founder  and the wallet in here 😃  tipsy doesn't work

[22-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> gah so hard to know with some of these exchanges

[22-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> hopefully they are just going through growing pains or something. i know a lot of people are lame and decide to point miners/masternode payout addresses to exchanges too, so that can really slow down deposits and withdrawals on exchanges

[22-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hope so

[22-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I like the exchange, just not the fees and withdraw times

[22-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> 🤞

[22-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> well hopefully that can get fixed

[22-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But about the withdraw times on exrates. Is it sure it's just a long waiting period?

[22-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah give it another day or two if nothing happens then we can start with sending them support tickets lol

[22-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> hehehe wallet back online

[22-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And it's quiet in here 😦

[22-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There are a few orders on barterdex now. It's there if you want it 😄

[22-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As for Exrates, we're working on it. Allegedly, they will be upgrading the system away from manual sends within the next couple weeks. Right now, it's in queue until one of their people manually sends it. Annoying, inefficient, and frankly, kind of stupid.

[22-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And of course, we will continue to negotiate with other exchanges.

[22-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What are long drives like with kids? probably ok with a tablet device 😃

[22-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
