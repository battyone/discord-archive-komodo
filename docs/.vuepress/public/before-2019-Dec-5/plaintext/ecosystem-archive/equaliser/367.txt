[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> fun times

[23-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> more features always in development

[23-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> I have only just gotten into crypto 3 months back a lot of people seem to make serious money and a living from it too

[23-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Rain parties lol

[23-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> ?explain rain

[23-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> üòõ

[23-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Ahhh cool so these are commands i was wondering what that meant

[23-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Don't worry about understanding it all at once, just take your time and ease in. There's... many many layers to crypto, discord, and bots lol

[23-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> type `?cmds` in one of the proper channels from before and you will get a DM from Tipsy with a list of commands you can do

[23-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Yeah people have already started messageing me with buttons or links. Kind of annoying too lol

[23-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> oh yeah so

[23-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Discord is RIPE with spammers

[23-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> you can pretty much block/ignore every one of those if you don't know who sent it

[23-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Yeah true i could only imagine. Where there is money there is dodgyness

[23-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> You can turn DM's (direct messages) on and off per server... you need them on in here though for Tipsy.

[23-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Ahh ok ill have to look into that as well. So it seems like alot of people get kickbacks for these links huh?

[23-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just be sure to check out what coins are about

[23-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lots of these spam discord links are linked to hyped up coins just for the devs to earn money

[23-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> There are sooooo many though lol. Seems like they pop up all the time

[23-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Yeah try being listed as a developer lol

[23-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> I get about 2-3 a day

[23-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> minimum

[23-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Arent some of them the same coin with a different label? Lol thats a lot

[23-Aug-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Lemme say this. If you have to resort to auto-bot spamming to try and get traffic to your coin, you clearly don't have anything worth much. It's a disgusting tactic meant to only cull the most gullible, like many spam operations. Those who actually fall for it are much more likely to be duped by whatever they're pitching.

[23-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lots of coins have bots on multiple discord channels, so you might see some pop up a lot

[23-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> D.Y.O.R. (Do your own research) is an important quality in coin hunting

[23-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Yeah they pop up straight away when you join a channel wtf

[23-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Please never listen to only single sources, read the whitepapers when you can, and join communities like this for questions and a better feel of the project.

[23-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> I heard people talking about deeponion or something like that is that a mainstream coin.

[23-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> BAM!!!

[23-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Haha sorry just heard them talking about it only ones i heard of apart from bitcoin and ripple and ethereum

[23-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> lol

[23-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But really, not sure how you got invited to EQLI discord, because it's a good project üòÉ But I would stay away from all the discord invites to all kinds of coins.

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hi there @Jonathan-Mod

[23-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> really, you must like the coolness of fall

[23-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> prefer some hotness here

[23-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but it is nice to have a change now and then

[23-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm actually hoping it will rain here because it hasn't rained for seems like months and all the plants and grasss are all going yello

[23-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's becoming more of a big thing in Australia in the last few years

[23-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Nice

[23-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, same over here in The Netherlands

[23-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And probably all over Europe too

[23-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's kinda sad that we also have another holiday a few day's later that's kinda the same thing, for kids to go to houses and collect candy

[23-Aug-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But hey, we kinda have double halloween that way üòÇ

[23-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Kids here in sydney have started tirck or treating about 4 years ago.

[23-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not all areas

[23-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> also at school they're making more of a big deal about it

[23-Aug-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> means the kids come home with these halloween ideas

[23-Aug-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and their friends are going trick or treating

[23-Aug-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ans so it's kinda just taken off

[23-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <retrograde7> Hello everybody

[23-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At the moment we do not celebrate it but maybe if my son gets old enough we will üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <retrograde7> Trick or treat huh. Good ol halloween huh

[23-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <retrograde7> Mind you here in australia we dont really celebrate it that much

[23-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <retrograde7> Some people do it i  some areas though

[23-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <retrograde7> So how long has equilizer been around?

[23-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ‚ú® ariewayq ‚ú® ! The Real Human> better  hellow dear üòÑ

[23-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> fake candy

[23-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like an apple

[23-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...kids are pretty smart

[23-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they'd spot fake candy a mile off

[23-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> if the kids are older they'd egg the house

[23-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We don't give our son a lot of candy, but he doesn't even like most of them. Offcourse he likes some things

[23-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But we alway's give him fruit to school, and we we're going to MacDonalds last week, and you were able to pick a desert. I think it was some sort of kids yoghurt, a milkshake or some fruit. And he just picked fruit üò±

[23-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> That really surprised us

[23-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, we were talking about those discord invites earlier right?

[23-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Someone keeps me sending invites to a channel, but it's the same person

[23-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, can't they even see they already send you one?

[23-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm blocking some of them but I think it's just useless to block people, because 99% of the times it's someone different (or different account)
