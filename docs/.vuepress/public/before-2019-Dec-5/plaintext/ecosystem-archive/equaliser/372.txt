[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, I come back to lots of notifications üòÉ

[24-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But it looks like it's raining here in real life too

[24-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, going to in a few minutes, I can hear the thunder already

[24-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> noice

[24-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I love the sound of thunder

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's just one of htose sounds

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, to be honest I don't want it to near, but hearing it in the distance is nice

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that makes me wonder how incredible it is an dhow it happens

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, in the distance

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We have a clear view upstairs so watching it is also beautifull

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not cracking down on top of you

[24-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that can be a bit scary

[24-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I was alway's afraid my son would wake up to hail and thunder, but he sleeps through it all

[24-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And he has a room with a big roofwindow, so you can imagine how hard rain and hail on that must sound

[24-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you have a lot of thunder storms there?

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not too many

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> last time was super close

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> sounded like over house

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the windows shook and rattled

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but that was months ago

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> still, very impressive when it happens

[24-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> what vote lol

[24-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> hmm... hail and thunder

[24-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> very very frightening indeed

[24-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha..yep

[24-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Thunder storms have a scary but also a strange thing. When I was little, whenever the thunder was really a lot and closeby, we were sitting downstairs with the whole family. Scary but also a nice feeling of beeing together

[24-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, a good family experience

[24-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> well,, can be

[24-Aug-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If everyone is scared it can be different I'd imagine haha

[24-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, time to go to sleep üòÉ
