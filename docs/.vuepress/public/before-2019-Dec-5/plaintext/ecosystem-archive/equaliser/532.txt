[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Kmd is just so good I don't understand how it gets no attention

[07-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah I'm holding my ARRR

[07-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm about to load up on kmd heavily

[07-Dec-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I might put a little bit into ada, neo vet and icon

[07-Dec-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> But most will go to kmd and eqli

[07-Dec-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> No Christmas presents for anyone this year üòÇ

[07-Dec-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I put money into my car lot and that was a great investment

[07-Dec-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> How's your teeth cowboy?

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Hopefully better

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh. Not as much pain

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Got antibiotics n pain killers

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Well that's a positive

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I got 4 pulled out near the start of the year

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Was terrible pain before that

[07-Dec-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve been on a mission to get us back on track

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus trying to get rewards contracts enabled

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Just worry about the building and rewards

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve gotta keep trade going though

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Or we will get delisted

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Next year we will see the volume and price increase

[07-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Ah crap

[07-Dec-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Ok I'll try help out soon

[07-Dec-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There are sooooo many things to do in running a coin

[07-Dec-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto do we need volume to stay listed?

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yes

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 1000 a day is the req

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hummmm, didn't realise

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah I heard that from another coin

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll be on it soon enough

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Threatened to delist them because of low volume

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Damn

[07-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's so hard to get listed in the first place

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just don‚Äôt possess enough hours in a day

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Personally I think it's a bit harsh to delist coins during bear markets

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> But I don't make the rules lol

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs business

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Unfortunately it seems to be the lifeblood of any crypto coin

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Honestly it won‚Äôt matter

[07-Dec-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah we will get there

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> :EQLI1:

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If we got delisted from everywhere I‚Äôll still carry out my goal

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm not going to fail.

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Good man

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This is a massive market we are about to disrupt

[07-Dec-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice

[07-Dec-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> :Amusing:

[07-Dec-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did the math on a 10k sq ft home which we could list at 600k usd and be at half of appraisal value with, and I could pull one off every 35 days

[07-Dec-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So 6m just in that game, which funds us for a very long time

[07-Dec-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just an example but there are a multitude of structures we can offer for fiat to fund the crypto end of things

[07-Dec-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah man once you get the first house up and sold you will be in a good position

[07-Dec-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think it could be a blessing in disguise that you had a few set backs

[07-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It proves the anyone can own a home theory

[07-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well hopefully you can find some cheap land in australia

[07-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ill buy üòÑ

[07-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hahaha

[07-Dec-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> with eqli only though not enough fiat lol

[07-Dec-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are going to build a professional foundation first. Once we are established then we will seek out land on a massive scale.

[07-Dec-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> F#k yea

[07-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> @SwimedDragon  that‚Äôs because no one reads what is said. They just pop in say thanks and leave.

[07-Dec-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @blackstone1 That's why I said it lol

[07-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @blackstone1 you could rain rather than soak, that way people that pop in, need to stay and talk otherwise they won't get anything

[07-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Thanks  @!üëΩThorthüëΩ

[07-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> I‚Äôll do that @‚úåJellysmash‚úå next time. I try to come and go some everyday

[07-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I normally just rain for that reason.but sometimes it's good to soak to let them come and see that they're missed out on the rains

[07-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Time for me to do my Sat morning weights
