[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> everyone

[06-Nov-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Greetings

[06-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yoooo

[06-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Hey guys

[06-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Gee. Wish we had a video of the compressor. 😂

[06-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> (as long as nobody was hurt it's funny right?)

[06-Nov-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My son about pissed himself

[06-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once he got over the shock he thought it was funny

[06-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hey guys...back home and dinner time

[06-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> nachos...kids have it on corn chips...I have it on brown rice.

[06-Nov-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> lots of mince and beans...nice

[06-Nov-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hey good to hear about a lot of new options for Equaliser

[06-Nov-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> look forward to hearing about them.

[06-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've been tthinking as well  of how to progress Equaliser into other areas as well.

[06-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's tough though

[06-Nov-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Maybe if Equaliser teamed up with a payment system provider whereby Equaliser could be used as a currency for payment to buy whatever goods. That's what a lot of other crypto currencies are trying to get, ie get their crypto used as a currency for a payments platform to be offered by retailers as a means of payment.

[06-Nov-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> EQLI would be competing in that area with a lot of other coins, but would be good if it was possible. It would give Equaliser a lot more exposure.  I saw a few Cryptos in the last couple of weeks teaming up with SwirlPay and Whopper Cards.

[06-Nov-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Might be worth looking into later down the track, who knows.

[06-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> remember we will be added to pungo wallet

[06-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> cool

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm also curious to what the options are 😃

[06-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Morning all

[06-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[06-Nov-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hey jelly

[06-Nov-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 👋

[06-Nov-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wouldnt mind other payment systems integrating us, but we need liquidity in order to do that

[06-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> @jellysmash ☕☕☕☕

[06-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm really getting sick of these people

[06-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Also still in pm messages, they never stop

[06-Nov-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Cypher - Founder break the link between tg and disord

[06-Nov-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lets just shut down the tg channel.

[06-Nov-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Tg channel could alway's be set back up once we start to get more people in here. Don't think we'll see a lot new people till that first house is build and gets attention of people

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Looking at charts, you?

[07-Nov-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not looking at charts 😄

[07-Nov-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> haha hope you been well bass

[07-Nov-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Haha, yeah, just trying to get back into a normal sleeping pattern. Whats new with you?

[07-Nov-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ah same old.. trying to fix my sleeping pattern but its not working

[07-Nov-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> trying to cut down discord/crypto time as well

[07-Nov-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> also not working that well 😮

[07-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, many people are trying to get a better life balance and reducing time on crypto, I understand as it leads to many sleepless nights.

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I've been failing to cut the discord time too, but it's hard to do since some things often require checks, and it's not all timed on the same moment.

[07-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If I get some temp work in I.T, I'm going to suggest they use discord for collaboration so I can be on here while working lol
