[11-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I agree with you. I believe they are really doing some good works behind to give us all what we need to hear about the project development

[11-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I know the recipes are beeing tested, and exchange progress can't be discussed. New website should be coming soon too. Not sure when they are going to visit Puerto Rico again but I guess that's in the near future too.

good text, Jelly!

[11-Sep-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here if you know of any podcasts or youtubers that would take an interest, let us know or message them on our behalf and lets get the word out about this project. I have some great news to share soon, but waiting on the ink to dry so to speak. HOPE YOU ALL have a great day!

[11-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Having a great day here üòÉ How about you? Is it hard to wait to share the news haha?

[11-Sep-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> sounds good have a good day cowboy

[11-Sep-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> I think power ledger and equaliser is a match made in heaven. We need to start decentralzing the grids. Take power generation down to a micro level. Have you guys thought about merging renewable energy with the homes you build? A neighborhood of your homes on a microgrid would be amazing.

[11-Sep-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> I noticed some of yall are in Australia as well. Would be a great partnership is all im saying

[11-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> its a good idea

[11-Sep-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is really hard to keep it contained honestly.

[11-Sep-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I spent 14 hours yesterday filling out paperwork and dealing with some things for this project, left at 7:30am and got home around midnight.

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @dolladollaiv interesting...I have some power ledger as well

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> 80 percent of puerto ricos transmission infastructure was ruined in hurricane maria. Sure if you have an eqli house you would be safe but would you still have power?

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not as much EQLI  but a little

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Same!

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I believe it's a ogood project backed by the Australian government

[11-Sep-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's price is down a lot as well

[11-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and a good time to buy

[11-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I bought a little about a week ago

[11-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and yes Hurricane Maria took the power grid off line in Puerto Rico for a long time

[11-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Great time to buy but im not worried about the money to be made, its there. Just need to implement the system and get it out to the people who need it

[11-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I dont' know enough about Power ledger to know how to utilise it in a Equaliser way

[11-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but there may be some way of doing that

[11-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just not sure

[11-Sep-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well, we are working on several possible scenarios. Puerto Rico is about to get hammered down again from the looks of things. It is that time of year. We are working on the idea of building concept that I can build somewhat locally as to reduce costs.  I have alot of resources at my fingertips here that I do not have there and I want something that is tested for structural integrity before we laying claim to hurricane proof homes in the caribbean

[11-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, that makes sense

[11-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but once they start going then the game is on.  Powering a neighborhood, will most likely be the byproduct of propane generators and solar.

[11-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> You would have to put the power ledger system throughout the whole neighborhood to share rooftop solar with each other. Trading energy between each house

[11-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> building the prototype doesn't necessarily have to be in Puerto Rico

[11-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's the beauty of a prototype

[11-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'd love to be in PR but i need a provable system first.

[11-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's so let people view how it can be done and what improvements can be made before it's rolled out on a large scale

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> .If you see my response in the #ama-mondays-1700-utc  channel, we have many options for what we want to do.

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the limit is our imagination and our budget.

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be good if we could incorporate solar panels into the shape and frame of the geodesic dome structure

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> imagine that

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Well u have about 2 days till florence makes landfall, you could head out to virginia and build ur prototype real quick lol. /s

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> even the walls and roof would be generating power

[11-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i hope @Jonathan-Mod gets the hell outta dodge

[11-Sep-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that one looks like a bad one..

[11-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> I think the incorporating the solar panels would be amazing. Just have to keep cost low. Cant be buying tesla solar tiles, too much.

[11-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I'm on the outskirts of it @CowboyCrypto- Founder - SW VA

[11-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> right on the TN border

[11-Sep-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Geothermal heating could be useful as well.

[11-Sep-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Rainwater collection systems too

[11-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im about to quadruple the amount of air cells in the blocks

[11-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> which will make them thicker, more insulative and stronger after a cure.

[11-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be much lighter

[11-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lighter as well

[11-Sep-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Get some!!!!!!

[11-Sep-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I own a car lot, but I make blocks in the shop üòÇ

[11-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Nice!

[11-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once i have the recipe dialed in, I will be pushing to rent a seperate warehouse to mass produce them

[11-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if our funds allow it.

[11-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the only thing i have not figured out is what kind of foundation we will use.

[11-Sep-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've considered making a ring foundation and just filling with cement to build the domes.

[11-Sep-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> What was the guy who lives in turkey use? Y'all's partner

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but I think they pour a slab

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Oops lol

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to call him and message him

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> or*

[11-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
