[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs going to be an amazing thing regardless of market conditions.

[29-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm looking for different finish options right now

[29-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We may end up hitting the aircrete with a thin layer of shotcrete to increase the stability

[29-Aug-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Like a render

[29-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[29-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Another option is to wrap with a fiberglass mesh and apply mortar

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol

[29-Aug-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's that because I'm in the land down under?

[29-Aug-18 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> vegemite yum

[29-Aug-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha...yes land of vegemite

[29-Aug-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its funny how people hate it because they put too much on. I could eat it by the teaspoon but a nice helping of butter and a tiny smear on toast hits the spot. good cuppa tea with it too

[29-Aug-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, that's the way...sounds good

[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good morning!

[29-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> morning @gh√∏st

[29-Aug-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> what's your target price for EQLI guys?

[29-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 100 USD

[29-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> üòõ

[29-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> true

[29-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> that would make the marketcap of EQLI 50billion usd

[29-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> is that a realistic target?

[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> US property market values at about 31.8 trillion usd , while the world total is worth 217 trillion usd

[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> so maybe it's possible

[29-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> EQLI price looking good today üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, it's picked up in the last hour or so

[29-Aug-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> interesting

[29-Aug-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I hope everyone is smart enough to hold

[29-Aug-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'd like to BTFD but need a dumper to help me out with that

[29-Aug-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> any whales in here that can oblige?

[29-Aug-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a couple of mill should do the trick

[29-Aug-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is that for if you hold Komodo or have the Agama wallet?

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I would install to the latest version anyway.

[29-Aug-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thats agama

[29-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Can I just re-download it and it will overwrite the old?

[29-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I was trying to download the latest Agama wallet on the weekend but the komodo link wouldn't work

[29-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i raised a support issue and they said that they would activiate it when the latest version was ready

[29-Aug-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the version i had wouldn't sync for KMD

[29-Aug-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i googled and they said you need to get latest 2.41 or something like that

[29-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so now hopefully i can move some KMD to my agama and get the 5% rewards for it

[29-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Latest version is up now üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do I just need to download that version and the rest is done automatically or do I need to save wallet.dat files?

[29-Aug-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> good practice to backup wallet.dat

[29-Aug-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> when it asks you want to select 'update current version'

[29-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok, first time I have to update it so just beeing carefull üòÉ

[29-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Thanks

[29-Aug-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i just installed the latest agama wallet...

[29-Aug-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> noice

[29-Aug-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it can now synch to the kmd chain

[29-Aug-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i can now transfer the little kmd I have to it so I can get the 5% rewards

[29-Aug-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> do you need to update the wallet.dat if you just use the lite version @AndronicusBass-Founder

[29-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You cant update wallet.dat

[29-Aug-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> So I don't need to backup my wallet.dat if using agama lite mode?

[29-Aug-18 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> correct. you dont have to backup  when updating the software but its good practice

[29-Aug-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ok, actually i just updated it and moved my KMD into my agama wallet

[29-Aug-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> no problems

[29-Aug-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> when did the new wallet come out?

[29-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> today or yesterday

[29-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> download it now üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> @AndronicusBass-Founder It only gives me option to "reinstall current version" or "uninstall"

[29-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> select reinstall

[29-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> üëå

[29-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Could be better wording but that updates.

[29-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> haha ok

[29-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> do i want to uninstall agama and all of its modules? @AndronicusBass-Founder
