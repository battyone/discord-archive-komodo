[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you're using a seed phrase, you shouldn't need one.

[26-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Make sure you're not running the coins in native mode.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hyperdex is less of a PITA than Barterdex by leaps and bounds. Still got a ways to go, but it works pretty easy üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and the new version you may have to go into the manage coins tab first

[26-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> in BDEX that is

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> oh yeah, forgot that part. Might be the whole thing right there. In hyperdex you still have to make sure EQL is added to the active list in settings.

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> i have looked at Hyper and couldn't see any

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Weird. There should be at least a dozen orders on BTC and Komodo from my server alone.

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> but starting to wonder if it is not playing nice on my end with network

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i already done that an added eql

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> still nothing coming up on the exchange

[26-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> also couldnt see any volume on the bdex stats page

[26-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe ping @PTYX  or someone over htere to check on the back end?

[26-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't think there's been any. I have the same amount of coins listed as when I launched this instance a week ago üò¶

[26-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if they can fix barterdex and make it user friendly it will be a step in Komodo taking over more of the market

[26-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> dahell? I swear this market exists üòõ

[26-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> yeah - both Bdex & HyperDex make doing small swaps so easy......when it works..... but the hit rate due to order matching and tech issues is a bit off at the moment - been playing with it since Sep last year - getting better all the time

[26-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll see if the KMD guys need to switch something. Or I'll ask Evan to, since he's on first name basis with the big players.

[26-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Our project was my introduction to Barterdex. And frankly, this is not going to replace central exchanges without severe revision.

[26-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> couldn't agree more

[26-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> dont forget to manage your UTXOs

[26-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The failure rate doesn't concern me that greatly, yet, because there's a bigger issue. You have to go b y UTXO size, whereas I can place any size order I want on a traditional exchange. That, I believe, is the first user facing issue that needs fixed. Then efficiency.

[26-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> My UTXO's are set at 500, 1000, and 5000 currently.

[26-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> dont even understand what is being said lol

[26-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> yes - the magic of utxo matching - who knew üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> but if the seller has a good liquid selection to aim for and you are aware of what you need on your side - it works - dont see it ever really replacing big exchanges - but it is great to own the keys.....

[dscrdeql] <c2k> unspent transactions

[26-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nice ICP reference üòÑ

[dscrdeql] <c2k> lolol

[26-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> UTXO is and unspent transaction. Coin control was introduced in Proof of Stake wallets, and then in Bitcoin core so you could pick and choose, primarily to avoid fees and maximize POS returns. Atomic swaps match order to specific UTXO's rather than order size.

[26-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I think this could be optimized within barterdex to split UTXO's on the fly by ANY number. You can do it manually in any wallet that has coin control enabled, so why not build in some automation?

[26-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Granted, behind the scenes it would be somewhat complex, but it's not beyond the current state of the tech.

[26-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> way over my head. maybe u need to have a 1 on 1 with jl777 in a PM

[26-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive been using BDEX for a while..mostly u can get things done but its not efficient and often frustrating

[26-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @Biomech-Founder its not pure automation - but have you seen BarterDex make inventory feature? I have seen it auto trigger that when setting up a swap - or you can break your uxto's yourself

[26-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've not seen it auto trigger, but I've not done a great many trades. Breaking the UTXO's by hand, that I already do üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But Hyperdex doesn't have that feature, and that's annoying. Barterdex is difficult to use, but has more features. Hyperdex is pretty easy, but needs an 'advanced' tab.

[26-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <miles> yeah - step by step !

[26-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> BarterDex Make Invenotry Tab - worth checking if you are doing it all yourself

[26-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In re-reading this, I come across pretty negative towards BarterDex. That's just frustration with an unfinished product. I like the concept. Hell, I love the concept. My critiques have more to do with what needs to happen to make it work for Grandma.

[26-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @Biomech-Founder i get you though! i did a swap for MNZ back in Sep 2017 testing - it really didn't work then üòâ
