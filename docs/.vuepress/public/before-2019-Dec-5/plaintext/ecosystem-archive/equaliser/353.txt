[20-Aug-18 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> lol...I can see mine in there

[20-Aug-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it'd be interesting to see dates on those as well like when they arived

[20-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I guess it's possible to lookup each address and see what transactions intered and when

[20-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I guess more interesting to see all those big hodlers in the top 20 or so

[20-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> large numbers

[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> To my knowledge those amounts are put aside for the development of Equaliser and building affordable homes

[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so it'll ultimately benefit the whole community

[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> also it means there's no oversupply of EQLI on teh exchanges

[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so it's a good move

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The largest wallets are held by us. Yeah, we are reserving most of it to make things work ðŸ˜„

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's good

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm glad it's in your hands and not some dumpers

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> although I'm missing the dumper

[20-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It'll all get properly organized shortly. A lot of real life stuff getting in the way right now. We'll publich our company addresses and what they're earmarked for soon.
