[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> HyperDEX is the same as BarterDEX (same backend) but more user friendly

[07-Jul-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sourge> it would be ballpark tho

[07-Jul-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm focusing on getting you guys a few listings so that we can focus on building

[07-Jul-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They don‚Äôt want us all talking and telling each other what we paid for listing

[07-Jul-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Which we do anyway lol

[07-Jul-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Cryptobridge is on our list but they have issues with zcash parameters

[07-Jul-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what does zcash have to do with anything

[07-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol we are a Komodo asset chain which means our code basically consists of zcash and bitcoin combined

[07-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
