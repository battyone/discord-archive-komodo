[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I just stepped out for a break, learning alot about types of gasses, flammable components and oxygen displacement. This info and certification is applicable to a multitude of environments including construction. Many countries will have strict safety protocols for building so by having all bases covered will ensure minimal delays getting approval or permits for building. 👌

[11-Sep-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It will be great to educate local labourers in local communities around construction safety and mitigation plans to avoid accidents or risk.

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass I think Australia would have some of best safety in the world

[11-Sep-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Massive debt....the world will need Equaliser even more

[11-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've been seeing inflation over the past few years when governments say it's fine. Alan Greenspan an ex federal reserve chairman I believe came up with the core inflation model where governments cherry pick economic data in favour of lower inflation figures. When the bank of England confirms that loans and mortgages inflate the broad money supply, it's basically the same as quantitative easing otherwise known as money printing. Economics 101 I learned that interest rates need to be raised with increased money supply. Household debt to GDP in Aus is somewhere around 190% people don't realise how bad tgat is. Australia will have its own sub-prime mortgage crisis. Banking investigation has turned up many improper practices from Australian banks and financial institutions

[11-Sep-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I fear for everyone.

[11-Sep-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If that pushes interest rates up than that will cause a big problem

[11-Sep-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> My first mortgage were when interest rates were around 15%

[11-Sep-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If interest rates went up to that level now, then a lot of people would lose their home

[11-Sep-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Sep-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> There's a good movie called "The Big Short"

[11-Sep-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Came out about 3 years ago about the US  housing crisis...

[11-Sep-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Great movie

[11-Sep-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I have to watch it however, I heard it's good.

[11-Sep-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, you'll love it

[11-Sep-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> But if they can't increase interest rates as it will cause havoc, loans and mortgages have to slow or stop which gives those trying to remortgage for a better rate, little chance. Those on interest only mortgages not paying off any principal amount are probably the worse off. ABC article on mortgage stressed Aussies says 1m are mortgage stressed. Either which way, we are over due for recession,possibly depression.

[11-Sep-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice level up there  @AndronicusBass

[11-Sep-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, we haven't had a slump in housing ever in Australia.....that I can remember. I've had mortgage for 30 years and housing prices are nearly always increasing

[11-Sep-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Indeed, unfortunately many are complacent and think Australia is different. Sure the population can rapidly increase to kick the can but it's only a short term fix that reduces quality of life, congestion on public transport and roads, potential for reducing wages with increase of competion for jobs, increasing rent for competion of rent supply among many others. Majority of politicians have a legal background, we need more with background in economics

[11-Sep-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, agreed

[11-Sep-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Many think Australia is different, but it's not

[11-Sep-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Sydney may be a little different

[11-Sep-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In 2014 the G20 agreed on bail in policy where creditors to the banks will bail out the banks, similar to cypress where the banking holiday was extended, people couldn't use their savings or deposits as they wished, limits were reduced for cash out at atm's. Anyone with savings over 100k Euro took a haircut on their savings

[11-Sep-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Always big demand for Sydney

[11-Sep-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When people have savings in the bank, they are creditors as defined by IMF. I believe the stock markets have been doing well because so much credit is being pumped in to it, pump and dump and it's a bait and switch from the elite, I bet they are buying up crypto slowly as weak hands exit crypto which is why HODL is a legitimate concept
