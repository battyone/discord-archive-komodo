[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Faisal I suggest you don't sneeze if it's painful

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> thats ok i understand

[24-Aug-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yes the plan is to build in more then just one place.. the the first house/houses will be built in Puerto rico.. I think after those houses are done more countries will get involved

[24-Aug-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> each house will be different... the founders will better answer these questions though

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I can imagine. It can get to 50 degrees Celsius here in South Australia, i know how you feel. I plan to build one for myself, maybe more

[dscrdeql] <hotboy30199> you need to fix website. your website shit and cheap.

[24-Aug-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> @hotboy30199 thanks 😃 but yes you will need to keep an eye on progress.. once the first houses are built we will have a better idea

[24-Aug-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yes the website is being updated

[24-Aug-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> it is a bit slow sorry about that

[24-Aug-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> Hi, I have a question: Did anybody understand page 18 in the whitepaper?

[24-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> Can somebody help me to understand it? 😃

[24-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good morning everyone 😃

[24-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I'm not math-adverse but the formatting how it's done there is very bad and hard to read

[24-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @SwimedDragon hey there

[24-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @coinard I'll have a look

[24-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> this should probably be extended over three or four pages, properly formatted

[24-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Morning Everyone

[24-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> at the moment it looks like it has been put in there to impress the plain reader and to make him think, that whoever writes something like that must be really, really smart

[24-Aug-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> like when people on sci-fi shows talk about "tachyons" or "hyperspace" 😂

[24-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @coinard just showing mathematically the the geodesic some structures are very strong

[24-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I get the point but why is it so poorly laid out?

[24-Aug-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> you really need to read to the end of it to get to the point, though

[24-Aug-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Could just be that there may be people out there that might challenge the strength of the dome style dwellings...the maths might prove to those ppl that it is a sturdy engineering structure.

[24-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Personally I don't sweat the small stuff

[24-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Things like formatting...layout...is subjective

[24-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> but it's really hard to follow the math. To start with, letters that should be subscripts are just plain letters so they look like variables.

[24-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> that's not subjective, I'd say, that's just common sense

[24-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I'd go as far as saying that the math, how it is presented there, is wrong

[24-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ok

[24-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its for people that can understand it to read it, it wasnt intended for everyone. Its quite a comprehensive wp

[24-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> Compared it to an English sentence: If I just use wrong letters or write it with random spaces or interpunctation, it will not make sense

[24-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I think I can understand math 😃

[24-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> that's why I cared to understand it

[24-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You have only been the 2nd or 3rd person to raise the question of its purpose. I see this as a non-event that you can take it or leave it

[24-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 👍

[24-Aug-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> 😅 ehm, ok...

[24-Aug-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Tipsy loves ya

[24-Aug-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I hope you put more sincerity in the rest of the project 😉

[24-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You wouldn't believe how much already 😍

[24-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> yay, I'm an intern

[24-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> how much?

[24-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I'm ready to believe

[24-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @coinard seems like kinda getting overly concerned about the small stuff...I've googled and there's a tonne of evidence on the internet about the strength of the dome structure.

[24-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I certainly find this project very intersting, it really deals with an important problem

[24-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Stick around and find out 😃 and enjoy the perks of tipsy too

[24-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> I know that domes are strong, that's not the point

[24-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ok

[24-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> What is the point them?
