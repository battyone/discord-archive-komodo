[15-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Aug-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think more buyers coming in will help with volume

[15-Aug-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm expecting that the bounty program will help to increase that volume

[15-Aug-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
