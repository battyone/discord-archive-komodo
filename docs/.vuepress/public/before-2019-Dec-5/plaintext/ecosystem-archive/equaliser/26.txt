[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Yeah and it was their defense. It's wick and cant hold brazil sharp forward

[06-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I think they will play with 4 defenders and fellaini tonight

[06-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Not with 3 defenders and mids that won't do their defensive jobs

[06-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Hahaha fellaini that will be their biggest mistake

[06-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I was even surprise he made the list

[06-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hiiiiii

[06-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Heylo

[06-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Fellaini is a beast and will show his value tonight ;p

[06-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I don't get why they aren't always playing Dembele tbh

[06-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> He has no value!! How on hell you drop Radja and pick Fellaini

[06-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> True that

[06-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But I would take fella and radja and drop witsel

[06-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> He's playing in fucking china

[06-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> passing mostly latterally or backwards

[06-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> always slowing down the play

[06-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> That doesnt matter!! You check reason record. Fallaini didn't have a good season with utd, Radja was super hot in the italy league

[06-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Sure, but Fella has his uses

[06-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> In games where a guy with his size can really weigh on the defense of the opponent

[06-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And smaller guys like Mertens or Carrasco are less useful

[06-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That's why I say drop Witsel and bring both Radja and Fella

[06-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I also would not have brought Kompany tbh

[06-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> The glass man

[06-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> You aright. Martinez failed on Radja and I feel it was a big insult on Radja

[06-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Let see what happens. Fellaini and wistel can't pull surprises when needed

[06-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah, I felt bad for the guy

[06-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Doing his best, absolute ace season at Roma

[06-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But he's not a follower

[06-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> He is a leader. A game changer

[06-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Thank you

[06-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I look at myself that way as well

[06-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> He is like @Biomech-Founder @AndronicusBass-Founder @CowboyCrypto- Founder  in cryptoüëå lol

[06-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> haha, thanks. Does that mean game changer?

[06-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <BTC-BTC-BTC> Do we have to do anything for the ticker change?

[06-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Yeah Bass

[06-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not that im aware of. i dont know the technical details. I'm confirming those now as I don't want to give incorrect info  üëç

[06-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> You guys know how to change the game

[06-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Bless you all

[06-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> @üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ how are those guys game changers?

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @BTC-BTC-BTC the answer is no üëç

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Just watch what they will do with EQLI

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @sami Who do you mean? the football players?

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> I watched what cowboycrypto did with b3

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> Are they gonna do the same?

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Just wait

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Excites

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> For?

[06-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> whats b3?

[06-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> You guys are amazing

[06-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Wow b3 still exists?!?

[06-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> @üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ you tell me to wait, so it means you probably have something in mind as to what they are gonna do, care to expalin why I should be excited?

[06-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> @donaldmathers half dead

[06-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What country are you from? Are you aware of property price inflation at the moment in developed countries?

[06-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> I am from Germany

[06-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are building houses, they will be purchased with equaliser and have proof of purchase and title registry. Its an asset chain

[06-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @sami tell me what I did with b3

[06-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Would love to see your view.

[06-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> You know what you did, the whole team were scammers, I dont want to invest my time into explaining what you already know

[06-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In puerto rico, people's homes were destroyed and many couldn't provide a title for assistance or insurance claims. The title registry office in the government was down for a long time and people couldn't get assistance without it

[06-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That information will be provided on our blockchain

[06-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ummm I took zero dollars for my 20 hour days spent on that project. Yes I bought a Denali with B3, but that came from my own holdings. The issue with B3 was hyperinflation, too many coins being produced so I suggested we run a 1000:1 virtual swap.

[06-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Which helped curb the inflation, stabilizing supply.

[06-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe dogethereum is going to do the same, 1000:1

[06-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> What is b3? ü§î

[06-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Community went toxic on me as I was the only one left talking to the community so I left.

[06-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 1st project I ever worked on.

[06-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> of course you also banned lots of people for no reason

[06-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!!> HOT ‚òï  who wants üòÑ

[06-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sourge> why come on a new avatar sami instead of your orginial?

[06-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> meh whatever whats in the past is in the past

[06-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did what I thought was best at the time Sami. I stand on everything I do be it good or bad.

[06-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> b3 is also almost dead so who cares

[06-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Good point sourge

[06-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just want to build houses lol

[06-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> well good luck at that then lol

[06-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There was definitely a lot more to the story than what you saw though

[06-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Me too, we went to puerto rico to source suppliers and costs, scouted land and met locals and crypto community

[06-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sami> @CowboyCrypto- Founder probably, but I also talked to the dev before and it seemed like he had no control of the coin really

[06-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Josh had no control and how that happened is still a mystery

[06-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I love josh. Lol he‚Äôs my buddy

[06-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> @sami  I think its unfair attacking someone without knowing their part of the story

[06-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I believe you got what u wanted to know

[06-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs ok. I walked through that fire and I‚Äôm smarter and stronger because of it.

[06-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Let‚Äôs gooooo

[06-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Misunderstandings are common these days, quite alot of miscommunication.

[06-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I don‚Äôt mind talking about it. I still go talk to the team and pass along info I find useful

[06-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Anyway, I hope you are all ready for some exciting things coming our way
