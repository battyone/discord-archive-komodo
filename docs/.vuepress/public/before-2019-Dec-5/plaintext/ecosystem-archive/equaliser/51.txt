[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Another üòÉ - Agreed, in addition, we may or may not agree on this next one however, I believe established property investment has become property consumption for total speculation. It is a non-productive spend and negative gearing is removing potential income for government to put back into the economy because essentially our government is borrowing more and more money which is a given now we have the lowest cash rates in history. This is all not going to end well if the government doesn't recognise and intervene the state we are in. It will be difficult also given that the last time I checked, Australian federal politicians owned approx $370M worth of property investments and didn't include holiday properties. But any way to kick the can as long as possible will be preferred and it's getting to the point it might be too late. If I was a property investor, I would sell as much as possible to pay off favourite properties and own them outright. This too will cause an increase of housing stock and lead to further property price correction. Everywhere is a catch 22 situation unfortunately.
