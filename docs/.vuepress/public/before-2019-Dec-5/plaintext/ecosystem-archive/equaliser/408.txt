[05-Sep-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> this will really help to Equaliser out there

[05-Sep-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Equaliser is such a great project

[05-Sep-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and the more people that hear about it the better

[05-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> I believe that the all entire Equalizer community is promoting this project.
Any participant should disseminate information

[05-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> It would be nice to create a thread in Discord, where all the tweets of the participants are collected.

[05-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> we should promote and follow all the tweets

[05-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, there's some great tweets out there

[05-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> Thanx for the all rain

[05-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> social media like twitter is an amazing medium to get information circulated

[05-Sep-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> more awareness = more people =the community will grow

[05-Sep-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[05-Sep-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i actually like the idea of a channel just for tweets. would make it easier to see and retweet...or offer a bounty! lol
what do you guys think @Biomech-Founder @CowboyCrypto- Founder ?

[05-Sep-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> Materials can be distributed and in facebook

[05-Sep-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> there should also be some retweet bounty

[05-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> I'm not particularly interested in bounty :)
I distribute materials for free

Because any of our messages - leads to higher prices, in the future.

[dscrdeql] <c2k> many of whch are held by devs and founders

[05-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i thikn the founders are supposed to clean up some of those addresses because they each hold multiple addresses...was for security purposes i believe

[05-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CrytoHunter> damn. you know how much was raised?

[05-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im sure thats somewhere in the dexstats info too but i dont know off hand

[05-Sep-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CrytoHunter> just want to figure out. how much I over paid.

[05-Sep-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think the dico was 2000sats but cant remember exactly

[05-Sep-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> which is prob around 7c

[05-Sep-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CrytoHunter> That is about right. hope some will get burned so it will worth more each token or increase the number of token to all dico holders.
