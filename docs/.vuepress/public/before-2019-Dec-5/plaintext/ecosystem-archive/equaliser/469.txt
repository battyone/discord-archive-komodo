[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I just finished watching that movie 'Oceans 8'.  chick version of Oceans 11

[08-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It was ok, although I thought Oceans 11 and 13 were better.

[08-Oct-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> time for me to get some sleep

[08-Oct-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anything with Sandra Bullock in it should be cool. The Net and The Proposal are just a couple of many good ones. I'm yet to see oceans 8 however, the previews looked cool, dont tell me about it lol I'll watch it one day. Sleep well, keep well and gear up for Tuesday, there's a smell of awesome in the air.

[08-Oct-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
