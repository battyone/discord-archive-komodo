[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> did you see what happened in the city today? Melbourne

[09-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yes time is precious I agree

[09-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No, surprise me.

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> google it was pretty bad

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> suspected terror attack dont know the full story but a mad man lit his car on fire

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I read news only when I feel like it and most of the time is on global economics ðŸ˜ƒ

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> stabbed a few people killed one then tried to stab the cops

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> one police officer shot him non fatal shot

[09-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> unfortunately one person died from the stabbing ðŸ˜¦

[09-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it was on bourke st near myer i think

[09-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Damn, let's ban knives. Keep it in the Kitchen

[09-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> oh wait the guy died in hospital

[09-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> just read now

[09-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i was really hoping he would survive and rot in prison

[09-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, to be honest I can imagine that, but sometimes it's good if people just die

[09-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That's terrible news unfortunately. I wonder how the royal comission into australian banks is doing?

[09-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Alot of drunk people who have accidents, killing kids in the progress, get poor punishment in my opinion

[09-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah the laws need to be fixed

[09-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> don't worry bass i am sure some one will get bribed in the comission

[09-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> would not be surprised if they pay the bankers some compensation lol

[09-Nov-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> nah honestly have not been looking into it much

[09-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If my son gets hit by a drunk guy and dies, and that guy is known by the police for multiple offences, I would be so mad if he only gets a few years of jail time.

[09-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I probably can't even live with the idea that the guy will be living his happely life after that jail time while my family is having a loss till the day we die

[09-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yes but don't even think about that dragon

[09-Nov-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Society is unfortunately a disturbing picture. However, risk mitigation I'm sure will help with your concern. Run through many scenarios in your mind and think about ways to mitigate the risk without compromising your kids wanting to explore and learn their surroundings.

[09-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I used to walk outside and play around when I was 3 years old while my parents were sitting on 2 high indoors.

[09-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really don't see a lot people doing that these day's

[09-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep its pretty messed up sometimes but still heaps of good

[09-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Can you tell me the media outlet you first heard that news? And be aware of social engineering, I believe it is quite real.

[09-Nov-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> was at work so would of been channel 7

[09-Nov-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> of course social engineering is real people are zombies which makes it easy for them

[09-Nov-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You know Fairfax and 9 are merging and ACCC don't care? Just like TPG acquired ADAM internet in SA, internode and iiNet

[09-Nov-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Tv is too vile for me lol

[09-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i don't follow the media but at work the tv is on so i get some of the head lines

[09-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> at home my tv barely gets turned on

[09-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> pretty much only use it during afl season to watch some games

[09-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I was in a workplace that allowed TV and it was a novelty at first however, quite detrimental regardless of channel. it was in 2009-2010. since then, personally I unplugged the antenna and only get news when I feel like it. Most of the time has been research. I prefer to find out what's going on, not told what's going on.

[09-Nov-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've never had interest in sports, I felt alone at first and pretended to like it when I was younger however, It was so darn boring, I really didn't care for sports, never do and never will. I dont mind engaging in conversation about it with any info I know, other than that, sport is only a distraction. I want to concentrate on building cheap and strong houses
