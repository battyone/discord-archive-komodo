[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just helps to keep finger on the pulse

[27-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I keep the Equaliser discord on, but it can be confusing at times when there's a soak party üòÇ

[27-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sometimes a couple dozen notes, sometimes a couple hundred haha

[27-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But since it's in off-topic I think I can be sure to not check all of them

[27-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm rarely in off-topic I mute it

[27-Aug-18 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I try to switch there for off-topic talk at times but sometimes the chatter just goes lost between rains and thanks messages, and I end up here

[27-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> Thats why I like most conversation in general as it is sent to telegram group and our channel in Komodo discord

[27-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> So more people can be involved if they want

[27-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> back in the day medicine had all sorts of drugs like cocaine in it

[27-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> cough medicine had herioin in it

[27-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> coka cola had realy cocaine in it as well

[27-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> there wasn't the regulation there is today

[27-Aug-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe for the best

[27-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> But kids with ADD are given speed today. Not sure why people have a problem with giving kids with seizures, cannabidiol extracted from cannabis. The THC is not in it at all. Medicine can be patented, a plant can't.
