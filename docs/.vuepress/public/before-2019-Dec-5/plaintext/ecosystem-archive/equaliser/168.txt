[dscrdeql] <ganjie> dinner time

[24-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i would thnk a lot of that selfishness and less humanity has to do with the prevalence of social media...imo

[24-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The more we are connected online the more disconnected we become as humans. less humanity

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There was a southpark episode on it haha. I havent watched it for over a year. I wonder how many seasons now. 20 or more years for sure

[24-Jul-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ha, that i didnt know. dont watch much of that these days. between kids and work not much time for myself

[24-Jul-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> one thing about becomming a parent is that there is much much less selfishness in parenting. its all about your kids

[24-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I would say there is a bigger problem

[24-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> then just social media

[24-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> people have no belief in anything outside of themselves which in turn causes them to be more selfish.. survival of the fittest as they say

[24-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> why should i do that? it doesn't benefit me.. it's all about me

[24-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Oh I will get something out of it? sure I will do it

[24-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> me me me...and BTC >8k dragging the alts market higher 😃

[24-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> you will notice heaps of poor people are more giving then rich people

[24-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and you will notice that those poor people have belief in something outside of just themselves while many rich people are their own gods

[24-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> a generalization, but mostly true yes

[24-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yes I am generalizing some rich people are very giving and some poor people are not giving at all but you get my points 👌

[24-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> definitely

[24-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> btc doing nicely alts still getting hit though ]

[24-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> This is the most constructive BTC price action since late 2017. price is over its descending trendline, as well as both its 50day and 100day moving averages. next resistance is the 200day near 9225 followed by the may highs just below 10k.
the nearest fibonacci retracement level is at 38% which is 10,500. so as long as price can hold over $8k for a day or 2 it should grind higher to those areas mentioned above

[24-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> problem is that alts have been not catching the same buying as BTC this quarter. but today it seems theyre acting similarly in %age terms
