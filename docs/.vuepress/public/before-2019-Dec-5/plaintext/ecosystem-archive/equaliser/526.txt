[30-Nov-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hi GoldMine

[30-Nov-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto great plan

[30-Nov-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Hey guys

[30-Nov-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Yawwn.

[30-Nov-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Friggin tired

[30-Nov-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> So any update

[30-Nov-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I see chatter about block factories

[30-Nov-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hi there  @Smoky Satoshi

[30-Nov-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Heya. Why tired? not much sleep?

[30-Nov-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Yeah dude

[30-Nov-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Also been applying for jobs in arkansas.. Got a couple of rejection emails. Lol

[30-Nov-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Me too, been looking for a little more than casual jobs to cover living expenses. We havent been paying ourselves.

[30-Nov-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Equaliser is much bigger than just a coin, its my baby we are growing into something big to help change peoples lives

[30-Nov-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> our baby. I dont have kids but for me equaliser is like one to me üòç

[30-Nov-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> So the blocks are good to go?

[30-Nov-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> just have a quick read up above, some updates have been discussed üëç

[30-Nov-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Can i see what the blocks look like?

[30-Nov-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not yet

[30-Nov-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm waiting on approval from engineers still

[30-Nov-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I could get a red light on this and have to reformulate them

[30-Nov-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I don‚Äôt think I will but it‚Äôs always a possibility.

[30-Nov-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Ok

[30-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Remind me again?

[30-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> You are designing this to be a dome?

[30-Nov-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Using multiple techniques, not just domes. shotcrete, aircrete, 3d printing, geodesic, each to fit the relative environment and also by customer design and specifications

[30-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Aircrete is energy efficient because its insulated which requires way less energy for heating and cooling

[30-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No

[30-Nov-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not the first

[30-Nov-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will be a traditional style home outside of mountain home.

[30-Nov-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm going to have enough issues with getting aircrete approved but I‚Äôm 99% sure it won‚Äôt be an issue

[30-Nov-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Aircrete houses require less processes to build and less labor which drastically reduces costs for the homeowner as well as less energy costs

[30-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> They have these blocks molded out of recycled plastic. And build walls and joints like Legos. Seen it the other day on some fundraising commercial

[30-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah I‚Äôve seen them

[30-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Pretty cool shit

[30-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Won‚Äôt need the LEGO connection but I plan on implementing it

[30-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Could be another approach you can exolore

[30-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I‚Äôve been past that part of thought for months

[30-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Like those?

[30-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Nice

[30-Nov-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> But no

[30-Nov-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Imagine this. But molded into bulding blocks that fit into eachother

[30-Nov-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Its not letting me send the image

[30-Nov-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Mehh

[30-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ?

[30-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Copy image n paste In here

[30-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Interesting, looks like he does everything in plastic

[30-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think he might mean blocks made from plastic? problem with that is its susceptible to heat and you still need to insulate the structure which is an additional process

[30-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i.e. additional costs involved

[30-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be quicker to assemble though

[30-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> aircrete is light and quick to assemble anyway

[30-Nov-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just superglue them together...no concreting

[30-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> combustible material

[30-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah but what emissions come off of it when it gets over 100 f

[30-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> warping

[30-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Fire would melt it down trapping ppl inside

[30-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Imaging buying a lot home and it comes in a big Lego box....my kids would love it...lol

[30-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[30-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> good for play houses üòÉ

[30-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I would have gone crazy for that when i was a kid

[30-Nov-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Need a new room just add it...need a wall taken out, just undo the Lego blocks...

[30-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Probably get washed away in a heavy rain or wind easy

[30-Nov-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Although if you could add water to each block to make our heavier then that would help keep the Lego down..

[30-Nov-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The roads department put these large plastic safety barriers on some roads. They're a bit like Lego in that the clock together side by side. They full them with water tip give them weight and to withstand a vehicle hitting them.

[30-Nov-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Some road barriers can also have sand in them. That might work as insulation after construction. Would only use as a play house or temp emergency shelter

[30-Nov-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea

[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Good day all from snowy Canada. Did any of you hear about the earthquake in Alaska today? Crazy

[01-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> no, I didn't know there was an earthquake there

[01-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> was it a big one?

[01-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @jellysmash yeah 7.0 with several aftershocks

[01-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
