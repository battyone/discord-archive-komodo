[20-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol

[20-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe it's a world wide things..planets have aligned and everyone is very tired

[20-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Or not

[20-Nov-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Could be.  Crypto tired. Change of seasons.

[20-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha..New phenomenon...crypto tiredness

[20-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Yes but when it bounce back it be crypto joy

[20-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Could do with some crypto joy

[20-Nov-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This will hopefully purge many useless ethereum tokens and bitcoin clones that do nothing and bring great projects more into light. Tough times but regardless of the mainstream narrative that blockchain and decentralisation is useless, we know the opposite is true.

[20-Nov-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Ive always been long on crypto

[20-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Boom, 2 cars sold today!

[20-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> waiting on these checks to clear in the bank and hoping it drops down to about 3600.

[20-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> gonna grab as much coin as I can during this dip.

[20-Nov-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> YEAAAAAAA....nice one  @CowboyCrypto

[20-Nov-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Nov-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Forms should be here this evening as well üòÑ

[20-Nov-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> As you say, so many btc and ETH  clones out there that provide no added value. This carnage will saught them out

[20-Nov-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will hurt a few, but I think that people will ultimately see that the coins they thought were valueable were merely rhinestones not diamonds.

[20-Nov-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> when we have homes popping up  every few weeks, then people will see that you can truly hold that kind of value in a currency of this type and we will have the greatest kind of shitstorm that exists on our hands. A buyer frenzy

[20-Nov-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, agreed...in fact I hope this dump happens quicker....get it over and done with so crypto market starts picking up and new investors enter market.

[20-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I dont think it will be fast.

[20-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Either way though Im accumulating and knocking down some coins.

[20-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe

[20-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, good time to accumulate

[20-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im enjoying the thrill and excitement of running crazy trying to pull more money out of other ventures to buy lol

[20-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I havent had this kind of excitement all year
