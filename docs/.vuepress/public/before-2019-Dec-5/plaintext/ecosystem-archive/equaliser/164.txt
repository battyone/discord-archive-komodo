[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> @CowboyCrypto- Founder just created the new asset chain SCAM, you in?

[24-Jul-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Shit man I don’t know that I have time. Only way we can make this work is to launch it on EOS

[24-Jul-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Equals Obvious Scam (EOS)

[24-Jul-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 20% premine and we can just airdrop the rest

[24-Jul-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Boom we are set for life 😂😂😂

[24-Jul-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This time last year it would have literally been that easy

[24-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Look at useless ethereum token lol

[dscrdeql] <zenbflor💐> thank you @Biomech-Founder

[24-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Is EOS a scam?

[24-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lots seem to trash talk it

[24-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Idk honestly

[24-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just wondering

[24-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Thanks

[24-Jul-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know Brock pierce was going to meet up with us when we were in PR but he never answered any of our messages

[24-Jul-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And the fact that they can just freeze accounts at will is scary

[24-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Surely they can't legally just freeze accounts

[24-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s been done already

[24-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> nooo

[24-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> those accoutns were compromised

[24-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> don't fud the EOS yo

[24-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not fud just goin off what I’ve heard around the fire. I know some eos fanboys and some sheos chicks

[24-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> right, campfire stories

[24-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The fact that they have the ability to is scary

[24-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> who is "they"  . .do you even know the process that has to get done to freeze a given account?

[24-Jul-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Block producers on a consensus like bote

[24-Jul-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Vote

[24-Jul-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> all I can say then is don't invest

[24-Jul-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yea I would say I’m a bit past the newb stage of this considering I’ve been on 2 core teams and I’m a founder

[24-Jul-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
