[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> missed all the rains

[22-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> is exrates still not letting people withdraw?

[22-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They're doing it manually so maybe tomorrow?

[22-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> some people here have had their stuff locked for 2 + days

[22-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Anyone tried another coin withdraw?

[22-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Has anyone succesfully withdrawn yet?

[22-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I only have an EQLI withdraw pending but some others have it pending longer, so I'm not sure what will happen

[22-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> let's assume the worst, and this exchanges turns out to b ea fraud. . I hope the eql devs do something to compensate us for our losses, since they are the ones who picked and promoted this place to us

[22-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lets just give the devs some time to figure out whats going on

[22-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i will admit though this exchange is either just terrible and has the worst/dumbest traders on earth or something is fishy

[22-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> Hallo

[22-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> reviews for this exchange is terrible

[22-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yup

[22-Jul-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> seems to be two common reviews.. first one is its a shit exchange and really slow.. second one is don't use it it's a scam exchange

[22-Jul-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> please let it be number 1

[22-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This happens on other exchanges with other coins. exrates has been around for a while so they arent a scam exchange. We werent meant to be listed until the start of august so I assume the wallet integration is still happening and at least give it until start of august

[22-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> I dont think if the team knows about all this they will go on and list there

[22-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder I'm just going by the reviews I have been reading... like I said above seems to be 2 common reviews about this exchange

[22-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> I dont think if the team knows about all this they will go on and list there

[22-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> @CombatWombat  why dont you give it alittle time before making such comments

[22-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄ I have given it time... again I am going by the reviews I have read regarding this exchange.

[22-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I am hoping for review number 1 obviously but they are the reviews this exchange got

[22-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "The maximum processing time for withdrawal requests is 48 hours from the time when the request was created, but usually it takes no more than 12 hours. Please wait, financial department will process your withdrawal soon."

[22-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People say the same stuff about other exchanges and many people trade fine on them. just not all people can be satisfied

[22-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it hasn't been 48 hours... i'm happy to wait another day or two before thinking the worst... but again I did google exrates.me reviews just to see what other people said

[22-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> at least their support replied to me right away

[22-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah most reviews said its just a crappy layout and too slow

[22-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but there were a bunch of reviews that said they lost their funds (yes that could be due to a mistake the person made)

[22-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe they are doing upgrade to make it better

[22-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> all I am doing is relaying the information I have read

[22-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I hope so bass 🤞

[22-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄ Sorry if you thought I was being negative or fudding that's not my intention... just letting you guys know what other people have said. I bought eqli from ex rates so obviously I want the best

[22-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
