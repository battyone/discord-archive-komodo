[14-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Everyone has different taste on what to watch. I do think if you like Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit movies, you probably like Game of Thrones too

[14-Nov-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm several episodes behind on 'better call saul'

[14-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not much time to watch anything? I have those moments, sometimes I can sit down and watch new episodes of series every week, and sometimes I sit down after a month and have lots to watch because I couldn't find time to watch earlier.

[14-Nov-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> One time I was watching a series, and I didn't watch for 3 weeks, and expected some episodes to be aired, but they didn't üò±

[14-Nov-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just hate when they do that for no reason at all, or move the airings because some sort of lame sport event is on tv

[14-Nov-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> have you watched terror ?
