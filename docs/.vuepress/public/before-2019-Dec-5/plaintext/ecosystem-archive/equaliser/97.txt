[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yep, both were great

[16-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I'm rewatching Game of Thrones

[16-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I liked season 1 and 2 and got bored season 3

[16-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I tried several times to watch game of thrones al the way thru...every time I got one season further but still never finished it

[16-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> My shows were the sopranos and the wire

[16-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> It's pretty awesome, books are better of course but the series is further in the story which is weird

[16-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I was obsessed with both

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Now being broke isn't so bad if there's welfare

[17-Jul-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> No welfare then it's hard going

[17-Jul-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
