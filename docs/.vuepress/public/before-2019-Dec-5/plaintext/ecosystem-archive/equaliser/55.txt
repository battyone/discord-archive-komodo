[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I usually don't like to take medication unless I'm really bad

[08-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I was a locum doctor assistant/navigator/security guard, we saw cases like it and she would give them that or you can have a tablet if you can stomach it long enough

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> If I was in hospital and they wanted to give that to me because I was really bad then I'd take it.
