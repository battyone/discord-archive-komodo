[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the covenants were made in 1973

[03-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> So in 1973 people must have been running around molesting birds....glad we've evolved beyond that in the last 40 years..

[03-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Grant writing is an art. I’m an ok writer, but I’ve no experience in that field specifically. Luckily I have one I can use when it comes to it.

[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> i get u 😛

[03-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its mind boggling to me there are idiots selling their small lots of EQLI down to 20sats

people, for whatever you get selling it at 20sats just hold onto it in a wallet and 10x your money in a few months!

[03-Dec-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> personally i really dont mind because im one of the people buying down here...but if youve been in this chat collecting rains you really should be holding.

[03-Dec-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, good time to buy now. And with  rewards..OMG....fantastic

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s ok. Let em. I’ve been buying

[04-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And once we monetize the business end of it, then there’ll be support at 100k sats.

[04-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice

[04-Dec-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> People who don’t realize the potential currently will soon.

[04-Dec-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I thank all of you who are here though. It’s been a rough ride on the space as a whole, but with this project we will be able to convert coin into another store of value: real estate.

[04-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, it'll be huge

[04-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Buy as you say, it's been a rough ride and you have born the full brunt of that..

[04-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think we will beat everyone to market though, which is a huge advantage

[04-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Thank you for getting this work through and pushing forward no matter what

[04-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m too stubborn or stupid to quit lol

[04-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Haha

[04-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This is my dream.

[04-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once we have a few things completed, this coin becomes a juggernaut and our mission success is inevitable

[04-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s designed to be failure resistant

[04-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It will be a world changer

[04-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass I'm expecting btc to drop a bit over next 3 days..RSI overbought. Maybe down to 3300 to 3500 USD

[04-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm  guessing that will be bottom, so I think it'll start to go up from there.
