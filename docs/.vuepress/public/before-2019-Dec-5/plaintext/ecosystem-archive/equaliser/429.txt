[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no because Im buying the forms.

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> oooh..so, that's good

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> no probs then

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The main goal is housing.

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> can you get a stamp of the Equaliser logo on them when you pour each block?

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but blocks are a definite income stream

[14-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah thats easy.

[14-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so you can tell it's an equaliser house by the logo embedded into the block

[14-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I can just make one and put in the bottom of the form.

[14-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> problem is that once we finish the block it would  be covered

[14-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> you plaster the inside and stucco the outside.

[14-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> noice

[14-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @c2k What's that clap stuff you mentioned earlier?

[14-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Oh, I need to create an account for it

[14-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, just keeping it at twitter for now 😄 Trying to get the hang of it

[14-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I did follow and retweet, I think lol

[14-Sep-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> Is there a possibility that eqli will rise up?

[14-Sep-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> Do we have an exchange for eqli?

[14-Sep-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> @SwimedDragon

[14-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Exrates, Barterdex

[14-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And Hyperdex

[14-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> https://exrates.me/dashboard

[14-Sep-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think exrates, for me personally, was the one easy to use @nevermind💕

[14-Sep-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> @SwimedDragon what's the price?

[14-Sep-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> on exrates the price is just below 20sats

[14-Sep-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> amazing steal

[14-Sep-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> personally i doubt it stays down here much longer

[14-Sep-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @CowboyCrypto- Founder looks really nice !! 😃

[14-Sep-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @nevermind💕 you can always go to https://exrates.me/dashboard and look for the BTC / EQL pair to check the price

[14-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Exrates is not the most user friendly site but the price swings on there can be pretty impressive so there is money to be made if you are lucky/careful

[15-Sep-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are working on other exchanges but building is my primary objective

[15-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I saw the article and clapped. just wondering who "Evan Holford" is?

[15-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> is that one of the founders?

[15-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I presume so

[15-Sep-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> not sure though

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've clapped and clapped on medium

[15-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> We really are in exciting times

[15-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye I did the same also

[15-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im glad I managed to buy a big portion of this project at so low prices srsly

[15-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> this has places to go thats for sure

[15-Sep-18 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and when theres trust in a team theres trust in the project 😃

[15-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> glad you are here.

[15-Sep-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will not be easy. and there are not promises of lambos, but there will be houses!!

[15-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Lambo colored houses

[15-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CowboyCrypto- Founder  I imagine that you can add concrete colouring to the building blocks to give a more natural colour like a sandstone colour??

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Those blocks would look awesome in a sandstone look

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I havent messed with pigment powders yet

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> wouldn't have to paint them then

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well here's the thing I will have sto stucco them anyway

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so it wont really make sense to color.

[15-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> inside will be plastered.

[15-Sep-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im ok with houses 😄

[15-Sep-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> fair enough

[15-Sep-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
