[25-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Got $30 for my recycled cans and bottles. South Australia gives 10c for every can or bottle returned to a recycling depo. Great system as we have no waste anywhere. Homeless people collect to also make some income.

[25-Aug-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> wow

[25-Aug-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> sounds good

[25-Aug-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> Good Morning!

[25-Aug-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass that's great

[25-Aug-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They started a similar system in nsw a few months ago and my kids have been getting some money collecting bottles and cans..

[25-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But from what I heard the system hasn't beem that popular in nsw

[25-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But from what I heard the system hasn't beem that popular in nsw

[25-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Pity

[25-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think it's a great idea

[25-Aug-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And be great if every family collected and recycled

[25-Aug-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> recycling is a good thing we should promote and save our planet. the more v recycle more v reduce waste

[25-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah it's crazy people aren't taking to it in nsw

[25-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> further as mention by @AndronicusBass-Founder  it can be source of  income for the poor and the needy

[25-Aug-18 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That's what happens here in my city, people collect  as a source of income.

[25-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lots of cans top get at spring events

[25-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> People collect them here in vic but don't get near as much 10 cents a pop would be nice

[25-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> In nsw, they're 10cents

[25-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> If it was 10 cents here I could make real good money just going to footy clubs

[25-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Good way for kids to get some extra pocket money

[25-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> What we used to do when we were kids but gotta collect heaps

[25-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> im surprised more kids don't do it

[25-Aug-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> Yeah kids are too spoilt these days

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and I didn't have to stand over the BBQ with an umbrella so an added bonus

[25-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Sydney swans ahead of hawthorn by 19 points

[25-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> surprising ...but good

[25-Aug-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> swans rarely beat hawthorn

[25-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so to be ahead like that at half time a definite bonus

[25-Aug-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hope they can keep that lead
