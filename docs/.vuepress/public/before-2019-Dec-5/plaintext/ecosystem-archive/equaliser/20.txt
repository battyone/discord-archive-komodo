[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> No confusion now

[05-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it will still be equaliser in agama, but worst case scenario we just create a new chain and airdrop with new ticker.

[05-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but we should be fine for now.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> "No stop signs, speed limits, nothing gonna slow me down..."

[05-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Hsha....dirty deeds done dirt cheap

[05-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Yea...I got that

[05-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I like back in black...although not bon Scott singing

[05-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, that was a good album. Even had one Bon Scott song.

[05-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But Brian was a bit boring after that. The brothers' guitar playing just got better and better, but the vocals... Now they got Axl. That should be interesting üòÑ

[05-Jul-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I agree....Brian got boring after back in black.

[05-Jul-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Most of his songs sound the same

[05-Jul-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> But Scott was very dynamic

[05-Jul-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
