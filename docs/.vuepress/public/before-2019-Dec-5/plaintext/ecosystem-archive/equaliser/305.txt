[14-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I hope it hits 5k  . .

[14-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but I know it wont

[14-Aug-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I caught a piece on the bounce üòÑ Not much, but now I let it ride...

[14-Aug-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I expect it to bottom out around 5K within the next couple weeks. Then start up again.

[14-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Good night all!

[14-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Steve10 good night

[14-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Need some good news

[14-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've been buying while way down...the whole year

[14-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Each time I bought I thought this is the bottom

[14-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ....then it goes lower

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ...this is the bottom

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> .....then it goes lower

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Rinse..repeat.

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you must have steel ballz for crypto

[14-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> X 10

[14-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Good night steve

[14-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå same here been buying thing bottom close but to no avail üòÇ

[14-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I feel my balls are a bit battered....I need to convert them to steel

[14-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Haha plenty out there with their battered balls üòÇ

[14-Aug-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> this might be the last time I buy bitcoin anyway

[14-Aug-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I think im good on the crypto game

[14-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> believe it or not I make way more money in the regular stock market

[14-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> all those dividends keep me smiling. .  use em to buy more stocks. . free money basically

[14-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't have the patience for the stock market. I'm good at crypto üòÑ

[14-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It lets little fish like me play the same games on a smaller scale, and on my time frame.

[14-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> stock market trades were $20 when I was in that game

[14-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' Andy üòÑ At least I assume it's morning for you üòÑ

[14-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm a crypto guy through and through.....

[14-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's why my balls are batters

[14-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Battered

[14-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But not in the deep fried sense

[14-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> More in the bruised sense

[14-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ...in case you were wondering

[14-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lmao

[14-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I did the stock market thing years ago

[14-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Trades were way expensive even going through an online broker

[14-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Better than a battered sav

[14-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I only broke even after 2 years on stocks, one company went bust but another picked up the slack. 20$ can go far in crypto

[14-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> corndogs are awesome lol

[14-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I lost on just about every stock I bought except one

[14-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol...corndogs

[14-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Stock markets are extremely inflated at the moment, kudos if anyone is making money from it

[14-Aug-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They may be making money from dividends

[14-Aug-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I guess a masternode is a similar passive income

[14-Aug-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Could be

[14-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Or staking

[14-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I wonder what the rewards well be on the EQLI masternode.

[14-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Or could be like a lot of crypto people not accepting they have losses lol

[14-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've got crypto losses

[14-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But it's only really a loss if I convert it back to fiat

[14-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Otherwise...it's just down a bit

[14-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> According to twitter everyone making money haha

[14-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, can't believe them though

[14-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> No one wants to follow a self assessed crypto loser on twitter

[14-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They like to talk it up

[14-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Get more gullible followers that way

[14-Aug-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> My favorite type of winter day

[14-Aug-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> What about during day?

[14-Aug-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Trucking in the outback would be something nice .
