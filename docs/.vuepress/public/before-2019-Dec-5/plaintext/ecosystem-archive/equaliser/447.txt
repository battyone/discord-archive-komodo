[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @c2k get some good zzzzz

[19-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss 😈 TTC ]> is a really interessant project. and i hope. dream that at one day we, i can build a house with this technique. and i hope it comes to us in switzerland

[19-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Building in Switzerland will be great. As many places in europe too will be nice. I ask because I'm interested what new people think specifically, i dont think Ive seen you around before 😃

[19-Sep-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss 😈 TTC ]> no problem about your ask. the nice thing is that i be in a older, who i ca, and want build a house. not this year. not next. but soon.

[19-Sep-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss 😈 TTC ]> Geodesic domes is the big dream from me

[19-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ve built a lot of geodesic domes

[19-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Being in Switzerland I’d consider monolithic as the insulation factor Is super important

[19-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> True, unless a majority of the geodesic structure is covered with earth. Have a garden on top.

[19-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah but on geodesic you have to seal the seams perfect

[19-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Or they will leak

[19-Sep-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss 😈 TTC ]> i love this view

[19-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You can cover monolithic domes in earth to grow a garden on top or just lawn

[19-Sep-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That looks awesome

[19-Sep-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> No wind could ever blow it down either

[19-Sep-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I plan on making homes that are damn near indestructible

[19-Sep-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> One of dome Gaia domes got hit by lava in Hawaii and is still standing

[19-Sep-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I have a few full frontal skits up my sleeve haha

[19-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> full frontal was a great tv show

[19-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i remember watching it with my whole family when I was a teenager

[19-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and laughing and laughing

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> very australian

[19-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Same. Last few years I got into the D-generation with the Mick Molly, Tony Martin crew and also can't go past fast forward lol.

[19-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> A shame that those skit shows have been killed off by Political Correctness, Aussie humour has always been when you take the piss out of someone, its a sign of respect.

[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, I remember tony martin and mick molly show. it's true....PC has killed so much in australia. It's almost like it's killed Australias spirit and humour.  vitually can't say anyting for fear of offending someone and losing your job or worse.

[dscrdeql] <Zach> I don’t think that’s just in Australia, that’s in the states too

[19-Sep-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It feels like it's been planned all along. If you say something which is a valid opinion about something, someone will come along and try to correlate it with being offensive. Truth is that facts dont care about feelings. people are too offended these days and it's stifling creativity. can blame indoctrination and social media for it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMoDt3nSHs

[19-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yet it's illegal to grow your own tobacco that is natural and doesn't have chemicals added. 🤔

[19-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> bass my 25 gram pouch of tobacco went up another 5 dollars from 35 to 40!

[19-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i moves to roll your own as a packet was too expensive.. when I started buying pouches they were less then 30 dollars
