[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I don't bet money on sports...only crypto

[12-Jul-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> still a bet

[12-Jul-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> True...but an educated bet

[12-Jul-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Betting is gambling

[12-Jul-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> that usually works

[12-Jul-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> No good

[12-Jul-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> well that's true I'm against them but from time to time I do a few. a few times per year

[12-Jul-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> since this world cup the last time I made a bet was last year or 2 years ago

[12-Jul-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I have lost most of the bets on sports

[12-Jul-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> But it's exciting and addicting

[12-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> if you start being addicted to them, leave them

[12-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Then I switched to crypto and I don't feel to go back to betting üòù

[12-Jul-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Once I went to the casino and made $500

[12-Jul-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Started with just $40

[12-Jul-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I felt like I can never lose

[12-Jul-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Then after a few days I again went to the same casino

[12-Jul-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> And lost 500 within 30 minutes

[12-Jul-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> a fried did something similar

[12-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> After that I never went to the casino with more than $100 in the pocket

[12-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> he started at around 20$ won about 1000$ then continued until he lost 500$ and another friend pulled him out of the place.

[12-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> he went home but the second day went back and lost all

[12-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Ha ha ha

[12-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> yeah that guy really had problems

[12-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I know some people who go to casinos regularly and hope to win big some day

[12-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> but from what I know he stopped now. and has a nice familly

[12-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> But they keep losing every time they go there

[12-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> yeah. they hope to win big but infact their losing almost everything

[12-Jul-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Yeah

[12-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> My visits have reduced to 3-4 times in a year onky

[12-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> With $50-$100 in the pocket

[12-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> So I don't lose much

[12-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> that's good to hear. if you could stop it it will be better. since you where addicted

[12-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Just visit for fun

[12-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Yeah kind of

[12-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Once I went 3-4 times in a week

[12-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> then be sure you don't get in that habbit again

[12-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Yeah

[12-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I know my limits

[12-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> that's great

[12-Jul-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Sometimes I just go with $10 and come out within 5-10 minutes after losing

[12-Jul-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> It's hard to do that though

[12-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> You just want to continue

[12-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
