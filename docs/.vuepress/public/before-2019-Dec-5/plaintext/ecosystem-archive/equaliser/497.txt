[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think guys that train at gymnastics should be very good at it

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> When is this bear market going to stop?

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Looks like it'll be going for a while more

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> @jellysmash or not....

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽 do you know anything about tarot cards?

[04-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> That guy

[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> What about those

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> What do u wanna know

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've started using them to get an idea how the market will go.

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Lol   @jellysmash

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 😂

[04-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Why not

[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Tarot are for 1 pers

[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 😇

[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Not a situation

[04-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> According to the tarot I've done, it doesn't look like the market is going to pick up for a while

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I thought I'd try to adapt them to market readings

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Hmmm... for situation u should try astrology

[04-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> And astrograma 😂 😇

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Haha...if it helps then why not

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 🤔 😀

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Tarot, coffe .... are for 1 person ... and never try to use it for u... will never work 😇

[04-Nov-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> That's a rule

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Have you done anything with the tarot before?

[04-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> I know stuff... let say i read enough 😇

[04-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> My mom used to do readings for me and at markets...before she passed away.

[04-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> She was good

[04-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I thought I'd try them

[04-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But she always used to say that you can't do them for yourself properly

[04-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Like you've said

[04-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Your mom should tell u... that the taros will not answer if u wanna see for yourself..... and i'm sorry to hear that

[04-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Yeap she was right

[04-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I thought I'd try it for a while and see if I can get any consistency

[04-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That is if I can reliably gauge market sentiment

[04-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Only time will tell

[04-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Hehe.... u cannot 😁 at last for yourself

[04-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I tried doing a reading for someone at work a while back....the girl is obese.....the card reading actually said that she over eats to comfort herself...I felt so embarrassed doing that reading and saying that stuff..

[04-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lol

[04-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Well that's a medical true 😁

[04-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, it was freaky true

[04-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> U did a good thing... a doctor will say the same

[04-Nov-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> My mom did the markets for years but started worrying about doing them. People would actually take the reading for the truth and rush off and do stuff based on it..my mom didn't want the karma of that.

[04-Nov-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> hehe :)))

[04-Nov-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> How are people's experience with the raisex sign-up reward of 0.02 eth?

[04-Nov-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I did not get it, and I've seen a lot of other people complain about not getting any. And they blocked me from their twitter for speaking about it multiple times

[04-Nov-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> All they tell me is my account is to ''new''
