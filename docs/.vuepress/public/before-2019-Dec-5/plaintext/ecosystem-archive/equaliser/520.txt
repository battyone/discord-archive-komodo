[dscrdeql] <c2k> no one would know that
but if you go to dexstats you can see the size of the wallets

[24-Nov-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I haven't been around for a while, didn't realize the price was even 50 SATs. I bought a bag at 14 SATs and will be hodling it for a while! I loved rains and did get a nice little chunk from rain but totally understand needing to move people to the exchange.

[24-Nov-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> cooll. hold on to that steve

[24-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and if you can get on over to stex and grab some more before rewards announcement and build announcement im pretty sure you will be happy about your decision

[24-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @c2k oh I plan on it. I think this project is great and I'm looking forward to seeing the first build

[24-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üëç

[24-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Veensüö¨> Wheres the giveaway??

[24-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> what giveaway are you referring too?

[24-Nov-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I don't have enough yet to take advantage of the rewards. This market killed me so buying has been limited

[24-Nov-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> totally understood. yes the whole crypto market is feeling some pain

[24-Nov-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but with EQLI going from 20sats to 50sats recently while BTC and others have tumbled, anyone who has a large amount of my investment in eqli should be happy about not losing money!

[24-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Totally agree! Think it's my only investment not down

[24-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Plus side is that if anyone wants to buy extra btc to buy EQLI, this is a perfect chance with these low prices

[24-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Those orders on 100 sats is about half of the total amount of EQLI for sale

[24-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I'm going to have to see how much it would cost me to get to 100k EQLI so I can get rewards.

[24-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you have other coins that are staking, you can alway's sell some of those profits of to buy EQLI

[24-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the market moves around the 50sats to 80sats area a lot
if you try in there somewhere you may have some luck

[24-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sadly prices on all coins are currently down so at this moment it's not worth it to sell off some coins

[24-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I wish I could sell off some stuff but to far in the red to do it.

[24-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sometimes even small faucet amounts can be a nice addition to buy some

[24-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But if you're going to do all kind of faucets and free earning stuff, it will cost a lot of time I think

[24-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I won't be buying anything for myself this Christmas... the money I would of spent will go towards cryptos prob 50/50 kmd/eqli

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> cowboy is a gun üëå

[24-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye I‚Äôm up nearly 180% from my holdings s in EQLI s√≥ can‚Äôt complain really .

[24-Nov-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> love to hear that buddz. all of us who bought early feel thankful for that

[24-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed imagine when this thing goes ballistic it‚Äôs insane

[24-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> If you hold nearly 1 mil like me you will be extremely healthy

[24-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> So I encourage everyone to buy as much as you can while the price is less than 100 sats

[24-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Get a bag while it‚Äôs cheap

[24-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wonder if the people with the 100 sats orders will pull it up if buy orders are getting closer to it

[24-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Over 600k EQLI for under 0.7 btc is a bad price, even if those guy's were lucky enough to get it extremely cheap on exrates

[24-Nov-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It went for under 1 sat each right?

[24-Nov-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i htink those EQLI at 100sats will get bought very soon...as in within 2 weeks

[24-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once that is gone this will go up in 100sat increments fairly quickly

[24-Nov-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I'm getting worried about crypto

[24-Nov-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Not much action in last few months at all

[24-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @Smoky Satoshi its usual

[24-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, last week was a lot of action haha

[24-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I think everyone prefers some action up, unless you plan to buy more offcourse

[24-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> @javadth sounds like the stock market

[24-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> How about Arkansas

[24-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have land in Arkansas

[24-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Looking at some Missouri land as well

[24-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Tell me. Does it get really cold in the winter there? In Arkansas?

[24-Nov-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is hit or miss

[24-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Some years it‚Äôs cold af and shit weather , others it goes from fall to spring

[24-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I hear mixed reports lol

[24-Nov-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Anything new in eql land?

[24-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> The lowest I got was 15 sats if I had seen it at 1 sats I would have bought millions of them

[24-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Srsly I think for all of us that got in at less than 20 sats was a blessing

[24-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Good morning everyone

[24-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> What is it at now?

[24-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 47 sats last sell I think

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> What a lot of ppl don‚Äôt realize it there were a lot who bought at 4000 sats plus

[24-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Cool. .47 huh?

[24-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea and there are people that at least want to break even.

[24-Nov-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and we touched nearly 100 sats yesterday I reckon

[24-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exactly.

[24-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i think we will get some attention, but it may be a bit before we do.

[24-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> crypto market in general its like that

[24-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I can play the car game well these next few weeks then i will reload into BTC, after paying off my lease

[24-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> So I think we are holding up not badly take into consideration to what happen with exrates.

[24-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> then I am shifting full focus into this project.

[24-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> stex was def an upgrade to our whole scenario

[24-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wish I'd went that way to start with lol

[24-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I believe in you thats what really matters to us investors I think its faith believe and progress

[24-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and we have all of the above.

[24-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im just pouring concrete and working on cars until I can get everything set for the build.

[24-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need more forms is what I need.

[24-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> mistakes happen and we learn from them its what matters.

[24-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if I get it to where we can produce 80 blocks a day, then every week I can build a small home.
