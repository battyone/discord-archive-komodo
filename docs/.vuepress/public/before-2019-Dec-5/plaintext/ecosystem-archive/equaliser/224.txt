[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I had to do a breath test

[29-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they pull vehicles over and get the driver to breath into this device

[29-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> to work out your alcohol content

[29-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just to see if you've been drinking and are over the limit and driving

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, that's the rating 0.05%  alcohol in the blood

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they do a breath test first though

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> @✌Jellysmash✌ hi

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> if you fail that then they take a blood sample

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, it's pretty low

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> is way to low

[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> can only have about 2 to 3 drinks before going over that limit

[29-Jul-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so I had been drinking the night before but was ok the next day.

[29-Jul-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think they like to try to trap drivers who went out drinking the night before and are driving home early the next morning

[29-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> morning @MySoulisNotForSale

[29-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, I was fine

[29-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But just surprised to be pulled over at 11 am on a sunday

[29-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I had my son on the back of the motor scooter, they asked how old he was

[29-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> kids have to be at least 7 yold to double on the back of a motorbike

[29-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> luckily the son on the back is 10 yold

[29-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> my youngest wants to have a go as well, but he's only 6 yold

[29-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> he's hanging out for his birthday so he can finally get a go on the back

[29-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> well 😃  good u respect the law 😄 in all his way 😄

[29-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, I remember when I was much younger though, we'd go out drinking and park in the back streets and then drive home going around all the smaller back roads to get home.

[29-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the police were always only on the larger main rods

[29-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> got away with it, but I probably wouldn't do it now

[29-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ....well not regularly
