[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> For 1 eql @Jonathan

[02-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> It will pick up with time  @Cryptoon

[02-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> 0.000000015

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> @ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„ I'm not worried, bougt some eql last week

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> Most exchanges are dumps

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> just copy and pasted that @Cryptoon

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> looooooooooong term bag

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> Buy and hodl

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> Yeah that's it

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> amen @ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> how long ?

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> why the fuck would you even think of selling at anything below 1000x this price

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> at least a year?

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> given I don't rain everything away out of boredom tho lol

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> makes no sense why some one sold so low

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I think someone sold like a huge stash because of a misclick or whatever

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> yeah, completely irrational

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> and now people are just buying these and selling them at 2x

[02-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> more like trading not really 'investing'

[02-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> To make a quick flip

[02-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no idea

[02-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Once these cheap eql are off the market to hodlers price will stabilize

[02-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> To 1000 sats or whatever

[02-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> we need more hodlers

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> And also people have to stop selling cheap

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> As I said, I have some shitcoins which I am waiting to moon

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So once these go 2-3x

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> refill = deposit?

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I'm selling and buying more long term holds

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> yes

[02-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> @Llama

[02-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> I was following this project and people were selling cheap and the team most people withdraw coin from exchanges and they manage to get the coin to a $1 after

[02-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„> ðŸ˜€ ðŸ‘Œ

[02-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> @Catalyst what price are you anticipating a home being?

[02-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I heard around 80k

[02-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> well 10K-20K USD will buy you a nice flat in the city, for a home you will need land+housing+all legal stuff so yeah around 80Kto 90K one can get a 120 yards house

[02-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> but a decent land will cost you more like 100K

[02-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> in the village for 80K one can have a nice 1000 Yards house ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> are there renderings of the homes...different sizes, interior and exterior, etc

[02-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> land in the village is cheap as mostly agricultural

[02-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> not yet @c2k

[02-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> will need about 700k AUD for a house here lol

[02-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok tx. would be great to see at some point

[02-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yes depends on how you want. for instance when my father bought this plot it cost him mere 1K uSD now buying a plot here where we live just the plot costs 60-80K

[02-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 700K woah that's a great fortune ðŸ˜„

[02-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> can't get anything here less then say 400k and that's nothing special in a crappier location

[02-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> @Catalyst where is that

[02-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Karachi Pakistan ^

[02-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> nice place on the see right

[02-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> wow 400K crappier noice ðŸ˜„

[02-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol very expensive here

[02-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yes, sea is really near like 5 miles from us

[02-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <yamakashy> sea sry yes

[02-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but apparently house prices dipped 1.6 percent in Melbourne so let it keep going lol

[02-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> aha nice dip and still 400K.. give.me.a.break ðŸ˜„

[02-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> that would be the cheapest you could get
