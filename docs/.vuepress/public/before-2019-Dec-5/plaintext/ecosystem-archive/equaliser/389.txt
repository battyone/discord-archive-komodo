[30-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Suffering*

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Honestly I need to get hodl or enough before price goes up even more

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sometimes you just need to lift the offer @ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Of enough*

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> a few sats shouldnt matter

[30-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> I agree

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If I were you I should use half of what you try to buy with to just buy it, and the other half you can putt a lower offer in

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would be a shame to miss out on a descent amount

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Mine is  sat at 0.00000055

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I've had to do that a few times then the next order goes quicker

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Thankx guys

[30-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so are you selling @ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> is that what you are tryin to do or you trying ot buy?

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Buying with eth

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Buying with eth

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> gotcha

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> ETH didn't go fast for me

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> had to swap back to BTC to buy

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Biomech-Founder  are you around?

[30-Aug-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> or @Cypher - Founder

[30-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> OK.  I will have to eth swap to btc then

[30-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have an idea, I didnt really wanna do this anymore but I think it will help everyone.

[30-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I will post it in announcements I guess.

[30-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Ok

[30-Aug-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here due to the insane withdraw fees that exrates is charging all of you, we have a solution that helps us all get to where we want to be. We will open up OTC sales for a short time in order to get funds to list elsewhere. If you are interested please message myself, @Cypher - Founder - Founder , @Biomech-Founder-Founder  or @AndronicusBass-Founder-Founder  and let us know: amount of btc you want to spend along with your EQL wallet address and we will take care of it promptly. I have a few other exchanges interested in us but we will need to raise funds. Thank you all for your continued support of Equaliser!

[30-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thanks @CowboyCrypto- Founder , that may also incentivise people who dont want to deal with an exchange that doestn seem to be so great overall, and takes so long to withdraw

[30-Aug-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, my English is too bad for this to completely translate it, can someone explain me how it works?

[30-Aug-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> Hi, why are so few people of the ones that got 1000 EQLI sharing parts of it?
Can anyone tell?

[30-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Never mind I think I understand it ðŸ˜ƒ

[30-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Bo  what do you mean?

[30-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> Some people got rewarded 1000 EQLI, but only a few share some of it

[30-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe some peoople are using the rewards to accumulate more

[30-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah people dont have to rain if they dont want too some people just sponge ðŸ˜®

[30-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I think, if you got rewarded so much, you can share some. For community building and helping the project and show gratefulness.
I know they don't have to... I just don't understand that attitude

[30-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ya, everyone diff i guess. many of us share a lot of eqli with rains but what can you do

[30-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> not much, that's true. I just don't understand it

[30-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right. well here are the biggest eqli rainers for all to see...

[30-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oops...in off topic i guess

[30-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> ah

[30-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @Bo Do you mean the amount @BeethovenAndMozart gave?

[30-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> yes

[30-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wasn't that a random gift?

[30-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Can't force people to share offcourse, like @Combat Wom-mod said, some people only take

[30-Aug-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I don't know. Maybe. Anyway, I think: if you got that amount , you can share in the rain.
I know you can't force people, but, I think it would only be smart to share.

[30-Aug-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> To build the community, let everyone have some EQLI

[30-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> And let the appreciation of the project and coin rise

[30-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm saving up rain for when we get a lot new people in

[30-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I've rained enough for now on our current members

[30-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I agree with you

[30-Aug-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> 797 ðŸ˜®

[30-Aug-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> ðŸ˜±

[30-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ðŸ¤”

[30-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And then suddenly 3 less again right?ðŸ˜‚

[30-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[30-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> if that happens ðŸ˜¦

[30-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> well i got one of them so i know that one is staying lol

[30-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I hope we get more members, but I fear I can only get members in that are mainly interested in the rain in stead of the project. So I let the invitation.
I invited a few to Chainzilla, but they were active for a few minutes or hours, so that isn't helpful

[30-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, the rain only people might read something about it if they usually chat

[30-Aug-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some of us even joined here for the rains at first.

[30-Aug-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> In some channels I just stay for a rain because I don't even know the coin or it's a bad one that I can sell to buy something else, eventually

[30-Aug-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But you have people that just are in all channels for the rains, and you've got people that come for the rains, but do research on coins too, and chat a lot.

[30-Aug-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So I think every person that joins can be a potential investor

[30-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Myke500> And in some cases the rain is not enough to transfer or sell without buying more, so that helps with trade volume too

[30-Aug-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> I think rains help to make people interested in a coin and learn more about it

[30-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, but I know and see some people I know they are not interested in it at all

[30-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> Indeed, I joined for the rain at first, because i heard of it and got interested

[30-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> too bad @SwimedDragon

[30-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I think the rain is doing a good job, but maybe it's also that current value making people leave too.

[30-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But who knows if people get back in once we get more value

[30-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think once the founders start to put out some press releases, photos, etc...really get the project in gear, people will show up in big numbers

[30-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats why those of us who showed up early and learned about the project, and also bot a bunch of eqli at these silly prices, will be sitting pretty in 3-6 months

[30-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> much sooner than that.

[30-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe I can buy my son a lego train for christmass haha ðŸ˜„

[30-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Bo> haha

[30-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <c2k> 5 is a good age to start improving those fine motor skills

[30-Aug-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
