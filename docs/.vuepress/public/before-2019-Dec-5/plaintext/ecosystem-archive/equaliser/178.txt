[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> ☕

[25-Jul-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Jonathan everyone knows the triforce is protected by the Royal Family

[25-Jul-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Believe it or not we almost chose the triforce as our logo

[25-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I had an idea to make the windows on our home triangular with smart tint glass

[25-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So when the sun shines in it makes a triforce on the floor

[25-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yes but Zelda keeps losing it, since the logo is so similar I think it's in better hands here 😃

[25-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 😂😂😂

[25-Jul-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s dangerous to go alone!

[25-Jul-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> 😆

[25-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> What's smart tint glass? @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[25-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its the class that reacts to electricity I think?

[25-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Because it’s awesome

[25-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and you can change the color and darkness with your phone lol

[25-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s cool shit

[25-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I found it one day searching for auto tint glass

[25-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> big price difference I'd assume?

[25-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[25-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It wasn’t cheap

[25-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> still awesome lol

[25-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have an entire discord server with links to stuff and ideas I want to include

[25-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> for building?

[25-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think cheaper auto tint glass degrades when exposed to outdoors

[25-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Auto tint is also new to me, man I'm a noob in this area lol

[25-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
