[24-Jul-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> great community tho. and the projects coming out of there (EQL , etc) are very interesting

[24-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yep, love em all especially this one though for the cause

[24-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes. for a project to have an altruistic bias makes it worth more than many others in my book
