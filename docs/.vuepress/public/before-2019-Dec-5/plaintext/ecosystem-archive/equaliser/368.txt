[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @✌Jellysmash✌  i hope our EQLI team also look into what Pakistan new govt is planning about building 5 million homes in 5 years..

[24-Aug-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We've seen evidence of a lot of inequality in the world which is why we came together to start equaliser. We are constantly looking 😃 There are many in developing countries without access to bank accounts that the elite are pushing however, I think cryptocurrency is the best particularly those that cant afford mobile phones that are struggling even to provide the basic human necessities. Paper wallets will be greatly suited in that respect 👍  💕

[24-Aug-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> This new govt is really working for a social welfare society am not pushing politics in here by any chance but i am just saying they have a plan and we should try 😄

[24-Aug-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
