[19-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 😰

[19-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are they doing anything illigal?

[19-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if they dont have the coins to cover these sales then yet they are

[19-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> oooo @CowboyCrypto- Founder   that's a lot 😃  mine are stil in my wallet 😄

[19-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there simple math to do to see if they have enough to cover it?

[19-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> nothing simple about that.

[19-Jul-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will take hours to figure it up and correlate with the wallets

[19-Jul-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it is what it is, as long as I can withdraw all of these coins to my wallet then Im good.

[19-Jul-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> seems not handy

[19-Jul-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> i never understand why anyone would want to sell that cheaply though

[19-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good night @x2maano

[19-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> good night  @x2maano! sleep well!

[19-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think you should investigate asap to see what comes out. If this exchange is a scam, you need to clear away from it as fast as possible.

[19-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Can't you check out how much money there is on the exchange wallet?

[19-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Try to make a small deposit on there

[19-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And check how much EQL that wallet is holding?

[19-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @x2maano good night

[19-Jul-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CowboyCrypto half a million. Wow

[19-Jul-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> You'll be celebrating in a couple of months when it goes 10x

[19-Jul-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im not even trippin but its just crazy to me that people would sell that cheap.

[19-Jul-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That is 0.005$

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im about to check  it

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> all otu

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> out

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've been busy all morning and was on this at like 4 am

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 2500$ for 500.000 coins, right?

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And most of them are people that bought it for like 50 cents each?

[19-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ish

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the highest we got due to complications was 28 cents I think

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> epic deal

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🇦🇺 millsy🐘💨💸> Dumpers will dump but they will run out soon enough, and then the price can come back to something reasonable

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but the cheapest that anyone got in they are taking a massive and I MEAN MASSIVE loss

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But that dump is just taking 95% or so loss?

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[19-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🇦🇺 millsy🐘💨💸> Where can i buy cheap?

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 0.005 usd each jeez

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> fat finger misclick maybe? 😄

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> go put buy orders in at like 11 sats lol

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Exchange...just listed

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🇦🇺 millsy🐘💨💸> Which exchange?

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> remember they use 9 points to the right of the decimal

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Maybe they mean 1100 sats or so

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> instead of 11 sats

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 110 sats.

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Exrates...check out #announcements📢

[19-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> is what it would read if you didnt count

[19-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's also strange that these sell orders don't go lower

[19-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> you made one hell of a deal

[19-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Instant 20x 😄

[19-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, sell is on 100 sats and buy on 10 sats if I see correct, right?

[19-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Did you try to withdraw some of it?

[19-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> mine didn't work earlier

[19-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> hmmmm

[19-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hahaha

[19-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> wait and see.

[19-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we had anticipated a dump of sorts, every coin with a presale has it.

[19-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but there is nothing that makes any sense at all about this one lol

[19-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> this kinda stuff happens on graviex all the time cuz of the extra 9th decimal place

[19-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> and yobit. dont ever go use yobit, its a scam exchange

[19-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> haha yeah

[19-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> yobit sucks

[19-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> craptopia is a scam too, making coins pay a ridiculous amount to get listed, then if you do a chain swap or coin swap whatever, you get delisted and have to pay to list the new coin same as a brand new coin starting there

[19-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> So what is the new exchange
