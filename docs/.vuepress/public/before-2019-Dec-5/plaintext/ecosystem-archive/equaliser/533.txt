[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice. Always nice to lift to a beat. What music do you lift to?

[07-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> The thing is, most of those people are in a lot of rain discords so they don't even bother to look what they are missing

[07-Dec-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass varies a lot

[07-Dec-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> True. And people don't check Twitter. I was thinking of making a channel with updates but we have too many channels. Maybe we just direct people to check out Twitter and link them to it, then to feel free to ask if they have any questions. People seem to forget we are a different coin project to most, and building is what gives us more strength and given the setbacks earlier this year, we are still working our asses off and not even paying ourselves, in fact we are working to put in to equaliser. Most people are only speculative in crypto which is natural however many also don't understand the projects or the tech they hold.

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Last week I've been listening to 1980s music...tears for fears...rule the world

[07-Dec-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass true that

[07-Dec-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But investors are predominantly crypto investors, and they have expectations such as exchanges, coin market cap, master node rewards,  etc....that's where the initial money will come from, so gotta play the game.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Rome wasn't built in a day and projects take a little time to build momentum, it's a marathon not a sprint. Scammy shit coins are sprints with fancy marketing and anonymous teams.

[07-Dec-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Lol

[07-Dec-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha..Yea

[07-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Current potential investors are mostly crypto, when crypto markets turns to bull market then it's gonna be crazy

[07-Dec-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just gotta keep chugging along till then

[07-Dec-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Keep our exchanges going with min volume to keep the listing

[07-Dec-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If I were to go back, I would have recommended we list on small exchanges and build up from that, problem with listing on well known exchanges is volume has to be kept up or risk delisting. If so, we will just list on smaller exchanges and keep building up in the market

[07-Dec-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's very important. Without exchanges you'd be lucky to get even 10% of potential investors

[07-Dec-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass what's the min volume required for stex?   Can we simply buy and sell to ourselves to keep volume up?

[07-Dec-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm not sure, cowboy knows all that stuff. I've never been a trader, I belive in blockchain tech and HODL for long, I am grateful have extreme patience, think I learned it with computers in the 486 and Pentium 1 days as a kid lol

[07-Dec-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I could sit and stare at a loading screen the entire time, maybe a placid soul has a bit to do with it üòÅ

[07-Dec-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe we should create a second stex account now and buy and sell to ourselves then to create some volume...depending on what fees are charged

[08-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i was talking to cowboy about that. havent tried it yet but he said you dont need 2 accounts...it can be done with just one

[08-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> all good now. seems Discord is having ongoing issues today.

[08-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> either way @c2k  we need to do something

[08-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[08-Dec-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i agree @‚úåJellysmash‚úå but i dont have any btc there

[08-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> will see if i can get from somewhere else and do some trading also

[08-Dec-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You can sell and buy your own orders

[08-Dec-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just have no time

[08-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so that's 1000 EQLI ?

[08-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think we should be able to do that

[08-Dec-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @c2k  I moved some BTC there this morning...about $20...enough to buy and sell to myself

[08-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No 1000 usd worth

[08-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> slow day today

[09-Dec-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hot today, putting up Christmas lights for a friend. Cryptoland is quiet indeed, eye of the storm before we all lifted up to the moon üòÅ

[09-Dec-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Let it stay quiet. Lol

[09-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We need to accumulate as much as we can

[09-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Can get alot done when it's quiet, easier to concentrate

[09-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once we have accumulated then it can moon üòÇüòÇ

[09-Dec-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Kmd to 50 would be nice

[09-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, that's a good idea, maybe it's good that cryptoland is quiet. Can get on with the job of building without 'crypto' issues or demands from crypto people.

[09-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm making a slow cooked roast pork shoulder...been cooking for 3.5 hours so far.  another 2 hours to go.

[09-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I made one last week but it wasn't pull-apart. So I'm hoping this one will work better than the one I made last weekend.

[09-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yum. I plan to try and smoke and flame a pork roast one day. Think I'm having Thai for dinner.
