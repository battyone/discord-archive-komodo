[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> For me it's been dead

[11-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the EQLI price is fluctuating....never boring

[11-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> look at that if you're bored...or buy that if you're bored

[11-Aug-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wonder what the bounty's will do with the price

[11-Aug-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Especially if everyone who joins knows what the sale prices were and what's it's now on exrates

[11-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> None of the bounties will be paid out until the end of the campaign

[11-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> which is October 10th.

[11-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> oh

[11-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @SwimedDragon I see that price drop since dICO as a great buying opportunity to get in cheap whilst I still can

[11-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But maybe I'm not typical,

[11-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> how many satoshi is eql now

[11-Aug-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Although I have seen other coins with that sort of drop and not bothered because it looks bad

[11-Aug-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> About 12 satoshis

[11-Aug-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But last week hit close to 50

[11-Aug-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> damn, it's still less than what i bought for

[11-Aug-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> So I feel that I'm buying a coin worth at least 50 (because it'll be back there soon enough) for 12.

[11-Aug-18 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I bought some last week for 46.....and I bought some for 4

[11-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and if there is no intention of selling near term these small fluctuations dont really matter

[11-Aug-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> obviously small in absolute terms...and not percentage terms

[11-Aug-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but still

[11-Aug-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> here

[11-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> have you guys checked out #announcements📢 yet our new bounty program is up for reading it kicks off on wednesday 😉

[11-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> omg

[11-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> my friend just got me the best shit for bday

[11-Aug-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @Llama-Admin I was not talking about the payout of the rewards, but the amount of new people that we will be getting in. That will make the price rise for sure

[11-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just a matter of time 😁

[11-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Things will grow here soon

[11-Aug-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I'm glad most of us at least had/have the chance to buy very cheap from the foolish dumper. I hope others get that chance too, it's still very cheap 😄

[11-Aug-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think of this as an opportunity for those wise enough to see our vision is going to happen regardless

[11-Aug-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> 42 rt to go to start rain party 😜

[11-Aug-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> this is the beginning of a long, successful journey. thats how i view it. and we should all do the most we can to help the project along the way

[11-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> someone say rain party? activate umbrella!

[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> nice

[12-Aug-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 💯  💯  💯  wow, decent response actually. despite the low price and how new the project is, the retweet response from @cz gives you founders an opportunity to pitch the project and get listed. at the VERY least it would give EQL a ton of  exposure.  💯  💯  💯

[12-Aug-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I think we still need to prove ourselves before binance

[12-Aug-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm trying to un derstand what that retweet from binance means?

[12-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I presume they aren't talking specifically about Equaliser but that they won't list a coin regardless of how much they're offered if they don't think it's a worthy enough project...because they have such high moral standards?  is that what they're saying?

[12-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I created a linked in presentation and messaged him to review several weeks ago. Short, sharp and shiny with key details.

[12-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They are saying that they want to list coins with substance

[12-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I talk to cz every once in a while on LinkedIn

[12-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Llama-Admin you are correct

[12-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I think we either need the marketplace up or a house built before then

[12-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Or some combination of the above.

[12-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> yeah

[12-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But utilizing the attention they have regarding the tweets by Franco (had me rolling) and redirecting towards our project is just a simple billboard posting in simple terms

[12-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I missed it. Chris Franko?

[12-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If one person comes to this community because of that rt then it was successful and free😂

[12-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> true indeed...smart thinking

[12-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> i liek it cowboy

[12-Aug-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah Kevin

[12-Aug-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Huh. He is, or was, a friend. What'd he do to set off binance?

[12-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Might have to try to talk to him 😄 Since he got successful, he hasn't had a lot of time for his old homies 😛

[12-Aug-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im sure you guys can formulate a plan to approach cz in the right way. whether its after some build or other pertinent development, whatever is needed to increses the probability that EQL gets listed.

[12-Aug-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and if takes 6 months to get there by taking the correct approach then it will reap many rewards

[12-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I actually have a great deal of respect for CZ. We will approach him carefully and respectfully, when the time comes.

[12-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ve talked with cz about a lot of things, he honestly doesn’t deal in listings much anymore. He is pretty much an ambassador these days who gets paid fat

[12-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have the contacts for that when the time comes.

[12-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 👍

[12-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Scarecrow is wise beyond his years. how old are scarecrows anyway??? :tipsy:

[12-Aug-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gn all. enjoy the rest of the wknd

[12-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> You too @c2k

[12-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> you'd think binance would want a quality coin like Equaliser because it's about helping people.  they could get good PR just be supporting such a worthy cause.

[12-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Multiple angles to sell this from. Just working on getting everything in place before we move on it

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Morning fellows

[12-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Howdy.

[12-Aug-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> morning @Buddz1993

[12-Aug-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> problem is that land can be expensive in Australia.  I guess there are some cheaper areas though

[12-Aug-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> good morning!

[12-Aug-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> For the time being in suburbia however, there is loads of cheap land everywhere across the world 👌

[12-Aug-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Also there will be some municipalities that will have stringent design guidelines for structures and houses however, with more people having to move to regional areas that are expanding in population and investment development, these are factors considered. In Australia in the regional areas especially South Australia, the summer heat is harsher and thus our home designs are perfect for those conditions as well as the other end of the spectrum of climates prone to house destroying winds and weather .

[12-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> hello people

[12-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
