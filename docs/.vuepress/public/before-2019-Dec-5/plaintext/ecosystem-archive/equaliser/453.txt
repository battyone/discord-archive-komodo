[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Anyone watch Game of thrones? The snowball is coming for EQLI

[20-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that wont effect us until we are certified for housing and urban development.

[20-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> cant get that stamp of approval until we have a house to test lol

[20-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gotcha. wasnt sure

[20-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> is that a certification EQLI is eventually going to apply for?

[20-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> needless to say @CowboyCrypto- Founder  grant money to build would be amazing!

[20-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @bmully82 are you around? check this out if you are. You guys could prob get some of that action

[20-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @bermudeztejero  could you look and see what we would need to qualify as builders for this grant?

[dscrdeql] <miles> Yeah, but by actually selling cars??

[20-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> People not really owning cars, just being trapped in debt cycles to lease new cars all the time

[20-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> The same issue with debt that hit during gfc has just been passed from credit cards to car lease contract for most people

[20-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> You selling used cars?

[20-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[20-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its a lot of hours and work, but sometimes it pays the bills

[20-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Fingers crossed for a good week then and some more buy wall üòÄ

[20-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Lots of hours and work doesn‚Äôt sound good for sometimes paying the bills

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Just kind of curious. Have you guys considered distributing the profits from home sales to the holders of equaliser to establish another purpose for the coin? A structure similar to how the BarterDex fees are distributed?
