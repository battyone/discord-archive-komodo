[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> raisex holding funds in liu of KYC verification

[29-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> To request a withdrawal, it must be verified.
Do the KYC procedure with a passport or idendity card, proof address or
bank statment, and selfie with passport.
Without the approved verification it is not possible to request the withdrawal.
This procedure is to eliminate fraud, multi accounts and the truthfulness
of our users
The verification is controlled by another company and not by raisers. To check if all documents are authentic.

Users will not be accepted.

Example:

***Documents and selfies by Moms / grandmothers / and not real users.  (My grandmother does not do crypto trading)

Our system checks the authenticity of users also via the mobile number.

***Do not send proofs of address that are not in your name.

***Do not open tickets for KYC approval, they will not be considered.

[29-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They still haven't payed up the sign up reward I would be getting for signing up

[29-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> When I asked them about it multiple times, they just blocked me

[29-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I dislike them more than exrates

[29-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hi guys

[30-Jan-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hey. Damn bank locked my account completely, have to go into a branch to show ID. Bit suss

[30-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Albeit, I lost my wallet last week and cancelled my card, got a new one and ported my number to a new telco this week so maybe it's for the best. Ironic though it's for anti fraud purposes when the royal commission determined the banks engage in fraud themselves.

[30-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day all

[30-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass it's a hassle to lose wallet or mobile

[30-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I was using coinspot yesterday and did a withdrawal and got an email to double check it was me withdrawing. It's annoying but good to see exchanges being more vigilant since the cryptopia hack.
