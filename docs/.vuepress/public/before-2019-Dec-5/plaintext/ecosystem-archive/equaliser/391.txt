[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Fake bacon is not bacon

[31-Aug-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> true

[31-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nothing tastes like bacon other than bacon.....sorry vegetarians

[31-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> One time I made a meatloaf and wrapped it in bacon

[31-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <jester21> when will EQLI be listed on CMC?

[31-Aug-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian üëΩ> Morning ‚òï

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï

[31-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Guys I just tried to register Equaliser in CMC, but to get listed the coin must be traded on 2 exchanges that they have in their list of exchanges...Exrates is in their list luckily

[31-Aug-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ahhhhh...Just saw that BarterDex is listed in there...so EQLI satisfies that criteria

[31-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> They said they will look at us in the near future but in the mean time we will continue to grow and when we are building we will attract a lot of attention which will move volume

[31-Aug-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Shall I continue with my registration?

[31-Aug-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Couldnt hurt üòÉ more interest shown they may look at us sooner

[31-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ok..one of the questions is how many coins do the founders have for Equaliser purposes? I thought it was around 150 million but couldn't find that written down anywhere

[31-Aug-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> in the white paper

[31-Aug-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We may just have to wait for them to look into us later down the track

[31-Aug-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> whats the volume requirements for cmc?

[31-Aug-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Is EQLI mineable or it's all pre mined isn't it?

[31-Aug-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Mineable for transaction fees, currently you can setup a node

[31-Aug-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If I have to give a yes/no for  mineable what's the answer?

[31-Aug-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm guessing no

[31-Aug-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ?

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ok, I've finished with the request and submitted it...I put your email on it  @AndronicusBass as the contact person

[31-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They said they'd take 7 days to get around to look at it

[31-Aug-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah they get bombarded. We are on coinlib.io

[31-Aug-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
