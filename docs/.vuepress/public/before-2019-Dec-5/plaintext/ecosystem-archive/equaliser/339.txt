[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @Biomech😂 😂

[18-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Weed grows anywhere, should be good there 😄

[18-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We can even get aliens to live in EQLI's domes 👽

[18-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We need a dome emote instead of the regular house ones

[18-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> 🏠

[18-Aug-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> interstellar commerce via EQLI! I like it 😄

[18-Aug-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> i would like a house in australia 😃

[18-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> AndroniusBass is the go to guy for that side of our project 😄 Obviously, our first target has to come to fruition before we expand, but Austrailia is high on our list.

[18-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol so we will live in igloos?

[18-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nah. Igloos are made of ice 😄

[18-Aug-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But they are an extremely strong and time tested structure..

[18-Aug-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol true

[18-Aug-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> we could have a substitiue ice

[18-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well, when we start building on Mars, ice will be abundant and a good building material both for structural soundness and pressurization 😄

[18-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> 😄 :EQLI:

[18-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol great

[18-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> ice igloos on mars

[18-Aug-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> freeze to comfort

[18-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> exactly 😄

[18-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> What's funny about it, is it's true. A structure built of ice will tend to seal easily, as warm air within will partially melt the ice, causing it to refreeze as the heat dissipates, making a monolithic, self reinforcing structure. This sealing will allow internal pressurization, which allows for an atmosphere in which you don't need to wear protective gear or a pressure suit.

[18-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lmao!

[18-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Plus, the sealing allows you to control the atmosphere inside, making it breathable.

[18-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've never researched terraforming at all, you see 😇

[18-Aug-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> have you researched how they faked the moonlanding?

[18-Aug-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yes.

[18-Aug-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm unconvinced that the moon landing was faked. However, the videography was definitely edited heavily, and often clumsily.

[18-Aug-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what would it take to convinced you

[18-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Being born ten years later. I watched two moon missions.

[18-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> watched?

[18-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Apollo 13 was clearly visible to the naked eye on it's return. I didn't have a powerful enough telescope to watch it orbit the moon.

[18-Aug-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Apollo 17, I watched through a telescope on it's outbound trip. It was below the horizon for splash down. I don't see any reason they would travel there and not make the landing.

[18-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The physics behind it are straightforward, and the gravity such that a much less robust craft could have easily done it. The hard part is and was the first fifteen minutes of the flight, in which nearly ninety percent of the fuel is expended just escaping the earth's atmosphere.

[18-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Beanstalks need to be built before we can do proper expansion off earth. We have the technology, we need the will and funding. In that order, as without the will, there will be no funding. Since off world societies will be necessarily autonomous, governments have no interest in doing this. It has to be the common people, or it will not happen.

[18-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I consider this project a step in that direction.

[18-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> You know

[18-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> I really wish they had not lost the original moon landing tapes

[18-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> well, they lost all the telemetry data

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Whoever thought it was a good idea to tape over the 1st moon landing tapes was silly

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> believe that?

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ALL the telemetry data!

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That didn't happen. The military is quite good at keeping secrests.

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Hail Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They found something that scared them.

[18-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> the most "important" acheivment in human history and they lose the data

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> There could be something out there that they don't want us to know

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Like aliens you know

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder well, now that makes more sense as to why they would fake the footage

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Could be they found the first aliens on the dark side of the moon

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but remember, all those "astronauts" are freemasons

[18-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> so they won't tell the truth anyway

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> one day

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> lol @MySoulisNotForSale

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> you're really funny 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> you will have your own private spacecraft to go up there

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> and you can go verify everything yourself

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Adrian 👽 it's true

[18-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> An igloo would work nice on the moon

[18-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> if u say so 😃

[18-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> i don't buy it 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> and just theoretical... did u ask yourself... maybe is better then u don't know 😄

[18-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you don't buy they are freemasons?

[18-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> cuz' i know for sure ... isn't mandatory to be  😄

[18-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[18-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> there probably some elite class out there

[18-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> with some private army

[18-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> and secret society
