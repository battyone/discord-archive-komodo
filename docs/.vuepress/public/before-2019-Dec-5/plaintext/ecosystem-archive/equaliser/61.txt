[dscrdeql] <sisana10> Looks like I have alotof reading to do!

[09-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it's round so no flat surfaces for the hurricane to push over or lift

[09-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That house looks legit badass

[09-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We wont only just build domes like that, but also homes with curvature and different shapes and sizes which will not be susceptible to the high and low wind pressures that hook a traditional structure or building and tear it from its foundations

[09-Jul-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> a bit dirty...but badass

[09-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Actually, can you prefab make them and then just drive them out on a truck and deposit them on land?

[09-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> conrete would be too heavy for that

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I remember those Bessa Blocks

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I think it’s awesome

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> they're airated

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> and super light

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> maybe that material woudl be ideal

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'm not sure if that's how you spell bessa blocks

[09-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Prefab is an option we looked at but its better to build onsite given that areas can be remote and inaccessible to large trucks. Equipment is mobile and transportable in pickup trucks

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> bessa blocks are kinown as cinder blocks in australia, they are rectangular

[09-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> that house looks awesome

[09-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> my parents got a prefab cabin built up in the mountains in tasmania

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> got built in launceston and trucked south past hobart into the mountains. where it was assembled

[09-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> they look very retro 1970s....i always liked that type of design

[09-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> not sure why there aren't more of them around

[09-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Roads in puerto rico arent like mountain roads in tassie 😃

[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> 👌

[09-Jul-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> amazing..anyone getting one of those will be very lucky

[09-Jul-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Absolutely

[09-Jul-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> housing is provided for a lot of aboriginal communities in Australia

[09-Jul-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> they get trashed a lot though

[09-Jul-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> the homes in the picutres look more sturdy and less likely to be wrecked too easily

[09-Jul-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @jellysmash i was thinking of aboriginal communities in Australia. Some of the housing is poor quality

[09-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> nice dwellings

[09-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> people need that type of house

[09-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> i'd love to live out in the bush

[09-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> monolithic and geodesic structures

[09-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> yes, those aboriginal communities really need good housing

[09-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> and they can be heat insulated as well i imagine

[09-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I don’t see why botn

[09-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Not

[09-Jul-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> They keep constant temperature which is why they are energy efficient

[09-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i would live in one of those 😄

[09-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> aircrete is light, and the monolithic design is structurally superior

[09-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i used to work for a company that made mining equipment they said in some of the aboriginal communities they had brand new homes but they trashed them

[09-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and chose to live in their cars

[09-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Often housing trust homes are cheap and nasty single brick veneer

[09-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> those domes look hard to trash though lol

[09-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Those cookie cutter homes in australia you see, Ive built them and i can tell you the quality is shit, more often than not only come with a 10 year warranty

[09-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah new homes aren't built very well.. within a few years the foundation starts shifting and you can't close doors properly

[09-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> but people are happy paying hundreds of thousands for them

[09-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i don't think people are happy paying that much

[09-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> exactly and cracks appear in dry wall before 10 years

[09-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> houses are ridiculously over priced

[09-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i pay 1400 a month to rent a house thats almost falling apart

[09-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> All too common

[09-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder i've seen cracks appear within a year

[09-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it's terrible

[09-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I love the concept of helping those less fortunate

[09-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Old building techniqes that were originally meant to be solid build designs have had so many corners cut to become designs of today

[09-Jul-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> There should be no reason wealthy people/celebrities don’t endorse this

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @donaldmathers selfishness mate can't change that

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> all we can do is be the change we want to see

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Yea but there’s plenty of people out there that are all for a good cause

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I see a lot of homes in the US and AUS that are build in wood

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and hopefully some time it will be "cool" to be selfless and more people jump on board

[09-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We have considered, however Big hype and marketing can sometimes have the opposite effect as it happens all too often that projects are hyped up and endorsed but end up being scams or no real benefiit to anyone

[09-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> While in europe we build with bricks and solid concrete

[09-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Not sure why that is

[09-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We think results will speak for themselves

[09-Jul-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> dont get me wrong, we are still working on marketing

[09-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah I agree bass... every project over hypes things probably better to be the sleeper project which actually makes moves without the hype

[09-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, I obviously like that you're planning to build cheap houses, but for which kind of people are these houses?

[09-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wouldn't it just be easy for rich people to buy EQLI and buy it instead of someone that has less money?

[09-Jul-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That’s what I mentioned lol celebrities endorsing this idea
