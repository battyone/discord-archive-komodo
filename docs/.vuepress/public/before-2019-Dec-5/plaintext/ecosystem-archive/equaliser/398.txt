[03-Sep-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Imagine getting 5 btc for every egli...not enough btc

[03-Sep-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> isnt the quote 14 / 16sats? or am i seeing something different than u guys?

[03-Sep-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol someone triggered an order at 5btc per eql

[03-Sep-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> WHAAAAA

[03-Sep-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont have any anywhere for sale...but wondering if ppl had offers at higher prices if they sold any

[03-Sep-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Not me

[03-Sep-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I don't see how a high sell order could be filled without filling all the lower orders first

[03-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Unless someone has found a hole in the system and is trying to manipulate the market

[03-Sep-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> wow

[03-Sep-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Sep-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Niiiiicce.

[03-Sep-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Sep-18 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 5btc per eqli...that would be a heck of a retirement! lol

[03-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hey @CowboyCrypto- Founder someone told me you rained a bunch today. guessing the testing was a success?

[03-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> so some good news from the Syrian front

[03-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I was just at home lol

[03-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> that rain was crazy at 12:30

[03-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> for me...

[03-Sep-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder suggestion . . it might be a good idea to think about building eql homes for people in Syria who lost everything ..

[03-Sep-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> the dollar goes a long way over there
