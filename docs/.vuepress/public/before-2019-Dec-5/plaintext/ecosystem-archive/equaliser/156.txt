[23-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i find it disgraceful something that can help people in pain is banned yet alcohol which kills more people then any drug is legal

[23-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @CombatWombat yhe im hoping for that also

[23-Jul-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> let her know its only temporary... but i think the problem is it can become an addiction so please be careful

[23-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @slipersty yes we should help each other but when I hear stories like yours its puts things into perspective.. we all have problems but I think in the Western World we complain about everything for no good reason
