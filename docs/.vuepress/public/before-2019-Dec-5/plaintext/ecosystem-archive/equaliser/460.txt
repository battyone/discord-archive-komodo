[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Where did the picture come from?

[22-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Are there any copyright issues using photos on Twitter?

[22-Sep-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've been getting all my photos from copyright free places

[22-Sep-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's probably ok, if  photos aren't being sold, just used on Twitter

[22-Sep-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And if they're Photoshopped then they wouldn't be recognisable as the original photo

[22-Sep-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I might create some ones as well...they're pretty funny

[dscrdeql] <ELHARAKA94> I wanted to buy EQL but i just need to know some informations and how it works,

- is  EQL available only  at exrates exchange? because am not signed up yet with them if there is any other exchange please suggest to me
- how the Agama wallet works? 
And what BarterDEX related to EQL?

[22-Sep-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ELHARAKA94> sorry just my internet went off for couple of seconds

[22-Sep-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exrates is the best place to get it. Agama has 2 types of wallets native or electrum. Electrum is fastest to get synced

[22-Sep-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs only place to get it. Currently
