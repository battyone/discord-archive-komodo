[18-Sep-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if only it was always that easy zach

[18-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> @Combat Wombat Alright thank you. It appears to be the wallet.

[18-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> It does seem that way but will wait until one of the team confirms that

[18-Sep-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m consolidating coins to redistribute

[18-Sep-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> My 2nd wall is falling..

[18-Sep-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @Zach it is but your walls did push those a few buy orders up got orders at 23 and 20 now

[18-Sep-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> they weren't there earlier

[18-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I'm hodling till I can get a house

[18-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> might be unrealistic lol

[18-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> with my amount

[18-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> The 20 is mine too.. haha but yeah got the 23

[18-Sep-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> depending on eqli prices i should have enough

[18-Sep-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @Zach lol ohhhh ok well yeah the 23 is good 😃

[18-Sep-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I will be glad I bought more when it shoots up to 1000 sats 🤞🏻

[18-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I bought in initially at 1-4 sats though haha

[18-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> same

[18-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> except for dICO

[18-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Should have bought more..

[18-Sep-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I really do think anything under 100 sats is a bargain

[18-Sep-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but yeah we all wish we bought more in single sats

[18-Sep-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Llama is an OG here 😃

[18-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I was actually just going around investing in every dICO and this project popped into view

[18-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I got all my friends to invest in the presale so I did too

[18-Sep-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I didn’t invest until it hit exrates

[18-Sep-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Yeah. I actually bought like 99% of my holdings once it hit exrates

[18-Sep-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> same here

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Well single digit sats compared to $0.33 makes sense haha

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I sent some btc over to buy about 10-20k

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lets just say i ended up getting much more then that

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> then bought a couple more times

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lots of bags for everyone...:troll: :troll: :troll:

[18-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> exrates being such a crap exchange has actually been a blessing in disguise for most of us lol

[18-Sep-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thanks exrates 😉

[18-Sep-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Agreed, that’s why I have stayed around on there

[18-Sep-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @Llama-Admin I forgot to tell you nice job on that article 👌

[18-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> 😂

[18-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> would be better to throw it on exrates and build up those buy walls 😄

[18-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> I am 5k short of a masternode - soooo close

[18-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> easy enuf miles. even if u need to pay up

[18-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i already have a bunch of masternodes but am willing to get more

[18-Sep-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Yep !! How do the master node payouts work? Can you claim interest as you go?

[18-Sep-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Or is it locked and all released at end of term

[18-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> well in the komodo ecosystem theyre called rewards. interest is not friendly term in islam (i think thats it?) so they call it rewards

[18-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there is a loose schedule cowboy was talking about but im not sure where it is. when its official im sure they will post or pin it

[18-Sep-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah we will get the official info soon i hope 😃 but yeah im preparing to lock some away

[18-Sep-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not sure how much though

[18-Sep-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Didn’t know that! I use KMD rewards all the time - just wondering how the implementation will work given its a locked contract duration

[18-Sep-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> But if you could claim reward during the term it would be cool as it would incentive people to lock more away knowing they would still have access to some coins if needed I guess

[18-Sep-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not going to even claim to understand how it will work lol but miles what you said does sound nice

[18-Sep-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> cowboy is the man to talk to

[18-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Is it considered insider trading to know that the profits from the house are going to go directly into the EQLI market price? Basically tells me how high the price is going to go

[18-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> here are some details from the last medium article if you didnt see already...

Equaliser Chapter 2: Our plans for the future – Evan Holford –...
In my previous writing I told you of our past up to current events, along with where we are at. In this piece I will give you a glimpse…

[18-Sep-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its not if I tell everyone at the same time

[18-Sep-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Zach insider trading as defined by the sec (who doesnt oversee crypto anyway) is having access to non-public info

[18-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there u go. beat me to it

[18-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> 👌

[18-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> hmm....

[18-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> crypto is going to change the world, but I assume you already know that.

[18-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> crypto is going to change the world we live in!

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Fair enough 👍🏻 yeah I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think crypto was the future

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we are just doing our small part to see that the little guy doesnt get shafted

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> mmhmm hm

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> cmon podmaster get those marbles out of your mouth ...

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 😂

[18-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I look forward to telling people how I made my millions with EQLI

[18-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I was talkin to the other Founders about that the other day Zach, I would be happy as hell if all of you make a fortune from getting here early.

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> i can't get those marbles out mrupphhh!!!

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> so when will we get to see the dome of arkansas? 😄

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my goals really are not monetary, I just want to build houses using alternative build methods to prove it can be done on a large scale and help put people in a house

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> just joking i know it not a dome

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah wont be a dome.

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> box of arkansas

[18-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am thinking about going out there this weekend and clearing it.

[18-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> then next weekend maybe renting a backhoe and leveling it all out.

[18-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> aircrete.... will you copyright the formulation and stuff?

[18-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
