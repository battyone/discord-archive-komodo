[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think you will need to relax and just enjoy the friendly community and positivity. you can understand that the entire cryptocurrency community around the world  is a little down from the entire bear market this year. Our project is having real world tangible products so this is something many are excited about.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, WTH.

[27-Jul-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> POS, probably not but we haven't ruled it out. All founders agree that we like, want, and need masternodes. Exact details are being ironed out, as KMD platform has new tech that make's 'em doable in a somewhat unique way. We'll know shortly, and y'all will know shortly after üòÑ

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> By entering this discord, the #rules are agreed to, so please adhere to them

[27-Jul-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We will always give the community a heads up regarding our plans WHEN THEY ARE SOLID, but not before. I learned that the hard way when I was part of the GameCredits team. Too much info, one little things goes wrong and you spend six weeks swatting FUD that could be used to fix the issue. So we will be pretty damn solid on any timelines we post.

[27-Jul-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what happened now

[27-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The flip side is, we seriously want the community's input. We take everything into consideration. Sometimes, we think something is a great idea, but doesn't fit. Others, not so much üòÑ But we wanna hear 'em all.

[27-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nothing happened, I'm just takin' a minute to clarify our position.

[dscrdeql] <ganjie> good morning

[27-Jul-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> If you look at the electra coin, the people who bought cheap and are making a killing from their MN' rewards keep driving the price of the coin down. . I remember buying eca over a year ago at 6-10 satoshi, and it's still the same price now üò¶

[27-Jul-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> them whales do lot's of damage

[27-Jul-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> In any case, all the Founder have been nothing but helpful and I really appreciate it üëç üëè üíØ :EQLI:

[27-Jul-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I heard about Electra coin but not sure what it's for. However what you must realise, buying Equaliser gives holders the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.
