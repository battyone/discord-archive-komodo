[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> @✌Jellysmash✌ @Cryptoon @SwimedDragon good evening

[04-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i think komodo has to work out how to do masternodes

[04-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's not 'built in' at the moment

[04-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> maybe someday

[04-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think there's a roadmap to put EQLI onto masternodes

[04-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> guys are working on it as we speak

[04-Sep-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and should be ready soon-ish

[04-Sep-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> or maybe something like that but different models

[04-Sep-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yes, masternode rewards

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hope the next one will be better 👌

[04-Sep-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> this one was super solid, but not what I wanted it to be

[04-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> So are the houses going to be built with bricks or 3D printed?

[04-Sep-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> they will vary @Zach

[04-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Gotcha, when I skimmed over the white paper I pictured more of a 3D printer spitting out concrete

[04-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We will offer various methods of building. Different applications for different circumstances 👌

[04-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> The first stage is pre fab walls though?

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 🔸Equaliser is a Blockchain based solution that aims to provide affordable, strong, energy efficient and beautiful homes and accommodation which will contain a title registry, proof of ownership and smart contract functionality. Storm shelters are also an option to be offered by Equaliser.

🔸Equaliser won't contribute to already inflated established property market prices and a fraction of profits are used for helping those in natural disasters and also subsidies for some that need assistance owning a home. 

🔸A build is commissioned with the purchase in EQLI, there is no competition between those with wealth and those that struggle to save for a deposit on a mortgage. Equaliser is  non-discriminative which is how we planned Equaliser to be, just that, an Equaliser to be able to buy a home to live.

🔸Equaliser provides access to a great store of value in real estate. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.

🔸Equaliser will build energy efficient homes such as monolithic and curved structures which are hurricane and wild fire resistant. 3D Printing, shotcrete airform and aircrete are some of the techniques that will be used for building. Geodesic domes are also another building technique to be utilised.

🔸Equaliser projects can benefit local economies by having a positive effect on tourism, local businesses, suppliers, jobs, communities and lives

[04-Sep-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 👌

[04-Sep-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 3d printing will come, there are multiple ways to build a home.

[04-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we mention a few of those methods in the whitepaper. Aircrete is honestly my newest obsession as we have few hurdles to jump with this proven material. I am currently testing out various recipes to get costs analyzed.

[04-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i like the pinned messaged @AndronicusBass-Founder @CowboyCrypto- Founder 👍 :vote_up:

[04-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 🙌 😊

[04-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If I stop replying, i'll have probably fallen asleep lol

[04-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> haha. then get some zzzzz's

[04-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> looks like price go up to 19 sats and then dumped back down to 13 sats

[04-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> thought it'd stay up at 19

[04-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> oh well, i'm sure it'll be back up there soon

[04-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> good evening!

[04-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It was to be expected 😦

[04-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But eventually there will come a moment or day that we keep it up 😃

[04-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its insane, these prices...

[04-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is this still the whale or are it random sells?

[04-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Last time I looked the buy orders weren't that much from 13-19 sats

[04-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I haven't sold anything so I'm confused - it isn't logical to me why anyone would sell 🤔

[04-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm still holding the same for over a month I think

[04-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But a new good exchange will probably do the job in keeping it up 😃 Also less chance for the whale to keep it down

[04-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Agreed @SwimedDragon - I have zero doubts in this project and team 😃

[04-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> it was only a small dump we don't have the volume to keep prices up it will come though

[04-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> another opportunity for people to get it below 20 sats once we hit new exchanges and get volume these prices wont be seen again

[04-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If I win the lottery I'll buy up until 100 sats 😄
