[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @CowboyCrypto I posted here yesterday or maybe the day before and didn't get an answer. My wife saw an interview with a company who was new and planning on building home using 3D printers ect and starting in Puerto Rico. She couldn't remember the company name, by chance was it EQLI?

[16-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> could have been us.

[16-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There is another company called New story who is doing something similar, but not blockchain based.

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, the roof park was not very nice. The childrens section was closed without any reason, so we had to do something else

[16-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But in the end, we had a good day, and there was a very large toy shop downstairs where my son played with lots of lego
