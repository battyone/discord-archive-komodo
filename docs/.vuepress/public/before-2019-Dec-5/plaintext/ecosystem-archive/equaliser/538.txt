[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My issue currently is time.

[14-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I understand

[14-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I cant do all of the admin work, pay the bills, pour the blocks, build the community and handle social media all at the same time. I also have a car dealership that I own. It takes a lot of work but I use my time wisely here and make the most of it when I can.

[14-Jan-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <peddycb> do you need donations ? if so, a kmd account could be created. where anyone can send something for your support if they want. i think that donating in kmd is better than buying elli or ...if there is any interest in it

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm on my second â˜•

[14-Jan-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Just got to work

[14-Jan-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> It's hard getting back into that routine

[14-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @peddycb #5889  it is a good idea, but I almost hate to ask as people here are already invested.  ya know?

[14-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> The traveling around was hard going, but good to see another country very different to Australia

[14-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You should come to the states sometimes jelly!

[14-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'd really like to knock this first house out fast and get going in puerto rico, but I am also working on a design for a resort.

[14-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @CowboyCrypto you can add a blurb at the bottom of your medium articles and Twitter account with a donation address. That's what most people do.

[14-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @CowboyCrypto omg...you're a work house

[14-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol you have no idea.

[14-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I took a day off this weekend and played starcraft half the day

[14-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it was great

[14-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> fix cars pour blocks and try to make sure things are running good on stex.

[14-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yea, I'd like to go top U.S. again. It's just very expensive traveling with the whole family and the Australian dollar in a steep decrease in value against the US dollar.

[14-Jan-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[14-Jan-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Puerto Rico would be a good trip for them!

[14-Jan-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> We traveled to U.S. about 4 years ago.

[14-Jan-19 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once i get this going you can pay for the flights and pay for your stay with EQLI.

[14-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yea, sounds like it'd be a different type of experience going to Puerto Rico

[14-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> man I have this crazy ass idea that will work if I can pull of funding for it. A full service, 5 star resort that doesnt accept dollars.

[14-Jan-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> With a convention center, Crypto Casino, Restaurant/Bar

[14-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but like i said i gotta get through this build and get everything rolling right first

[14-Jan-19 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <peddycb> let me know if you have a kmd donate account... i could donate 5% of my kmd interest to them every month... and others might do the same to help them.

[14-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ok let me talk to the guys about it

[14-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Dr Debt#0891
everyone 

We are still at it working on creating a better future for all in terms of housing. We need your help. We are accepting any donations of KMD from members of the community to assist us with things like server bills, construction materials etc as this has fallen on my shoulders. I would like thank @peddycb for suggesting it. IF you could donate to help further this project, it would be forever appreciated.

Our KMD address is RRYE4LvFP9HL94ew8RpMqpUQCQJ4utCvMD

Thank you all for your support in what we are doing. I am trying really hard to get this moving as fast as I can. Thank you once again.

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Magic box

[15-Jan-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's a "hot box" today in adelaide. only realised this morning the tour down under is on. I'm not into it but good tourism for South Aus. Fringe festival and Adelaide 500 soon, its crazy in the city from jan to march.

[15-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In all honesty is an inconvenience for many of us trying to work to make a living, bringing shelter from the rain. haha, barnsey should have made the lyrics more accustom to australian climate, hardly rains.

[15-Jan-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> looks like cryptopia got hacked

[15-Jan-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> a heap of eth

[15-Jan-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Best to keep funds in wallet and never on exchanges. I still think BarterDEX will be word of the year in the coming years. Evereryone will be sick of centralised exchanges which defeat the purpose of decentralisation. mark my word's

[15-Jan-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah better to keep funds in wallet but what about when setting buy/sell orders or trading.. makes it impossible to do that

[15-Jan-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and i still think we need a trusted centralised place

[15-Jan-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> especially if we want mass adoption

[15-Jan-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> majority of the population are not willing to be their own banks

[15-Jan-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hopefully BarterDEX becomes easy to use because at the moment I can't get it to work lol

[15-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but yeah i think barterDex will eventually become easy to use.. if not them some one else will make something.. a user friendly dex is def needed

[15-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lucky i only had a little bit of spare change on cryptopia

[15-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> still hoping for the best possible result but doesn't look too good at the moment

[15-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> got a few coins that are only really traded on there ðŸ˜¦

[15-Jan-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Only expose what you are willing to lose. Unfortunately I think there is much to learn for everybody and the media is winning the Psy-op battle to deter broader awareness of an alternative from the current system. It's a battle that's for sure. Sad markets don't mean a finished market. I havent had an antenna connection to my TV for several years.

[15-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I love computers and am sick and tired of wallets

[15-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I programme myself, I dont let TV programme me

[15-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> the average person who doesn't really like computer won't be willing to do what we do]

[15-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> which is why we need a centralised place

[15-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> we can hate banks all we want.. and yes they are crooks but they protect what we put in there

[15-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> a friend of mine was getting billed from uber for about 4 months lol he didn't know some one was using his bank account

[15-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but the bank paid him back

[15-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> because he could prove it wasn't him.. they were interstate transactions

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I saw a video months ago of CLI of decentralised binance. I havent looked into it yet and not sure if they have a gui yet.

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> uber eats some one was ordering food daily lol he didn't even realise for 4 months man i know if 20 dollars goes missing hahaha

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah i remember hearing about that

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i like binance

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> wish them all the success

[15-Jan-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think something like Binance could help spread mainstream adoption

[15-Jan-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and with the amounts they charge for a listing they better have good security haha

[15-Jan-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> which reminds me i got coins on binance

[15-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> icon, neo and vet ðŸ˜® never used any of the wallets

[15-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> looks like its time to learn lol

[15-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I was wondering why cryptopia had been in unscheduled maintenance for the last day or so...I assumed they must of got hacked but didn't know details.

[15-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hey jelly

[15-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah sucks huh

[15-Jan-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lets hope its not as bad as most of us are thinking but apparently a shit load of eth was withdrawn

[15-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I've only got a small amount on there. Btc sms some shitcoins. Still don't want to lose any of it.

[15-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I've been trying to log on last day sms haven't been able to

[15-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah it sucks as we are told to not to keep anything on exchanges but in reality thats not possible

[15-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I thought cryptopia had pretty good security now with 2FA

[15-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but yeah i guess only leave little bits for trading or buying on a dip or something

[15-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well we shouldn't jump to conclusions but apparently a shit load of eth was withdrawn the day before and the amounts people are saying are ridiculous

[15-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I hope coinspot doesn't get hacked...got some shitcoins there.

[15-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i dont know how the hackers work but would they need an account to hack it? or could they hack it without an account

[15-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> It's not really practical to have a wallet for event shitcoin

[15-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> unfortunitly usually i find it easier to store shit coins on wallets

[15-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i never have problems with shit coin wallets

[15-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[15-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> They'd need to hijack someone's account

[15-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well lets hope with their strict kyc they also got good security

[15-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i got a coinspot account but never used it

[15-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Get their session token and log in impersonating that person

[15-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> everytime i read about an exchange hack i get nervous

[15-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yea, same

[15-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but so far cryptopia has been the biggest exchange to cop it... well since i been here anyway

[15-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> cryptohub got done a while ago

[15-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> exrates crap lol

[15-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yea, exrates, that was bad

[15-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> was it coinsmarket?

[15-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I notice they have 2FA now on exrates

[15-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> that got hit hard can't remember if thats the right name though
