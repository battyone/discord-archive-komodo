[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> A few months ago I was getting multiple invites to discord servers from the same coins from different people, but that stopped eventually as the crypto/btc market didn't move much at all

[18-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But on your question @CowboyCrypto- Founder , yeah you're technically handing out coins for free on those rains, but haven't you done that so far? And offcourse you're staking it for people. But you are not the one buying them back from them, other people will be doing that (well I hope they would doüòÇ  )

[18-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But aren't you kinda doing the same thing on those masternode rewards?

[18-Nov-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> In the end, by how you look at it, we've staked our coins and got them for free aswell

[18-Nov-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It was just an idea and I think it is too much work, especially once the building starts, it would need someone else to look at those things if it would be even possible to do.

[18-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I guess

[18-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Masternode rewards give better price stability

[18-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sorry if it was a waste of time to read/discuss this, but I'm just trying to figure something out that could help getting more people in

[18-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I appreciate the thought

[18-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will just keep doing what we are doing, until it is time to crank it up to an 11.

[18-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once we have everything in place it will no longer matter.

[18-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
