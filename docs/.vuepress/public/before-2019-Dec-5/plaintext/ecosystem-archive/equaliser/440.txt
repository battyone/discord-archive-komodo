[18-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Dang.. pulling 1M EQLI out of exrates takes a fee of 5k EQLI

[18-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but only like a quarter way up the ladder

[18-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> wealthier*

[18-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Zach you should of seen the fees earlier

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> the fees you are paying now are reduced lol

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye the fees are crazy Im still waiting for them to open my account back

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Disgusting haha

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> with 100 usd on it.

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> crap

[18-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We can arrange OTC too if anyone wants. saves on the exchange fees.

[18-Sep-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And I want to spend those in eqli obv

[18-Sep-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> What rates do you sell OTC?

[18-Sep-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Cowboycrypto would best be able to answer that but I guess about the same as exrates

[18-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Zach there wouldnt be any "rates" just an exchange between buyer and seller at an agreed upon price

[18-Sep-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Zach> There seems to be a whole lot of back scratching going on in here.. haha

[18-Sep-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Nice!! ðŸ˜„

[18-Sep-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thanks people

[18-Sep-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> haha zach we are a team :EQLI:

[18-Sep-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> Hope some of the people who have held off buying are starting to believe in the project.
My thoughts on price have gone up exponentially this week.
The founders are making progress delivering what their vision is...
The dumper is apparently gone...
And the only people that could sell if they wanted are the devs or people in this room that have a direct interest in the price going much higher.
Given that, i personally have zero interest in selling any of my bags below 100sats...but thats just me.

[18-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> @c2k I hear you and completly aggree with you.Â´

[18-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah I agree

[18-Sep-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im just taking some profits above 100 sats and thats like 25 %

[18-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> because I really believe we can go much higher..

[18-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> me too

[18-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but im more like 10-15%

[18-Sep-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> about 10 percent for me as well

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> will lock up maybe 30 percent for MN

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> give or take

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think it would be great to get some of the people from the komodo discord into here. people who belive in the ecosystem may be willing to take a stake in EQLI also

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> would be a good idea for me to hold long term seeing as they might start building in Australia soon

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> could buy myself a house ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye Im aiming between 15-25 % have to decide when that day comes.

[18-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive invited a few but no luck yet

[18-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> c2k the people you invited will kick themselves soon

[18-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Offcourse there will be more EQLI on the market eventually if we lock up good amounts, but at start, all those amounts would be locked up and can't be sold

[18-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep thats the thing when I read the whitepaper I soon realized the potential in this

[18-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And probably more people want to buy at least 100k to lock in for rewards

[18-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So I think that will help the price go up too

[18-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[18-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep masternodes will give a great boost

[18-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Today may have to be a math day to see how much I will lock up and in which lengths

[18-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I think I'm going to do different amounts at different lengths

[18-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, if we get a bull run, I don't want to miss that out

[18-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> def not lol

[18-Sep-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We know it will eventually crash back down and we can rebuy lol

[18-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> in not so sure about that @SwimedDragon

[18-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if the next bull run brings more adoption there could be a chance we won't see a correction like we have seen for a bit

[18-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wouldnâ€™t bank on that

[18-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> at least not at these levels

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I dont also think we will crash back tho these levels
