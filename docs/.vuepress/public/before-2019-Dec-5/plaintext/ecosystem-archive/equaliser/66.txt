[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we will soon be needing alot of help from our community to spread the word. We have kind of let this be a quiet project up to this point because we have seen what over hyping can do to a project in terms of expectations and market reaction. We want to make sure that we have everything in place before we start making noise, and we are just about there. Our first listings will be very nice exchanges with very solid volume. Our first homes will be built in Puerto Rico and will be structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. This is not a wen moon project but we feel we will be the first to actually show a legitimate everyday need being covered in the blockchain space with a cryptocurrency as its method of purchase.  If you notice, we have never made claims to our currency being backed by real estate as many do, because it is not. You can buy real estate with our coin, but our coin is backed by us, the community. Thanks to all of you who have joined us so far and taken time to inquire about this project. It is almost time folks.. Hope you all are ready for the ride! here

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think the concept of a dICO is very new to everyone. Just remember, you are the start of a community that is part of the 3rd dICO in human history.

[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hi

[09-Jul-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> to buy? @Catalyst

[09-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yes it was a test order I don't quite remember the details but I remember this that I used 15 or so kmd for it :)

[09-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 2 weeks ago :(

[09-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I try over 100 times to sell not one has worked.

[09-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I see buy orders but you can never match them.

[09-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Haaaam may be you putting a really high price or something. But as barderdex is still new to many, it would take time to mainstream

[09-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Price is under market or matched to buyer orders

[09-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> But still you're unable to sell them? :o

[09-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> yes

[09-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> You on the latest version of barterdex?

[09-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> 1.0.7-rc

[09-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> They release like every week or so.

[09-Jul-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> I can't tell you about the version as I am on cellphone

[09-Jul-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I will check TY

[09-Jul-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> But try to get the latest version may be that will solve the issue

[09-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Have you tried with the test coins? I.e. beer and pizza

[09-Jul-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I can swap tests

[09-Jul-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> If tests are okay then may there is some issue from kmd side. Try to report it on the kmdplatform or their slack.. Really good and cooperating people

[09-Jul-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> You will love their quick and helpful response.

[09-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
