[dscrdeql] <c2k> today is a nasty BTC break below support.  no one in their right mind should be holding BTC after this. price is headed for low $3k's imo

[14-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @c2k no 3k anymore

[14-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <c2k> personally i have zero interest in owning btc unless price gets > ~$6700, and then > ~$7350 

would much rather buy EQLI! 👍 :EQLI1: 💯

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are currently getting things together to start building which is the primary function of equaliser but if you suggest we stop that and focus on something else, I am certainly all ears if you have a better idea? 😜
