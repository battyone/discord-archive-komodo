[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> then under 20 😄

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I am going to disengage here 😛 I could argue this for days. And all it will do is start a fight. We don't know what happened to that data, but the official story makes almost as much sense as the official story regarding the twin towers. Neither is true, but we don't know and probably won't know the truth. It's irrelevant to future progess, because that will not come from centralized governments. They are not capable of it, even if they had our best interests at heart. Which they demonstrably don't. Democracy is the new age religion, and it's just as false as the others. And with that, I'll leave ya'll to ponder it and get back to work.

[18-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> well Democracy  isn't the best... but for sure is the only who works 😃
