[29-Jul-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> .41 is current, I believe. Double checking right now.

[29-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yep, it's current.

[dscrdeql] <SoldatChristi> I can't keep up.

[29-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not sure what you're asking, @x2maano

[29-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ok, I upgreaded the wallet but still getting a connection error

[29-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Native or Lite?

[29-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> spv

[29-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Still down. I'll keep you updated. Native should work.

[29-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Quick way to check the latest version is in the pinned messages in Komodo agama wallet channel 😃

[29-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <addi> good night all 👋

[29-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder do I need to import the keys into native?

[29-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Goodnight @addi

[29-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> @SoldatChristi lol

[29-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> @addi good night dear!

[29-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> @Biomech-Founder  I am asking about EQL rate

[29-Jul-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Sorry, busy with the servers. @MySoulisNotForSale yes, but I recommend you wait. We are getting the spv servers back online. You hold the seed, so your coins are safe. This will all be sorted shortly.

[29-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @x2maano check exrates.me. I think there is still some cheap coin available.

[29-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hmmm

[29-Jul-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> looks like the import worked in native

[29-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I never used native mode so far always with lite..

[29-Jul-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> do you guys know max supply of EQL?

[29-Jul-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 500million.

[29-Jul-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> try lite mode, anyone willing.

[29-Jul-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> One of the servers is back up 😄

[29-Jul-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I still got to do maintenance on the other one.
