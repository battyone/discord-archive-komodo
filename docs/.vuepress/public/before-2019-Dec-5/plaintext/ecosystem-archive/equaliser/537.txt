[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I remember Timezone from when I was a kid....losing my pocket money there.

[11-Jan-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I was never really good at any of the games though

[11-Jan-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hey jelly hope the trip was amazing

[11-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, was a good trip...hard though with 4 kids to look after and make sure they're safe and they eat a lot as well.

[11-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think the kids really appreciate the different cultures they've seen and enjoy coming home and enjoying the basics.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Welcome home, you reckon you felt you could have stayed longer In Japan? When I have had holidays in the past, I've been ready to get back to work.

[11-Jan-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good morning everyone

[11-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> After 10 days I was ready to leave Japan and come home.

[11-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've just made a large roast leg of pork with crackling for dinner. Good to eat food I'm used to.

[11-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice, I flame grilled a rump steak last night on my BBQ with volcanic rock with a side of quinoa, chickpea and carrot salad which had a slight curry powder flavour, new favourite salad for be at the moment. Similar to a Moroccan cous cous

[11-Jan-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> wow...sounds great

[11-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just had auto-mac

[dscrdeql] <The Money Manager> Good morning!

[11-Jan-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> What's auto-mac?

[11-Jan-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[11-Jan-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Haha it’s the drive thru McDonald’s in Puerto Rico

[12-Jan-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've never seen that "AUTO-MAC" in any mcdonalds.  like you said, must be a PR thing

[12-Jan-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's hot af in Sydney today.  I did a long workout session and sweated bucket loads. good to lift weights again after a week or so travelling.

[12-Jan-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> hi there @nille

[12-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> how's it going?

[12-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's sat night here in sydney...just finished BBQ

[12-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> awesome

[12-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> chicken sticks and salad

[12-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That was at a roadside spot in mayaguez

[12-Jan-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Having an in depth conversation with my buddy who pours concrete about ways to make the blocks much stronger

[12-Jan-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Always good to get experienced advice

[12-Jan-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> He’s been pouring concrete since he could walk

[12-Jan-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I value his opinion highly

[12-Jan-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Also learning python as I think it will be the easiest to write out the marketplace with

[13-Jan-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> coding a whole marketplace from scratch I think is a huge job. would be better to buy an existing system that could be adapted for this.  A lot of smaller companies these days will buy before build, unless they're a fintech company and that's their specialty.

[13-Jan-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If we could find a payment system that we could use for the marketplace whereby we can define the currency (eqli) then that would be ideal.

[13-Jan-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think I could find a plug-in and incorporate it into the framework of an app.

[13-Jan-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will see I learn really fast

[13-Jan-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have friends I can call on if I need help

[13-Jan-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus all of you! Lol

[13-Jan-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ok

[14-Jan-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im hoping it takes a swan dive this week

[14-Jan-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> as I am ramping up car listings.

[14-Jan-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> tax time here so we should crank out around 15-20 cars next month

[14-Jan-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if I can average 1500 a car profit margin with btc low then we are set to add the support we need and push a decent little campaign as well

[14-Jan-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> liven this place up a little bit

[14-Jan-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> even if it dips low i don't think i can buy need to save up for a car

[14-Jan-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if only you had a car dealership here in aus cowboy 😄

[14-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Classic cars are nice assets. I would love an Australian ford falcon from the 60's

[14-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I personally think the falcon and Commodore died when they stopped being built in Aus

[14-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I drive a kia carnival so it can fit 6 people in it...like driving a bus..

[14-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'll covert an old transport bus one day. Electric motors, solar, wind and keep the diesel as a generator or swap it for a much smaller Cummings

[14-Jan-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Use an Onan generator

[dscrdeql] <peddycb> Since our money is used up and teammates disappear, what exactly does that mean? When you're out of money, how are you going to move on?

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @peddycb I am running on my reserves that I sat aside before we ever started this.

[14-Jan-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good to get it done for day

[14-Jan-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CowboyCrypto nice one

[14-Jan-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I sat aside funding to make sure this was successful long before we ever created the blockchain for this.

[14-Jan-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good thinking to have reserves set aside

[14-Jan-19 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> actually I created a coin called homecoin on waves first. but I never really launched it

[14-Jan-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But to be more specific with you, this project is about creating affordable housing. So afforable we can create homes to help the homeless get back on their feet.  That would be super easy if we still had all of our raised funds, but this way is truly proving to be a challenge...

[14-Jan-19 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
