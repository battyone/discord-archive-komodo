[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure if I misread it, but is there a time known for when we can lock our funds?

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hi there

[18-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> looks like EQLI price is going really strong

[18-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> great to see

[18-Sep-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> more good news and more good news

[18-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Price is looking good - I wasnâ€™t planning on  a masternode but am now shopping for more after seeing the rewards structure today ðŸ˜€

[18-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Been digging the flow of news, stories and openness coming out the last few weeks

[18-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, people still have a chance to get that 100k needed for very cheap

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep getting good action on exrates at the moment

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> we will say ah damn should of got some when it was cheaper

[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> imagine in a month guys? we will be dreaming to get eqli at these prices

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> dinner time see you guys a bit later

[18-Sep-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ðŸ˜„

[18-Sep-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> See ya combat - enjoy

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> enjoy @Combat Wombat

[18-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Enjoy dinner Wombat ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Guessing I can safely cancel my buy orders for 7 sats and below, doesnâ€™t look like we will ever see those levels again

[18-Sep-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> have nice dinner too

[18-Sep-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> You never know, but with new buy orders popping up higher, it will be very hard to dump below

[18-Sep-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> or breakfast there

[18-Sep-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghÃ¸st> dinner for me

[18-Sep-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the dumper is gone..you can tell by the trading action

[18-Sep-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the only people who are selling are the people who bot lower and are lightly selling to take some profits

[18-Sep-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> size of the offers are much smaller in aggregate than the bids

[18-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> none of the major holders in the top 10-15 rich list are selling...for sure
all this tells u price is going higher

[18-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> imo

[18-Sep-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Letâ€™s hope so @c2k - as although as much as I would love to buy cheaper I would be happier to see EQLI price rise which will bolster and support the project

[18-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[18-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just sharing what i see from the way its acting

[18-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive been trading for 20yrs so learned a few things along the way

[18-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ðŸ“ˆ

[18-Sep-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I agree with that analysis c2k

[18-Sep-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it sure does look that way and also looks like we are headed for 30 sats soon unless of course some one who bought really low decides to dump or put a wall up

[18-Sep-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> earlier we were up to 26 and some very smart person decided to put his/her eqli at sale for 20 sats

[18-Sep-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ðŸ¤·

[18-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im not that smart to sell my eqli lower then what it just sold for

[18-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[18-Sep-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lolol

[18-Sep-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have my masternode bags...just waiting

[18-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> all the trades are on the offer...no one hitting the bid.

[18-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> another GREAT sign

[18-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, looking forward to the mn rewards ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I was able to pick up a little more for 16 sats a little while ago, and 20 sats more recently, but I am not seeing it drop below 20 anytime soon

[18-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ya was checking, thinking the same thing. I have sells at 2x last. Great to see us early investors get gains. And when i say "sells" it's not a dump, just 15% of my bag to get 100% ROI

[18-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I have the same type of sells set up, basically all the EQLI I have has been paid for by itself

[18-Sep-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Things are looking much better on the trading front.. if we can get some good support at these levels we will go even higher on exrates and will be in a very good position for when we get listed on other exchanges

[18-Sep-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> the team is also moving along quicker then I thought... who knows how far EQLI will go this year.. I was honestly expecting next year but it could happen much sooner

[18-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep more liquidity..

[18-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> i think 100 sats are def possible this year minimum.

[18-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> oh if we get volume that will be easy Buddz

[18-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> when mastermodes are out

[18-Sep-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well if people are smart it will happen before then

[18-Sep-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> unless they want to wait until masternodes are out and price goes up before they buy

[18-Sep-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats fine they can do that lol

[18-Sep-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if no one else puts buy orders up about 61k eqli until we hit 30 sats

[18-Sep-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> exactly ahah

[18-Sep-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> for me it would be awesome but lets wait and see.

[18-Sep-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im just glad to be this early thats all into this amazing project.

[18-Sep-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> same here.. lucky to be here with all you guys ðŸ˜„

[18-Sep-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> have you seen the price that its labelled in agama wallet?

[18-Sep-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I tried looking but I don't see it

[18-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> agama wallet

[18-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
