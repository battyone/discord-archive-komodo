[02-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> exrates.me

[02-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Where the dumper lives 😠

[02-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Are there still any exchanges out there that let you vote for a coin? I haven't looked in a while, but if there is, let us know.

[02-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> It's really mind boggling why they would do that, still can't wrap my head around it

[02-Aug-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I am trying on one but they are slow to respond

[02-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We can get on coinex with 500 verified accounts voting

[02-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> I'm sure there are other exchanges out there that will allow you to vote

[02-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> But I don't know if they they turn around and ask you for a fee

[02-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Tbh

[02-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> At these prices the dumperstash should not last this long?

[02-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Volume just really low

[02-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> If volume picks up that stash is gone in a sec

[02-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
