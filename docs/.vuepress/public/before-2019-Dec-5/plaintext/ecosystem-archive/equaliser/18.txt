[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> where you at now?

[05-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I have a ps4 and I have a wii u, not going to buy the switch.

[05-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At the time I was going to buy the wii u, there was news about the switch, and they said it was not going to replace the current gen (wii u), and that there would be games coming for both consoles.

[05-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Offcourse, I bought the wii u, and not long after there was news that they we're stopping with the wii u. I bought several games for it that are now coming, or are on the switch.

[05-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So I'm sticking with ps4 only this gen

[05-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wish I just did some research on it like 2 months later and I would have waited for the switch

[05-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> last year I bouth a xbox one s with a couple cames from microsoft store for 299, I had a ps4 already. I dont play games much these days except Ive spent hundreds if not thousands of hours playing tom clancy rainbox 6 vegas and vegas 2 on split screen co-op with my father the last 10 years

[05-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wow, I wish I had a father like that!

[05-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Mines would never play games with me, maybe like once every 3 years.

[05-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> He likes war games

[05-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> a couple of them. I miss split screen co-op not many of those these days. hopefully they will make a comeback

[05-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sourge> 007 was a good split screen

[05-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> on n64. for sure

[05-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I was in primary school when that was out

[05-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, since online is available I don't like solo gaming anymore.

[05-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We even bought a second ps4 (and also did with the ps3), so we could play lots of games together

[05-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> n64 and gamecube are probably the best I had. Lots of fun with the mario games with friends.

[05-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I own the original NES, the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo switch. Also got PS1-2-3 and ps4 lol

[05-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> You could say I‚Äôm a gamer

[05-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Also got the ps vita

[05-Jul-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I had a chipped ps1 but dont know what happened to it. Have 2 sega mega drives (genesis)

[05-Jul-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm probably to young for the nes system.

[05-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I‚Äôm 33 so the nes and snes were my childhood loves

[05-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I had a commodore 64 and the games were similar to nes

[05-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> took forever to load

[05-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Woww

[05-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> was better than atari

[05-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I did play some commodore 64 games, my father had it. But that's probably it

[05-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sourge> i use this sometimes
