[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've found that pasting links from twitter work ok

[09-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It might just be type of link

[09-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've tried the gif type ones like you have and they didn't work either

[dscrdeql] <Zach> Anyone know how EQLI is doing on exrates today?

[10-Sep-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Back down to 8..

[10-Sep-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Not a good message to level up on haha

[10-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ha

[10-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> well if u look at the cup half full it could be good if youre looking to buy more

[10-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Market will do what it does. We are working to create better market conditions but are currently focusing on delivering on our end.

[10-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But @c2k is right. If one person walks in and market buys 1 btc worth, see where the price would be then

[10-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive bot more below 10 and sit on bids all the way down

[10-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fwiw

[10-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We appreciate it

[10-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have nothing for sale below 1000 sats

[10-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once u guys get product visible thats where its  going üëç

[10-Sep-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> heya everyone!

[10-Sep-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I would make a ton of money if it makes it to 1000 sats, lets do it haha

[10-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice level up there  @Zach

[10-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @linkara6669 hey there

[10-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto if one person bought 1btc worth, price would be crazy high

[10-Sep-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> 1 BTC on exrates would take it to 78 sats I think

[10-Sep-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Building and delivering our mission will get people to notice, The housing affordability crisis is out of control and first home buyers and families struggling to save for a downpayment on a home are doing it tough in the extremely inflated housing markets. We are going to rock the hell out of the housing market. Equaliser provides access to a great store of value in real estate. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.

[10-Sep-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good morning everyone

[10-Sep-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Still tired, need to prepare my kid for school. I'm surprised it was easy getting used to school schedule again after the 6 weeks vacation. It's the third week already now
How are you doing?

[10-Sep-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> After summer vacation? Winters finished here so much happier to see some sun and warmer weather

[10-Sep-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning  @SwimedDragon

[10-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, I'm looking forward to winter, not the big cold, but it has often 5-10 celcius day's which are not too cold over here

[10-Sep-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> damn. thats the temp at night in winter here. winter days around 10-15 degrees celcuis

[10-Sep-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, it can get a lot colder, but it's often not for too long. But I prefer the autumn and spring months, winter can be nice because it sometimes has snow üòÉ

[10-Sep-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> nice. Im yet to see snow. Never seen before.

[10-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Really

[10-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Tasmania gets some snow

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Also thredbo

[10-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Tasmania would be nice to visit, world class scotches there I believe

[10-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> So expensive going skiing in Australia

[10-Sep-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It can be cheaper to fly OS tip go skiing

[10-Sep-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I know a few ppl that fly to Japan to ski

[10-Sep-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Japan would be nice. We used to host Japanese exchange students and show them around and our daily routine. Adelaide used to have a place called mount thebarton, indoor tobogganing and ice skating. tobogganing was closed i guess because of too much liability, I believe ice skating still exists

[10-Sep-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Didn't know that existed..

[10-Sep-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Sounds good

[10-Sep-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
