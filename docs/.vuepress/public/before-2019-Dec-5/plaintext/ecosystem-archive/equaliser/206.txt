[27-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not a bad thing to see right when you get up. ‚òï brewing, exrates doing updates... only thing that would make it better is if Homey the Dumper fell down...

[27-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> horney the dumper lol.

[27-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ha

[27-Jul-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hard to be particularly original before coffee. Best I got üòõ

[27-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> How much and at what price is it on exrates?

[27-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> very cheap on exrates if you want to buy now is the time

[27-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well not now because the site is under maintenance lol

[27-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> hey thorth

[27-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> would the price on BDEX be equivalent to the price on exrates?

[27-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Anyone know how long you have to wait for EQL withdrawlas from xrates.me?

[27-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> No idea

[27-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not sure can't figure out how to use those things lol

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ha

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> Oh everyone is waking up xD

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @miles can be up to 48 hours... they are under maintenance now so maybe longer or quicker depending on what they are doing

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but they say usually from 12-48 hours

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> worst time so far was about 30 hours, best was less than an hour.

[27-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm hoping they're automating it with this update.

[27-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> cool - thanks all

[27-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> unless somebody is dumping on BDEX too, then I'd say no. I certainly wouldn't sell any at those prices. Buy, hell yeah. Have been üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> Haha it's like a black Friday sale

[27-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> Don't miss out

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> Grab it whilst it's low low low

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I tried bdex and didn't see any trades one there

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> It probably be $1000 in a year's time lol

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Da hell?

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I have like 30 posted between KMD, LTC and BTC markets.

[27-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And I just checked, my server is running fine.

[27-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> This was a week ago i checked. When did you post?

[27-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've had the majority of them up for about a week. Added some two days ago.

[27-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Im logging into BD now to check

[27-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hang on, I'm rebooting Hyperdex, just in case.

[27-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if i wsa in front of my bdex pc i would log in to see too. unfort imnot

[27-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> although my coins are added in electrum mode

[27-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> shouldn't matter.

[27-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> All mine are too.

[27-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I abviously did something wrong then

[27-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, it's up.

[27-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Obviously

[27-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not necessarily. could just as easily be me. Bdex is a strange and temperamental beast.

[27-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I mean, i could see kmd trades for other coins, though...i need to play with it more

[27-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i bought a bunch of pangea on BDEX a while ago but never saw a market on either side

[27-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i asked support in discord and they told me where it traded last and to put a bid out at that price

[27-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it worked

[27-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for some reason there were no bids and offers tho...so didnt appear to be "working"

[27-Jul-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah the whole thing is confusing to me

[27-Jul-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> as you said...tempermental beast

[27-Jul-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> will never reach its potential if they don't fix it up

[27-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Those who buy early will have a great tale to tell

[27-Jul-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Masternodes are a great way to create passive income, but just think of how the market is going to react once they realize that being a homeowner can create passive income as well

[27-Jul-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when someone uses EQL to buy a home do those EQL get burned or recirculated ?

[27-Jul-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Recirculated to an extent

[27-Jul-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We basically will just be locking those funds up with a portion of them going towards our sponsorship program

[27-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
