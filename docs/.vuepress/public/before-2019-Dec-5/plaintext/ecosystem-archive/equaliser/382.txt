[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm thinkning of maybe getting some ingredients and making up a mix of my own to try it out as well

[28-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> will have to wait till the wekeend and see if my local hardware has all the ingredients

[28-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> also like to see how easy it would be to cut the blocks once they're set

[28-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like cvould you cut them wiht a wood saw or need a concrete cutter

[28-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe just an angle grinder with a masonry bit would cut it easily and with a clean cut

[28-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> sunny day but work calls

[28-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> gotta go earn the money

[28-Aug-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You can cut with a knife

[28-Aug-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Really...that's pretty good that you can't have top use an angle grinder

[28-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The dust from an angle grinder cutting concrete or bricks is horrendous

[28-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> So glad a knife or saw will be able to do it

[28-Aug-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's gonna be great trying this stuff

[28-Aug-18 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Epic

[29-Aug-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @x2maano morning

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï

[29-Aug-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm really hoping that the first recipe is awesome in structural testing

[29-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> all of our fingers are crossed along with you üíØ

[29-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just contacted a local structural engineer hoping that we can get data on the strength of the blocks

[29-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sounds like progress in the right direction. maybe there is an engineer in the room that can suggest some questions to ask?

[29-Aug-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know we have a few here lol

[29-Aug-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Morning fellas :)

[29-Aug-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning  @Faisal

[29-Aug-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think engineering usually will take core samples of concrete and test them for strength

[29-Aug-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> another normal day

[29-Aug-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå just shoot a .50 cal at the block . . then measure it's strenght by how hard the shards strike your face

[29-Aug-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> üòÇ

[29-Aug-18 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> good morning

[29-Aug-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I forgot the name of the exchange eql is listed at

[29-Aug-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> refresh my memory someone

[29-Aug-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> actually. . I just want to know the price

[29-Aug-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning  @K00l1

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> How are you  @MySoulisNotForSale

[29-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what is the price of eql now

[29-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ok, let's have a looksie

[29-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> WOOooo 7 satoshi!

[29-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôll stay at .45 bro

[29-Aug-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 50 cal is just overkill

[29-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just want to see how strong these bastards are before I start making them stronger

[29-Aug-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ^^^ lol

[29-Aug-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I would test them against a tree stump flying at 200 mph

[29-Aug-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå  hey man

[29-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> nice

[29-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you‚Äôre in Arkansas I‚Äôll invite you up @MySoulisNotForSale

[29-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hey  @Faisal

[29-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> In on my lunchtime now

[29-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Such a nice sunny day

[29-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've gone to the nearby library

[29-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just to chill out for a while

[29-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They have some very comfy seats here

[29-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Noice

[29-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nice

[29-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @MySoulisNotForSale test engineering......by gun.

[29-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I have several methods I want to use

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Go the 45cal...won't be anything left of it

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'd try hammer, drill, saw

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I will use my 45 carbine for sure

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Also my bow

[29-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And do same with a conventional brick to get a good comparison

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Bow?  Walking dead style

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Like that character

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> With the bow

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I‚Äôm country

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> He's way cool

[29-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haaa...country...that explains it

[29-Aug-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yup

[29-Aug-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> In that case you might try the shottie

[29-Aug-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Slug would be fine

[29-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> greetings good people

[29-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My issue lies in waiting for it to fully cure

[29-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Sup andy

[29-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Greetings  @AndronicusBass

[29-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea...concrete takes 28 days to fully cure

[29-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I got a driveway press a few months ago

[29-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Couldn't drive on it for 2 weeks

[29-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Didn't fully cure for 4 weeks

[29-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Calcium chloride can accelerate it tremendously

[29-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But even then lol

[29-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 2 weeks it should be around half strength

[29-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's good

[29-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Is the strength compromised at all by adding calcium chloride?

[29-Aug-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I had to water the driveway twice a day as well so it would cure slowly and not crack

[29-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Could you shape the mould to create arch shaped pieces to fit the dome roof?

[29-Aug-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Better to pour the shape you want rather than blocks that then need to be cut

[29-Aug-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It makes it stronger actually

[29-Aug-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Will use trusses for roof framing

[29-Aug-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ok, even better

[29-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You sound like you have a full game plan

[29-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Noice

[29-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have had a long time to draw up several plans

[29-Aug-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I‚Äôve been putting this on paper for a year

[29-Aug-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's good to hear

[29-Aug-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's exciting
