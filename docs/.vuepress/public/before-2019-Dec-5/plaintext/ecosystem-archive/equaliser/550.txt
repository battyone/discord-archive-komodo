[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hello all good people

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've finished work for the week

[15-Feb-19 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> got a lot to get done this weekend though

[15-Feb-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just read that JPMorgan thing...creating their own crypto. intersting to see how it might affect the whole crypto industry. I'd hate to see it with marketcap above other main cryptos like btc. Most likely just a Ripple rip off.

[15-Feb-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Banks are loving blockchain but never want to admit it until they have something ready to go themselves. They have monopolised money for so long and own the media that the masses are programmed to tune in to, we have to keep up the good fight to put money bac in control of the people. Blockchain needs a self regulating mechanism so government regulation wont be necessary.

[15-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> true.

[15-Feb-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There is only so far the powers that be can kick the can. Too much interference of economic cycles can have devastating effects like runaway inflation. Given that Australian wages have been stagnant in growth for the past 7 or so years and more M3 broad money supply has been introduced into the system from excessive loans and mortgages from banks, if velocity slows such as people reducing spending in the economy in order to service debt obligations, and then government introduces QE to make up for reduced lending by banks, it is going to perpetuate the problem. I had written something a few years ago about the consequences of Australian style QE  however, it came to fruition by proxy with the lax regulation of bank lending. Why wont politicians realise that a correction needs to happen and sure it will be recession but rapid population growth is not the answer. Problem we have is that no one wants to be government in power when a correction happens.

[15-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Houses and property have become a tool of speculation and have only been driven higher by greed and still utilising tax incentives for property investment introduced in the 80's when interest rates were high and trade employment was low. Each generation of government kept the negative gearing going and also opened the gates for foreign investment which drove up demand for property. The first home buyer has no chance. When I saw Equaliser, I knew I found my calling.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Never any conversation around the origins of equaliser, just as long as we spit rain, everyone's happy. LOL

[16-Feb-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass-Founder  intersting about the 'correction' we have to have.

[16-Feb-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> you're right, no government wants to be holding the hot potato on that one. They'll quickly pass it off to the next and then the next and next. band aid after band aid. It delays the inevitable and when the inevitable happens, it'll be much worse.

[16-Feb-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I work with a bunch a 'indians' from india who have taken australian jobs... ok that's not good for australia, but now these Indians are lamenting about the cost of housing in Sydney and how much it costs to buy anything. It seems there's no way they could come up with a 15 - 20% deposit on a property.

[16-Feb-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> reason is that 15- 20% of even a cheapy property of $600k is around $90k. By the time the person saves $90k over a few years then the price of that cheap property has now risen to $1M and now 15% of that is now $150k.   It keeps getting further and further escaping from them. I recommended that if they want to buy then just get out of Sydney. They're stuck doing IT though and most IT jobs are in Sydney.  Some are in Mel but that's almost as expensive.  I recommend they move to Brisbane. Still has some IT jobs and better standard of living being able to live closer to work.

[16-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> In terms of interest only in 'spitting rain' I think people will become way more focused and interested once the first property has been completed. That the Proof of Concept. At work, whenever we do something new we do a POC. People don't focus much energy until the POC is complete and its proven that the approach and method will work, then it's full steam ahead.  Might be same here. Once the POC is completed and investors will come knocking.

[16-Feb-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> My comment to this: My major concern is the ones purportedly running the country didn't see a problem with it happening.what hope do we have with such incompetence behind the wheel to get us out of this one. Rapid population growth which will have major social problems and shrinking wages further perpetuating debt and mortgage stress among households. The only option is to hold on for a bumpy ride and allow economic cycles to naturally run their course. Or print more money with QE and cause runaway inflation.

'We've stopped dreaming': Meet the people abandoning Sydney
Priscilla Meyer says she's given up on buying a home in Sydney and is moving interstate, as exclusive data reveals living standards in the Harbour City are actually going backwards.

[17-Feb-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Unfortunately moving isn't going to help in the long run, the industry has been allowed to self regulate which has seen building standards drop. Anyone heard of opal tower in Sydney?

[17-Feb-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> nice one.

[17-Feb-19 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @AndronicusBass don't blame her moving interstate to be able to buy property

[17-Feb-19 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'd do the same if I didn't have a place already in Sydney

[18-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> By no means blaming her, my narrative is general population, it just shifts the problem.

[18-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> we had areas in Melbourne where homes were cheap.. heaps of people sold properties and moved into those areas. Now house prices aren't too cheap in those areas anymore

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I think one of the bigger issues in australia is land prices

[18-Feb-19 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is

[18-Feb-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve been looking at it

[18-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Land acquisition is the killer there

[18-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah it sucks! might have to start a crypto land in the middle of no where lol

[18-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once we get traction here, the rest will become a chain reaction.  I‚Äôm taking my time getting these panels perfect so that when time comes the actual build will take place in a day or two and will be done.  The plan is to pre-install windows, conduit and some plumbing to reduce labor and costs.

[18-Feb-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> nice well when you end up pushing into Australia I'm in Victoria my labour services are available to you for 1 eqli coin per hour üòÇ nah free free üòÑ

[18-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If the first build goes as planned,  then I‚Äôll be there by next summer.

[18-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have another build I‚Äôm working on that will be contracted through us in Utah

[18-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> nice keep up the good work

[18-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I apologize for my lack of presence lately, just trying to get myself positioned to rock this out as fast as I can and get this project back on track

[18-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> haha better that you are not around üòÑ

[18-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[18-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> the rest of us need to pick up the slack in discord while you get those panels right

[18-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Got a potential partnership in the works that could add massive value to our mission. I have to go meet with the CEO this week

[18-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> woo nice good luck with that

[18-Feb-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs all but a done deal we just need to put it on paper after we figure out how our paths best intersect

[18-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> sounds exciting can't wait to hear the news

[18-Feb-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, it's strange to see an overview like that in the sneak peak when it's in another language. But layout looks nice, and it has more rooms then we have hereü§£

[18-Feb-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto interesting design layout. I've seen designs in Australia have been changing a lot. All the open plan living and kitchen are at the back of the houses opening up onto the backyard

[18-Feb-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> There's usually a small front living room on a wide hallway that goes past the bedrooms to the rear of the house with large open kitchen and living.

[18-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> People like to be able to watch what the kids are doing in the back yard whilst they're in the kitchen

[18-Feb-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Especially if there's a swimming pool in backyard

[18-Feb-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, especially while cooking it's easy to take a quick look in the yard instead of walking there. There's not lots of swimming pools in back yards over here, but I can see the need to keep an eye out even when kids are a bit older.

[18-Feb-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
