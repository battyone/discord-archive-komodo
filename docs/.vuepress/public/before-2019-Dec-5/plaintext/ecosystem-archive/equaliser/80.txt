[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It will be blasted all over social media far and wide, I know you were trying to sell on barterdex but you should buy more on exchanges

[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Aww. It's 8am and just about to start my day

[11-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> what's the 'hard way' this morning?

[11-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> It's 3am here...I'm about to end my day! üòÑ

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> that's a late turn in @aFastHero

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> won't you be shattered tomorrow

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> nah, I do my best work at night.

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'm more a morning person myself

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> not too good at night

[11-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> I can function without issue on at least 4 hours of sleep.

[11-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Taking hamburger: instead of clients coffee

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> But I've also been doing some selling tonight. Made a nice profit on DGB. Closed 50% of my position at 639 and the rest, just now, at 605.

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> hamburger...breakfast of champions?

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> me fine what about you?

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> 4 hours sleep isn't much

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Closed my MCO position as well. Looking forward to buying that back much lower.

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I'm morning person too but I don't joke with work as long as am getting person. I don't mind doing 20hrs with 4 hrs break

[11-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Why did you close your DGB position?

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> just think it's going down?

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Am good  @x2maano

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> did you sell for fiat or btc?

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> is this your health secret

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Hit significant resistance, RSI topped out, 5-wave count up complete.

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> sold for BTC

[11-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> I trade for BTC

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> ok, thought maybe fiat or USDT

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Not I, sir.

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> BTC isn't looking too good at the moment either

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> in downtrend

[11-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> The movements of BTC have become irrelevant to me.

[11-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> I've made it a point to learn how to make gains with the market going up OR down.

[11-Jul-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Even if BTC drops lower, seems way too risky to short now. To me, at least.

[11-Jul-18 08:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> I guess I could, but I see that I'll do much better focusing on alts at the moment.

[11-Jul-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> For the record, I'm planning to buy back in to DGB at sub 500 levels.

[11-Jul-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> nice

[11-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> ok, sounds like a plan

[11-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> not A plan...THE MOTHA FUCKIN plan üòÑ

[11-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> haha...yep

[11-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> What up everyone

[11-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Hard ****s and helicopters!

[11-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> cool

[11-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Anything exciting going on for anyone?

[11-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> or eventful?
