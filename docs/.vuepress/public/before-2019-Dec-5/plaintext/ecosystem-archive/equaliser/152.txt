[23-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> trust me, I can get random tested by the company, as well as any cop who pulls me over . .

[23-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> they can piss test me on the side of the road anytime they wish

[23-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> true, keep safe and others on the road safe too. you yield alot of power on the road

[23-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Here in the "land of the free" things like that are common. My oh my how far we've come since 1781 😦

[23-Jul-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder tell me about it, we even sponsor terrorists these days

[23-Jul-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hell, our leaders invented them.

[23-Jul-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> trust me I know. . I am Syrian . .

[23-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Interesting

[23-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I didn't come to be an anarchist easily. I believe in rules, but not rulers.

[23-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @AndronicusBass-Founder If you have any questions, feel free to ask me . .I was actually born in a place called "The Valley of Christians" . . . where their native language is Aramaic. .

[23-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> the only place on earth

[23-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But I am also a student of history, and one thing that is universally true: One doesn't make friends by killing people.

[23-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> although Its obvious that the WMD's was a made up story.

[23-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I didn't know Aramaic was still spoken anywhere 😄 That's pretty awesome !

[23-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder only in 1 small area in Syria

[23-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Have you ever seen the movie "Fallen"?

[23-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> nope

[23-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm curious if the Aramaic spoken in it was accurate.

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I'll try to download it tonight

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's a Denzel movie, well worth the watch 😄

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <hanson24> wooot

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Even if they didn't get that part right, it's a good story.

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Biomech-Founder he's always making movies which involve the bible

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Pretty indirectly in this one, but it does have to do with Azazel.

[23-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> last one I seen of his was the book of eli?

[23-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That was a good movie.

[23-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> something like that

[23-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Fallen was better 😄

[23-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> and just to be clear . . those terrorists are not Muslims . .  you see, Islam is the only non chrsitian denomination which makes it an article of faith to believe in Christ . . thought's i'd put that out there. . In Syria, Christains and Muslims celebrate Eid, and Christmas together, we are brothers and sisters. . opposite of what the Zionist media like to portray

[23-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Mz Kim> thanks

[23-Jul-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm an atheist. I've too many contradictions in all the religions I've studied. You won't offend me with strong opinions 😄 But I will debate it.

[23-Jul-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <lAlexl> ty

[23-Jul-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> Indians believe in god 😛

[23-Jul-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> don't get me wrong .. I don't follow organized religion

[23-Jul-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> fook all that shit

[23-Jul-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I neither believe or disbelieve in gods. It's religion I don't believe in.

[23-Jul-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but to believe we come from monkeys the way darwinism has led us to believe? Nahhhhh

[23-Jul-18 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If there was a god that had ultimate power and wanted to be worshipped, there'd only be one religion.

[23-Jul-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I really am off to bed now. Too be continued 😄
