[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I reread the Ann, do we have to reset to level 1 again on Aug 15th?

[13-Aug-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Aug-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @Cypher - Founder I saw I needed to restart at #tipsy-begin but it's not in the announcement. Not sure if people know about it

[13-Aug-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> All this chat makes me feel like buying EQLI

[13-Aug-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I only saw cause I scrolled up

[13-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm already trying to buy more haha

[13-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha...we're probably all competing against each other on Exrates

[13-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just have an order lower. I bought some earlier at like 14 sats (few day's ago) and it went back lower

[13-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not sure if the whale is done with dumping yet

[13-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I would say he hasn't... just be careful.

[13-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I put about 25 % back in as lower buys each time, and then slowly move it up as a wall gets established.

[13-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not gonna tell my whole strategy, but trade in layers üòÑ

[13-Aug-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've bought in a nice amount already but I'm sure plan on getting some more üòÉ

[13-Aug-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And hold more than you sell.

[13-Aug-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I do not plan on selling all, and even the part I want to sell, I'll be holding that for a while

[13-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do I need to register any more besides tipsy begin?

[13-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, I have layers

[13-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> good question...do we need to 'register' for bounty program or just start doing it?

[13-Aug-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
