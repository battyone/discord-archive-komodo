[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> going to an end of footy season 'party' for my son's AFL team

[31-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 🍻 🍾 🍷

[31-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> let the party begin. happy weekend

[31-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hope you're going to enjoy 😃

[31-Aug-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It looks like someone is selling EQLI again, it's down a bit

[31-Aug-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I noticed in the top 100 on the eql explorer that my position went up by one

[31-Aug-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> which means someone withdrew a large amount from their address, which I presumed meant would be sold on exrates

[31-Aug-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so not exactly surprised

[31-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, why would someone sell now?

[31-Aug-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @🌟KQweci☄-Mod Did you fill a buy order now price has dropped a bit?

[31-Aug-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> lol...why do you think it was @🌟KQweci☄-Mod ?

[31-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> No!! I wasn't selling @SwimedDragon

[31-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> I have cancel mine buy order and redrawing eth to trade OTC here

[31-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> My*

[31-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> No I meant did one of your buy orders get filled?

[31-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> what price are you getting OTC?

[31-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Nope. I cancel order and withdrawing to trade otc here

[31-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok

[31-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> 15sat I think

[31-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> cool

[31-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I would watch EQLI price, if it drops any more you still got a chance to buy cheap 😃

[31-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Alright

[31-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Still waiting exrates to finish withdrawer process. It's also taking forever😂

[31-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, it's slow

[31-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i've had to wait 24 hours sometimes

[31-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Wow

[31-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> First time I tried to withdraw it was in around 24 hours, but others were even waiting for over 48 hours I think

[31-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I don't think it's taking 48 hours anymore, maybe on weekend but not sure

[31-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> They need some serious system update

[31-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Mobile app hardly login
