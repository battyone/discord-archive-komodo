[19-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> android OnePlus One

[19-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Pull the battery for about 10 minutes. While the battery is out, hold the power button down for about 20 seconds.

[19-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That usually works.

[19-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Android can usually be recovered even if you brick it pretty bad.

[19-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> iPhone can always be 'recovered' for about 700 dollars üòõ

[19-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> well it has a built-in battery so can't just simply take it out have to disassemble it to take the battery out

[19-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> try holding volume up+menu button then while holding those you hold down power button until you see the screen show up

[19-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If screen shows up let go of all buttins

[19-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> there is no menu button in Oneplus One üòõ

[19-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> just volume and power
