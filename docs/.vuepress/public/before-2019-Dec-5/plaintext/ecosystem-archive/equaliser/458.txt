[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> anything good happening?

[21-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> price looks good

[21-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I convinced someone on exrates to buy 2k EQL earlier, tried to get him to join here but I dont think he was familiar with discord

[21-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> he bought at 65sats

[21-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> yeah

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hello

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I was just telling him to look into the project and he ended up buying some

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> if it's a smaller number it'll be worth close to $2000 soon -ish

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hi there @x2maano

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> how are you

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's gerat work @Zach

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> now get him to buy 2M

[21-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> watching sports

[21-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...I watched teh AFL game earlier

[21-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> great game

[21-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I probably have a better chance of playing in the AFL..

[21-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> really, have you ever watched it?

[21-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> actually, what country are you in @Zach

[21-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a big American guy kicked a bunch of goals actually in the winning team

[21-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i think he might be one of only a couple that are in the AFL

[21-Sep-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> USA, but I am not a big guy haha

[21-Sep-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> the US guy that kicked the goals is a big guy

[21-Sep-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> he'd be at least 6foot 8 or 10

[21-Sep-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah thats giant

[21-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I was just saying it is rather unlikely that guy would buy much more EQLI, didnt sound like he had a lot of funds to work with

[21-Sep-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> üòã

[21-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, but that's what's good about eqli at he moment, you can buy some now before it rockets more

[21-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that guy that bought most likely wouldn't be able to buy anwhere near that later on

[21-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ^^^ THIS!!!!!  This is good stuff @Zach thanks!

[21-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> he'll look  back and thank you

[21-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> 2k isnt much but at least its something

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hey its a step forward.

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no matter how small the step it is progress.

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they all add up

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I plan on bringing up EQLI at least once a day in exrates, as naturally as possible since I hate coin hypemen

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah its not easy to do lol

[21-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but if you knwo how its an art.

[21-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> today i just answered a couple people's questions about things on the site and then brought it up

[21-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> best i could come up with

[21-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Its also hard to promote discord on there because you cant put any links or websites in the chat

[21-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im workin on a few things right now

[21-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice work zach

[21-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üëå

[21-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> we're all gonna live in domes one day üòÑ

[21-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That BeethovenAndMozart guy is online on exrates again

[21-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> intersting

[21-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i thought he blew out of his position

[21-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe not...maybe he just left discord

[21-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[21-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> great job @Zach  appreciate it üòÑ

[21-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I thought so too, but he just said "EQL is screaming on here, while everything else on very other exchange just keeps falling and falling. Wonder why." which was a great opening to talk about how good the team behind EQLI is and that they are building their first home soon

[21-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right

[21-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i always read that chat

[21-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when im on there

[21-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> If he did sell short he is probably regretting it now

[21-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i doubt it. maybe he still owns a little but not as much as he used too

[21-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hard to say

[21-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> lol he's still in the discord. He can see what you're saying

[21-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but i sure he feels like hes missed the initial move...and whatever else is to come

[21-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> @c2k  which chat you talking about?

[21-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh really? i thought he left. lol

[21-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah i see him on the list but he is offline

[21-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Buddz1993 if you go onto exrates there is a chat in the top right

[21-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ahh I saw you guys are chatting there

[21-Sep-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I really wish exrates didnt have tons of fake volume, really takes away from the legitimacy of the exchange

[21-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> yeah

[21-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah its a mistake we made for sure. on that one

[21-Sep-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> oh well, thats how I found EQLI so I am personally glad you made that mistake

[21-Sep-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> wish we had noticed the wash trading beforehand lol

[21-Sep-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I would have went with coinexchange.io

[21-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> @CowboyCrypto- Founder  coinexachange.io is def a better exchange than exrates thats for sure

[21-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[21-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I got clouded vision from the volume

[21-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> even planned for poor sales

[21-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but couldnt imagine that anyone would dump like they did in the begining

[21-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Their loss

[21-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I took a huge hit trying to stop it lol

[21-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no worries though, i will just make more on the back end.

[21-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm glad he dump, and lots of us had a chance to buy a lot cheaply

[21-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> A huge hit by buying up what they were dumping?

[21-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah it was great for early adopters but I felt bad for those who bought at 10 or 27 cents

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we had a few sell at 50 cents as well

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but not a whole lot.

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah but that‚Äôs a known risk in investing, when it drops sometimes you have to buckle down and buy more so you can lower your average

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Let's just hope the dumper was someone who bought at 50 cents haha

[21-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so earliest investors kind of caught a bad run.

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its a loss on their end either way.

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I dont have an order in below 1000 sats.

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah but as long as they stick around it will still pay off in the long run

[21-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
