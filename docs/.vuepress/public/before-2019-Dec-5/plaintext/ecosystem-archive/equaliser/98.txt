[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> 200 will soon be 2000 in 2019

[17-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Actually I want to cash out but the market has been keeping low

[17-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Hopefully, the market will rise in 2019

[17-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I'm expecting a repeat of 2017

[17-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> The more it gets delayed, the bigger it will get

[17-Jul-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Hope so...counting on it
