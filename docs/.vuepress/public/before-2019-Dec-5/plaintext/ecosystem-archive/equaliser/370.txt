[dscrdeql] <coinard> up to a certain size, of course üòâ

[24-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I must be missing something

[24-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I found there are very large dome structures

[24-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> it looks unprofessional, very much so. It looks like you are talking about things you have no clue about yourself

[24-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> 2 storey ones

[24-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We did think to leave it out however, we decided in the long run it couldnt hurt to leave it in.

[24-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> it wouldn't if it looked right

[24-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Do you need to understand the mathematical equations to know the domes are strong?

[24-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't

[24-Aug-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't need to

[24-Aug-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thank you for your opinion, noted.

[24-Aug-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's what architects are for

[24-Aug-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Or engineers

[24-Aug-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> you want to attract investors with a lot of money, right? The project looks very capital intense. If the presentation is such that it looks like you want to impress people with gibberish math, it's a red flag

[24-Aug-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't need to know how to built a car engine in order to drive one

[24-Aug-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @coinard haha

[24-Aug-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Gibberish maths...lol

[24-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We haven't hyped this project like many others these days because we think its important to do things right and get our first builds down without undue pressure. Organic growth is key and results willl attract investors and customers.

[24-Aug-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> ok, I just wanted to let you know that you might want to do something about it üòâ either leave it out or present it in a way that makes sense

[24-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> if you succeed, you could really make an impact, but why make it difficult for you by giving a wrong impression about yourself?

[24-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thank's definitely a valid argument from your point, we havent had much concern with it but if we get more we can do something to reduce the WP üòÉ Also I forgot to mention, please feel free to read recent notes  form our recent AMA in #ama-mondays-1700-utc just some questions and answers

[24-Aug-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @coinard The rest of the team are afk right now however, I will raise with them what you raised today.

[24-Aug-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <coinard> ok, nice üòÉ And if there is somebody there to talk me through the math, it would be nice to get in touch üòâ I'm just interested from a fundamental point of view and would like to understand it

[24-Aug-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I just googled there are lots of links that walk through the maths of a dome structure...we don't want to reinvent the wheel here

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I wrote that last night  @coinard

[24-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I keep an open mind and always open to suggestions from community, I will raise it with the team, see what we think in hindsight if it's information the WP benefits from or not üëå

[24-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It might give some more idea about what Equaliser are moving towards

[24-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> Hey maano

[24-Aug-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> looks like Port had a bit of a come-back

[24-Aug-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> except they missed their last 2 shots at goal

[24-Aug-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I tipped Port but Essendon will win for sure now

[24-Aug-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> only a slim chance that Port will win

[24-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I wish everyone a happy friday. Any fry up's on bbq?

[24-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Happy Friday üòÉ

[24-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Happy friday to everyone

[24-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I might do a BBq tomorrow

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> didn't have time tonight

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I usually do a BBQ on the weekend

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not sure what I'll cook yet

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but I love the BBQ

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I probably use it twice a week in summer

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but it's not as nice in winter when it's freezing and dark by the time dinner rolls around

[24-Aug-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> summer is perfect for BBQ

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's good because it doesn't heat the house up

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> whereas if I use the oven it heats the house up which is alreayd very hot in summer

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but anyways, a BBQ is worth it , even if it does heat the house up a lot

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> you have to do what you have to do

[24-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a mans gotta BBQ what a mans gotta BBQ

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I love a good bbq

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I have a gas BBQ outside

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but it's connected to mains GAS

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so I never havce to stuff around with gas bottles

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've done that before

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I did some ribs in my smokers a few weeks back

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and it sucks big time changing gas bottles

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I love ribs

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> my favourite

[24-Aug-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm not good at BBQ them though

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I got a stick burner

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I usually burn them

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they need a slow cook

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a "stick burner"

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Low and sliw

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Slow

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like a fire pit?

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, slowwwww for ribs

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that's the secret to keep them tender

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Nah barrel with side fire box

[24-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> my gas BBQ is too quick

[24-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> I set aside a whole day for bbq
