[dscrdeql] <miles> @c2k - you were taking about ways to spread awareness of EQLI in KMD eco system - one thought i had was around the Rewards for MasterNode being implemented in Crypto Conditions? This must make EQLI one of the earliest adopters of actual use cases on the new Crypto Condition which KMD are promiting heavily

[21-Sep-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> maybe an oppotunity to get the EQLI name at the forefront of that

[21-Sep-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> i just voted for kmd! hopefully we can win! 😃 🎉

[21-Sep-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Looks like Collingwood in front

[21-Sep-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Very surprising

[21-Sep-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> well done @MassimoStyle

[21-Sep-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> 😃

[21-Sep-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good point @miles

[21-Sep-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think cowboy mentioned it in his last medium article

[21-Sep-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> we are all trying to get the word out any way we can
thats why im trying to get othre people involved wth retweets etc
because this project is still flying way below the radar

[21-Sep-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> CC is potentially huge - and as most things in the KMD eco system - it gives the people using the platform the chance to show what KMD and their own projects can do

[21-Sep-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I just noticed that there is a 2M EQLI buy wall at 100 sats, that won’t be fun to break through at our current volume

[21-Sep-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> worth mentioning to Cowboy when he is online later - same thing with the Pungo wallet - positioning EQLI  nicely within the eco system

[21-Sep-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> yup!! 100 sats will be a nice problem to start solving though - maybe the sale of house 1 and a few of cowboy's cars might do it 😃

[21-Sep-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Congrats @miles , a house sale will definitely do it, we need to keep a sell wall built to support the price as it rises too though

[21-Sep-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> congrats on your level up @miles

[21-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> thanks guys - @Zach  - yup - totally agree

[21-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hi there  @c2k

[21-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Your looking busy

[21-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Zach yes I noticed that buy wall....maybe it'll be removed as the price rises.

[21-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nevermind💕> Can I ask help ?

[21-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've seen a lot of walls get removed

[21-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If the order owner thinks price will go up a lot further then they may remove it...be dumb not to

[21-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @nevermind💕 what help?

[21-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Assuming the owner is paying attention as the price rises

[21-Sep-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> of course @nevermind💕 what do you need?

[21-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if someone isnt available here you can DM a moderator or helper whenever you want

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Collingwood winning with triple figures will be sweet.

[21-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I can't believe I actually wanted Collingwood to win

[21-Sep-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i actually supported collingwood lol

[21-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and people say miracles don't happen 😂

[21-Sep-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> the power of change in anyone @Combat Wombat 😂 i used to live in Aus for 10yrs so know how strong the AFL fans are!!!

[21-Sep-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @miles i normally dislike collingwood lol well its more the fans and eddie but i really wanted them to win today good on them

[21-Sep-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i hope melbourne can some how take home the flag that would be nice

[21-Sep-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> fingers crossed!

[21-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @c2k - not sure if you saw - but Ben just posted the first ecosystem spotlight in the KMD announcements channel on Versus..... sounds like they are doing a series

[21-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i just DM'd him to do it for EQLI

[21-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> glad we are thinking on the same wavelength

[21-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @miles

[21-Sep-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> you are on it 😃

[21-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> what i actually like about EQLI - is it is not all about the crypto tech...... i think it would make a really good compliment to other eco system stories such as Versus, OOT, Zilla etc

[21-Sep-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure
