[11-Oct-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> You can use the agama wallet.

[11-Oct-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Can download it from the komodo website

[11-Oct-18 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ]> @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ i have. but so many options to set. phuuu... i have scare to do what wrong.

[11-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Agama is simple...just "Activate"  coin and choose Equaliser from dropdown list

[11-Oct-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ]> but eqli is not a pos coin. right?

[11-Oct-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Doesn't matter...just use agama, EQLI is a coin based on the komodo blockchain

[11-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> i hadn't used agama before using equaliser

[11-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think agama is a good wallet

[11-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> me too, feature rich. slight learning curve, felt a little overwhelming for me at first but got around it in no time.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> compared to qt core wallets that many coins use

[11-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ]> any mining guide ?

[11-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ]> and why not a own wallet?

[11-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> hi

[11-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ] kmd wallet supports eqli i think

[11-Oct-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> The agama wallet is the kmd wallet...yes it does support all coins based on the komodo blockchain

[11-Oct-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> @Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ] it's not worth mining as the block reward is like 0.0001 EQLI

[11-Oct-18 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Highest reward i ever got was about 0.00075. I'm sure others can contest to this.

[11-Oct-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Good morning everyone!

[11-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> @NWhiskeyTango The thing about mining EQL is it is to help keep the blockchain moving. The reward is transaction fees, so it isn't going to be super high. Without miners the blockchain stops. I strongly believe in this project, so if I had a miner I am sure I would aim it on EQL to help out with the hash rate.

[11-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ]> damn. how long goes transfers from bot here to komodo wallet? think its work not. when i goe to explrer and serach the tx, i se no result.... @CowboyCrypto- Founder  can you help me?

[11-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I stepped away for a bit for a late dinner. thank you @Linkara6669-Mod  We have the plans for a rewards system for having eqli. As we have been concentrating alot on progressing the build which in turn will be fuel for the marketing machine as a wise community member has said. The entire cryptoverse is really quiet and many this year have exited crypto all together however, I believe soon, many will flood back in. There are people in other communities still mining coins with asic's at little to no profit to accumulate like people mined bitcoin back in the day when it was worthless and no one knew about it. Good things take time and what we are building is not just a crypto currency but a movement to give affordable housing and as soon as humanly possible when we have the means is charitable efforts. unfortunately there will still be people that just want to make a quick buck and I have no respect for such people

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> open your wallet in native mode and sync to 100% and let me know what the result is?

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> plus you should be using #support thanks ðŸ™‚ ðŸ‘Œ âœŒ

[11-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> @linkara6669 lol i know what mining is, i am a miner. I mine for profits. Mining EQLI is not profitable. But since you are interested in mining let me help you. All you need is a computer and wallet address to mine. Do you have a computer with a wallet on it?

[11-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Wait a minute, your the dev tipsey mod? Why do you not know this already?

[11-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Depends on what coin you want to mine, it is impossible these days with a standard CPU or the best GPU if you are talking bitcoin, one day it was possible but not any more . that's what an asic is for

[11-Oct-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Im not dev

[11-Oct-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> you said "dev tipsy mod"

[11-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Are we on the same page? LOL ðŸ˜†

[11-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> maybe we both need to catch up on some kind of sleep haha

[11-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I cant share screen shot lol...nevermind the tipsey fev part i guess.

[11-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Dev*

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> To sum it up, @Thuerlich[ Swiss ðŸ˜ˆ TTC ] asked if EQLI was minable. I said it is, but not worth it. @linkara6669 said mining secures the blockchain, and would mine eqli if he/she could. I THEN continued to explain anyone can mine it with any computer and a wallet. But, from a miners perspective, i'd simple mine something profitable.

[11-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> if you have costs and rely on it for a living

[11-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I cant even use asic's because South Australia is one of the most expensive energy prices in the world

[11-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> The whole point of mining rewards is to encentivise miners to "secure the network". I could mine 1 eqli in 3 days and it'll be worth 0.001 USD. OR, i could mine anything else and make at least 0.50 USD a day. If i wanted EQLI, then trading options are available, in the same day i would have 1,000 times more EQLI mining ANYTHING else. Any other factor you try to throw at this equation, this is the best way for a miner to gain EQLI hands down.

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> So to my original statement, mining EQLI is not worth it. ESPECIALLY factoring in energy prices.

[11-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not for profit but if it does help secure the network and you already leave the pc on why not

[11-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but yeah agree for profit def not worth it

[11-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> better to collect a few aluminium cans lol

[11-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Lol

[11-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> tango i don't think anyone listened to me about exrates in the other discord

[11-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> :facepalm:

[11-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Sorry i am not trying to stir the pot. Just saying i am miner, and as a miner, i wouldnt recommend it. But if you want to try it im all for helping especially helping people that are new and want to learn something. Im all for humanity's evolution lol...maybe to far, but ya.

[11-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i dont think anyone disagree with you about mining eqli for profit

[11-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well no one should lol

[11-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i don't know nothing about mining but i think linkara is just saying he would do it to help support the network

[11-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if it can be done with a pc seeing as i leave it on for staking i would prob do it as well if needed

[11-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> @CombatWombat i dont even remember where we were at to be honest but ya, some people just do whatever they want. I dunno man, times are tough, i tjink exrates is cheap listing so thats why, but i dunno

[11-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> many conversations around the web Ive seen through out the year talk about people shutting down miners until profitable again. 2018 has sucked for crypto, but global markets are spattering, I can see anothe goldrush into crypto again soon

[11-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Oh believe me i am eye to eye with you on that.

[11-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im waiting lol

[11-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> what kind of listing fees have you seen for exrates from others?

[11-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> But it is specualtion ðŸ”®

[11-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I have not seen the fees that was just a guess. Project was set on putting in for a listing on exrates and we tried to warn them about exrates

[11-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well if we hit a good bull run ill be taking profits and buying some gold

[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Crypto boom boom soon...but i am also willing to bet it is another long haul like 2013/14

[11-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Excessive loans and mortgages especially in australia which the government has turned a blind eye and in my opinion is because it was a way for them to QE as loans add to broad money supply

[11-Oct-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Big no no. Our housing market took everyone down in 2006. US banks, GM...government was throwing money at everyone to save their asses...now China owns us lol
