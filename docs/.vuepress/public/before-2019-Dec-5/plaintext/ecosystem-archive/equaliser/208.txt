[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So every 1000 blocks 1 coin is created

[27-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Plus there were approx. ten created for testing.

[27-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are looking ahead. Ive done the math and will do it 1000 times to make sure it‚Äôs right but if we launch with the figures I‚Äôm thinking we will have enough inventory to pay our rewards out for 10 years

[27-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> The potential upside is huge in any case

[27-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how many coins were sold during ico?

[27-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Approx 49 million, including presales. Dumper cant do math.

[27-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and what happens with the coins that were not sold?

[27-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just north of 49

[27-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The unsold coins are locked

[27-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They are currently in our custody, but once crypto conditions are ready, they will be locked under contract

[27-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so thats about 300 mil coins?

[27-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And distributed as the reward fund

[27-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so you could say circulating supply is about 200 mil?

[27-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ?

[27-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Give me 5 min

[27-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to be at my desk lol

[27-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well there was 350 mil for sale lets say 50 mil sold

[27-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> that leaves 300 mil locked up

[27-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> is that right?

[27-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Correct.

[27-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so for the mean time our circulating supply is about 200 mil?

[27-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> about. We have the majority set aside to be locked in contract as soon as the CC stuff is tested. We will release a small amount periodically, but most will be locked up for rewards and masternodes. Currently circulating about 55 million.

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The remainder in reserve.

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No because those coins are also going to be contractually locked

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> circulating supply is about 55 mil and people or person dumping at these prices

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yeah. Insane, right?

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> gets stranger and stranger

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Funds allocated for the team won‚Äôt be released for a while

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> insane is one way you can put it

[27-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs nuts.

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm off to an appointment, but will be back in about an hour and a half.

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> how many do u think this person/entity has sold down here so far? best approximation

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol you should have seen the nice letter I wrote exrates üòÇ

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> cya biomech

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well millions

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 8 millionish.

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 6.5-8

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> unless other people started dumping as well

[27-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its mind boggling lol

[27-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A huge loss. Doesn't make sense, unless they were trying to panic us into dumping the bulk. If that was their gamble, They're toast üòà

[27-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If kmd weren‚Äôt so low we would just buy them out and leave em behind

[27-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so more than 10% of the issue. crazy

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> possibly as much as 20%

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And the big presale holders are still holding them?

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah.

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So must be someone that bought them through bdex?

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Has to be

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> how much is the exrates wallet hodling?

[27-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> holding*

[27-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not sure exactly

[27-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I only sent them 100 test coins

[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> crossref this list with the presale whales and team funds

[27-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> is it possible its someone trying to arb from bdex to exrates. buying them flat to cheaper on bdex and flipping them on exrates?

[27-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> arbitration would go the other way around

[27-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> sell higher on barterdex/ buy cheap on exrates

[27-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> dopesnt have to be. can be buy cheap anywhere and sell higher anywhere else

[27-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> exrates currently cheapest place to buy

[27-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> quick Q regarding exrates, any account verification needed to be able to withdraw?

[27-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> dont see anything, but just making sure

[27-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My initial though was it was the exchange playing games

[27-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No verification required

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Cryptoon nope just make sure you set up a finance password as well

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> finance password?

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Password to withdraws

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah its pretty much a withdraw password

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but called a finance password üòÇ

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> ok weird

[27-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah the way they word things is weird

[27-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> you don't depost funds onto exrates you refill lol

[27-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and you don't withdraw you output them hahaha

[27-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> From my conversations with them, they are upgrading servers and revamping the system

[27-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thinking out loud here...wonder if exrates buying on bdex and selling at a loss on its CEX just so it shows high volume and attracts other users? trying to move up in the CEX ranks, knowing that the incremental loss of selling EQL at a loss will be offset in other ways

[27-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I heard aug 2 being their goal to have it all integrated

[27-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Believe me I‚Äôve played all these scenarios out in my head and all I can come up with is it doesn‚Äôt matter. We will have to clear these orders and build support over the next month

[27-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep

[27-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ya i guess no need to be distracted by this

[27-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you have a vision and thats it

[27-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good to hear

[27-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> for the mean time if you want some cheap eqli you know where to go

[27-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have a plan. Just will take some time and this is only a hurdle

[27-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve been up against much worse in this space as a team member lol

[27-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Try being sales director for litecoin cash when Charlie lee, fluffypony and whale panda all are calling the project a scam.

[27-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lolol
