[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but i doubt i got hacked

[22-Sep-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but was a good time to change passwords anyway lol

[22-Sep-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> how you doing jelly?

[22-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have my thoughts on the situation

[22-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But we will get it figured out one way or the other

[22-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üëå

[22-Sep-18 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> cant keep us down

[22-Sep-18 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I had 490k on there

[22-Sep-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah sucks

[22-Sep-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> anyone else other then us three?

[22-Sep-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hopefully that was it

[22-Sep-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My gf is ok she has a good amount too

[22-Sep-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The rest of the team is good

[22-Sep-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> what are we the only volume on the exchange that the hacker targeted eqli?

[22-Sep-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üò©

[22-Sep-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wish I had those answers

[22-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> It is extremely odd that it happened to 3 people in this group all at once basically

[22-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I have a bunch on there now but can‚Äôt do anything with it

[22-Sep-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i did see people on troll box complaining about not receiving emails for withdrawals

[22-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah i saw that as well

[22-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> anyways i should sleep night all

[22-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Have a good one

[22-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> So out of the 3 people that got hacked only Jelly had his actually withdrawn? Or did all 3 of you lose what you had on there?

[22-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gn @Combat Wombat

[22-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> been out most of the afternoon here

[22-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I lost mine

[22-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but keeping up on the convo

[22-Sep-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Wombat n jelly did too

[22-Sep-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Exrates doesn‚Äôt even have a good 2FA option.. their texting option was taking money from me every text it sent

[22-Sep-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm in process of other listings

[22-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Sucks this will most likely slow everything down, and not to mention cost however much to get listed somewhere else

[22-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just have to get very creative

[22-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I can‚Äôt touch what we have set aside. That‚Äôs for the build

[22-Sep-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Well I definitely don‚Äôt have the 3-5 BTC that it will probably take to list..

[22-Sep-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No worries, we will push forward

[22-Sep-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I haven‚Äôt been that successful yet

[22-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will come

[22-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Thanks for your perseverance Cowboy üëçüèª

[22-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have a few friends I need to contact this week

[22-Sep-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Worst case scenario is we get on a smaller exchange and work our way up

[22-Sep-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Well I am here for the long haul with you

[22-Sep-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure...we are here. any way we can help just ask

[23-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
