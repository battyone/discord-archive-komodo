[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> I'm jealous, haven't shot since college

[07-Nov-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The only time I get to shoot is on my dad's property...it's so much fun

[08-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Went n took the homie donny_crypto out. He’d never shot a gun before so it was cool to show someone the joys of slinging brass

[08-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Cool

[08-Nov-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> people keep going to my local gun range to commit suicide, sad.

[08-Nov-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> so now the guns have to be locked in a cradle before you get to fire the guns to prevent people turning it on themselves.

[08-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That’s nuts

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just beat the kids twice at cards

[08-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I never let the kids win...and they almost always beat me

[08-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'd be a hopeless gambler

[dscrdeql] <Acura> Any news about the Exchange listing on stex ?

[09-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have been emailing and messaging

[09-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> How's it going

[09-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Listing times can vary for many different coins. We will indeed share the news once listed 👌

[09-Nov-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, it's surprising how long some exchanges take to list a coin...

[09-Nov-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> One of those things, don't celebrate until it's actually listed.

[09-Nov-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm home from work, but now driving kids around

[09-Nov-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah same. But sometimes I go for a flat white with double amount of coffee shots, I don't like the milk taste but more of a milky coffee texture.

[09-Nov-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> I don't like at all... whipped cream or milk... just coffee

[09-Nov-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Nop

[09-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 100 years

[09-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Of romania 😇

[09-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> How do you mean? I see this from britannica.com "In 1859 the principalities of Walachia and Moldavia were united, and in 1877 they proclaimed their independence from the Ottoman Empire as the modern Romania."

[09-Nov-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm very curious now 😃

[09-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Welll if u look in history .... first union was in 1600

[09-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Between Moldavia, Walachia (also call the kingdom) and Transilvania

[09-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> In 1859

[09-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Was union between Moldavia and Walachia

[09-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> And Romania appear

[09-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> And on 1918 dec 1

[09-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Transilvania come and become Romania

[09-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> Also on dec 1918.... Basarabia come ( current name Republic Moldavia  with capital Chisinau ) and North Bucovina.... (this is part of Ukrainr now )

[09-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> So dec 1 ... is named the Big union

[09-Nov-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> And 1877 was a independence day from ottoman... but we weren't directly governed  by Ottoman .... we were Vasals of the Turkish empire

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Oh 1918. sounds good. I bet it is going to be a big party. the 1st of december is a saturday 😎

[09-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Do you know if there will be a countdown from the friday night leading in to the saturday like a new years eve?

[09-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Do you drink?

[09-Nov-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> lol :)))) countdown... nop ... but is a free day .... 😃  and party... concert... military ....etc

[09-Nov-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I must admit, I often respect the pride that military personnel show frequently for celebration of any country is cool. In australia it's just a job for people. There is rarely any show of military here except for remembrance day and ANZAC day. Then again, some argue that all wars are bankers wars.

[09-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> on dec 1... will be a malilty pride 😄

[09-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> a big one 😃

[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> near this arch 😄

[09-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That looks centuries old. I haven't travelled much however, when I visited Edinburgh several years ago, to see buildings older than the discovery of Australia , made me very humble.

[09-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> is a copy from from France arch from Paris... was build in 1848 😃

[09-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> but the current arch was rebuild in 1922 😃

[09-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> or something like that 😄

[09-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> don't know for sure 😄

[09-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It looks cool. To replicate that on a smaller scale could be done pretty easy.

[09-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> from my perspective and the right artists.
