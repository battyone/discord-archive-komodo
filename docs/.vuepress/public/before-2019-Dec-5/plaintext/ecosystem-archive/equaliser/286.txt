[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Kinda remind me of a few spaceship homes I've seen in Taos, NM. Dome above ground, majority of the home in ground

[10-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sounds like nice and cool in the NM heat

[10-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yea, its a bad situation @ghost . lets try to keep non EQL talk in the off-topic room tho

[10-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!üëΩ Thorth üëΩ> is this someone from team ?

[10-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> doubt it no one here would be that silly to sell so cheap

[10-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yea i doubt it too

[10-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> well i would hope not anyway

[10-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> be shooting yourself in the foot

[10-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> probably some one from the exchange who got dumped on early for real cheap trying to take profits

[10-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> when eqli gets decent volume thats when you will see huge price rises

[10-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> in the meantime the more of us who accumulate here with the intention of not selling until much higher prices, the more that helps clean out these sellers

[10-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> as soon as there is at least a draft of the first house ...

[10-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> we need to get more peoplee involved in this project

[10-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> from other discords

[10-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @c2k yeah it's not much but everything that gets rained on me here is getting held until the end of time lol

[10-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @ECA Gorillaz üëå

[10-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> have you signed up at exrates yet?

[10-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Nah I haven't I try hard not to sign up for new exchanges unless I have too, since I'm too poor to buy any EQLI and since I have no intention of selling the bit I do have...I have no reason to lol

[10-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok good point. there is no kyc tho...so they dont ask for documents or any id. very easy process

[10-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if you have any crumbs of BTC or other coins laying around a $100 equivalent can get you started very nicely in EQL.

[10-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just a thought

[10-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @c2k ahh maybe I'll check it out...I'm planning on buying some eqli in the future but right now I just got SCREWED with an $800 dollar water bill and an underground leak which could cost me a few grand...so yeah I'm out of fiat conpletely

[10-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> ouch

[10-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> It will, just gunna be a rough couple of months

[10-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i have not put fiat into cryptos for a while.. i sell and buy though been swapping things around

[10-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> just got in on komodo and yeah bought eql before

[10-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> trying to see if i can see something and buy more but im not sure

[10-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh wow...sorry to hear @ECA Gorillaz

[10-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah sucks when everything comes at once

[10-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> bills and gotta pay to fix something always sets you back

[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> What is it

[10-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> a website that shows the fair value of Komodo in the #2 position

[10-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you can sort data other ways also...but FV is key

[10-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> That's interesting

[10-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> And very true tbh

[10-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> The trick is getting there in reality

[10-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> articles are 99% opinion and people lie all too often, but numbers dont.

[10-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> It's interesting however

[10-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agreed. anyone who follows the project knows its amazing. its just the remaining 99.9% of the population that hasnt caught on yet. lol

[10-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Seems biased

[10-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im not defending it...just discovered the site. but which part do you find biased?

[10-Aug-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> What determines the fair values?

[10-Aug-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I‚Äôm not saying that it shouldn‚Äôt be there,though. Komodo is super undervalued

[10-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i agree with you...but im going to play devils advocate. what information do you have that KMD undervalued?

[10-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> The price of it vs what it has to offer

[10-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> exactly. so its price vs where value you believe KMD offers

[10-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> *what

[10-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Interesting debate going on there

[10-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the website just attached numbers to their valuation, instead of what we "see" in KMD value

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> KMD can do everything Ethereum can, and it's actually secure.

[10-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> The coinfairvalue website determines the fair value price by the amount of transactions it is making in a day and the projected amount of transactions in a day

[10-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Where is the projected amount from

[10-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> not certain, but maybe from the column "Txn 24h"

[10-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> KMD has done >66k according to the site

[10-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 5th highes behind USD EUR BTC and ETH

[10-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Many of these transactions are probably from  notarization and also claiming the 5% but it is still impressive
