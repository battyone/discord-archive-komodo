[09-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Stomach sickness?

[09-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ramen is the best thing

[09-Jul-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> really Ramen noodles?

[09-Jul-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> thats japanese isn't it?

[09-Jul-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah Asian idk where it originated from

[09-Jul-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> High sodium broth

[09-Jul-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pasta soaks up anything in your stomach

[09-Jul-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The broth restores sodium

[09-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Hi

[09-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Missed

[09-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I hate long drives

[09-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> not me

[09-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> love driving

[09-Jul-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Why am I missed rain

[09-Jul-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Long drives suck

[09-Jul-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'd rather someone else drive now

[09-Jul-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I love driving

[09-Jul-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Me to

[09-Jul-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if someone else drives you can spread out and relax

[09-Jul-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> play with mobile

[09-Jul-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> This makes no sense

[09-Jul-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Keep missing rain

[09-Jul-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sisana10> See if your active in bot commands

[09-Jul-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sisana10> Says your active.

[09-Jul-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> It's done that to me sometimes as well

[09-Jul-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I think you need a few xp as well to be eligible for rain

[09-Jul-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I think if you chart a while it'll work

[09-Jul-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Chatting in tipsy rain does not earn you XP

[09-Jul-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> So you could be active but don't have xp

[09-Jul-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> hey yall

[09-Jul-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> one of my favorite things to do honestly lol

[09-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Hmmm

[09-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> But that's weird

[09-Jul-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> @sourgenight

[09-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Dream of green candles

[09-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> And moon

[09-Jul-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> And lambo on the moon

[09-Jul-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> haha

[09-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Or maybe Tesla

[09-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Tesla probably work better on the moon

[09-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> No combustion required

[09-Jul-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Lol

[09-Jul-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> I can't believe people still think NASA actually went to the Moon

[09-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I don't believe anyone got to the moon and back again

[09-Jul-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> The whole thing was faked

[09-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Green candles in all of our hearts will come to be in our folios ðŸ˜‚

[09-Jul-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Haha..sounds good

[09-Jul-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Just what we need

[09-Jul-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Greens around

[09-Jul-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Yes. Total fake

[09-Jul-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> So they steal money from people

[09-Jul-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what green candles?

[09-Jul-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> hah...the green candles are gone now

[09-Jul-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
