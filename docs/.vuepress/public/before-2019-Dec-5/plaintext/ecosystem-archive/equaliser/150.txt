[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder I remember when i was just old enough to pay attention, they used to talk about doctors flying from all over the world to see/study kids with Lukemia because it was so rare. . now it seems 1 out of 10 or less kids are getting that sicknes

[22-Jul-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs terrible to watch your friends fall apart while dealing with it

[22-Jul-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I have a retarded question

[22-Jul-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok

[22-Jul-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> when you decide to list on an exchange, do you guys as the devs send the exchange the coins to be traded?

[22-Jul-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No

[22-Jul-18 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We send test coins to use for the wallet. In this case I sent 100

[22-Jul-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> so how can the exchange be trading in hundreds or thousands of coins if you only sent them 100

[22-Jul-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This is what we are attempting to figure out

[22-Jul-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[22-Jul-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have withdrawn all the coins we had or requested them to be

[22-Jul-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There‚Äôs a lot wrong about this scenario

[22-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòê

[22-Jul-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.00001 btc is 7 cents usd, why would anyone be selling at 2 satoshis? These are questions we are trying to get answered.

[22-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.000015 would be the lowest I‚Äôd expect ppl to dump at and that‚Äôs just early investors

[22-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No worries though we will figure it out any take appropriate action.

[22-Jul-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> exrates not loading for me, anyone else?

[22-Jul-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> im still tied up on what you said about the 100 coins . .what the hell is being traded if you already took out the 100 coins to sent them? are they just heading against the value of the btc people deposit?

[22-Jul-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> *headging

[22-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not loading for me either

[22-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm not sure. I spent .3 btc on setting buy orders and it was instantly sold into.

[22-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We didn't take out the 100. We had considerably more to build the books... and then WAY too many were being sold at ridiculous rates. Something is not right. Either something is goofy with the exchange, or some moron is dumping WAY below what they paid. The numbers don't add up.

[22-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> dont want to sound negative here but seeing as almost all reviews about this exchange are negative in some way is it possible most of the volume is fake volume

[22-Jul-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Could be

[22-Jul-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i also don't understand how no research was done on the exchange before agreeing to pay for listing

[22-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That would be my fault honestly and I‚Äôll own it

[22-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> At this point, we're trying to get it resolved. It makes no sense, though, as the exchange itself is always in the top 45 for volume. It would be killing the golden goose to cheat us. At this time, I'm certain barterdex is ok, if difficult to use. I'm not ready to endorse Exrates. Nor am I ready to call shenanigans, it could be innocent. We're looking into it. We did do quite a bit of research, and all that came up, really, was slow withdrawals. That's an annoyance more than a red flag. I'm not letting @CowboyCrypto- Founder throw himself under the bus here. He's the lead negotiator, but we all signed off on it.

[22-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I knew withdraws took a bit but I should have done more research

[22-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> many exchanges have poor reviews but are actually fine for many.

[22-Jul-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well lets see how it unfolds

[22-Jul-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Another scenario is that someone is trying to kill the coin to gain more. If people know how to read a block explorer, they know that this is unsustainable. Not that many coins in the wild to KEEP it this low.

[22-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder Have you found any positive reviews for exrates?

[22-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can't see why anyone would do that, but you never know.

[22-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I used it before early in the year and seemed fine

[22-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I will say that correspondence with exrates is great regardless

[22-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They answer my questions very promptly

[22-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I found a few reviews saying that they were ok, if a bit slow. I was unable to find ANY substantiated claim of fraud, just slow response. Which given their volume, I thought there'd be a LOT more. Both good and bad. They seemed ok.

[22-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well lets see what happens i hope withdrawals work but even if they do i won't be using this exchange again.. would rather use something like stocks.exchange lol

[22-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[22-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, we're not happy with them either. We're exploring several other options. The listing fee was reasonable, but not so cheap to raise flags. Not nuts like some exchanges and not cheap as fuck either üòõ

[22-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Y'all have held with us this long... HODL for a bit. We'll get this resolved üòÑ

[22-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> One way or the other

[22-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i'm not going any where

[22-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm already working on other exchanges

[22-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i am registered with over 20 exchanges

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Damn, I thought I was crazy at 10 üòÑ

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> out of all of those the only one I would stay away from is yobit

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> lol

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Aye.

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yobit has killed two projects I was involved in. Wouldn't touch 'em with a stolen dick.

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Another sunny day in Sydney today

[22-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Very dry...no dew on grass

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yet is still has $21,309,822 in volume

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Cold edge though

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so don't just go for volume guys

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if a coin is popular people will sign up to the exchange

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> What of Octaex

[22-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> heck Electra crashed coinsmarket because of the volume we brought there

[22-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i was on another coin which was listed in icqbase (it had less then 0.5btc volume.... that increased to over 10btc volume within a day because we were signing up to buy it)

[22-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> then the devs done something stupid and lost our trust and the exchange is back to below 1btc volume

[22-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> point i am making is.. if people believe in a project they will sign up to an exchange with low volume

[23-Jul-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> well, we're not intending to do anything stupid, except maybe get wasted after we build our first house üòÑ

[23-Jul-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
