[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Be good for next Xmas 2019 to  setup EQLI xmas gift cards.....or maybe pongo wallets can do that.

[22-Nov-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Good chance to give a great gift of EQLI to that special HODLer for XMAS

[22-Nov-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pungo wallet is pretty cool

[22-Nov-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Pungo wallet is nice. Its in development mode on android so dont use with funds just yet.

[22-Nov-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I've seen some cryptos partnering with WhopperCrypto that provide cards with a certain cryptocurrency on it. A bit like a glorified paper wallet with a cool design on it.

[22-Nov-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> You wouldn't bother putting a large amount in it though if you couldn't stake it or get masternode rewards with it.

[22-Nov-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm going for masternode rewards ðŸ˜„

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm just gonna try and leave crypto alone for a few day's and see how it goes. Don't think I can do it but I can try ðŸ˜‚

[22-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Do you know how long does it take to have our EQLI in Blockfolio what are the requirements?

[22-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> No I don't know

[22-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I've never used blockfolio

[22-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @SwimedDragon it's hard to give up crypto, I've never been successful

[22-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> What about delta ???

[22-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Coins like pirate and chainzilla are much younger and they have their information probidade there already

[22-Nov-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Most ppl in Australia don't eat turkey much...when I was a kid we had it a lot, but now ppl just seen to go for chicken

[22-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Turkey has a distinctive taste though that chicken doesn't come close to
