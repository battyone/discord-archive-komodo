[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i don't really follow much ta apart from support and resistance levels

[24-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gotcha. its what i do all day so...

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i do see all the good news coming out and would find it strange if we don't see higher prices

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> job hazard

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well i tried looking at ta but almost every ta person I looked at was full of it and kept getting it wrong and changing their minds every 10 seconds

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> telling people the obvious

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> noobs trying to read charts

[24-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but it seems to work for some people

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but blinded by their obsession with "when moon"

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> btc was supposed to dip to 5.4k

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> or 5.2

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> or 5

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> voodoo is difficult.

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but they seemed to be the magic numbers for many

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I mean... TA, yeah, that's it. TA.

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and I truly believe if people didn't follow these guys always waiting for the magic 5k number btc would of broke resistance a while ago

[24-Jul-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[24-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive been doing ta for 20 yrs. gets disparaged a lot but its more about repetitive cycles that are found in nature (ie Fibonacci) and behavior psychology than anything else

Fibonacci number
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

  
    
      
        1
        ,

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I get it, but it's still completely beyond me. Seems like voodoo.

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Which is also based on natural cycles...

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üò´ lol

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the problem is crypto market is not like other markets

[24-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the volume isn't there and its more volatile then others

[24-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Biomech also calling something voodoo because you don't understand it isn't the right way to go... TA def works in the correct markets if things go right

[24-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but with cryptos I don't think so... because the market is still small all it takes is a few whales to buy or sell and it destroys all ta

[24-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats my opinion on it anyway

[24-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the manipulation is yuuuuugggggggeeeeeeeeee

[24-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hahaha

[24-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i have seem some very good calls based on ta

[24-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so im not going to reject it completely but for me I think cryptos is a much harder market to get it right in

[24-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and im more into fa

[24-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe thats because i prefer to hodl lol

[24-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but if ta works for you.. keep going üëå

[24-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm not rejecting it, I just can't do it and when people try to explain it to me, it makes less sense üòÑ

[24-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The voodoo thing is just humour. I actually follow Omkar Godbole, because he explains his analysis in a manner that I can follow, but I can't figure out how he gets it. He's usually pretty spot on.

[24-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha fair enough

[24-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I hodl'ed since april 2017. the current paradigm fiat system is dead and its like a weekend at burnie's

[24-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I get a little nuts about things I can't grasp. I'm intelligent,  so it should be something I can grok. But TA just escapes me no matter how much I stare at the charts. So, I have to laugh at it or scream.

[24-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> The more I learn the more stupid I realize I am üòÇ

[24-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Never stupid

[24-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏> may be silly but not stupid lol

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha well the more i learn the more i realize I didn't know that much? better? lol

[24-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> weekend at burnies lol classic

[24-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏> smarter man than me, but thats not very hard

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You're smarter than the majority for learning

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nah the point I am getting at is once we think we are smart that's when we become silly.. always more to learn and the more you learn the more you understand that you were never really that smart

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> once you think you know it all which seems to be most people these days you block off your mind and become an ignorant fool

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> oh and im not talking about anyone in here

[24-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> im just speaking generally

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> don't take it the wrong way please üëç

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> we are always learning. no one is smart, it's just a construct or definition that we accept in general

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but I know everything

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòÇ

[24-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I want one of my friends to change their name to everything

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so then I can really say I know everything

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Information is conveyed and received differently by everyone

[24-Jul-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats true

[24-Jul-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think keeping an open mind is beneficial

[24-Jul-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The more you learn, the more there is to know. And my brain is NOT as fast as it was. It's frustrating, but also kind of cool.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not the slowing down part.

[24-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> we all gotta slow down

[24-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not much we can do about that

[24-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's the quality of information as you get older, not the quantity. We may think we forget stuff but it would seem that useless information is purged from the mind in older age

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Agree

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> sup @Cryptoon going well?

[24-Jul-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Very good thanks, you?

[24-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> how is the quest for land going in PR?

[24-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not bad, as you may know we were in PR in may. We met an agent that showed us some places and we factor in and consider accessibility for equipment and the land size. It really is intensive in finding land or let alone property.

[24-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Aha I thought you were there now as well?

[24-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
