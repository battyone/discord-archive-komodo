But would it be able to check let s say emc2 / zcash / btc / eth / snowgem (took em out of my imagination)

[24-Oct-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
these are things i run into with HushList and also gui wallet code that supports multiple coins

[24-Oct-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, we could support any coin, just need to have the regexes for each coin 😃

[24-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hehe. So... basically I feared that I had to code it myself. Seems like a divine intervention ^^

[24-Oct-18 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have some of this code written, from my hushlist and hush-ng code that supports multiple coins

[24-Oct-18 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you care what language the API is written in? What if it's a "microservice" and a little app, where all it does is validate addresses + chains?

[24-Oct-18 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
it needs to run locally on each jawarrr server, to be trusted. But it could be it's own little app

[24-Oct-18 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
i wouldn't trust a remote server to validate addresses for my jawarrr server, for instance

[24-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think @adstrakt will use node.js, so the limitation will be on their side

[24-Oct-18 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
microservice architecture, man 😃

[24-Oct-18 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah run it locally on the webserver

[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've inherited nodeJS code that I maintain, but it's not quite my favorite

[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tbh I have an idea for a secure infrastructure scheme, and I think we ll manage to run the minimal things on the  public side.

[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
if I have a simple one-file script that spins up an embedded webserver and answers requests on localhost, it can be integrated easily

[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
But for example if it runs as standalone on a vps it could be even more secure

[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[24-Oct-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i assume something like nginx or something is routing requests from the big bad internet

[24-Oct-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
and we can route to a specific localhost port for a certain file path

[24-Oct-18 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am a big fan of nginx

[24-Oct-18 04:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hehe. Oldschool apache here. Only used nginx for rtorrents microprojects back in the day ^^

[24-Oct-18 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
putting nginx in front of apache will give orders of magnitude improvements in some areas

[24-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw I will assume that this problem is not a problem anymore if you re confident about it

[24-Oct-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
apache holds onto database connections forever, because they are so slow to start and stop

[24-Oct-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i wouldn't worry about address validation, worry about more important stuff

[24-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
My only requirement is to use mysql.

[24-Oct-18 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
there will be no DB

(For the main project)

[24-Oct-18 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
ah, well that is your call

[24-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
For other things i mostly use sqlite or jsons

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i worked at a link shortening company, our apache mysql DB connection count would hover at 700

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then traffic spikes would make our DB connections go insane and bring down the system

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
moving nginx in front of the apache mod_perls, our db connection count went down to 40

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
And btw about stability of the app. I think i ll just use a custom version of lazynode to handle coins. So that in case a coin daemon is down it is detected and the json used to select available coins will autorefresh

[24-Oct-18 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
because nginx is so fucking fast

[24-Oct-18 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure we will have these scalablity concerns, but it's good to know

[24-Oct-18 04:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
definitely don't serve static content with apache

[24-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I made the stats script for scaling I had issues with mysql... then I learned a few tweaks and it worked like a charm. I don t see jawarrr as a microtrading service so machinegun request won t happen

[24-Oct-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
the simplest thing is to serve all static with nginx, proxy everything else to apache. you will get a huge perf boost, will be able to use smaller servers/etc

[24-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Biggest limitation is the use of daemons and pure cli

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
If i want to include eth that s a huuuuuge hard drive thatwe ll need

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
starting apache to serve a favicon.ico is like using a 747 to go across the street

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha ;D

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
ETH is at 700GB  or so now

[24-Oct-18 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
if it ever syncs, lol

[24-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not 1tb+ ?

[24-Oct-18 04:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
i heard just under 700gb recently, could be wrong. they don't update the stats anymore

[24-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok.

[24-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe am mistaken but does having eth fully synced mean that we can also query erc tokens ?

Dwy these are the droid (makers) you are looking for.

Yeah. Nice to see him here

[24-Oct-18 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I m with my wife atm..will be here tomorrow and friday (the whole day for both). My next step has been readjusted. I feel we would be far more productive and efficient if we put the flow chart on the paper and describe extensively what happens at each step. That will be profitable to any 3rd party that would like to join just because it will explain how to integrate in the different applications : web is one, bot is another. Once this is done (i won t lose time to get things graphically attractive, the purpose is only to be able to have a clear view on how things work and what path the users shall follow depending on each status of the trade)

[24-Oct-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once it s done i ll just resume my work on the ways I have to make every single step standalone and runnable concurrently)

[24-Oct-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Another crazy thinking theory is that I think if the bot can shape data received as users could be identified (if on non private mode) it can also sort of remember trade to give stats and rankings

[24-Oct-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Still relying on api to query the db)

couldn t do something pretty

[25-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
but it will basically detail all steps status, and everything needed (not extensively yet), for UI devs and bot dev @sclear @adstrakt

[25-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can remove colors, I m colorblind so I only distinguish pink pretty good lol, unfortunately I put pink everywhere... so I changed a little

[25-Oct-18 03:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll get some sleep, see you later. Obviously I had to change some status codes, and I didn t detail the cancellation and refunding logic yet

[25-Oct-18 03:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
(it is already done on bash side but I will break every single part to be able to have very precise status that will make requests more db friendly and less costly)

[25-Oct-18 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
the preview won t give much info, just get the image on a widescreen and cry 😄

[25-Oct-18 03:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
tried to give an idea of both the path and what for example would be the steps for 3rd party wanting to bridge into it

[25-Oct-18 03:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
tomorrow I'll setup a pad for functionalities to include / suggest, so likely anyone will be able to participate

[25-Oct-18 03:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
(tomorrow is in fact today... :D)

[25-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
as it may not be very digest, I can explain each single step of this image while doing a swap, if needed.

[25-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
for security purposes I didn t include details about infrastructure, or security, they will be done on a private sheet

[25-Oct-18 03:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
I expect, and I really hope :D, that some notary buddies will pentest us so I won't share the details of how I see servers / services communicate, or any backup solution. BTW I think every single configuration / install steps should be included on a global howto for better maintenance.

[25-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
didn't think about a specific interface for a potential support team / member that would like to manage it, maybe that would be a good idea, obviously not allowing to gather any secure info, but just for example to show a page printing trades stuck by status. Some can be handled automatically, but some other, that should... never happen, would need investigation. I'm trying to reduce it to the maximum giving "exit points" in case of stuck trade, depending on the status it may involve a specific modal for whatever side needs to ask for a refund (if the trade is stuck). About a way to identify and authorize it, we'll have 2 cases : There was a problem during the sending of any side : It will be handled via cancel module, as nothing has been spent, a refund is one of the way to proceed.

The ETH blockchain is not that big, Parity mainnet node uses 92Gb now.

oO

[25-Oct-18 11:27 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also it has fancy features like warp sync which allows to sync blockchain really fast.

started to rewrite each step to include new status codes, and have a true logfile 😃

@sclear @adstrakt feel free to ask questions directly on the channel, as it is private I don't expect any leak, most of people here are developpers or very trusted members / friends

[25-Oct-18 06:00 PM] adstrakt#8509
Been going over the files you sent @Deleted User with my colleague today. We are going to propose a detailed workflow outline of all the sections that we would build. Just get everything on paper so we can all agree or discuss before we get started. We also have a few suggestions and ideas that could be implemented.

[25-Oct-18 06:03 PM] adstrakt#8509
We are really excited to be part of this and we really think we can make something amazing here. We should have the outline document ready for you by Saturday.

[25-Oct-18 06:11 PM] adstrakt#8509
Not sure if this was talked about before. But we think it would be great and simple idea to add an "Invite to OCT Trade Button" once you have initiated an order that will send out a invite link by email or social network to complete the trade.

We are really brainstorming some simple ideas that will make everything really easy for the user. Small details such as tooltips and animated notifications that tell the user what is happening without them having to do too much.

Any idea that could make ux better and that can facilitate user adoption will be nice :)

[25-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know that it s not sexy at all but you ll be able to understand each specific step / status with the previous link posted. It is obviously subject to modifications.

[25-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
A perfect trade can be processes with minimal user knowledge / actions. Most of the hard work is to handle internal stuff to be able to maintain every case as "expected"

[25-Oct-18 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
@adstrakt yeah like a share this. Tbh I didn t even thought about this because this would break anonimity. But it would be stupid to narrow possibilities

[25-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The sheet above only take into account a few cases and is only here to help potential 3rd party that would like to bridge on our solution understand how they may integrate things
