[23-Oct-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[23-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[23-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
you have action buttons

[23-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
on the right

[23-Oct-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
that will open a window to input the addresses you want to receive your part of the trade on

[23-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jorian  thanks !

[23-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 your addresses were detected

[23-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can refresh

[23-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
it will give you the command to send

[23-Oct-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
my part is sent

[23-Oct-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
didn't need to refresh, but the whole mouse thing needs help

[23-Oct-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah I handle most of the stuff via js atm, hopefully a UI/UX pro will reshape it

[23-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
KMD tx seen

[23-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[23-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000

step 10

[23-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
click on the eye you should see the trade

[23-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
every side

[23-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's a little glitchy as far as UX, but works pretty well 游녨游낖

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
hehe

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
in the future i ll add open orders

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
public ones

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
the receiver will just have to catch the trade he wants

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
basically you ll be able to handle your WTS WTB directly on it

[23-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
not relying on chat spamming 游땏

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but chat spamming is fun :abusedsmily:

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah 游땏

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
but scams are not :p

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
true

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I worked mostly on the cancel order routine today

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
basically the amount doen not match : the order is stuck

[23-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
then if one side cancels

[23-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
funds are sent back to refund addresses

[23-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
if the amount is done via multi tx, it handles it too

[23-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if you mistakenly sent twice

[23-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
the cancellation job stop after 2 days or when you say : Ok i ve been refunded

[23-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
the global time of 1 full routine is approx 50 sec, I ll parallelize it, afterwards ^^

[23-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
will reduce to approx 10 sec

[23-Oct-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
The key to remember is that once you get it where you think it should be, then step back and run through it as if you've never seen/used it before 
That usually helps towards making it something that folks are likely to use (imo, BarterDEX and HyperDEX lack of use has as much to do with UX as it does liquidity issues)

[23-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[23-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the UI/UX here is important

[23-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
but people that looked at it were lost, so I basically added tons of JS to allow only inputs where I want em to be

[23-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but as far as working flow, I think you've got it good 游녨游낖

[23-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s the primary goal atm

[23-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
thanks for your time, and the 0.99995 kmd 游땏

[23-Oct-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
lol I think I can spare 1 KMD w/out "breaking the bank" :trollface:

[23-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
i ll let it running, cancellation tasks are not launched, I think I need to check every single case, like multisent, cancellation before a block happened. The logic stating that the sending of the shares takes into account the DB : uses the trade values. But in case of emergency, even if the trade is done, just with a flag to 1 you can ask to be refunded automatically

[23-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
(basically I just have to add a but for "support - refund me", the scripts are ready)

[23-Oct-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

[23-Oct-18 04:25 PM] adstrakt#8509
Ok so basically we would provide a brand new design and working UI.

[23-Oct-18 04:25 PM] adstrakt#8509
the frontend for the app.

[23-Oct-18 04:25 PM] adstrakt#8509
right ?

[23-Oct-18 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I developped the backend. If you handle the UI i will be able to focus on serverside

[23-Oct-18 04:27 PM] adstrakt#8509
Ok great. Can you give me some basic info on the brand.

[23-Oct-18 04:27 PM] adstrakt#8509
