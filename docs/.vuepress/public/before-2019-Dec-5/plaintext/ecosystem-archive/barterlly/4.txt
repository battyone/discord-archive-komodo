But to me it s the same for external coins adopting dpow : they trust us so this can be seen as another service we can offer em. As the cost of dpow may be increased in the future I think this type of tool should be seen as something that is bundled

And tbh not knowing yet if it will be run by me or a 3rd party or officially by kmd team if they like it, it s too early for those  things. Tech first :D

will virustotal maybe work?

0.1% flat fee seems reasonable to me.  

1,000 trading volume = $1

[22-Oct-18 07:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
1,000,000 trading voume = 1,000 - a fair fee for the work required to create and maintain it.... If youre talking about outside coins.

[22-Oct-18 08:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
they were interested in working on the ui once there is a working tech

[22-Oct-18 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
The tech is not an issue at this stage

[22-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not a marketmaker edition for  first version

[22-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is really a need for something right now I believe

[22-Oct-18 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I may contact him yeah :)

[22-Oct-18 08:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

[22-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
A quote ?

[22-Oct-18 08:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
jawarr isn't much complex from design point of view, it's only a few pages but need to be done right

[22-Oct-18 08:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I mean the ui, not the tech!

[22-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh ok. Understood, the quote sorry am not native speaker.

[22-Oct-18 08:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

[22-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I totally agree with you

[22-Oct-18 08:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I see, it's easy to read french for me but I don't understand a word when spoken

[22-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even the graphics used are a problem cause they are copyrighted atm so I must purchase or i even thought about contacting an arrist to have very good design

[22-Oct-18 08:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this seem the right job for him

[22-Oct-18 09:00 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

Hell yeah :)

[22-Oct-18 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact I built the system part to be able to separate each steps. That mrans i just have to replace the actual cli version of senddeal.sh by a version that integrates it with marketmaker and it will work the same exact way

[22-Oct-18 09:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't understand that part üòõ but whatever works is ok

[22-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[22-Oct-18 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw just passed the domain on 443 auto

[23-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
on the autocancel part atm, I'm handling the cases where the amount is not valid, where the amount is exactly the good one, where the amount is done via multiple tx, for example if the user just sends twice, each time the ordercancel is triggered, if there is a tx to refund, it will increase the sum refunded

If we have the case for example of a user sending double tx, and the 1st is validated and processed for a refund while the  2nd is still not confirmed, the parser will see it and see that a refund of the first part have already been sent, so the next time it will launch a refund, it will deduct the first refund tx

[23-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
that allows to be able to claim a refund even if the trade was done good

[23-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
but a user just decides to send again, he will be able to claim the not needed tx

[23-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will ensure no funds stay for infinite time, and the user can claim his generated address balance

[23-Oct-18 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok, that part works for now

[23-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
even if the UI changes, I ll integrate the logic on the existing webpage, that will allow me to test it directly via GUI

[23-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
the same rule applies on the other side : a user that has been refunded can just say : Ok, refund is done, stop trying to find hypothetical funds, when both have either been refunded or in case of no refund (for the side that didn't send anything).

 The refund logic stops when those conditions apply : trade done // one side refunded the other side said he won t need a refund // both refunded // in case one side is refunded and the other just let the trade die, the refunding search only lasts 2 days

[23-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
most of cancellation logic implemented, I ll start testing it, if there are volunteers... feel free to contact me !
