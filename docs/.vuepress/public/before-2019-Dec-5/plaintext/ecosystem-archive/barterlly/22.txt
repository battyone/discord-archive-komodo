as the latestt major update was working like a charm

[15-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
will communicate on reopening, I just have to finish something first, expect a reopen in the coming days

[15-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll explain in a few minutes

[15-Jun-19 12:38 AM] bishop#9773
That would explain it, thanks

[15-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
finishing current task

[15-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'llbe back in approx 5 10 min

[15-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
was totally focused on alternate development to add more security with brand new tools that will help us protect trades live with some features, the goal is to make users more safe in case of chain being attacked. I needed to end the NH detection tracking tool to allow the app react dynamically in case abnormal behaviour is detected on specific chains

[15-Jun-19 12:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
It's nearly finished, and we have to integrate it to the core to add a "variance" in case any chain got attacked

[15-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
that being the 1st subject

[15-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
the second one I started was to automatically report any fork directly on the app, to prevent users from trading when i'ts a total mess in an attacked chain, adding modifier in case the chain is at risk, to prevent users from trading on potential bad chain.

[15-Jun-19 01:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Other tasks handled with NN's hat not related to Barterlly, but those days were pretty insane :). We made good progress on tortuga, and in the same time refining and revamping the gui

[15-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
all of those subject were launched to secure even more users foreseeing an upcoming  update, before the final release

[15-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
We also prepared new listings that will be available at release, won't disclose it yet, but I think people will be happy

[15-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
after the recent attack on KMD, noone can deny it : any affiliated project is at risk, we must make sure every siingle solution /safeguard is live when we wil go to release. 
User protection > all

[15-Jun-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
We could just reopen right here right now, but I really believe safeguards I have coded will be an advantage once delivered

[15-Jun-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
all new features and scripts are being fin,ished right now

[15-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I expect a reopening  at start of next week, Would love to say today.... But we want to act as professionals and kills the treats even before they can show up

[15-Jun-19 01:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
We're missing 2 or 3 core features to be able to  reopen and going for real.

[15-Jun-19 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s likely for next week, this one was really really insane.

[15-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
downtime was forced, so we just ran on security subjects that will maximize the protection of both users and the platform

[15-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
everything is already super safe, but we took that downtime as an opportunity to launch a "rush" for the next update to integrate more user guidance

[16-Jun-19 04:30 PM] QuMike#4235
hi, just created an account and verified the email, but login says account not active?

[16-Jun-19 04:30 PM] QuMike#4235
ahh just read the backlog.

[17-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
will open back today

[17-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
We are opening back the app, and will resume operations in a few minutes. We activated fees, that are set to 1% on top of transactions happening on the platform, refunds excluded.
A new coin joined the list of active tradeable coins, we're now at 4/5 of top100 CMC integrated on the platform, more to come in the following weeks :).
Some icons are not updated, and will be hotfixed in the coming days.
See you soon !

[17-Jun-19 09:56 PM] QuMike#4235
do i have to create a new user? still says account is not active

[17-Jun-19 10:21 PM] QuMike#4235

Soooo many flaky counterparties... this whole agreeing and then canceling bullshit is frustrating as all hell

[23-Jun-19 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
the reputation system will get rid of that.

[23-Jun-19 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
also, people are still testing extensively the GUI.

[23-Jun-19 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
it will tend to more reliable offers over time. We intend to list a few coins in the following weeks, each coin being a partner, hopefully promoting the platform.

[23-Jun-19 02:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Fees are not activated for a long time, and we see that day after day, more and more people test the app, with little or big amounts. Confidence will be built on a longterm basis.
Our goal is to be totally compliant, and show transparency to bring trust. One of the upcoming phase will be to release our internal bots to get live any type of offers, notably completed ones.
Basing ourselves on a ratio between cancelled / performed swaps, the Profile section and choice to share it publicly or not (users having the choice), added to an optionnal minimal ratio to accept trades, will also prevent the ping-ponging of cancelled trades.

[23-Jun-19 02:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
This is an example of what we got internally :

Transparency, and trust will make this journey exciting !

[23-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
We are also preparing templates for coins that want to market their own branded version of the app, allowing them to be independent, but still as secure as the main app. Sharing the liquidity will strengthten the overall process.

[23-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Unleashing bots, notably discord and twitter ones will also participate to bring people, coins, and communities.

[23-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Our goal is also to find partners, of all sorts, like exchanges, mining pools, or brokers, to go to the next level.

Crypto family for the win ! üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 10:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
Can someone explain to me how Barterlly works exactly? So if you generate a public offer with your refund address for the coin you're trying to sell, then add your receiving address for the coin you want to collect, how does it actually send the coin you want to sell to the person?

[26-Jun-19 10:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
Or is there a second step once the offer is accepted?

[26-Jun-19 10:59 PM] owerache#0341
Barterlly is an over the counter (OTC) cryptocurrency swap service that allows direct trading without human escrow. Let's say that Alice has 800 Ravencoin (RVN) and Bob has 450 EnJin (ENJ erc20) and they want to swap them, how can they proceed? They don't know each other. Neither can't risk to send first. There are many stories of people getting scammed while trading privately. They will have to find someone with an excellent reputation who will act as escrow. This is an inconvenient procedure that takes time, risk and high fees. Barterlly offers a fast and simple alternative: Alice can setup a private trade of 800 RVN <-> 450 ENJ and send the link to Bob. Once both sides have deposited their coins, Barterlly makes the swap (or refunds if anything goes wrong).

[26-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Alecandro#1179
perfect, thanks

Hello everyone !
We are preparing the next update, that may take a bit of time to deploy, and redirected the app / website / templates to a temporary provider. The error you will encounter is linked to HSTS and is totally normal. A fix can be done here : https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/
We processed a full refund on all assets currently listed on the platform, as it may take time, and we don't want to do anything in a rush, we prefered to get every user having still funds on the platform refunded before the downtime.
We don't give a date for reopening yet, as we will first focus on implementing everything on the new infrastructure on our dev nodes, and add every features we developped dring the past monthes.
We will also use that time to search for investors, that will help us make this journey a success. The GUI is ready to go to the next level, as the core, and we really want it to get properly done.
See you soon !

Hello there, a lot happened during the last few weeks, on the tech side we were able to finish the ERC20, and the whole codebase was refined to allow unlimited scalability and more independance on coins handling. New code also allow to handle any type of coin, be it Z, XTZ, Monero and any chain.

Unfortunately, after all revelations about tech stuff on KMD, I personally am not seen as a good relation anymore. I just hope people won't be shocked discovering all I tried to do to improve the ecosystem, and was just seen as bad actions, whereas it was done to avoid multiple mistakes that were done by the past, and that could just destroy the credibility of KMD's marvellous ideology and project.

We invested monthes of our time without any tech support or financial one, some guys helped, thanks @KomodoWorld for all you have done for us but unfortunately, we can t wait anymore for a real funding coming from the ecosystem.

[18-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
To launch the platform fully, we need to be fully compliant, but don't have the funds to achieve this. The opportunity is huge, but we can t afford costs without a proper investor.
Discussions were started monthes ago, but no clear but wait answer was given.

We have no choice but to go on totally limited version. Our code is safe, real, as people tried it and enjoyed it. Templating and API and wallet integration are really mind blowing. But we can t achieve this alone.

Whitelabel solutions were also done and could have helped KMD ecosystem a lot, notably by adding stablecoins, and involving brokers. 

Lack of financial help led us to this.
We will try to come back, and search for real investors, and will detach from KMD progressively, as it doesn't respect our fairness and transparency standards.

This is an open call : we are actively searching for a real investor that want to take advantage of our automated escrow solution.
Private tests showing our skills and the adaptability of our solution will be possible for interested investors.

Being honest is what will transform and make this journey a success.

See you soon ;)

@Deleted User I don't know what is going on behind the scenes, but would like to thank you for your contribution. I personally like barterlly and I hope you will be able to find an investor(s). DEXes are new reality and maybe BTC recovery can help you with your goal.

Sorry to hear about the service, absent flaky buyers, I've had nothing but good experiences. With that said, did you try reaching out to the guys in #venturecapital ? I'm guessing you have but if you haven't, might be worth your time.

the dev infrastructure is being set up right now, with limited assets and totally private, to reduce costs, ERC20 are a big deal, and true investors will see that it really can be a good project, especially when you see so much exchanges having issues handling Z

[19-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Paying crazy fees to little exchanges is alright, but it seems even being listed on very little exchanges don't give the guarantee to have it working properly, unfortunately. We proved it was totally functionnal with ARRR, so time will tell üôÇ

People should not forget we are only 2 on tech side, and never lost funds / had specific issues, no matter the coin or tech involved, this, to me, is more trustable than anything ^^

[19-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
the fact that we have a powerful API and can be integrated to anything / produce whitelabelled solution in minutes, be integrated to wallet without any risk, or get a mobile app / Chrome plugin like metamask will make the difference

`If you find some using the main escrow bits, you should let folks know` As in people posts offers and have no intention of sending after I accept their listed price.`

[20-Aug-19 12:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
offer and demand :(. As all works on chain, it can t be as fast as an exchange, cause the blockchain is the proof. There are systems that will allow faster trades, like prefill, but it induces being in charge of coins not ours far more time than if there is a critical mass of users using it. We prefer to let people have their coins into their own wallets :)

[20-Aug-19 03:05 AM] bishop#9773
They post the offer, I accept it and then they renig. It's the counterparty being shitty

[20-Aug-19 03:06 AM] bishop#9773
if you don't want to trade at that price, don't post an offer. Post offers you are content on filling with a counterparty. If you are too lazy to update your prices as the market changes, that's on you.

Google trends for "OTC Crypto", which refers to the large transfers for trading $Crypto 'Over The Counter' has a lot of interest based in CA. i.e. Silicon Valley.

Maybe nothing, but this could be indicative of more startups/HF's looking to divert capital to Crypto or $BTC
