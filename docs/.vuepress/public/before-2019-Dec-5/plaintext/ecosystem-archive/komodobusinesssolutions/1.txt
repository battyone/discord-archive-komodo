Wow that's a great deal.

Making some moves, requested prepaid access clarification,  ( is a members credit which is put on a voucher, as found in existing barter networks, considered prepaid access)  Lazy FinCEN, responded to my clarification request with submit your question in writing and mail it to us for an administrative ruling.  I would like to get their confirmation in writing.  Conceivably a possible scenario exists.  If a member requests a barter exchange to issue his credit in the form of a voucher, and that member sells that credit.  Is the merchant a seller of prepaid access,  is the exchange a provider of prepaid access.  Credit by definition is not prepaid  .  However the merchant is  selling that credit.  Is the merchant independently liable for sales of gift vouchers or does the exchange ,  which serves as a third party record keeper only, and issues said vouchers to the merchants at the merchants request,  held liable as well.  Existing barter networks use this mechanism to deal with non businesses , so I think it's ok but then again from what I've seen of their operations,  they may not be up to date on rules that have changed in the past couple years or so.

[17-Jul-18 02:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
In other news ,   Warehouse deal got sweeter.  2 other Komodo supporters, the warehouse owner and an anonymous whale are combining forces.  Rent to be based off percentage of miners occupying the site .  So if I have 50% of the miners I pay 1500 a month for rent.   Currently warehouse is being fixed up and we are starting to get the two main components ready,  electrical and airflow/ventilation.   In a couple weeks exterior repairs will be done then we will bust out the the fans and electrical.  Move in date set for September 1st.  Maybe in a little bit before hand .  Also have deal worked out so that from my estimated electric consumption and rent will be paid for some months in advance.    Going to announce collateralized  private loan request to team soon.  Have over 1MH already however would like to fill the space up more ,   Not to mention I think I can return their investment quickly with funds being spent all on miners and accessories and my other miners contributing to the payback.

Update: Work is continuing along at the warehouse,  moving closer to electrical and fan install .  The owner is going all out on the roof and has bought a heat reflecting sealant for the roof which should help keep costs done.Good news is that we have managed to squeeze out a quote for kWh from a broker at 5 cents for guaranteed 1 million kWh / year consumption.   As the site gets bigger we can get that number lower.    Here are some pics of the progress.

Quick update:  unfortunately we are running a week and a half or so behind ,  electric and fans should be fully ready this week then we are just waiting for the power company and inspection.  Still waiting for miners to be shipped so the delay worked out a little.

looks amazing, what kind of coins do u plan to mine?

[16-Sep-18 10:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@kimmel (Pungo.io)  Mainly Equihash algo coins  to begin with ,   Additionally have some Cryptonight and Bytom miners.   In the next few months looking at other miners as well mainly BTC/LTC  but also a couple of the smaller algorithms, decred/sia/X11 and variants  maybe even a gpu rig or two budget depending

[16-Sep-18 10:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

[16-Sep-18 11:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Between the three of us at the warehouse we are just a bit under 5 MSol .   After ROI and filling bags a bit,  the miners will form the starting businesses of the barter network.  I am still trying to figure out what is the best way to go about it legally however

[16-Sep-18 11:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Everytime I think I got it I find some obscure law that nulls it .  There is the failsafe way of doing it, and that is essentially using it as a true ledger ( meaning users have to relay their transactions to the exchange rather than have the autonomy of sending it themselves ).   The issue becomes scaling the operation at that point,  cryptoconditions could help greatly with this.  Realistically though until our tech matures a bit on all fronts ,  will have to work it manually.

[17-Sep-18 04:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161

[17-Sep-18 06:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
In short yes.  In a barter exchange goods and services are liquidity,  cryptocoins are just another good,  and it acts as like a tether without being a coin. The main value proposition of a barter exchange is as a credit network,  allowing small/new businesses and consumers to obtain a line of credit proportional to the demand for their goods and services as well as an exclusive channel for new customers.  For large companies and established businesses it provides a way of taking advantage of excess inventory and lulls in the workflow to pay for outofband essentials.  Since this is a credit network,  the creditworthiness of the participants has to be vetted or otherwise assured through collateral to provide a foundational surety of contract and minimum line of credit.  Komodo will have a preferred treatment of course as collateral,  with other self-generating coins accepted as well at a less favorable rate.  With this a feedback loop occurs:   Collateral generates coins which covers costs and provides goods to barter with.  Coins get exchanged for trade credit which then is used to get more self-generating coins (Komodo).     Regarding the credit generating process it is important to note that it is the participants of the network that generate the credit not the barter exchange itself,  the barter exchange is just the record keeper.   The power of issuance of credit is in the hands of the people.

[18-Sep-18 10:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am wondering for large mining operations if someone ever looked into the option of recovering the heat from the miners to generate electricity?

[18-Sep-18 10:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume now the heat is just dispersed outside and not recovered in any way?

[18-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Could be used to generate electricity or warm water for neighborhoods?

[18-Sep-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My mum was telling me about some thing where they said they do that... so miing was almsot free, but I was pretty sure it would cost more to set up than it would be worth.

@blackjok3r  I'm in western PA,  practically live on top of a coal mine.   Regarding using heat to generate electric ,  the only thing I can think of that can do that is thermocouples/thermopiles ,  not much electric gain from them unfortunately

[21-Sep-18 08:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Thanks, just lucked into an awesome property owner whose interests align regarding mining üòâ. Unfortunately things are a little bit delayed,  power company taking forever on running the lines to the building as half their crew is down south repairing hurricane damage and miners being held up in china because of some mechanical issue  with ups.   But it's only a matter of time now. After the machines are set up and running the real work begins,  designing and building a barter exchange.

[21-Sep-18 08:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats quite the undertaking. Almost seems worthy of it's own kmd asset.

[21-Sep-18 08:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
I've been going through all the other ecosystems channels and you're the only one with actual hardware and a facility

[21-Sep-18 08:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can't do an asset unfortunately,  at least at this stage,  the strength of the barter exchange comes at the cost of user autonomy.    To be fair a lot of the ecosystem projects can be worked from a laptop anywhere they don't need a facility,  more of a blessing for them , less overhead more agility.  That is not to downplay properties advantages however

[21-Sep-18 08:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I will be using blockchains just not an asset

So you're going to barter crypto for various things with other busunesses?

[21-Sep-18 08:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
Let's say I make widgets. I've got a surplus, you give me crypto for my extra widgets?

[21-Sep-18 08:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No, you would receive credits( which then you could use at another merchant to purchase crypto) The business model is based on fees and subscription.  The reason for going the barter exchange route is to avoid being a MSB. It helps to clarify a term.  A barter exchange is a third party record keeper of credit and debt.

I've a got a place under solar power in the south but the heat from mining would destroy the cost benefit. was thinking I could just bury some shipping containers though

[21-Sep-18 09:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
the idea of what I am trying to do is solve the "medium of exchange" problem in our ecosystem.  Komodo serves really well as a store of value and unit of account, but because of that specifically the first part,  it becomes a shit medium of exchange.   Mutual Credit is an excellent medium of exchange but whose store of value function is null. Whether through inflation as in current fiat system or through demurrage which is what I'm going to try to do.

[21-Sep-18 09:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

I think people will like the benefits of a line of credit outside of banks.   With solar power you could probably get a few of the z9 minis going they are low wattage and only one fan so heats not too bad

[21-Sep-18 09:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I'm sure that it will come in handy soon enough, an economy requires all sorts of trades ,  and  once things get a bit more progressed the goal would be to funnel work to you and others and keep the cycle going,  making our own cryptoeconomy.   Yes,  shipping is viable  if we ever needed work or the barter exchange was needed as escrow or something

sure, could be a use case test as well. we could make a an actual hardware "testnet." been working on some fairly esoteric heat sink designs for class D audio amps. I'm sure they would have applicable use cases for mining chips as well.

the beauty of audio is that silence is golden, so there is some incentive to keeping things quiet

[21-Sep-18 10:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol,  well some reasons for that,  depending on resale value might not be worth putting too much extra effort into them.    A silencer box would be good thing to make I think for the at home miner , might be a cash cow there if you can figure how to do it well and cost effectively

[21-Sep-18 10:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
well I could go all the way down the rabbit hole of transistor efficiency related to heat dissipation in audio circuits but I'm not sure if the same applies to digital processing. we will just have to see how soon Moore's law creates a ceiling for us.

Basically to crack keys efficiently,  or try to at least.  At some point it will be more profitable or at least more attractive to crack a high coin amount wallet than to mine coin.   Now I know combinatorially it should be near impossible but with advances in computing and theory it might reach a day it would be worth a go for a large entity.
