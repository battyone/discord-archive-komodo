how hot is "too hot" for an i7-8700K?

[13-Nov-18 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is running at 60-68C_

[13-Nov-18 10:52 AM] That_Guy8#4893
how do you change the p2pport?

[13-Nov-18 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
are you running latest komodod?

[13-Nov-18 10:52 AM] That_Guy8#4893
yeah just built

[13-Nov-18 10:52 AM] jorian#4555
on master or dev?

[13-Nov-18 10:52 AM] That_Guy8#4893
from jl's repo

[13-Nov-18 10:53 AM] jorian#4555
@jl777c which branches are used for this?

[13-Nov-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
beta, dev, jl777 or FSM should all work

[13-Nov-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain updated FSM branch with fix for your crash

[13-Nov-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

27 sol here

[13-Nov-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need the xenocat miner instead

[13-Nov-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its way faster tham tromp in the daemon

[13-Nov-18 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I wanted faster, I'd copy qsolo to here and just GPU it :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 10:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this is just the 1st time I've taxed this CPU

[13-Nov-18 11:00 AM] CMaurice#1685
nothing works for me

[13-Nov-18 11:01 AM] CMaurice#1685
changed the ports etc, port forwarded, changed back etc. etc.

[13-Nov-18 11:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
Can somebody post a peerlist?

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@CMaurice if you get the wrong p2p port, you are running the wrong version

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use FSM lol

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works fine

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] CMaurice#1685
I am using FSM

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
changing p2p port using the wrong version will not make it work as it is the wrong version

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] CMaurice#1685
lol

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810

if you want a working pool, you might need staked mastertest and my pool software .. but maybe you dont either.

[13-Nov-18 11:02 AM] CMaurice#1685
jl777, yeah, so I rmdir after each change

[13-Nov-18 11:03 AM] CMaurice#1685
so should have regenerated correctly

[13-Nov-18 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CMaurice are you following the readme exactly? or are you substituting `jl777` for `komodoplatform`?

[13-Nov-18 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you copy/paste, then you's still be building same as you started with

[13-Nov-18 11:06 AM] That_Guy8#4893
@blackjok3r link to your pool software git please?

[13-Nov-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
mined a block using 8 threads of i7-8700k locally on Agama

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
@SHossain how did you launch with agama? what version?

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
thanks

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need a special daemon to make it work ..

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 5 280x's with working fans ... might be the first whale 😄

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
@That_Guy8 test

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just try the normal one first ... you might not need my mod

[13-Nov-18 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
locally compiled binary and other things

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think mine was only required for -ac_script

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all the nomps cant make

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the right transaction

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it so that the coinabse

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
from the daemon is used instead

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the pool doesnt make its own

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the coinase cna be any transacion

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already did it

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
"disablecb" : true

[13-Nov-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
int he coins file

[13-Nov-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT it needs to use stakedchain/komodo mastertest branch

[13-Nov-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing else works with it

[13-Nov-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
had to change getblocktemplate with an extra "mode"

[13-Nov-18 11:11 AM] That_Guy8#4893
