Hi All. We want to start with a big thank you for believing in us early. Its been an amazing few weeks. We have been in contact with 3 of the top 10 exchanges relating to listing and we have an agreement already in place. However, this isnt a cheap process by any means, so we are determining how to raise the funds over the next 48 hours. This is testament that others see the value this project can bring and we have begun discussions with a number of other industry partners too. Please stay tuned for further updates.

founders fee

[05-Dec-18 12:39 PM] Machgielis#2406
There isnt enough liquidity in the coin yet.  There will be a partial payment in treasury coins from the founders fee but there is a substantial BTC requirement too. This is what we are working on now.

@zaddex are the ZEX pools updated?

[12-Dec-18 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
Who operates ZEX pool?

[12-Dec-18 03:05 PM] zaddex#2546
Hi Hossain, there are a few pools for ZEX including @That_Guy8 @blackjok3r @Laviathon -bcmonster.com and @forkwitch I believe.

[12-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
We are on the new wallet.

[12-Dec-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to make sure all are updated with sapling support very soon

[12-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise not only will they go on a fork, they will keep the old chain alive

[12-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and having a competing chain is always a bit messy

[12-Dec-18 03:19 PM] That_Guy8#4893
What’s the timeframe?

[12-Dec-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
Dec 15th 1am UTC

[12-Dec-18 03:33 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Did I blatantly overlook this ann? Haha anywho I shall be ready will get sorted tomorrow.

[12-Dec-18 04:23 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
I don’t know about the stratum protocol.

[12-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
If we are on the wallet but the coin does not change.   I’m guessing we will be ok.

[12-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
I know kmd had to do a node modules update.

[12-Dec-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the komodod daemon needs to be updated and there is also new pool software changes needed to support tx version 4

[12-Dec-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I don’t know about the stratum protocol.`
It's not really the "protocol" that needs changed, but since nomp and all forks of it incorporate a transaction library into the stratum module, all such forks did/do need a stratum *module* update

fantastic. will do. thanks for your prompt response

[12-Dec-18 06:17 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
As of right now I’m using black jokers 🃏.   I  don’t know if he is working on an update.   Would love to get the coin Merged into s-nomp get some more publicity.

[12-Dec-18 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, jokers "shouldn't" need any major update because of his work-around in how it creates blocks
as for putting it into s-nomp (rather than his implementation of z-nomp), I think that's a non-starter because of the reworking of payouts due to that same workaround
Am I wrong @blackjok3r ?

[12-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   I think we would need to set the config file like zen for example and it should in theory work....   for example.....   https://github.com/s-nomp/s-nomp/blob/master/coins/zen.json

I think it would do away with the mods he has implemented bypassing the Coinbase.

[12-Dec-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com for joker's version it's far more than just config (his has the ability to take pool % from the coinbase tx removed)

[12-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
Yea it just stops him from breaking the block on discovery.

[12-Dec-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it needs a new payment system to store and account for the difference

[12-Dec-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which also involves redis db changes

[12-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I’m talking about making it an s-nomp coin.

[12-Dec-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, I thought that your comment tagging me was in reference to my comment immediately above it
-----
I'm not sure about the "official" s-nomp, but I know that miketout's fork of it does work and the only config change off the top of my head is setting sapling height

[12-Dec-18 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
--------
My earlier comment about s-nomp was in relation to merging joker's cb format with s-nomp and that's where my head was at in the responses

[12-Dec-18 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
joker's format of implementing a usage of the daemon blocktemplate is because there isn't currently a transaction library that supports many of the assetchain features available and his is the current best public method for supporting the most assetchains in total

[12-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I believe joker has pool fee working with his implementation

[12-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
just in a very different way than typical nomp payment processing

[12-Dec-18 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought he said he had, but my point was that afaik he used z-nomp as the base, which would create a ton of work to port into s-nomp

[12-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
really just boils down to whether or not we support s-nomp or knomp

[12-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
or both?

[12-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
not sure s-nomp would accept the changes

[12-Dec-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it's no secret that my answer is "neither" 😛

[12-Dec-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
it's backwards compatible, but is a drastic change from typical stratum

[12-Dec-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and what do you suggest?

[12-Dec-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the same as I've said for a yr now:
"we need to start from the ground up and make a Komodo product for Komodo"

[12-Dec-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since I'm alone in that voice, it's at least 6 months out

[12-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
S-nomp and its dependencies will work. It’s sapling enabled already.   Just need the coin config right I believe.

[12-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com just needs a bit of a tweak for the founder's reward

[13-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@Alright besides just getting the coin config ironed out for the founders reward?

[13-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
should work if that does P2PKH at the exact amount in last coinbase vout

[13-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
I've been using joker's work around to make the daemon produce the coinbase, haven't tested existing founder's reward setups

[13-Dec-18 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
you can also edit transactions.js to make it pay the exact amount

[13-Dec-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My pool needs a slight update to be sapling ready.

[13-Dec-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs to reecognise the new parmeter in getblocktemplate hashReserved

[13-Dec-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the repo my pool is in, already has the change. I will go update my pool soon.

Hi, when I try to send ZEX from my transparent address to my zs sapling address, I get error: invalid ZEX address. (agama 0.3.2a, windows) also when sending from a transparent addres to another transparent one, it creates a new address and leaves some zex there. I have 1 zex in suc address and it seems impossible to send it.

If you currently have it in your R address its all good. Just dont move it to shielded zc or zs addresses.
