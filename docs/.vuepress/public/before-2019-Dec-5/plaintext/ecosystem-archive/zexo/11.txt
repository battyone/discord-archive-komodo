Can you please share core developer's username?

[14-Nov-18 04:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can your core developer answer here if asked questions?

[14-Nov-18 04:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Km888?

[14-Nov-18 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
More than marketing and customer facing team members, I'd be much more interested to interact with the core developer who will be working on the backend core project.

[14-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Machgielis#2406
@grewalsatinder will ask for some technical presence yes.

[14-Nov-18 04:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay, so far what I understand, just to be clear:
1.  Zaddex team is about 3 people. 2 customer facing, 1 core dev.
2. Claims to have centralised exchange engine done, which will be open sourced? When?
3. Do you have any expected timeline to provide technical details on Both Centralised Exchange and Decentralised Exchange?
4. Since no username provided for core developer, the core developer is not here on this discord? How is this developer learning CC tech then? Since this dev is anonymous already, and in case the dev is here on this discord, can you please give the dev's username?

[14-Nov-18 04:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
5. What is the Github repository to check on the source code or even the developer's github profile? or any developer network profile?

[14-Nov-18 05:03 AM] Machgielis#2406
1. We have 3 devs. 2 customer facing. 2. We have stated Q1 in the whitepaper and are tracking ahead of schedule so far. Updates to follow. 3. Centralised very soon. DEX is dependent on exact route as there are technical and legal considerations so we will build with both in mind. 4. The priority at the moment is the centralised exchange and we will absolutely make this available. 5. All of the Github information is being worked on over the next 48 hours and will be updated shortly. We thank you for your patience and understanding.

@forkwitch I tried connecting to your pool but my miner stays "Dead".

[14-Nov-18 05:07 AM] OliverDay#5571
I tried stratum+tcp://pool.forkwitch.com:3677 as the URL and my KMD wallet address as the worker.

[14-Nov-18 05:07 AM] OliverDay#5571
Mining with Z9 mini.

[14-Nov-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
forkwitches pool isnt working as far as I know... If there is a problem with mine I can take a look... ALthough it should not have 100% of hash rate, I really wany someone else to get a pool up ASAP...

[14-Nov-18 05:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thank you for your answers.
I have to be honest here @Machgielis 

I still don't have any confidence on Zaddex project.

1. I don't know ANYTHING about team.
2. I don't know What code history the developers has made to assess by checking on the code quality and how well things work in developer side.
3. I don't know ANYTHING other than the *"soon"* for technical details.

To me it is *VERY DANGEROUS* to do any exchange (buy/sell) of $ZEX token on current or any Centralised Exchange until the team provides technical details on the project, and also shows the in-progress source code or working source code, along with the core developer to answer further questions.

[14-Nov-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
35% founders reward is a LOT .... I agree waiting here.. although already have a few coins from pool. üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 05:13 AM] Machgielis#2406
@grewalsatinder we will certainly change your mind in the very near future but again, certainly understand your view and respect and appreciate it very much. Just give us a very short time to get this all updated for you and for the community.

[14-Nov-18 05:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will be waiting for working project, source code to look at, a developer to talk to and technical details.
Hoping for the best for your project. üëç

[14-Nov-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes interesting project for sure, await more details üòÑ

[14-Nov-18 05:18 AM] twistedmind#1523
sick of projects that people are hiding who they are. youre not satoshi

[14-Nov-18 05:21 AM] Decker#3767
@blackjok3r it's not 35% ... let's apply simple math:
- Block Reward: 130 ZEX
- Founders Reward: 70.0000002 ZEX
- Total Coinbase: 200.0000002 ZEX
So, founders reward is: 53,846154% üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so something is very wrong with the math inside the daemon then, as it flat says its 35%

[14-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Decker#3767
But 200 * 0.35 = 70 ... )

[14-Nov-18 05:24 AM] Decker#3767
In my imagine it should be 35% from 130 ...

[14-Nov-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```            if ( ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION == 0 && ASSETCHAINS_FOUNDERS != 0 )
            {
                ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION = 53846154; // maps to 35%
                printf("ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION defaulted to 35%% when founders reward active\n");```

[14-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Decker#3767
I know ...

[14-Nov-18 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exact copy pste from my deamon üòï

[14-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Decker#3767
But CoinBase Amount = BlockReward + FoundersReward.

[14-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it seems backwards to me ...

[14-Nov-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless the coinabse is meant to be 200 coins ... which is far too much IMO

[14-Nov-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess im not complaining atm...... as the only pool with a 1% fee im getting a fair few "free" coins üòÇ

[14-Nov-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
helping another pool OP to get one up now...

[14-Nov-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If my pool breaks, the chain is going to stall for a LONG time...

[14-Nov-18 05:28 AM] Decker#3767
Seems when we talk about 35%, we should mean 35% of coinbase. Where coinbase = BlockReward + FoundersReward.

[14-Nov-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes so in that case its right... üòÉ

[14-Nov-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we will be using something similar for staked... to pay % of BR to either a multisig address OR a contract.

[14-Nov-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends if I cna get the contract working.

[14-Nov-18 05:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Guys can we put a founders reward in pirate?   35% sounds sweet üòú

[14-Nov-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol...

[14-Nov-18 05:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just kidding.   I know projects need funding.

[14-Nov-18 05:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I know alll too dearly.

[14-Nov-18 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess you can height activate it ...BUT that siad the pools would totally break

[14-Nov-18 05:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085

Satinder is as always late and as always right. Someone must pump it in a day or two. These fees are just ridiculous = no mainland adoption. Nice try though.

[14-Nov-18 06:54 AM] ted#5473
@Machgielis is there a discord of zex?

[14-Nov-18 06:55 AM] Machgielis#2406
All coming. We are getting a media manager now

@forkwitch  which pool softeare are you use to make it work?

[14-Nov-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Very interested if anyone else has a working version, or if everyone is using mine ?

[14-Nov-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As I have fees working now and need to somehow ake them not hardcoded... @Alright  did you test my stuff so I cna make the PR? My pool is runnign on staked chain, komodo as I dont want to restart it for any reason being the only pool with hash on the chain.

[14-Nov-18 08:09 AM] jansako#3330
Morning all! Zex website says already integrated into Agama, do we have a public build yet?

[14-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think so

[14-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only testbuilds atm

[14-Nov-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no reason it wouldnt work, agama is just a front end to the daemon.. rpc calls are the same... that said, until its tested as working its much safer to just mine to KMD address, or leave on exchange a few days.

[14-Nov-18 09:27 AM] That_Guy8#4893
I'm getting there

{Reactions}
üëå 

[14-Nov-18 10:13 AM] jansako#3330
Is there a way to use the command line to communicate with the KMD daemon started by Agama to start & sync the ZEX chain? Then one could send coins etc 'fairly easily' without having to compile/use test builds? (I know, anything is still a 'test build' technically at this point...

[14-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[14-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just using komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX will work

[14-Nov-18 10:14 AM] jansako#3330
OK< so it will respond... which folder do I need to be in to issue the commands? (in WIn)

[14-Nov-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea... where ever komodo-cli.exe is

[14-Nov-18 10:16 AM] jansako#3330
the chain data is here: C:\Users\Jan\AppData\Roaming\Komodo

[14-Nov-18 10:16 AM] jansako#3330
OK, will look

[14-Nov-18 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will be in the Agama folder itself somehere
