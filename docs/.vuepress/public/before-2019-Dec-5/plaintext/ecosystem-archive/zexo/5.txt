[13-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any KMD address should work on my pool yes

[13-Nov-18 12:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Thoughts so

[13-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure, if an invalid address will work either so be careful

[13-Nov-18 12:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

oh that's why my stratum didn't work

[13-Nov-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
web it would be much better to spoof shares and use my method

[13-Nov-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
thought that was 2 not 20

[13-Nov-18 12:44 PM] jorian#4555

[13-Nov-18 12:46 PM] That_Guy8#4893
ahh ok

[13-Nov-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how do I spoof shares 🤔

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
```
    tx.addOutput(
        scriptCompile(poolAddrHash),
        Math.round(blockReward) + feeReward
    );

    // pool fee recipients t-addr
    for (var i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        tx.addOutput(
            scriptCompile(bitcoin.address.fromBase58Check(recipients[i].address).hash),
            Math.round(7000000020)
        );
    }
```
```
    "rewardRecipients": {
 "RH3ceKn9f4g7VHnpBwYyNvvn2WygkQXbFK": 1.5
    },
```

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
hack that will work ^^

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay who can I taalk to understand this project?

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks will test on my pool at home first

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
no that's not for faking shares

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
you can just take pool fee manually in transactions.js though

[13-Nov-18 12:47 PM] Alright#0419
that line right there

[13-Nov-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep thanks 😃

[13-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
Math.round(blockReward) + feeReward

[13-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
need to edit that

[13-Nov-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
makign a diffrent pool for all diffrent types of coinbase seems much harder #justsayin 😂

[13-Nov-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`makign a diffrent pool for all diffrent types of coinbase seems much harder`
Yes, adding 1 if statement per "unusual" ac setting is much harder than revamping the entire system and adding changes to the core block template 🙄

[13-Nov-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ding fucking make changes to the entire blocktemplate dick head ... its an optional

[13-Nov-18 12:50 PM] That_Guy8#4893
@blackjok3r possible to share your coin.json and pool config please? obvs erase critical info 😛

[13-Nov-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it returns hte normal one

[13-Nov-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you ask it for the pther one

[13-Nov-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

yes but if there is a very easy way to do it that doesnt take days of dicking around to get no where... why not just do it that way
You need mastertest branch of StakedChain/komodo
its a very simple change to daemon, I can PR to FSM later ifd james says its ok...
everythign is backwards compatible

250ksol on my pool so far without a NH port

[13-Nov-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`yes but if there is a very easy way to do it that doesnt take days of dicking around to get no where... why not just do it that way`
if it takes you "days" to add `if (ac_founders=true) { add founder tx as pool tx}` then you shouldn't be trying
#Just Sayin

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really don understand wht yo dont get about being able to put CC vouts in the coinbase .. .a fucking statum cannot do that

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
why you busting his balls genie

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes for this particular cain, you can hack the pool up

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but hacking ut up for every type fo chain seems dumb

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the daemon supplis a valid coinbase

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Nov-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@webworker01 depends on how the math rounds things, likely around 10 sats extra
