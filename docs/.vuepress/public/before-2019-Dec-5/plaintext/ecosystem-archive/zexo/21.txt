not sure if it's an issue, but I thought I'll bring it up. It takes me several tries to "stop" the zaddex wallet, each time it "fails" to stop. I have never had this issue with any other asset on native mode in the agama wallet.

[20-Nov-18 03:09 PM] SHossain#0007
ZEX in Agama wallet still in beta testing. All these issues will be addressed in a proper release

Did anyone tell AlexTraid that the same amount of coins are generated each day whether GPUS, ASICS or SCRATCH PAPER is used to solve the algorithm equations?

[20-Nov-18 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[20-Nov-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢Today at 6:56 AM

Hah... pen and paper.      
Im glad you said that too.

Zaddex, FIshy and I spotted a typo in the dPoW figure in your whitepaper

* mining effective only if there re no notary nodes.

[20-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Flexatron#8809

Hi. We will be launching the Telegram channel soon. It is up and running but just in set up stage. We will have some designs to share with you shortly. The exchange is well ahead of schedule. We will finalise this set up before beginning a media ramp up and also further listings.

[22-Nov-18 03:26 AM] Machgielis#2406
We have also been nominated in a Twitter Gems tournament and been slated for an upcoming coinmarketcap.com listing. We need to finalise current exchange deals before this goes live.

[22-Nov-18 03:27 AM] Machgielis#2406
Thank you for following us early and pointing your miners to us. I think this could very well be a good decision in the very near future.

[22-Nov-18 03:31 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@Machgielis  Thats great about CMC

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] house#8741
Great to hear consistent progress fellas 💪🏽

[22-Nov-18 09:12 AM] house#8741
Rumour true that you are looking at accomodating ARRR ?

[22-Nov-18 09:17 AM] zaddex#2546
Thanks house, yes we will definitely be supporting Pirate. We plan to list all projects launched with Komodo before Zaddex exchange goes live.

so z-addresses will be supported? how about using dpowconfirmations?

[23-Nov-18 04:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is mixed content on the site which gives an ssl warning
