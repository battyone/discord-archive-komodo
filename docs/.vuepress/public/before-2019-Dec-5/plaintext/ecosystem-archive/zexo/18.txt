"needed" seems to be a matter of opinion

[16-Nov-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@webworker01 have you tried br as vout0 fee as vout1 and tax as vout2?

[16-Nov-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User we've reached a point, imo, where backward-compatibility is moot and we need a Komodo-based stratum and can work on how to add outside coins later

[16-Nov-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_perc chains need the percentage in vout1 of coinbase

the other zcoins would be easy(ish) to readd if we have the lib functioning properly

[16-Nov-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the other quirk is that for assetchains if the coinbase is used to distribute payments, it cant include any txfees, just the blockreward

[16-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no chance of my change breaking anything existing it is an extra option. But do what you want, pool ops can choose which one they want.

[16-Nov-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its really NOT complicated... Use the coinbase from the daemon, as the validation function is an exact inverse of the function that created it it cannot fail this way

[16-Nov-18 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My solution does not burn tx feea

[16-Nov-18 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They r sent to miner and pool reward address

[16-Nov-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Its really NOT complicated... Use the coinbase template from the daemon as a template, take fees out on the spot, and be done with it all

Maybe one of you guys can also suss the option for people to set nicknames on this server also? As some server (aka personal use ones) I don’t want ginasis mining. But other crypto ones I normally change nickname on that server. Possible to enable this?

@OliverDay stop the wallet and start again

[16-Nov-18 08:40 PM] OliverDay#5571
It worked, thanks!

[16-Nov-18 08:44 PM] OliverDay#5571
So I restarted the wallet and imported the seed that I generated a few days ago, using a KMD address. The coins that I mined is now appearing in the wallet. However it will not allow me to send the coins, it’s giving me this error:

“Your wallet.dat is not matching the blockchain. Please restart the wallet with -reindex param.”

[16-Nov-18 08:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Close wallet, restart wallet, activate coin, choose zex native mode. Beneath that select from the drop down daemon params: reindex

Zex on agama now then tryed with the cli stuff and was a no go

Does a asic miner go for the high diff stratum port

[16-Nov-18 11:01 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Best bet is to try both ports. Check the regular one and if it’s smashing shares too fast after 10 mins try the high diff.

[16-Nov-18 11:01 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
I'm on the higher one atm but the website don't show the stats but on my phone it does

[16-Nov-18 11:02 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884

[16-Nov-18 11:19 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
I had ⚠️ that at the bottom left of the logo and had to stop the wallet and start it back again and now my 3 zaddex are there

[16-Nov-18 11:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@stephenleeholmes118   wait a minute,  check the explorer,   see the addresses  possible cause:  the 3.38xxxx was one utxo had to spend all of it  the remainder should appear back in wallet.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how can they hash a block and calculate the shares for it at the same time

[18-Nov-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
the block they'd be hashing would be changing constantly

[18-Nov-18 12:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because 1+1=2 and 1+1+1=3
It's on a 5N base, not literally *every* share up to the second, but recalculated every scrape (just like the node stratums rescrape every 55 seconds by default)

[18-Nov-18 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
seems like you could game it

wind down?

[18-Nov-18 01:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with "5N", your paid shares are based on 5 times a given *N* value (usually *N* is set at the current diff)
so, you have a period where you're not getting "paid in full" while "ramping up" and a period where you're still getting paid after you stop hashing "winding/ramping down"
