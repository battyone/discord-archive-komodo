_doesn't do arch _üòú

[13-Jul-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The point is that if it builds on arch, it should work on everything. Its a static build and builds all of the deps itself. Quite awesome really.

LUMBER keeps crashing on a non mining node
komodod: coins.cpp:564: const CTxOut& CCoinsViewCache::GetOutputFor(const CTxIn&) const: Assertion `coins && coins->IsAvailable(input.prevout.n)' failed.
I don't have a traceback maybe above helps

[13-Jul-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmm bar fish had that on labs as well weird

[13-Jul-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If its reproducible, comment the assert on that line and running gdb

[13-Jul-19 07:04 AM] CHMEX#0686
thanks I just did a git pull maybe it's fixed in the latest I will observe it

[13-Jul-19 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt it is, weird it happebs on lumber, as that's vrsc pos. I thought it was a bug with pos64, gald that its not tbh.

[13-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I have close to the triggers from last time (orphan POS blocks close to chain tip changes) but no repeats of the assert as yet - edge case.

[13-Jul-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I've got an idea what it could be, but I'm taking the rest of the day off

[13-Jul-19 02:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
Which chains should we be notarizing now...

[13-Jul-19 02:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
I just cleaned my repo and pulled it clean and removed my edited assetchains.json

[13-Jul-19 02:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
But sounds like some arent worth running anymore... so which are?

[13-Jul-19 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
I see LABS, CFEKFEK and CFEKLOTTO1

[13-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Is there a way of pulling the SegID of the UTXO that staked a POS block? - I see it reported in the stdout, but as I have -pubkey set it doesn't return in the transaction??

[13-Jul-19 02:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
validate the addy in AGAMA

[13-Jul-19 02:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
or command line

[13-Jul-19 02:35 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
??? - listtransactions shows the pubkey address - as does the txid on explorers - as far as I can see the segID is lost if the pubkey recieves the payout

[13-Jul-19 02:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
where can I get this from RPC? ```mined LABS block 68445!
Staked from segid 25 921586fc9628c58b9db63b01bd738368ff139b21171fe2853f66f039a9651e84
```

[13-Jul-19 02:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
idk about a drect call like that... but if you have the address of the staking funds, validateaddress gives the segid

[13-Jul-19 02:47 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
not sure it does - seems to give the segid of the pubkey

[13-Jul-19 02:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
also, joker's script for last N blocks staked segIDs might be able to be edited to output something close

[13-Jul-19 02:47 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
as the pubkey mined the block

[13-Jul-19 02:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
The explorer shows the utxo moving of the staking funds and then the tx for the send to the pubkey address... so its in there somewhere

[13-Jul-19 03:03 PM] daemonfox#6136

Cant get these two to launch now

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
weird... first run for these and it wont generate the files in the .komodo/COINNAME directories

[13-Jul-19 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
both CFEKFEK and CFEKLOTTO1 dont have their name _7776 file nor a conf file after starting the notary

[13-Jul-19 03:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Thanks @daemonfox - that hint got me to the rpc I needed.

[13-Jul-19 06:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
nice

[13-Jul-19 06:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
no idea why my other two wont start cant even manually launch them...

my balance of CFEKLOTTO1   is   94606.4602 now, I'll go to a smoke but then maybe I should stop it to avoid to spend everything (I don't know I'm asking)

getrawtransation returns correctly a big rawtx but decoderawtx returns the error

[13-Jul-19 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
using gettransaction, I can check if the tx belongs to my wallet, 3639ac0f1aba85edd028387f94472029b45b8c0004c67aa567efe41d8e79855b is not one of my tx, I didn't win

[13-Jul-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
I think that getrawtransaction is for all tx and that gettransaction is for wallet transactions

[13-Jul-19 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
just use `getrawtransaction 3639ac0f1aba85edd028387f94472029b45b8c0004c67aa567efe41d8e79855b 1`
