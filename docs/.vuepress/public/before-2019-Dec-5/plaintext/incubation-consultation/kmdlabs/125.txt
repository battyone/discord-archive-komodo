the issue was a test in IsInitialDownload() needs to be disabled

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once we did that all nodes sync instantly

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that makes sense

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if (0 && ptr->chainPower < CChainPower(ptr, bigZero, minWork))
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"chainpower insufficient in IsInitialDownload\n");
        return true;
    }

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as I used that in the mempool fix and i found it not workiing

[24-Nov-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow that was always returning true, even after chain was in sync

[24-Nov-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it dosnt  have the nothing at stake fix ,.... what we need as a PoS chain

[24-Nov-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I willl merge it later ly self if need be

[24-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
is worth the time and effort to stay on par with KMD @blackjok3r

[24-Nov-18 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r a small bit of Git advice: in your staked fork of KMD, i would keep all of James' branch names alone, such as FSM, and leave them as exact copies of upstream. Use your own branch name that is unique to this project. Then, when pulling in new changes from James, your life will be less complex.

[24-Nov-18 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
if your FSM is already different, it's not hard to just change the branch name and then put FSM back to it's upstream state. Then you can do diffs against James's upstream and your current tip, more easily

[24-Nov-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I want the PoS fix?

[24-Nov-18 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
my suggestion is for the case of: "I merged some stuff into our FSM, but not others, and now it's a nightmare to tell what is only in upstream and what is in our branch/fork"

[24-Nov-18 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this isnnt about $ for me ... i dont think I need to say that again

[24-Nov-18 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also will make cherry-picking commits easier, potentially

[24-Nov-18 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you mkssing te pooint

[24-Nov-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am just giving general Git advice to make your life easier, I am not saying it fixes the particular issue you have right now

[24-Nov-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
having an FSM with all your changes mixed with all upstream, and then trying to pull in more, well, you now know how painful that is

[24-Nov-18 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh .. abnd i hate that i am using that so much ... but

[24-Nov-18 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why

[24-Nov-18 04:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did u get a stake  notary up?

[24-Nov-18 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
have you been in this situation before, where somebody is coding like mad upstream?

[24-Nov-18 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
nope, I don't have time for a notary position, giving it up to another person who can focus on it
