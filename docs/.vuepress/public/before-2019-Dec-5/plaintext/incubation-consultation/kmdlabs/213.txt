Or this mutex is called inside a LOCK ... that wil be much ahrder to fix

[09-Jan-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the mutex and lock should operate independently

[09-Jan-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm dont know... the mutex is what stops it... not sure if thats 100% accurate but the backtrace is identical on every node that halted

[09-Jan-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
then something inside the mutex is calling the same mutex

[09-Jan-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
not good at all

[09-Jan-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... I have 8 threrads all waiting on cs_main those all say cs_main is held by this thread, and this thread stops on the mutex. By computer frozxe so I lost the debugger, guess I can just read some code for now and see fi I can find anything

[09-Jan-19 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
testing possible fix now.

I think this fixes it all.. I will test it first to make sure adding transaction fee works.

[09-Jan-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to retest staker with these changes also.

[09-Jan-19 07:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  
Sorry about this, but we also have an important update for StakedChain/komodo. This should fix all issues with migrates that were left. I have changed it so that we use the standard komodo transaction fee for imports of 0.0001 coins. This means you pay 2x this amount one for burn tx and one for import. There is nothing stopping you taking the fee out in the code, if you wish to do so, however blocks will only be maximum 2MB if everyone does this during the stress test.

We also bring down all the major bug fixes from the last few days. These are mandatory to update in a day or two or you risk forking chains, including KMD. We need to create a PoS chain and test this... Although I might do this locally first so save wasting everyone's time if my fix is no good. Nothing bad can happen for PoW chains, infact they should work better than before. :)
A simple start.sh was enough to update my notary. Staked repo nodes, will need to stop their daemons manually first. 
Thanks for all of your patience. I think this is finally close to stable. Please report any strange behaviour you find.

I want to throw KMD at somebody and they help me/Hush maintain the Hush insight explorer at https://explorer.myhush.org/ (which is down, luzl). I don't need a server, I need smart people to maintain insight, keep it updated, and help me make tiny changes to it, without breaking the world. Is this something that LABS can help with? If not LABS, who?

Why the need for a btcpubkey? I can't start the chains without one?

[09-Jan-19 10:28 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Planned for a mining node

[09-Jan-19 10:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka your NN need pubkey to know to sign tx with that addy

[09-Jan-19 10:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not needed for mining node

[09-Jan-19 10:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I'm on the /staked/ repo and it is requiring a btc pub key to start the chains. I've added the kmd key in there

[09-Jan-19 10:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```genie@StakedNotary:~$ cd StakedNotary
genie@StakedNotary:~/StakedNotary$ ./listassetchainparams.py```
will give you exactly the info you need to run mining node

https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo <- that's the komodo to build to run the chains

Not sure why you'd want all that, but whatever works for ya (me I just use the daemon and go on)

[10-Jan-19 12:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not familiar with all facets of labs just yet, so went with what was recommended. I'll have to have a play around a bit more when I get home. I just read about komodos scaling solution and am excited to help with this test

[10-Jan-19 01:39 AM] CrisF#3405
The pubkey in the config.ini is the KMD pubkey. From the KMD address and priv key.  They are all the same address.

[10-Jan-19 01:43 AM] CrisF#3405
You can also use the noconfig version that Blackjok3r mentioned yesterday, or from staked/komodo/master `. /komodo-cli  - ac_name=CFEKX`

[10-Jan-19 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure its there

[10-Jan-19 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I use it for mining nodes

[10-Jan-19 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And explorer nodes

[10-Jan-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
While genies solution is fine, when we start running multiple branches for different chains it will become a lot harder to manage.

Like I said I havent used it... What its doing it pulling them from the ~/.komodo/CFEKX/CFEKX.conf

[10-Jan-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The daemon generates that file automatically with everything needed.

[10-Jan-19 04:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for KMD it does not.... the buildkomodo.sh script does it

[10-Jan-19 04:27 AM] gt#2812
will look at again in a bit

[10-Jan-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
@gt what conf file do you mean?

any decent C++ courses out there?

[10-Jan-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah no idea... I never found courses to be any good either. When i did the cert 3 in IT at tafe... I used to go there 2H late every day to avoid the ticket collectors at the train station, and stay for like 1H then convince everyone to go to the pub ... Finished with 100% marks...  Did most of the work at home... Super easy and boring lol.

[10-Jan-19 10:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah tracking led me to where the battery went flat,  and he sure likes to range  a fair stretch. once he hits the river he's near impossible to find, but at least there's no cars. Not sure how he'd respond to snakes tho... dont think he'd chase them but you never know

`While genies solution is fine, when we start running multiple branches for different chains it will become a lot harder to manage.`
When a miner opts to mine such divergent things, s/he should know wtf s/he's after, imo

[10-Jan-19 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As someone with just about 1TB of chain data, I can tell you that mining every chain just because they are there isn't all it's cracked up to  be

Damn batteries.... maybe some thing that make power when you shake it so while he runnign around he carges up his prison. 😄

[10-Jan-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just keep finding more bugs here ... I almost have the PoW flag setting... This will help preformance and allow the staking script to work a lot easier, and also deal with  PoW mined blocks, for its segid distribution.

[10-Jan-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is also a wallet bug, that when you load the daemon it thinks transactions are expired and (either deletes them in our case, due to my wallet repair code) or does not load them to the runtime wallet.... which could lead to lost funds.

[10-Jan-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They are not gone.... but they appear gone.

[10-Jan-19 12:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[10-Jan-19 12:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[10-Jan-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure Genie... I havet got there yet... its simple enough to change ... just add flag, that on wallet load it does not check for tx expirty from wallet.

I either did somethign wrong... or the code is horribly fucked ... I guess it might be me ... Where it was trying to set this flag I can never do so... .So I found where it actually checks PoW and tried to set the flag there... and now it does not sync. 😦
