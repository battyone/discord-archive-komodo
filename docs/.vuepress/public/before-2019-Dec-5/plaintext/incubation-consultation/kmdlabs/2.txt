and im not sure anyone would compensate me for that time, to only end up wth somethig that works much the same as what we already have.

[05-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however... once it was done, making improvemnts would be very easy

However, sometimes knowledge and satisfaction are their own compensation üòâ

[05-Oct-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
true ... its not like anyone has realy compensted me for the work i already did... james gave a nice donation a few weeks/months ago but that was about all.

[05-Oct-18 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked actally cost me money so far... but Im really happy with how its turning out and what has been made possible by it

That being said, time value is every reason I never revamped BarterDEX GUI from the ground up the way I think it would work better

tbh never even thaught about it like that

[05-Oct-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
WOW ... this change has made my node go from 5-6 locked KMD utxo at a time to liek 16 ... that has to be better

[05-Oct-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it means its staying in the rounds and actually has a chance to notarise

@blackjok3r how many ppl have enquired about iguana code recently?  seems a few

[05-Oct-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was 1 guy in #dev-general  I think, and I wouldnt worry no one will be able to follow it üòÇ

[05-Oct-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although, I am starting to grasp it, it needs much simplification so that others can work on it/ use it for other things.

[05-Oct-18 08:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Might have made a mistake trying ```https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/barterDEX-Network-Optimizations.html``` on a node.  Might use your seednode scipt over the wkend, @blackjok3r .

[05-Oct-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldny use those on a notary, it seemed well tested on manin net to have no effect if not bad effect. I have one node on steroids it seems though.

[05-Oct-18 08:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I was just on the seed  I tried.

[05-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you use my script make sure you comment out the blocknotify command in start.sh

Graph of net activity seems `choppy` now.  Will see if I can revert to compare and then probably re-do to test out your script.

It seems to easy to be true...

[05-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great work... I think the hard part will be breaking it in a controlled fasion üòÑ

[05-Oct-18 11:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah üòÉ

[05-Oct-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
After yesterdays productive efforts didnt get a whole lot done today here after lunch time.

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Probably good to have a little rest now and then!  Come back recharged.

[05-Oct-18 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
If I have questions about channels is it better to ask here, or in the cc channel?

[05-Oct-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure anyone has really tested it thourghly but the guy who wrote it or jl in cc channel are probably best to speak to at this time.

[05-Oct-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
TonyL migh know some stuff about it.. I think it needs dPoW so it needs STAKED to be tested.

[05-Oct-18 11:58 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll ask there then.  Just basic concept thing atm.

[05-Oct-18 11:59 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try one more, then 'write' a sript. (actually copy and paste bits of yours, haha)

[05-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to read the notes and instructions you were linked a few times, it kind of makes sense, I have used some LN before on chips, which apears similer in concept, ut very diffrent in implementation.

[05-Oct-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats how I learnt how to do it, and still copy my own to make new ones all the time üòÑ

[05-Oct-18 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
haha

[05-Oct-18 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
It was very simple to do.  That's why I think I might have messed it up

[05-Oct-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its just open channel the make payment... it seems closing it is the ahrd part.

[05-Oct-18 12:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, mine is still open.

[05-Oct-18 12:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Better finish that.

[05-Oct-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You dont need to close it lol... but I think thats the hard part... testing all possible ways to break it will be much harder than using it properly with no chain reorgs and things like that.

[05-Oct-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I expect for the most part it will just work but who knows

[05-Oct-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
right now the notarization check is a stub

[05-Oct-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but once a channel is created, it is a matter of making a payment

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
system is backwards compatible with wallets, explorers, etc. nothing special to setup

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
though we would want a GUI that can indicate when the mempool payment arrives

[05-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so right now, you should be able to break the payment with a reorg

[05-Oct-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is a matter to then add notarization and notarization check, then that makes it dPoW protected mempool payment

[05-Oct-18 12:06 PM] CrisF#3405
What is a stub?

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] CrisF#3405
(too silly to know if that is a silly question)

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that refers to a function in the code that doesn't do anything

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it just says "notarized:true"

[05-Oct-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-Oct-18 12:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.

[05-Oct-18 12:10 PM] CrisF#3405
Could `channels` be compared to a prepaid debit card?  Bought with `channelsopen`?

[05-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
instant verification

[05-Oct-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
great for Starbucks, etc.

[05-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
smaller coins can get immediate and secure credit for purchases

[05-Oct-18 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I guess more like a Starbucks card, only useable at Starbucks.  Need a different card for each business?

[05-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
true, it is 100% p2p

[05-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some intermediary will setup some sort of hub service

[05-Oct-18 12:13 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder there may be some hub with points

[05-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
which is possible, just not mandated like it is for LN

[05-Oct-18 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a rabbit card here in Thailand - you have card can pay in metro, mcdonalds, burgerkings and etc

[05-Oct-18 12:14 PM] CrisF#3405
A prepaid wallet app.

[05-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, as long as the hub takes care of the backend, why not

[05-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
they can know their payment is securely received

[05-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so this seems the proper way to do LN

[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
make it 100% p2p at the low level, backward compatible and not require both nodes to be online

[05-Oct-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can add a hub on top without requiring an entirely new set of daemons, wallets, explorers, payment processors, etc

[05-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a nice clean and efficient design

[05-Oct-18 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Wow.
And this is only one of the CCs. 
Things sure are going to get exciting.

[05-Oct-18 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll get back to trying it out.

[05-Oct-18 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes each CC is like an entire crypto project

[05-Oct-18 12:24 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes! And then starting to combine them. Seems like almost anything will become possible!

[05-Oct-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[05-Oct-18 03:31 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r my hacked together script was able to open a channel.
I put in a wait, but it seems to wait for a confirm, but not a notarization.

[05-Oct-18 03:32 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll try a manual send on the open channels now.  Notarizations should have gone through.

[05-Oct-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no actual check for confirmations/notarizations yet

[05-Oct-18 03:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, that part was the stub.

[05-Oct-18 03:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I'll have a look again at what's happened.

[05-Oct-18 03:34 PM] CrisF#3405
It's only my 4th script so that's probably causing the trouble.

[05-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the check for notarization is internal, not really visible externally

[05-Oct-18 05:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Found a few mistakes in my script but there are some others I haven't been able to figure out yet. 
Payments are going through manually without trouble.
I'll have a look at the script again when I get back.

@CrisF link script? Not saying I can fix, but happy to look for my own purposes of understanding

had another intersting day yesterday. Dog escaped again. Used sisters car to try and find, cos ute wrecked last week. Her car shut down due to overheating, so I had to walk home, and then walk more to look for dog. Still no sight by midnight. went to sleep left door open, and he woke me up at 6am covered in river mud üòÇ

[06-Oct-18 04:08 AM] CrisF#3405

Ordered the little bugger a GPS tracker for next time.

[06-Oct-18 04:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, you should set up an ```oracle``` for the tracker!!

[06-Oct-18 04:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Shouldn't need a Rpi.  Can't you get stats/data from where ever gps data goes?

[06-Oct-18 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405
But maybe a Gopro could be added at some point.

[06-Oct-18 04:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah the tracker is a subscription service thing, so I'd have to do some haxx. sends data to phone, which I could tap into, but I'd prefer direct access. Might build something later, but had to get him sorted sooner than I have time to build.

When that's taken care of and if things set up it might make for a good example of tech possibilities for #komodo-team .

[06-Oct-18 04:27 AM] CrisF#3405
And maybe show ability of personal tracking systems.  (not corporate data collection.)
