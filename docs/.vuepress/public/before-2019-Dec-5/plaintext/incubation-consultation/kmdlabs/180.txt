What are the chances of getting elected though, do they change often? Do many notaries get reelected

[02-Jan-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
virt is great ... although it depends on how many IPs you end up needing, the DC said they can do NAT, but I preferred to just map IPs to MAC address of the VMs and manage it myself... as every time a coin is added you need to open more ports.

I started out the 1st quarter of last year never having thought of a server.  Got one for the scaling test and had 5 by December. Got a bigger dedicated one for xmas, haha.  Will have to figure out how to use them at some point...

Once you start, its hard to start

[02-Jan-19 04:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was in the same boat, never had one, or thought of using one. I now have a dedicated and a VPS

I think notary elections this year have been delayed until Q2 ... because we already had 2 hardforks in a year. Election isnt that hard, but I expect this year to be even more competetive. I think I was lukcy to get in last year as it was.

[02-Jan-19 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My wife was quite pissed off an confused when the 2RU rocked up here last year... those things are not quiet ... said there was 0 chance it was allowed to stay in my house... Luky I got elected and it was sent to DC to live üòÇ

I'd be up for running as a team. Going solo is a bit daunting. More interested in learning the next level than getting rich from it. If it pays for itself, I'd be content. 
Being a wageslave, it's also be nice to know there's a night watchman or two to cover. At worst, I could probably cover cash costs without having to sell KMD just to keep the lights on.

[02-Jan-19 05:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are there many that run as a team?

[02-Jan-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah team is a good idea, I am up for working something out, as our team will be disbanded at next election and a-team will 99% miss out of autoelection by a single ranking position in SH.

[02-Jan-19 05:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Quite a few.

That's not a bad idea, how do the teams usually run in house?

[02-Jan-19 05:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lots of teams

[02-Jan-19 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My team... is just one guy who I partnered with and a big voter, we share the mined KMD...

[02-Jan-19 05:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll put together a proposal over the next couple of months. Be good to have a diverse set of skills for contributing to all levels of KMD dev/promo etc

I have done all the work, servers is mine, I rent it to the team.

[02-Jan-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having a node, gives an income stream to fund the time you spend working on KMD... If your going to stick around here I would advise trying to get one 100%. Its not a huge a ount of work, this year multiple OPs have created almost completly automatic nodes.

[02-Jan-19 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
outside of inital setup its not a huge job.

[02-Jan-19 05:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's a great way of looking at it

[02-Jan-19 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When thigns go wrong, or hard forks and stuff... you can do some silly hours but generally its pretty easy. I spent vast hours early on, but had to start form basically 0 knowleddge of even linux let alone managing a full virtualised bare metal server on my own. üòÉ

[02-Jan-19 05:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
normally I like to diy everything, though with the right team there's chances to colab on stuff beyond indiv capability

[02-Jan-19 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly best ot make your own stuff...

[02-Jan-19 05:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Virtualization is high up on my todo list.

[02-Jan-19 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to migrate all my Vbox stuff to KVM locally in the commign weeks... aftet that and I know what I'm doing likely do the same to my main server... As using a trial vmware isnt realy the greatest idea long term. lol

Please add any ideas to pad.  Have a few things up for stats but more welcome.

[02-Jan-19 05:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Getting something up for stress test should be a good start.

[02-Jan-19 06:55 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It would be nice to add some IPv6 forward thinking to the code at some point - sooo much crypto code still lives on IPv4 for seeds etc.
Or at least to make stuff layer agnostic.
It's soo much easier to get a '48 than even a block of 5 IPv4

{Reactions}

[02-Jan-19 07:08 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you know much about that @Bar_F1sh_Rel?
I know less than nothing so am interested to see what the others have to say. :abusedsmily: 
Maybe it's something you'd like to work on?

[02-Jan-19 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is IP6 in the code, thats definatly something we cna look at... as it would be far cheaper for our VM's... IPv4 IP at my DC is $5 a month on its own, where as I think IPv6 is liek $1 for 5 address's lol.

[02-Jan-19 07:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Cheaper and easier... hmm...

[02-Jan-19 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure about easier, should be as simple as makeing sure addnode= can be an IPv6 address, and then setting up our nodes as IP6

[02-Jan-19 07:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Why hasn't more been done with it already?  Is it difficult?

[02-Jan-19 07:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really sure, but I am quite sure ipv6 is already supported...

[02-Jan-19 07:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just mostly unused.

[02-Jan-19 07:26 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
That.

[02-Jan-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKED is the chain I imported on... I guess it has forked.

[02-Jan-19 07:27 AM] CrisF#3405
It's been down for a while

[02-Jan-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its forked

[02-Jan-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess ites easier to just remove it :abusedsmily:

[02-Jan-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that stopping my miners would be enough to stop it forking, but that isnt the case. My notary has 21 connections.. I will try to resync my miners from the notary with connect= and see it it comes back to life

[02-Jan-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the chain the notaries are on have no blocks happening.

[02-Jan-19 07:30 AM] CrisF#3405
ED is a tough one.  Survived the blasting it took.

[02-Jan-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as noone does a rescan on the wallets that got blasted it should be totally fine. CFEK is the biggest chain by far. Losts of txns, takes quite a while to sync.

[02-Jan-19 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmmm tried to resync CFEKED here on staking node and its complaining of a corrrupt wallet.dat

[02-Jan-19 08:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
CFEK is drowning in oracle data, which is enough to make seem a bit insane.

[02-Jan-19 08:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I have over double the amount of notarizations on CFEK as the other 2 working chains over the last 2 days or so.

[02-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Mylo#8306
how is performance with lots of oracle data?

[02-Jan-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not great, but also much much faster than it was... We need lots of nodes to fill blocks with them to really know.

[02-Jan-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Some blocks that smks accidental spam produced, took over 30s to process on chain sync... I got it down to seconds... but the block isnt even close to full.

[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKED is living up to its name... I think I have killed it ... maye it will revive itself when 100% of notaries update

[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont think its likley to happen at this stage...

[02-Jan-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need new chains for stress test anyway.

[02-Jan-19 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems if you resync it it gets "unstuck" havent been able to find an RPC that unsticks it leaving a full resync te only way to fix it.

[02-Jan-19 09:59 AM] CrisF#3405
How about this for new chains for the stress test:

[02-Jan-19 10:00 AM] CrisF#3405
1.  logging chain -  get an idea of optimum params.  on demand?  
2. oracle chain - virgin chain for smk to spam with oracle data  (hmm.... sounds a bit off there on re-read  üóØ)

[02-Jan-19 10:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
call it pandora so we can continue the inuendo.  or `FEKBOX`.

[02-Jan-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will have to start with LAB/LABS/CFEK

[02-Jan-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless we change code...

[02-Jan-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
added a bunch of stuff to the pad... bit of rambling, but some good startig points for people to explore. Might be better wasy to do things than I listed, try to find them üòÑ

[02-Jan-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKED will sync for me on some nodes and not on others .... So its timet o kill it. something bad happened to it that doest seem able to be resolved.

[02-Jan-19 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, saw it!  Goof stuff!!

[02-Jan-19 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll incoporate that into the Todo at the top of the pad.

[02-Jan-19 10:32 AM] CrisF#3405
How about keep using CFEK... for the test chains? LABS... for working/tool chains (stats, backup, etc) and LAB... for test chains?  Something like that?

[02-Jan-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK was going to stay testnet stuff yes ... as they will usually end up FEKED üòÇ

abusedsmily 

[02-Jan-19 10:34 AM] CrisF#3405
I was thinking of LAB... for outside projects who might want to have their own chains added.

[02-Jan-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ...  if we end up needing multiple clusters more names can be added... Just having too many of them might slow it down a bit as the function that does that is called A LOT ! lol

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02-Jan-19 10:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I was wondering, what was the final verdict on adding a cluster to a cluster?

[02-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am an idiot ... I can change that function to hold a static value, then it can have unlimited chain names added üòÑ

[02-Jan-19 10:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No you cant add a cluster to a cluster

[02-Jan-19 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thauhgt about it.... It cant be done

[02-Jan-19 10:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Through a particular chain or chains being able to interact with different clusters.

[02-Jan-19 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see what you mean .... and what it would need to happen is to take the MoMoM from each cluster and notarise it to all chains in the cluster... kind of gets too ahrd to do... A better test will be to see how many chains a cluster cna reliably run using current software ... That will be some future test building on what we are doing here.

[02-Jan-19 10:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, first things first. Maybe something worth keeping in mind.  That would become very powerful I figure.

[02-Jan-19 10:45 AM] CrisF#3405
CFEK notarizations are really flying for me.  2 and 4x more than ING and LF.

[02-Jan-19 10:46 AM] CrisF#3405
ING and LF have been notarizing regularly too.

[02-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see it as something like what marketing asked for, a cluster that just keeps adding chains automatically as it has full blocks ... just keep on adding a chain every hour and fill blocks until it stops working üòÑ

[02-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ED is forked ... and wont even sync ... no idea why.

[02-Jan-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rest of it seems ok.

[02-Jan-19 10:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Would be interesting to make a chain like that üêõ.  :caterpillar:

[02-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Mylo#8306
If I wanted to only observe the oracles chain as a full node operator - is it CFEK and if it is what is the what‚Äôs the start command so I can see format of oraclized data?

[02-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Mylo#8306
Can I use vanilla kmd or is LABS kmd ‚Äúspecial‚Äù?

[02-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
CFEK has a lot of oracle data from smk's testing.

[02-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks.  & that is where the stats will come out of to post somewhere?

[02-Jan-19 11:12 AM] CrisF#3405
If @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is around maybe he can tell us how to view it.

[02-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah a cheat sheet of stuff would be cool.

[02-Jan-19 11:14 AM] CrisF#3405
There will be stats taken from all chains.  There will be new chains added to the cluster for the stress test by the sounds of it.

[02-Jan-19 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
No cheat sheet yet,  still figuring out what we need and then to start making it.

[02-Jan-19 11:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Blackjok3r has just done a lot of work at https://kmdlabs.cc/p/logging_stats_project.
