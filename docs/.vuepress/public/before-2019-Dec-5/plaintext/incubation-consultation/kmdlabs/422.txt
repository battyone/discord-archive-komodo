[08-Jun-19 03:38 PM] AkiraX#8269
who the hell has 1m of hash

[08-Jun-19 03:38 PM] AkiraX#8269
2m

[08-Jun-19 03:38 PM] AkiraX#8269
2 of them

[08-Jun-19 03:38 PM] AkiraX#8269
holy shit

[08-Jun-19 03:39 PM] AkiraX#8269
i should probably ROI before i mine kmdlabs?

[08-Jun-19 03:39 PM] AkiraX#8269
who knows what i will even be able to sell these at

[08-Jun-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I have a decent amount of hash, but far from huge; I fell way behind the curve these last 6 months

@Alright I had it twice in a few days, and I had to completely restart the OS for it to start.

but how do i know where it is staking to?

[08-Jun-19 08:19 PM] AkiraX#8269
what address is it using?

[08-Jun-19 08:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
this is just the output when the chain is syncing

[08-Jun-19 08:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
once done syncing, you can clone this repo, generate 64 addresses & send your LABS to these 64 addrs then start  staking

[08-Jun-19 09:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
I tried to run LABS on another server, but LABS stuff probably isn't merged yet with jl777?

[08-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jorian#4555
i thought it was synced with dev branch

[08-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jorian#4555
not sure though

am i staking properly?

[09-Jun-19 01:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@AkiraX use `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getgenerate` to see if you are staking

[09-Jun-19 01:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it should return
```{

  "generate": false,
  "numthreads": 0
}
```

[09-Jun-19 01:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if it doesnt, use `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS setgenerate true 0`

Bet1 has problems I'm not sure who is meant to fix it.

[09-Jun-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to fix sync issue but maybe it broke more things. The prices chains are just touchy I think, I don't know enough about hownit works to say for sure if my "fix" caused it to break or its some other bug

[09-Jun-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case its not a priority right now so I'll probably leave it be unless I get bored and run out of other work. Tbh its not my job to dev and debug every cc labs tests.

[09-Jun-19 03:49 AM] AkiraX#8269
@blackjok3r do I have to use Linux for the stake?

[09-Jun-19 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I do, can't say either way because I haven't used windows for years

[09-Jun-19 04:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe we should post a bounty/vote for debug? I too am busy with other work at this stage, but may be able to have a look next weekend.

Thats correct @Bar_F1sh_Rel if you find a fix, you can nominate for a bounty via vote.

Ryan?

@TonyL  I'll look at it again tomorrow, I have some back traces sent and yes, seed node down causes forks :6849_pepeold:

[09-Jun-19 02:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm it looks like a huge bottleneck

[09-Jun-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs will work when ppl have time to actually find bugs and apply for bounties? Maybe nobody ever has time

[09-Jun-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Chicken and egg lol

[09-Jun-19 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
So just seed DDoS can cause forks

_finally has all of his wallets back in order and will be funding and repairing his LABS NN shortly_

[09-Jun-19 02:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It could with this chain yes

[09-Jun-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For labs I disabled seeds in the code, because to test stuff u need to have known good peers or the code freaks out. It can't find the right chain. We are playing with consensus code here to a good seed node is very important

problem with CFEKBET1(and LABSEX I assume) is that the addnodes in the params aren't being added properly for some reason

trying to stake labs?

[09-Jun-19 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
yep ;_; sorry dudes needs to wait a bit longer, joker is doing most of the dev work needed for the KMD fork and most of the 3rd party coin forks. Agama BS set us back a couple days, so LABS hasn't been the priority :/

[09-Jun-19 09:46 PM] AkiraX#8269
hey alright

[09-Jun-19 09:46 PM] AkiraX#8269
how are you man?

[09-Jun-19 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
Tony, joker and I have been doing most of the work for prices stuff, and we're all swamped with KMD work until at least June 15

[09-Jun-19 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
so, just drop it from the json for a day or 3?

[09-Jun-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
@AkiraX I am ok, how about yourself
