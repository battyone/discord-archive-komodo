@blackjok3r any suggestions short of reindex and come back to it tomorrow?

[26-Jan-19 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think after the fix downloading a bootstrap and restarting will be the fastest way, maybe you can reconsider block like 100 blocks vac

[26-Jan-19 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Back?

[26-Jan-19 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I broke kmd good, the latest will fix but it could already be stuck

[26-Jan-19 02:15 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
got a handy link for bootstrap?

[26-Jan-19 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Staked Noraty readme has one I think

[26-Jan-19 02:15 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
nm, I never deleted the old tar

[26-Jan-19 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was able to reconsider the last block on my node here when testing the fix

[26-Jan-19 02:33 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Well, invalidateblock was a bad idea 游땥

[26-Jan-19 02:33 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`[KMD] Synced on block: 0`

[26-Jan-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I said reconsider 游땥

[26-Jan-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not invalidate

[26-Jan-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is still syncing... 游땭

[26-Jan-19 02:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
reconsider didn't do any good until I went 100 blocks back

[26-Jan-19 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sometimes I wish I had  newer CPUs lol.... Syncing a notary node with the private key imported is never a fun experiance

[26-Jan-19 02:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

its not athreadreipper is a 2700x ... 1/4 of a threadripper and no notary is on Opteron A64's

[26-Jan-19 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Fucking oldschool...

[26-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got it for massive amounts of cheap ram.... Does a fine job until you need to resync everything....

[26-Jan-19 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt actaully ned tro resync it I guess... But a full sync needed to be tested incase I broke something... so may as well be me,. 80% dont 200k blocks left... but that might take 4-5H... lucky I have plenty of other thigns to do.

[26-Jan-19 02:40 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'll sell you a i9-9900k full setup for the low price of $10k USD :troll:

[26-Jan-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This thing is fine...

[26-Jan-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does that have 256GB fo ram?

[26-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That would be the onlyt thing I think my server should ahve... but all ram slots are full 游땭

[26-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had to remove all my seed nodes from it yesteday and run everything open on main notary VM 游땭 rauuing oiut of ram when compiling stuff... causig Soft locks of the entire server... just goes unresponisve for 2mins

only got 32gb in the home computer.. 64 would be better but I dont think the single memcontroller handles it well at high speeds

[26-Jan-19 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need threadripper for that

[26-Jan-19 02:42 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
when the bull comes back, I'm getting the big threadripper

[26-Jan-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why jopt just get a 64 core EPYC workstation ?

[26-Jan-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with 512GB or ram :trollface:

[26-Jan-19 02:43 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
because a gajillion cores at 2GHz is still just 2GHz

[26-Jan-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
true... that single core boost is nice

[26-Jan-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats the problem with the Opterons in my server... the PhenonII chips were like 3-4Ghz ... these locked at 2.2 slow as fuck single thread

[26-Jan-19 02:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
between the 2 CPUs, I've got 20 cores and 40 threads on my Z10PE-D16, but at like 2.3GHz it's quite underwhelming for "non-server" tasks

[26-Jan-19 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD load here on boosted 4.3ghz single core is 120s ... server takes 5min+

[26-Jan-19 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But thats lik 8years old.... with consumer SSDs vs brand nerw and nvme

[26-Jan-19 02:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
RAID5 makes any time tests I do moot on that thing 游땥

[26-Jan-19 02:50 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'll take the time hit before I ever lose data again

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... RAID1 for server, and HDD locally here... From manfromaus advice... seems to work sweet, read times are super quick. Thats all that matters for  NN...

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
fwiw, I'm notarizing again now that KMD chain is moving 游땥

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
user cheaper drives and RAID1 them he said... bestr advice ever

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Was just about to ask that. good to know for anyone else

[26-Jan-19 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you juist reconsider liek 100 blocks ago?

[26-Jan-19 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
ya 100 back from where I was stuck

[26-Jan-19 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and then did clean on each because I had the screen open, but it was working again before the clean

[26-Jan-19 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
makes sense as it was getting "stucK" sthinking KMD was CFEK... still got no idea how that bug never appeared before ...

[26-Jan-19 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after I found it it seemed quite an obvious flaw in the codes logic

[26-Jan-19 02:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
stop doing that :troll:

[26-Jan-19 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ha... was one of the first bit of code I made for staked... it never worked too well... I think the latest function is pretty safe though

[26-Jan-19 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now LABST is stuck too right? I'll need to get some staking wweight cranking on that...

[26-Jan-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see its had a ferw 50-60 block reorgs...so there was/is 2 competing chains

[26-Jan-19 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
about 2 hrs ago was the last LABST block I made and I haven't seen any other since either

[26-Jan-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[26-Jan-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should not get stuck...

[26-Jan-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even with low stakig weight

[26-Jan-19 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
may indicate a problem.. but like I said there is 2 competing chains... it might have just gone caput

Will need to use a new ip for launch.

[26-Jan-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My advice is to not import private key

[26-Jan-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I have been cleaning out server... can probably get a few NN on it...

[26-Jan-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Setting up some new VMs soon... Thinking about putting BTC on HDD... just too much SSD space lol.

[26-Jan-19 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Knowing my luck as sson as I do it the drive will fail tho

[26-Jan-19 03:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Not import privkeys = not ./start.sh?

[26-Jan-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah to sync it... just do ./komodod from master folder

[26-Jan-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did it with start.sh

[26-Jan-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Should the NN be on it's own vps, or would a VM be ok?

both are much the same... My notary is on VM on my own server

Yeah, working but still needs some messing around.
Took a solid week of nights to figure it out, haha.
Finally found the answer I needed.
Some simple thing that everyone probably knows, haha.

my notary node has slipped toi 9th in SH over last few weeks... 游땭

[26-Jan-19 03:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Does it need to be 4th or above for auto-election?

[26-Jan-19 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
7th of above was said... but SH has more nodes... I always figured 8th would be good and we held it most of the year.... I fear the extended election timeframe will mean its got not much chance of getting auto elected... Done better than I thaught was possible though

[26-Jan-19 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I didnt share my optimisations.... probably be near top :abusedsmily:

[26-Jan-19 03:16 AM] CrisF#3405
