eras = versions of working programs?

[29-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
we have a mechanism for changing notary node keys via "eras"

[29-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Exile13#4458
ah

[29-Apr-19 06:29 PM] Alright#0419
not to be confused with `ac_eras` btw, nothing to do with this

[29-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant please read the above proposed lottery mechanism and let me know what you think. Maybe we can do a notary vote to determine whether or not we'll launch with 20 NNs or 22 NNs.

[29-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
notary vote should be as simple as having an oracle you post to from your notary NN key

[29-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
vote should be explicit with no default outcome, ie two options `20` or `22`

[29-Apr-19 06:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
nice way to test first vote

[29-Apr-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
I guess there must be a default outcome in the event that 51% do not vote?

[29-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
So default would be `no change`

[29-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
`no change` unless >50% say `change`

[29-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Exile13#4458
for the participants, whats ` post some data to an oracle` consist of?

[29-Apr-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
anything

[29-Apr-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
must be unique to them

[29-Apr-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
so maybe `handle+<anything>` to make sure it's unique to everyone

[29-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
or `pubkey+<anything>`

[29-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Alright#0419
think of the <anything> as you choosing lotto numbers

[30-Apr-19 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it probably is. But it could also be something else.

ok cool. pushed update

[30-Apr-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just do start.sh, and see if that fixes it

Updating everything didn't fix it, but a good `zapping` got it working.
Looks like reindexing, zapping will sort it and latest push should prevent it in the first place.  ‚òò

If I am elected as NN, I will give 20% of my earnings to kmdlabs (and 20% to chips). My proposal was clarified
At first I wanted to pay many servers for kmdlabs but less servers and a direct donation can help more (I discussed it a bit on discord)
Congrats for your work and involvment !

```Game based on paymentsCC:
    - Payments plan will be funded by entire coinbase via founders reward, and use VerusHash1.1 algo for the faster diff adjustent. and a 5minute block time. 
    - range of address that the paymentsCC uses is determined by lastsnapshotheight global var. deteministic formula, that gives a number below 50 and a number above 50. cant be 0.
    - The range of address paid is the percentage that lie between these two numbers.
    - snapshot = 288, notarised freq = 5. ~ 30 notarizations between snapshots, and a possible payout each day. 
    - The object of the game is to have balance in the range when the payment is released. 
    - Anyone can release the payment, and you will know the height the next snapshot will be at.
    - Obviously the goal is to get as many coins as possible.  ```
Came up with this as a way for us to test the payments CC. Pretty much everything exists to do this, apart from ` deteministic formula, that gives a number below 50 and a number above 50. cant be 0.`

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  
Fixed `getimports` RPC. vout position was changed. easy fix. 
Also pushing update that disables token migrates to LABS chain in the RPC, and rejects token import in validation on LABS chain, as tokens are disabled on this chain. 
Also getrawtransaction is now fixed with some upstream merges from FSM that I merged in. Will be mergeing paymentsCC down too for the game, so no need for anyone to update now unless you need a specific fix here.
Also fixed `getNotarisationsForBlock` RPC on KMD. So it shows LABS notarizations again.

```    - Chain starts with 10B supply. I have this and will distribute it evenly to all participants. 
    - Payments plan will be funded via founders reward 10M coins every 1440 blocks.
    - The range of addresses paid is determined by the last notarized block hash before the snapshot height, which is every 1440 blocks. the top and the bottom(3999th) address cannot be paid. 
    - snapshot = 1440, notarised freq = 10. ~ 144 notarizations between snapshots. 
    - The object of the game is to have balance in the range when the payment is released. 
    - Anyone can release the payment, 20 blocks after the snapshot. 
    - The balance of your addresses at the notarized height will deternmine what rank on the rich list you are. 
    - If you move coins after this, you still get paid the same amount. All you can do is release the previous days mined coins to the set range.
    -You can release half the funds, locking the other half until the next snapshot.
    - I guess you could fund the plan with extra coins but they would be locked there for 1440 blocks, so the next snapshot would have happened by then, changeing the range.
    - I guess the goal is to not have the address with the most funds in it, but also have enough so that your somewhere in the top 3998. ```

What is this nonsense üòù

[02-May-19 03:48 PM] Mylo#8306
I don‚Äôt get it though.  I understand it‚Äôs a clever game to test, but what is ‚Äúrange of addresses‚Äù?

[02-May-19 03:52 PM] Mylo#8306
You‚Äôve gotta have a balance in the rich list between rank #2 and #3998 on the list?
So 4000 addresses approx will share the founders fee of 10MM coins...roughly 2500 each winning address.

[02-May-19 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the range it pays to changes each day...

[02-May-19 04:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you have richlist from top to bottom, and it chooses a range based on last notarized block hash to pay the reward to.

[02-May-19 04:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It could pay 98% the adderes or it could pay 2% of them in the centre only.

[02-May-19 04:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyone can release half the funds or more only once per day.

It will need to be LABS komodo I think because we need notarizations for it to work properly

yeah so fire up the chain and then do a bunch of commandline/RPC stuff and we're playing?

my eyes....see.... `plantx.vout[plantx.vout.size()-1].scriptPubKey` and i wonder.....why not `GetTXLastVoutScriptPK(tx)`

[02-May-19 04:41 PM] Mylo#8306
i guess i'll be joining the vout party soon enough

[02-May-19 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, we got the Verus Enhanced CCs working. This is using that, which make thigns a bit simpler actaully. as the payload op_return is attached to the end of the CCvout itself.... 
```if ( (opret_ind= has_opret(txin, EVAL_PAYMENTS)) == 0 )
                            opret = getCCopret(txin.vout[vin.prevout.n].scriptPubKey); // get op_return from CCvout, 
                        else
                            opret = txin.vout[opret_ind].scriptPubKey; 
                        if ( DecodePaymentsFundOpRet(opret,checktxid) != 'F' || checktxid != createtxid )```
