ok, sounds like you know what needs to be done

[01-Mar-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
specific implementation details likely wont matter much as it isnt any large dataset it is dealing with

[01-Mar-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just need to talk to someone about it, as I only kind of know what neds to be done, I still dont know exactly how ti all works

[01-Mar-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
work with dimxy, he is close to that part of the codebase

[01-Mar-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep cool. Hopefully he can help with impletation side of it, as he seems far more experianced than me at that.

[01-Mar-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
he knows the C++

[01-Mar-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ill try to get something hacky working, and work with him to improve it. As I dont think anyone else knows enough about iguana etc, to get it all playing nicely.

[01-Mar-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, good plan.

```MoMoM fix:
    `uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(symbol, ccid, kmdheight, moms, destNotarisationTxid);`
     must check that the first notarization it is using is itself notarized on KMD. 
     lastnotarized height function will be safe enough (better still is to use DB and count back 2 nota of KMD, as this makes sure the nota is in the chain on resync)
        notarized height is faster, DB slower, its safe to assume all notaries are online, and as such cannot reorg past the last notarized height. 

need to add a bool falg to notarization class that sets and locks to true after 3 nota happened for an asset chain on the KMD daemon.  
iguana needs an error from MoMoMdata RPC on KMD when MoMoM cannot be detemined from above. this enable nota round to bail out until needed data is there.
    checking for last 2 nota made are confirmed and notarized and so cannot be reorged. we then use these 2 determinate data points to create MoMoM hash.
    the first 3 notarizations must have a null MoMoM returned to iguana, and not the error, to make sure that enough MoM  hash exist to get a determinate MoMoM hash
```

A chain cannot start yet... but if it already has notarizations then it should work, also doesnt need a reindex of KMD at this point

it can still determine MoMoM from a lower KMD height.. if notas didnt happen after that height

yeah its works.. but Im not sure that it will include all MoM's by using KMd notarized height rather than KMD height

[02-Mar-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
testing it now.

[02-Mar-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are no more NULL MoMoM but there are lots of dupes

[02-Mar-19 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe rather than notarized height it just needs to do KMDheight-10 and just assume that it has been notarized. ü§î

[02-Mar-19 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will try some migrates and see what happens I guess

[02-Mar-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or first KMDheight - 10+ that is notarized? meaning, scan backwards from KMDheight-10 until you find a notarized one

[02-Mar-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The heigh iguana uses... I made the daemon only work with notarized heights... but that mean iguana will never fetch any MoMoM ... something like KMD height -5 or -10 would likely be enough to make it reliable... Will see what happens with the current setting. Right now, if there is a long gap onj KMD (already seedn 20 or 30 block gaps for some reason) then everyhting stops for quite some time.

[02-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not all notarization rounds succeed

[02-Mar-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still dont understand how it determining the range it uses for MoM hashes

[02-Mar-19 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like does it know the last one it used? it seems that it does not/

[02-Mar-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just scans back 2 notarizations from the given height... so if a MoM hash falls between this then it would be missed.

[02-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
seems you need to remember the last notarization height you used

[02-Mar-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however it works.... right now it appesrs to be working... just slowed migrates down a LOT

[02-Mar-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
I think that what I tried didnt work, too agressive the other way,. Pushed fix to use just kmdheight -5 in iguana. 
Due to the sledghammer MoMoM fix, we can delay MoMoM hashes and the target chain can still locate them. This is working currently, but if notarization on KMD are too far apart we are losing MoM hashes. Migrates still work, but the are extremely slow (like 1H each migrate). and I dot have time to wait to test this, seems to not work so we need to try something simpler.
This is a very simple change, that makes some assumptions, but its far safer than what it was doing before.  If this proves stable we can work on making it make less assumptions. 

I am updating my notary now with this fix and have to leave town for the night. It would be really helpful if you guys can update and then loop migrates to test and log import fails.  You are spcifically looking for the `sendrawtransaction` step to on the target chain (last step) to fail with `momom-check-fail` But give it a good hour at least of polling it before giving up and logging it as a fail. The script here is a good example and is what I am using with some small changes.

No worries. I'm back. Seems I left my notary on the broken commit., in my rush to leave. But the chains have been being notarized. After I've had tea, I will re-enable my MoMoM print locally here and checkfor NULL MoMoM hashes. From what the old commit was printing on notary when i checked it ebfore, it looks like tehre are no longer any NULL MoMoM hashes. Likely means that it is fixed, at least when the chain isnt being reorged.
