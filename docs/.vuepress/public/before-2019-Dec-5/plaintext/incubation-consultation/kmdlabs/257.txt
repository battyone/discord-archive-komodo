Some respectful members of pirate like @mrlynch want to run for a NN and give funding to PIRATE

[29-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
Ah right

[29-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419

[29-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
So maybe a new batch of keys is a good idea on next update. But that s just my opinion

[29-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
worry about getting elected *then* worry about figuring out how to run it

[29-Jan-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419

[29-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s a question people ask me : my answer is : for fun and new faces ^^

[29-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
I have a theory about the NN guides being intentionally bad to dissuade people from running

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And yeah that s like shooting myself in the foot :p

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
It's not in a NN's best interest to teach other people to run a notary

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] jorian#4555
like everything around here, it's doable if you know where to look

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] jorian#4555
it's not that everything else is so properly documented

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yet I believe this knowledge should be shared

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
"where to look" is right here

[29-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Alright#0419

1500 kmd 0.5 cts - server cost and add the fact that maybe we ll need multiple servers

[29-Jan-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I'm ready to start it if you think those params I pm'd will work

[29-Jan-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seem fine... the notary payment is seperate from all other validation... any aprams but ac_pubkey and -ac_script should wrok.

[29-Jan-19 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
is it a test chain? have been out of the loop for a couple of days

[29-Jan-19 06:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made a noptary payment chain in 24H üòÇ

[29-Jan-19 06:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it pays per notartsation in the coinvbase to notaries who partiicpated in a valid notarisation

[29-Jan-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419

[29-Jan-19 06:09 PM] jorian#4555
thx üëç

[29-Jan-19 06:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it works... currently you guys can invent heaps of fre coins...

[29-Jan-19 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
interesting idea

[29-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if this doesnt work reliably we need a CC contract for it... which is possible just much harder

[29-Jan-19 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
that's what i wondered about OUR indeed, the dynamic amounts sent to founders

[29-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This was a fair bit harder than that....

[29-Jan-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r lay out the test plan here please

[29-Jan-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
not entirely sure what you have finished

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok.

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We just need to start it and once notarisations starrt happening... blocks will be mined with extra coins paiud to the notaries who notarised

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
right now if the amount is wrong or validation fails

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just lets it in as a valid block

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the validation works though

[29-Jan-19 06:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least for the most part

[29-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Notaries just let any block be valid... hopefully it doesnt fork too much üòÇ

[29-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so we can both test changes to validation locally adn see if ti syncs.

[29-Jan-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or try and break validation

[29-Jan-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries will just keep notarising and creationg coins

[29-Jan-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
ac_notarypay is working?

[29-Jan-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
or did you hardcode it for now?

[29-Jan-19 06:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes in notarytest branch

[29-Jan-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its working

[29-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
sats? coins?

[29-Jan-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sats per notary per notarisation

[29-Jan-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
simple

[29-Jan-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a consensus rule... whatever that amount is the notary vouts are all that many sats

[29-Jan-19 06:18 PM] Alright#0419
dude we really need to get rid of the orphan cleaning thing for now

[29-Jan-19 06:18 PM] Alright#0419
seems every restart is requiring a reindex

[29-Jan-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it is

[29-Jan-19 06:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or the new one?

[29-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
did you remove it yesterday?

[29-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
I was on a build from yesterday

[29-Jan-19 06:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure when but the orphan fix is long gone
