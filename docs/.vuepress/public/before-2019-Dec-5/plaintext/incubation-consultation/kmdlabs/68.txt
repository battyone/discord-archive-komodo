[03-Nov-18 04:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
well I cant really stake then unless I get another node up...

[03-Nov-18 04:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
as a Staked notary, with the req to be staking, that means two node needed yeah?

[03-Nov-18 04:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, seems so.

[03-Nov-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You really dont need to be staking... the chains with 0 BR should be handled by their creator

[03-Nov-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When staked goes live, you will need a very small VPS or a computer at home to stake with

[03-Nov-18 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe I can make it so that notaries can stake though, its not impossible, as long as the staker ignores 1 utxo all the time and does not stake it so that the notary has somethign to split with

[03-Nov-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other option is to use two address, and be able to make the staker ignore all notary address's.

[03-Nov-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But for that I need to fix my linker problem in dwy_mitigation2 branch üò¶

[03-Nov-18 04:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if its only staking the main chain, easy enough to setup something cheap

[03-Nov-18 04:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
GPS parts have arrived üòÉ still got a lot of work ahead tho. oraclesdata not really talking to me yet. no errors, just empty strings on fetch. Might be being sent wrong for publication? need to ask @Alright a few things to make sure I'm doing it right.

I have no idea why, but calling importpriv key with rescn false doesnt work, when its a few scripts deep. giving up before I waste an entire day on this, reverting back to old method.. üò¶

I can give you a key if you want to get one up

saves me doing another one

@gt  üëÜ  Give it a try üòÉ

[03-Nov-18 07:53 AM] gt#2812
i can give it a whirl but i only have a little while before i have some errands

[03-Nov-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gettin ti started is not ahrd, its the sync of KMD that will take a while, get it started and then go out, hoepfully be don when you get back?

[03-Nov-18 07:54 AM] gt#2812

yeah i‚Äôve got that loaded up

[03-Nov-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok DM config.ini for you

[03-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just finally got something working thats taken a few days, no Idea if it will be stable or even work properly... but, if it does.. 
We now have dwy attack mitigation built in for staked notaries, and it automatically follows eras, and changing pubkeys... getting the active pubkeys to be accessiable was difficult to say the least, and I had to do a lot of dodgy code and hacks to make it work.

[03-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after ive tested it, will need to clean it up a bit...

[03-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully this will also allow purging of old wallet transactions on the fly, so you dont need to reset it any more... Once all the vouts of a TX are spent, it just deletes it from the wallet, if I cna get that working.

[03-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
James said this was dangerous and not to mess with it, but its worth a try üòÑ

That was very hard.... like extremly so

The only problem is now, tha using -pubkey= on daemon start is not compatible ... might be able to fix that now though I solved the compiler errors ü§î

yes... Im working on anyther branch that might be totally broken... My two nodes can see each other, sont see any others though

[03-Nov-18 09:25 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm seeing 4 again.  Was 3 for a while.

[03-Nov-18 09:26 AM] CrisF#3405
@gt Did you get your node up?

[03-Nov-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have blackjok3r , blackjok3r3 and alrighttest1 in mine

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I see Blackjok3r

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I cna see your node in the extra debug prints in iguana is talking to me

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] gt#2812
i thought i got it up

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
f your on a diff branch its not going to work

[03-Nov-18 09:27 AM] CrisF#3405

[03-Nov-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  I think your iguana is wrong

[03-Nov-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in my debug prints

[03-Nov-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you have less data than the other nodes

[03-Nov-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
menas you might eb o version without MoMoM for CFEK chains

[03-Nov-18 09:28 AM] CrisF#3405

[03-Nov-18 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, good.  Why wasn't it correct before?

[03-Nov-18 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Don't think I missed an update.

[03-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed the branch in the install script, ... the start.sh just assumes supernet is on the right one

I have a VM now ready to start on StakedNotary if needed (waiting on config.ini)

[03-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I also have a VM up with the chains that I can stake with

[03-Nov-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool I guess we are waiting for Alright again now .. I dont ahve any more keys I can share ... if we have enough people we cna do an era change and add new keys.

[03-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does seems something wrong with tit though.

[03-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is 4 nodes now in recv... smk, alright and greantea are not showing up still here

[03-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like no comunication at all

[03-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as if those nodes were down

[03-Nov-18 10:24 AM] gt#2812
hmm

[03-Nov-18 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Which one is gcharang?

[03-Nov-18 10:25 AM] gt#2812
ill take a look at it again later

[03-Nov-18 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Well, my utxo tx finally went through!

[03-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
btw - my plain node (using the assetchains script) only started CFEK, CFEKED and CFEKING - is that correct?

[03-Nov-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say so, becuase  without the extra logic to build and use the right branh they will either fork or crash

./start.sh <name>

[03-Nov-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and handle the branches... it should not make any symlinks, and container itself to its own folder, but its not 100% tested or finished yet.

[03-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used that repo to start all chains llast night without issue. Use a diffrent config.ini

[03-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All those config.ini things can be changed or removed now too, as we have `setpubkey` RPC

[03-Nov-18 10:37 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I used a modified assetchains script - with the redirect to null and expand - so it started the three itself

[03-Nov-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Any better verisons people can com up with a re welcome

[03-Nov-18 10:39 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think I am missing two chains (libscott?) - if so, what are they - I can try a manual start

[03-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the libscott branch has an extra fix for MOMOM ... and the FSM_mempoolfix has the KMDICE mempool fix in it

[03-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are there to test with a control

[03-Nov-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but without working momom notarisations I can test anything yet

[03-Nov-18 10:46 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r I'm wondering the same as SMK asked about earlier.
How do I start staking from cli?

[03-Nov-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to stake on a node, you must meet some conditions:
setgenerate true 0 will put you in stakeing mode

[03-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in this mode, youc ant mine, or run a pool
