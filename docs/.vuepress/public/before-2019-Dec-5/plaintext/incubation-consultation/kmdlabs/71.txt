[04-Nov-18 12:19 AM] Alright#0419

various scripts we have developed on STAKED so far, none of these are perfect and some might not even work. use them as examples of what you can do. - StakedChain/PoS_scripts

ignore the thing about master branch

[04-Nov-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
you need to run whatever branch the chain requires

[04-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes you can, but you need KMD running to migrate

[04-Nov-18 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The `migratecoin.sh` script is very well commetned and easy to follow

[04-Nov-18 12:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using the staked repo to start each chain, and komodo needs to be started from master branch of that repo also, the normal versions are not cmpatible.

[04-Nov-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
you just need to do a sendrawtransaction on KMD, yes? @blackjok3r

[04-Nov-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
oh wait, nope

[04-Nov-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need the proof to sign the TX before you can import it

[04-Nov-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats wher the error was happenign efore... I just stopped all my transaction loops... and made them a bit better again. Should handle if I need to take a daeomon down temorarily now.

[04-Nov-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had about 1000 migrates all sucessful

From CFEK -> all chains... one every 30s... should acheive total coverage of all blocks.

[04-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
can we host a server that will only do the KMD side stuff?

[04-Nov-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it might be possible...

[04-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
it can be any KMD daemon, yes?

[04-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't need any specific keys imported

[04-Nov-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It does not require a  wallet or anything... its just quering the notariation DB

take raw transaction, pass it to RPC get raw transaction back

[04-Nov-18 01:04 AM] Alright#0419
should look at the code for that^

[04-Nov-18 01:04 AM] Alright#0419
maybe it's just doing sendrawtransaction rpc

[04-Nov-18 01:04 AM] Alright#0419
and we could change it to whatever

if your testing those, please log any failed import txs

[04-Nov-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so far I have 0

[04-Nov-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a combination, of suppress every 3 KMD blocks, and not stopping after finding one notariation in a block has helped it a lot.

[04-Nov-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ibscottts sledgehammer fix is also working well, but spams a few erross while its scannign around blocks looking for th valid momom hash

[04-Nov-18 02:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had one earlier on CFEKLF cos it crashed I think, re ./start.sh'd  and its all good

[04-Nov-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that chain didnt have getrawtreansacton fix until some time very late last night

[04-Nov-18 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
if you have any failed ones, please log them

[04-Nov-18 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
we need to see if we're able to recover them

[04-Nov-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can always recover if you keep the export TX and the payouts

[04-Nov-18 02:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've pretty much echoed everything, so easy to point it to a logfile.

[04-Nov-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah thats how mine works .. with some extra stuff sent to particualr files inside the script itself

[04-Nov-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then I just grep the folder for Confirmed import and export to get % of fails

[04-Nov-18 02:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whats the best way for triggering a script from a curl event feed url?

[04-Nov-18 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not too sure

[04-Nov-18 02:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been trying a few and using smk's script. Had one fail earlier with an old script due to core dump.
None gone through by time I left.
Waiting on import conf on kmd for long time.

I found a bug! The script that calcualtes total supply in the repo doesnt know about migrates... Still says 4 0BR chains have only 1000 balance... when its over 3000 now, just from me

`komodo-cli -ac_name=$coin coinsupply`  is no good for getting total supply.

[04-Nov-18 04:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just had a fail

[04-Nov-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great 😃

[04-Nov-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What happened ?

[04-Nov-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do you have all the raw hex that your script prints out at the end?

[04-Nov-18 04:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, cant paste tho. and drag file not activating?

IS this right ?

[04-Nov-18 04:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not intentional...

[04-Nov-18 04:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but I do have a large banace on CFEK

[04-Nov-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`  if (txout.nValue > MAX_MONEY)`

[04-Nov-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the code you broke

[04-Nov-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[04-Nov-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cannot send a transaction that is larger thean the money supply

[04-Nov-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think possibly this should be checked on the sending side.... if possible

🤔  what is maxmoney supply anyway

[04-Nov-18 04:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I think 1000 for all except CFEK

[04-Nov-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```        else if ( ASSETCHAINS_REWARD == 0 )
            MAX_MONEY = (ASSETCHAINS_SUPPLY+100) * SATOSHIDEN;
        else MAX_MONEY = (ASSETCHAINS_SUPPLY+100) * SATOSHIDEN + ASSETCHAINS_REWARD * (ASSETCHAINS_ENDSUBSIDY==0 ? 10000000 : ASSETCHAINS_ENDSUBSIDY);
        MAX_MONEY += (MAX_MONEY * ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION) / SATOSHIDEN;```

[04-Nov-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems prety complicated .. but there is nothing ther for clusters...

[04-Nov-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mayeb for is_STAKED or ac_cc>100 this should be set to some extrem large number ... or a definable param by the chain creator.

[04-Nov-18 05:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
would having a migration exchange rate based on relative money supply value be non-trivial? :trollface:

[04-Nov-18 05:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, that wouldn't have have resulted in a core dump would it?

[04-Nov-18 05:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I was doing a fairly large migrate when that happened.

[04-Nov-18 05:30 AM] CrisF#3405
The ones I'm doing now are all more than 1000 too.

[04-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is bugs in some daemons, and if the auto start sctipt hasnt been doing the updates properly (it hasnt) then you might be on a version that has the gettransacion crash .. prety sure every eingle script we use here has my waitforconfirm bash function in them, which will crashthe daemon on that bug, we had 3  branches with itin on testnet launch.

[04-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My notary just crahsed LF

[04-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There still exists a bug in start, whetre its getting stuck, trying to stop CFEK

[04-Nov-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To make 100% sure you build all new binaries incase geting stuck has broken it.... `./stop.sh` remove the folder `komodo` from INSIDE StakedNotary  then star tagian.

[04-Nov-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I reccoment using `staked` or` StakedNotary` to start the chains for testing stuff to avoid human error starting on the wrong branch...
