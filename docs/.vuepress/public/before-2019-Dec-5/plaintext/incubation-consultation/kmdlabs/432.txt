maybe I shoudl reset wallet in order to have 8 utxo for each AC and KMD (I left default values as I reinstalled today on the same VM)

[14-Jun-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
utxo isnt important lisunspent time is

[14-Jun-19 03:14 PM] phm87#7395
ok thx

[14-Jun-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have very fast server you can run way more

[14-Jun-19 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
very fast server can run way more what?

[14-Jun-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
utxos... but I already made solutio for this, so that everything has 1 utxo 😄

[14-Jun-19 03:16 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have a decent server, but it's located in Sydney 😉

in a bunker under a carpark 😄

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
so the default 50 KMD and 25 LABS utxo split is aimed at average PCs?

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats very low as it is

[14-Jun-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
50 KMd was suicide early on last year

[14-Jun-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the listunspent time is what matters.

[14-Jun-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that is the only time consuming call iguana makes before entering recvmask

[14-Jun-19 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i really want a lot more KMD and LABS utxos than 50/25

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
or i want as few as possible so that call is nearly instant

[14-Jun-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems there would be a balance in adding txns to the wallet that start to slow down the NN performance, and having the fastest listunspent time, would that be an accurate assessment?

[14-Jun-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
fewer utxos means more split ops and txns in the wallet

[14-Jun-19 03:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
more utxos means less txns over time but longer listunspent call

[14-Jun-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[14-Jun-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@lukechilds  worked out a perfect balance long ago, I copied neaerlt all of his stuff when I made LABS and made it the default

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I also changed iguana, and before letting anyone run it on mainnet and break everything I made it labs default for ages

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still didn merge that iguana, i think its too dangerous todo so... if OPs can work out how to use it and manage it then they have the option

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok im making some changes to mine... see how it does today

[14-Jun-19 03:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
getting a bit more aggressive with 10 utxos.

@gcharang whenever you have time, a simple guide for explorer and a tutorial will be fine

[14-Jun-19 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I want to rely on my own explorer not to load anyone else, as it's insight, i'll be able to make my own chain

[14-Jun-19 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm just a noob, but I love pushing buttons so much, I need to test some things

[14-Jun-19 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
explorers being a flaw in my head, not knowing how to install, but just use, I must fix that

[14-Jun-19 10:25 PM] phm87#7395
a guy replied this to a similar question on discord:
``` the insight api from the explorers does work

https://github.com/DeckerSU/insight-api-komodo#api-http-endpoints
all of them should work, just replace
insight-api with insight-api-komodo
ex: https://kmdexplorer.io/insight-api-komodo/tx/a61ff1eee265777890a1c87f286d93ff5d45c336f3c22ac7b0b0b287e580c3f9

but the explorers have ratelimits so be vary about that
alternately you could run your own explorer for any assetchain you want using
https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer```

[14-Jun-19 10:29 PM] phm87#7395
about this https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer I think it can be thrown into a docker container

@gcharang any requirements / specificity for this ? Hardware side ? Consider it will be non-stop hammered

[15-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
as it is based on bitcore (maybe am wrong), it should be compatible with any chain not even KMD related, right? All it takes is configuration ?

what does -PCT- mean in the above stats?

[15-Jun-19 06:38 PM] jorian#4555
i guess percentage, but of what? total notarizations?

[15-Jun-19 06:39 PM] jorian#4555
with 20 notaries, you would be doing a really bad job then

[15-Jun-19 06:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
based on the script, PCT = NOTR / BLOX

[15-Jun-19 06:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jorian for those of us that reset wallet, it's a completely meaningless thing 🤷🏽

How does Cosmos work? How does it compare to Bitcoin and Ethereum?...
So far, we've talked about Cosmos from the viewpoint of building a single blockchain and blockchain application. But as we noted earlier, one of Cosmos' biggest value propositions is interoperability — the ability to communicate across MANY blockchains. But how? And why?

Maybe going from 20 to 10 utxos would help?

[16-Jun-19 08:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530
try `time komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listunspent > /dev/null` to see how going from 20 to 10 utxo would impact the response time, I don't think it would help much though

[16-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Exile13#4458
Ok

[16-Jun-19 08:48 PM] phm87#7395
I'd like to say a big thank you to @zatJUM  and metaphilibert who helped me to figure out why my KMDLabs NN node had 0 nota in 20 days. zatJUM noticed that 
1) he didn't see my IP in output of ```curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776/" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"ipaddrs\"}" | jq -r .[]```
79.137.112.66
So he used a command to add my IP in his iguana:
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"79.137.112.66\"}"```
2) he saw that my IP is not into peer_ips.txt but we are not sure if @Alright  should add me (using a PR or the command of point 1)
3) in my logs, a btcpubkey & Raddress not belonging to me is used. I have no clues why, we checked all files. I began to add more logs inside iguana to know why an unrelated btcpubkey/Radd is used:

[16-Jun-19 08:49 PM] phm87#7395
zatJUM:
```{"result":"coin already there","tag":"15371262759716857471"}

`config.ini` seems OK too...

[16-Jun-19 08:55 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think `peer_ips.txt` contains peers IP to synchronize blocks, or seed NN, not necessarily every NN's IP, it only has 16 IP while we have 22 NN, mine is not in  in peer_ips.txt either

I use this instead and just read the value `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]` ,  but recently it randomly crash iguana so I don't want to use it unless necessary

[17-Jun-19 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It only crashes jl's iguana, mine and labs should have the fix for the crash

[17-Jun-19 05:18 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it's random though, sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't, I have no idea why 😂

[17-Jun-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a fix for this?

[17-Jun-19 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs a null pointer check, sometimes a dpow round hasn't started yet and it has empty pointer for dpow[0] I can make pull request to your repo tomorrow. I fixed it on testnet for genie. 
There is also a fix for the miner waiting in my repo if needed genie said it has worked for chicken pool

Hi, is it possible for change to be sent to an address not imported into a wallet?
I'm still looking into it but that seems to be what happened.  
The address that the change was sent to returns ```"ismine": false```

[17-Jun-19 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I vaguely recognize the address and am searching for it now.

[17-Jun-19 10:48 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yes, it is possible, depends on how you created your transaction

[17-Jun-19 10:49 AM] CrisF#3405
In this case just a regular `sendtoaddress`.

[17-Jun-19 10:53 AM] CrisF#3405

[17-Jun-19 10:57 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`REGmiJNT9HxYbpjr8bNfgJojTyxjy4vvru` is the address that doesn't belong to you right ?

Not imported into my wallet though.

[17-Jun-19 11:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
did you do this `komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS sendtoaddress RXfJXXfUjtK9qRdqVtPFQxwdwNViH8bssT 3000` ?

[17-Jun-19 11:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes

[17-Jun-19 11:01 AM] CrisF#3405
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS sendtoaddress RXfJXXfUjtK9qRdqVtPFQxwdwNViH8bssT 3000`

[17-Jun-19 11:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm not 100% sure, but I think you just spent 6004.8 LABS on tx fee 😅

[17-Jun-19 11:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully I mine it then.

[17-Jun-19 11:05 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the owner of `REGmiJNT9HxYbpjr8bNfgJojTyxjy4vvru` seems to be the one who mined/minted it

[17-Jun-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I was a bit worried about that.
