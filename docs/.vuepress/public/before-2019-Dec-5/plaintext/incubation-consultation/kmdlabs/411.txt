@LabsAssistant please do `./start.sh` on your notary, we added two CFEK chains. Both are tests for the upcoming LABS price CC fungible chain

[29-May-19 07:24 AM] Alright#0419
I know I said CFEK would be optional, but right now it's not! 😛

[29-May-19 07:24 AM] Alright#0419
need to work on that 😅

[29-May-19 07:26 AM] CrisF#3405

[29-May-19 07:33 AM] gcharang#6833
I think mine and jokers notarization counts are low because we are running dwy_mitigation script on a cron atleast twice a day

anyone else getting no peers on CFEKFEK?

[29-May-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm looks like it starting fine now

[29-May-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
both worked here

[29-May-19 07:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it was some "temporary connectivity issue"

[29-May-19 07:37 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r take a look at CFEKFEK

[29-May-19 07:37 AM] Alright#0419
looks like diff retarget is too high

[29-May-19 07:37 AM] Alright#0419
plenty of blocks, now a long stall at 98

[29-May-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Verus doesnt start adjusting until about that. Give it a 50 more blocks, it will either be close to 300s or simply not work at all

[29-May-19 07:38 AM] Exile13#4458
i see block 77 in CFEKBET0

[29-May-19 07:38 AM] Exile13#4458
78

[29-May-19 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKFEK is something new I only added today.

[29-May-19 07:38 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKFEK setgenerate true <how ever many cores you can afford>` please 🙏

[29-May-19 07:39 AM] jorian#4555
i need a new LABS server

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL can you look at `getbalance64` on your BET0 staking node

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
are all the utxos ineligible?

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh fek

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Staking, right

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Give me 5 minutes please

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
if you didn't split already, chain is fucked

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] Alright#0419
deded

[29-May-19 07:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright did you copy paste from your crontab directly? 
```
* * */1 * * /home/joe/StakedNotary/dwy_attack_migration.sh >> /home/joe/utxo_dwy.log
```
the script name seems to be wrong here

[29-May-19 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL if you didn't split, we might be able to scavenge it

[29-May-19 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
do not split it now if you haven't already

[29-May-19 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
try to stake it

[29-May-19 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
No, I didn't split

[29-May-19 07:41 AM] Alright#0419
ok just try to stake

[29-May-19 07:42 AM] Alright#0419
you have 1 utxo? 😅

[29-May-19 07:42 AM] Exile13#4458
`== response_dpow CFEKFEK ==
{'result': 'success',
`

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Emm, not - I mine on node with balance

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
It have many utxos

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
oh that's good, just try to stake

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
do not spend them now, will make them ineligible

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
I can hit it with ASICs if need be

[29-May-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it fine to just `setgenerate true 0` without pos64 staker?

[29-May-19 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[29-May-19 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[29-May-19 07:44 AM] Exile13#4458

[29-May-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
`  "staking": true,`

[29-May-19 07:45 AM] Exile13#4458
shows staking false and generate true

[29-May-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I'm just notifying @Alright  that I started to stake 😃
