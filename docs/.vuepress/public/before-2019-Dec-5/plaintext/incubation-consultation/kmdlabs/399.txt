if you do for LABs, I'll port to mainnet

[25-May-19 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so many chains, too many debug logs to look thru\

[25-May-19 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
it was much much easier to count notarizations from cb rather than checking each tx in the block

[25-May-19 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
it just won't work on anything but ac_notarypay chains

[25-May-19 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
maybe joker can do a flag for whether or not a block has a notarization

[25-May-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
that would make it easier to do

[25-May-19 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
@SHossain could you add @And1_89 to LABSassitant role please

are you trying to stake from an NN?

the slow_checkPOW error is so freaking broad

[25-May-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
anything goes wrong in that func and it prints that

[25-May-19 10:03 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - lots in std out

[25-May-19 10:03 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
or at least there was - after a few resets I need to restart the loops

[25-May-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
what is your utxo distribution?

[25-May-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
were they at least 1 coin each?

64 sets of 10

[25-May-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
can you just give me everything it's printing from both debug.log and stdout

[25-May-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
really not an easy thing to debug, that's `slow_checkPOW` thing could mean about a dozen different things

[25-May-19 10:06 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

@CrisF @blackjok3r @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @gt @phm87 @mrlynch @FishyGuts @-MiningOcean.org- @CHMEX 

going to start organizing multi sigs for KMD allocation. Believe we'll have 1 strictly for KMD tx fees and another(or multiple) for "dev fund". Please let me know which(or both) you want to be apart of. Hoping to get these setup by the end of next week at the latest as I've had a couple people trying to send KMD already. Please securely create a pubkey(or two) and send it to me.

If I missed anyone or I tagged someone who had not pledged, sorry. Just skimmed over all the proposals really quickly

[25-May-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
@FishyGuts you have an impersonator

[25-May-19 10:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm in. I recall supplying a pubkey earlier, are they being used or can I make fresh ones?

[25-May-19 10:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm in too.

[25-May-19 10:29 AM] mrlynch#5735
@Alright i can redirect funds to whichever address you tell me to in whichever percentage you wish

[25-May-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
can I give that other Fishy account the boot?

[25-May-19 10:29 AM] gt#2812

[25-May-19 10:29 AM] mrlynch#5735

@Bar_F1sh_Rel any idea how I could get a node into that state?

[25-May-19 10:31 AM] Alright#0419
yea sorry, if you sent me a pubkey previously I lost it 😅

[25-May-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
tried to do this way too preemptively last time

[25-May-19 10:33 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Wish I knew - I even blew away the directories, re-ran install script, etc. Only common points are now blockchain, wallet and OS

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
what OS?

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Deb9

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
could you try `dumpwallet` then deleting the wallet.dat then `importwallet`

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
lol be *careful* if you do that

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] phm87#7395
I did not win the lottery, can I send pubkey and be part of the Labs NN ? Or is it too soon ? How many assetchains in the setup ?

[25-May-19 10:34 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - yes - but it should be OK - I *should* have all the keys

[25-May-19 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
@phm87 that message was in reference to KMD NN allocation

[25-May-19 10:35 AM] phm87#7395
Oh sorry

[25-May-19 10:35 AM] phm87#7395
I was confused

[25-May-19 10:35 AM] Alright#0419
Sorry, going to have to wait 2 months or get a key from someone not using it :/

[25-May-19 10:36 AM] phm87#7395
Ok. Who is not using his key ? (Except dwy)

[25-May-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
so far we have 4 people who have not notarized, two of which haven't answered.  If you don't want the responsibility @Mylo or @daemonfox please consider giving the key to @phm87

[25-May-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
dwy gave his key to @And1_89 
metaphilibert said he'll be running his

[25-May-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
no answer from mylo or daemonfox yet

[25-May-19 10:37 AM] jorian#4555
@Mylo was here today

[25-May-19 10:37 AM] jorian#4555
said he was going to read up on all the excitement

[25-May-19 10:39 AM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[25-May-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
if you do give away your key, do it securely please 😅

[25-May-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
ie not on discord

[25-May-19 10:55 AM] Mylo#8306
i think i will have to give up the key.

[25-May-19 10:55 AM] Mylo#8306
got too much on at the moment.

[25-May-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
An unused key can be changed

[25-May-19 10:56 AM] Mylo#8306
ok cool.   yes i don't think i'll be a fast responsive-enough notary for any urgent things for the coming weeks with NN hardfork & rebrand & stuff.

[25-May-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case any notaries who don't notarize open their spot for next season

[25-May-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's the rules

[25-May-19 10:58 AM] phm87#7395
@Mylo if you want to give me your key, we can discuss it tonight. Thx

[25-May-19 10:58 AM] Mylo#8306
how quick are the seasons and how can i apply next season - by competition?

[25-May-19 10:58 AM] phm87#7395
(It is 1 PM here)

[25-May-19 10:58 AM] Mylo#8306
no probs

[25-May-19 10:59 AM] Mylo#8306
if it's unused, i think you can just create your own going on what jok3r says.

[25-May-19 11:01 AM] gcharang#6833
> how can i apply next season 
I think numbers expand by 2 every two months

[25-May-19 11:02 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm working out  a  small game app.   is the workflow still to supply chain parameters with something that needs testing for you guys to notarize ?

[25-May-19 11:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright ^

[25-May-19 11:03 AM] Mylo#8306
no rush, just looking forward to testing the labs workflow with something i make

[25-May-19 11:05 AM] Exile13#4458
'An unused key can be changed' @phm87  there's 3 steps for creating your key, crisf posted it a couple days ago I can try to find it if you want.

[25-May-19 11:09 AM] phm87#7395
@Exile13 thank you buddy. I will read tonight (I have some shopping to do for my car and other shores)

[25-May-19 11:17 AM] Alright#0419

i can give my key to anyone deeply interested

[25-May-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo every 2 months, 2 additional spots open up

[25-May-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
plus any notaries that are <25% of average notarization count get dropped and their spot is also up for grabs via lottery

[25-May-19 11:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
where these notaries need to be setup?

[25-May-19 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
the internet

[25-May-19 11:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like KMD notaries, on VPS/Cloud?

[25-May-19 11:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or Dedicated home server is fine too?

[25-May-19 11:20 AM] Alright#0419
if you have a decent connection and don't mind people having your home IP, sure

[25-May-19 11:20 AM] phm87#7395
