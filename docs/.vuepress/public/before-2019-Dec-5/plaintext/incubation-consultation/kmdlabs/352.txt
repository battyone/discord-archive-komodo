Added new RPC for ac_notarypay. Gives some nice info for chain owners/users so they can make sure the notarypay "fund" will last long enough.

[04-Apr-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
We have added a new chain CFEKKN, it shares cluster with CFEKNK, and is much the same. There is update to komodod to add the above RPC aswell. 
This is for testing migrates and token migrates. As I'm not sure 5/6 are working properly after all the updates.  The notarypay solution is fine as it is, changing it to a consenus rule will bog thigns down unless I add more things to the blockindex. So the PoC for coin emissions on the cluster chains half works. Need to work out how to put things in blockindex without breaking the format. Likely the solution will be to save the data to disk seperatly and load it on load and insert it to the blockindex of the current height.

scrolling up above that paste, there was also a fair bit of this - `<<<<<<<<<<< bitcoind_RPC: KMD post_process_bitcoind_RPC (getbestblockhash) error.{"result":null,"error":{"code":-28,"message":"Rescanning..."},"id":"jl777"}

I'd manually zapwallettxes and cleanwallettransactions on CFEKORKL then try again

[04-Apr-19 11:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yep, seemed a wallet corruption. not sure why, figured worth a report

[04-Apr-19 12:05 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORKL cleanwallettransactions
{
  "total_transactons": 2028,
  "remaining_transactons": 2023,
  "removed_transactions": 5
}
``` 
thought it remove more than that... might have been unintentionally staking on this node 🤷

[04-Apr-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If the wallet is corrupted it should just exit... It now checks all utxo on coin add is they are spent

[04-Apr-19 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its expected behaviour @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

cool, just ran ./assetchains -reindex, restarting now

That's not the solution

[04-Apr-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
U should start the chain manually and important the wif with a rescan 5000 blocks before the tip height
