CFEKING wont syn past block 29170 here

[23-Nov-18 11:38 AM] benohanlon#1119
I hear there are notary elections tomorrow for staked / kmdlabs? is it something you want to make public and share in Five Bullet Friday?

[23-Nov-18 11:38 AM] jorian#4555
i'd rather not üòõ

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi Ben

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well tbh we are already full.

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
It's not an election exactly.

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we should annouce it though ..

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] benohanlon#1119
hey @CrisF long time no speak üòÑ

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
More like a trial by fire.

[23-Nov-18 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, thanks for coming üòÉ

[23-Nov-18 11:40 AM] benohanlon#1119
We could get a post up on Komodo's medium with an outline and what's happening.

[23-Nov-18 11:40 AM] benohanlon#1119
calling it a 'trial by fire' is good üòÑ

[23-Nov-18 11:40 AM] benohanlon#1119
As it's short notice - it's totally up to you guys but if you announce in FBF no-one can say there wasn't notice

[23-Nov-18 11:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ir really will be like watching a rocket launch.

[23-Nov-18 11:40 AM] zatJUM#9924
@jorian mask script works for you?

[23-Nov-18 11:41 AM] jorian#4555
i gave 20 as a paramter

[23-Nov-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mask script is garbled crap ... makes no sense for me, never has worked properly ...

[23-Nov-18 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
@benohanlon This is only for the first round of notaries.

[23-Nov-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I didnt write it ... so dont know how to fix

[23-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
```

works for me?

[23-Nov-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant sync CFEKING here ... maybe its let a block in from the fork somehow...

[23-Nov-18 11:42 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not set, not sure what is wrong with me

[23-Nov-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gues I need to reycn it again

[23-Nov-18 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
@benohanlon There will be a notary change in a few months.

[23-Nov-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, we need to talk about the mechanics behind the notary change btw

[23-Nov-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
seems a good amount of people here right now, so is a good time

@blackjok3r mask scripts is working for me.

[23-Nov-18 11:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Usually use the curl.

[23-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
```
Notaries change every 2 months.
We take anyone who signs up for first 2 months.
The top 75% of notaries(based on notarization counts) remain if they choose to.
The remaining spots will be chosen provably randomly based on who signs up
```
This is my suggestion. Not at all definitive. We just need to hash it out

[23-Nov-18 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
credit goes to jl for that idea

[23-Nov-18 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
the problem with this however, is that this means notaries would basically be forced to notarize every chain

[23-Nov-18 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
if we could figure out some objective metric for a "good" notary other than notarization counts, it will work

[23-Nov-18 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
not sure there is one though

[23-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really like it ... as I am going to use my own server here, andmy counts wont be huge ... shor tof launching a shit load of my own chains, just so that my 64GB pf ram gives me advantage ... üòÇ  I will likely be kicked out of my own coin.

[23-Nov-18 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
Is there some metric we could use otherwise?

[23-Nov-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there a way to measure `up time`?

[23-Nov-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess... maybe instead of tracking total notarisations you could count time between notarisations ?

[23-Nov-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont really know hey .. .as a fast VPS on ery good internet in EU or ASIA with the built in daemon wallet cleaner on a cron tab, will flog everything else.

[23-Nov-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in counts as long as its up ...

[23-Nov-18 11:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Possible adding NN slots for other rolls in the project?  Doesn't KMD have some (dev?) nodes like that?

[23-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Alright#0419
for what purpose?

[23-Nov-18 11:50 AM] Alright#0419
we don't want one entity with >min sig number of notaries

[23-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant make exeptions just for me, ot use a free server (not free but its no cost to me) when you guys have to pay for one.

[23-Nov-18 11:51 AM] CrisF#3405
Options other than pure notarization counts as deciding all NNs.

[23-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its my choice to take this option... if its unable to compete after the first tim around, I will just have to look at other optons

[23-Nov-18 11:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I wasn't thinking of just you.

[23-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but yeah .. the onyl way to d othat is to have a VOTE liek KMD does

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but every 2 months seems very difficult to pull off

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
I see that as our fall back

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
time tested method that just works

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
yes, voting every two months is a bitch

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
we could automate it though

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Well, those roles could be longer than 2 months.

[23-Nov-18 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
so user can say "send my vote to this notary every 2 months"

[23-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just delagated PoS though :trollface:

[23-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actaully its not ... even close ... as we dont have any power of producing blocks

[23-Nov-18 11:53 AM] CrisF#3405
A % of NNs based on raw notarization count, and some roles elected for a longer term.

[23-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
just the power of producing chains üòê

[23-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah true

[23-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
likely more power than just procuding blocks atually

[23-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
ya think? üòõ

[23-Nov-18 12:01 PM] CrisF#3405
How about this?
(%s are an example)
```
Goal
- incentivize network strength
- incentivize development and running of KMDLabs

Method
- 50% top notarization count remain
- 30% new NN every 2 months
- 20% NN elected for 1 year term```

[23-Nov-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking something similar too ...

[23-Nov-18 12:04 PM] gt#2812
is 30 percent a little high if it‚Äôs just random selection? seems like it could leave a lot of work to onboard new people every 2 months

[23-Nov-18 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
The number are just an example.

[23-Nov-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Doesnt have to be new people

[23-Nov-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
take X% of the top preforming nodes... then ahve who ever whats to sign up again, + new people

[23-Nov-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can have up to 64 nodes... it seems it would take a while to get that many cpmpetnet  operators

same here

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
Notarizing @gt?

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] gt#2812
yep

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] CrisF#3405
@Alright @blackjok3r Seeing notarizations but only 4 total in mask üëÜ

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep.. looks liek my seed node needed to be resynced

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] gt#2812
seeing black in mask now

[23-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that would be the case tbh ... as era change was wayyy too fast, and not all nodes updated at the smae time.

[23-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anyone who is NOT notarising, resync

miner is back on now too, I have 1 node PoS and notary 0 is minign a couple of cores PoW on each chain.

[23-Nov-18 12:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r how did you solve this?

i just restarted and everything was in sync

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine stopped at a dffrent spot

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wiped `blocks chainstate komododstate*`

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the synced ysing connect =

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] gcharang#6833
just delete .komodo/CFEKING and start again?

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its somehow letting the blocks from the fork in

[23-Nov-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should not do that, but there are probably more nodes on the old version than the new atm

[23-Nov-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Again, this will not happen again, as a normal era change would be done over a fe weeks

[23-Nov-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing that needs to happen is iguana is restarted during the gap on all nodes at once.
