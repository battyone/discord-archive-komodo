[23-Nov-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, I try to keep my own scripts and auto optims running with lazynode, so I ll just gather info to get it working, as I want to setup and forget mode :p

[23-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be that msotly already .. but you can do it how every you like

[23-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some things are out dated and need to be cleaned up such as wallet resetter ..

[23-Nov-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
few scripts in there I cna remove..

[23-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to make it so that the coinds have some prints aswell at some point pipeing all to dev null is good to get iguana running but not great fo other uses.

[23-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

I forgot to change my config ini until just then thoghu üò´

[23-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah a copule of the chains seem to be not exaclty respecting protocol version

[23-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only way to make sure right chain is to use connect= on start to 103.6.12.112 as most if not all the blocks are comign from there.

[23-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once its synced, restart without connect=

[23-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that worked for me

[23-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Nov-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it already ?

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that was a very specific bug that never should ahve even been in this branch...

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was to help james fix somehting on KMD

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
while using the bootstarp is faster we need to make sure staked is not breaking KMD sync...

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it need s valid KMD chain

[23-Nov-18 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
