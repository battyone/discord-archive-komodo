[30-May-19 01:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
So I should try to buildl again?

[30-May-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mininglabs.rocks has been restarted because I'm tired of seeing 
`Invalid address  RNnLgqHH8L5xsumugMWaHGEPSQjYveGu8g`

[30-May-19 01:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
is that just from the initial issue or is it still happening?

[30-May-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`disablecb` @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  🤣

[30-May-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r that does nothing for payments

[30-May-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was a joke

[30-May-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the pool validates addys before sending out a payment to them and some ding-dong added a space to his addy :troll:

[30-May-19 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trim?

[30-May-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, it never had that for whatever reason 🤷🏽

[30-May-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess it does now?

[30-May-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol yeah

[30-May-19 02:06 PM] CMaurice#1685
seems to be up and runing a goodun, thanks

[30-May-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@daemonfox I missed your question 
it was from the original, stored in the database

[30-May-19 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
k thx just wanted to make sure i wasnt still causing problems

[30-May-19 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
like usual lol

[30-May-19 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
like usual lol

[30-May-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[30-May-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on the plus side for miners, the payouts include all NN payments too
yw 😭

[30-May-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this would have to be close to the hardest chain to ever make a working pool for, im surprised you got this far, dont give up now 😄

[30-May-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a "simple" fix, it just never dawned on me until last night that the reason I was bleeding out of pocket is there's no part of the code that subtracts the non-pool portion of the coinbase value
so, everyone benefits from me being an idiot 😛

[30-May-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lucky the bock reward is still small? or maybe its not by now lol

[30-May-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I cheated a bit, I set pool pubkey as pubkey on staking node until I have time to get to it

[30-May-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm sure that a year from now I'll regret that deeply, but for now it is what it is and I can't clone me to get more done at once

[30-May-19 03:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
My labs staking node is useless lol...

[30-May-19 03:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
nothing in a whole day so far

[30-May-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listtransactions "" 999999999 | jq '[.[] | select(.generated==true and .rawconfirmations <= 1440)] | length'
25
```
😭

[30-May-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I really need to split mine

[30-May-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r you still plan to try to get a hashrate estimate or should i try it in py?

[30-May-19 04:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listtransactions "" 999999999 | jq '[.[] | select(.generated==true and .rawconfirmations <= 1440)] | length'
```
I only have 3 , that's how many blocks I mint on average per day with 640 LABS staked 😂

[30-May-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
that's pretty good honestly

[30-May-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you having 3 makes me want to cry even more, exponentially that would give me 300

[30-May-19 04:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just split my 640 LABS over 64 segids, 5 utxo 2 LABS each, and let it do the staking job, haven't touched it since 3 days 😂

[30-May-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
should run a cron on notary to send ac_notarypay coins to staking setup 😉

{Reactions}
👌 

[30-May-19 04:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sure will !

[30-May-19 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
at 10080, ac_notarypay increases from 1 coin to 10

[30-May-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
probably want to figure it out prior to that

{Reactions}
👌 

[30-May-19 04:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
and when the reward goes to 10 remember to sell it at
graviex.net/markets/labskmd

[30-May-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
yes please^

[30-May-19 04:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[30-May-19 04:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have 3 TX of 25 LABS across all 64 SEGIDs and NADA

[30-May-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
`setgenerate true 0` :troll:

[30-May-19 04:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
trollface lol

[30-May-19 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
it takes some time once split, just have some patience

do utxos in coinbase txns stake too?

[30-May-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
they can, yes

[30-May-19 05:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is it normal that when I do 
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS listtransactions "" 999999999 | jq '[.[] | select(.generated==true)] | .'
```
all the objects returned have the same value for `"address"` field ? (it is the address which I set the pubkey) 
Does it mean that all my coinbases were generated in the same segid ? (which I find weird because I split my LABS evenly accross 64 segids ).

[30-May-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you set pubkey, then all coinbase rewards go to that pubkey (regardless of mining work type)

{Reactions}
👌 

[30-May-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, yes, it's normal

[30-May-19 05:43 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Thanks for the tip ! I'm still a jq beginner, have to learn more 😅

[30-May-19 07:54 PM] jorian#4555
jq is awesome

[30-May-19 08:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
looks like i did finally get 3 blocks staked

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] jorian#4555
aw yeah

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] jorian#4555
my staking is getting better too

[30-May-19 08:21 PM] jorian#4555
i also started staking ZEXO, but there it's a lot more difficult for some reason

[30-May-19 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
ZEXO is 93% vs LABS 51%

[30-May-19 09:31 PM] Exile13#4458
you ALL are awesome, *jus sayin* 🖖 :labs1:

👌 labs (4) 

[31-May-19 02:17 PM] CHMEX#0686
is it a normal thing to see show many utxos trying to stake ( and therefore become inmajure)
labs.explorer.dexstats.info/block/064566e4ba676179a485e4c8082835f13483a0eb0d7b07d5c9bdfb3035d09a45

[31-May-19 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes my question exactly? it looks like i am my own worst enemy trying to stake each time

[31-May-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
every valid utxo needs 400+ seconds to be eligible on every segid

[31-May-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
the only 3 blocks i got were after being offline for a couple hours

[31-May-19 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
zero since then

[31-May-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
size, number, and time all play a factor (and total supply iirc)

[31-May-19 02:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
guess im starting over...

[31-May-19 02:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
Trying to get a new set of addresses... this command is not outputting anything in the file but im not getting any errors...

[31-May-19 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:9333" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"gen64addrs\",\"passphrase\":\"test test test123\"}" | jq .addresses > NEWLABSADDYS

[31-May-19 03:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just run the `genaddresses.py`  script

[31-May-19 03:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
9333 is iguana p2p port , not rpc port, may be try LABS daemon rpc port instead (40265)
And I'm  sure rpc call works without back slash or not

[31-May-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
isnt that what I want... Iguana to respond...

[31-May-19 03:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
i need the RPC port not P2P then...

[31-May-19 03:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
this is an example , for an rpc call on iguana:
```
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]
```

[31-May-19 03:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
well that port connected but output is still NULL

[31-May-19 03:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
where is the genaddresses.py script you mentioned?

[31-May-19 03:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
here <https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker>

[31-May-19 03:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
btw the 2nd era of notarypay has started

[31-May-19 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
looks like the sendmany64.py script wants your coins to be in account "" but it looks like all coins in LABS do not get their address default linked to account ""

[31-May-19 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
newly generated addresses append to the account name "true"

[31-May-19 03:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
or at least... a new addy I made elsewhere and imported appended to "true" in my LABS wallet

[31-May-19 04:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
line 137 of stakerlib.py I changed mine to "true" from "" testing now

[31-May-19 04:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
lame just keeps telling me insufficient funds

[31-May-19 04:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
after using `./genaddresses.py` , pick 1 wif from your list then import it, then send LABS to its R address

[31-May-19 04:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
im trying to do that now but this wallet is not allowing me... says insufficient funds no matter what I use to try and send them

[31-May-19 04:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
reimporting this single key in a fresh wallet

[31-May-19 04:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
check your balance with getbalance or listunspent then, may be it's not confirmed yet ?

[31-May-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@CHMEX can't see that block anymore

[31-May-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
so an orphaned block's staking tx was included in another block or what?

[31-May-19 04:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I still can see it on the explorer

[31-May-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
copied it wrong, yes I see it

[31-May-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
I think this bug was fixed during the early pos tests, but maybe someone is rebroadcasting them just to eat up other people's utxos?

[31-May-19 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
the only way your node will actually broadcast it is if you staked a block

[31-May-19 05:03 PM] Alright#0419
and other nodes shouldn't put these txs back into mempool if the block is reorged

[31-May-19 05:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I don't get it yet, is there something that was not supposed to happen in that  #10043 block ?

[31-May-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
multiple staking txs it seems

[31-May-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
the last tx in a POS block is the utxo used to stake it spent back to the same address with no fee

[31-May-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
it *seems* that block has multiple ones

[31-May-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
oh you know what, it doesn't

[31-May-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
those are splits

[31-May-19 06:26 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@daemonfox - not sure if it helps - but I setup my staking node with pubkey and config.ini (same as a notary setup) - starting the daemon with the script to import the pubkey.
Sending funds to the pubkey 'R' address and distributing them from there using the staker script seems to have worked.
