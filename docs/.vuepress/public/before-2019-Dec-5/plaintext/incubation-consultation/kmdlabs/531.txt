is DUMMY daemon running?

[04-Dec-19 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
nope

[04-Dec-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
add `print(resp)` after`resp = stakerlib.start_daemon('DUMMY', True)
`

[04-Dec-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
what does it print

if you're on your own fork, need to PR latest changes to it or delete fork and refork

[04-Dec-19 09:49 AM] CrisF#3405
I had similar deleting and re-fork.

üëå 

[04-Dec-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
or just change that line to `startswith`

[04-Dec-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
instead of `startswtih`

[04-Dec-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
worked now @Alright

[04-Dec-19 09:54 AM] Oszy#5734
got the addresses

[04-Dec-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
`git add participants.json`

[04-Dec-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
commit, push and PR that and you're done

[04-Dec-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
hold onto PRIVATE.json, you'll need it for comp

[04-Dec-19 10:01 AM] Oszy#5734
i think it's done

[04-Dec-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
yep, merged

[04-Dec-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
plan is to start on Friday around 12:00 UTC

[04-Dec-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
and end 7 days after that

[04-Dec-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
200 or 300 KMD to the top staker, and a few hundred more KMD or LABS for bug bounties

hold onto PRIVATE.json, it has all the keys you'll have to use for comp

[04-Dec-19 10:09 AM] Oszy#5734
Pinned a message.

[04-Dec-19 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
I sent a PR

[04-Dec-19 10:11 AM] Oszy#5734
and this comp is gonna run on the new daemon or do we need to use current PoS methods same as on LABS?

[04-Dec-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
new staking mechanisms, yes

[04-Dec-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
it's not entirely different, but different enough to need wider scale testing

[04-Dec-19 10:13 AM] Oszy#5734
ok cool

[04-Dec-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian instructions above

[04-Dec-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant Please see the latest pinned message for instructions for signing up for pos64test comp that will start on Friday (around) Noon UTC.  

KMD(ca) is going to match 500 KMD for prizes. I'll put up the other 500 KMD or we can spend it from the dev fund(bDEV). We need to discuss how to allocate 1000 KMD. We don't want to spend it all without getting some good testing in return. I think 200-300 KMD for top staker is a fair prize. It should attract enough testers. Then up to 700-800 KMD for bug bounties. We can use NNvote dapp for bounty claims.

[04-Dec-19 10:20 AM] CrisF#3405
That went very smoothly on Ubuntu 16.04.

[04-Dec-19 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
should finalize prize structure ASAP then start marketing this

[04-Dec-19 10:23 AM] CrisF#3405
That looks good ‚òùÔ∏è

[04-Dec-19 10:23 AM] CrisF#3405
How long is the test?

[04-Dec-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
7 days?

[04-Dec-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't really matter, figured 1 week is plenty

[04-Dec-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
that's how we did it before

[04-Dec-19 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
If that's enough to collect info and break things sounds good üôÇ

[04-Dec-19 10:24 AM] CrisF#3405
start time?

[04-Dec-19 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
Noon UTC?

[04-Dec-19 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, I'll write  something for you to check out and post it to let people know.

[04-Dec-19 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Nice to get back to this kind of stuff after all this time :abusedsmily:

so now all PoS chains are called "LABSCHAINs" internally?

I  guess it  maight bein t he last 3 blocks

[04-Dec-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
start daemon with `-reindex`

[04-Dec-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
will take a little while

[04-Dec-19 03:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok  -

[04-Dec-19 03:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

`start daemon with -reindex`
for the love of god why? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[04-Dec-19 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```wallet db issues:
    -rescan
    -zapwallettxes
blockchain db issues:
    -reindex```
if reindex fixes wallet issues it is purely "coincidental" and the most resource consuming way to do so

[04-Dec-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, zapwallet is the way to go üôÇ 
The old staking code was stupid on reorgs... Deletes transactions from the wallet by force.  *I think* I finally fixed it with the hardfork code.

[04-Dec-19 03:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
thats what i was  thinking

[04-Dec-19 03:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
my chain  was  up  to date

[04-Dec-19 03:53 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill  get  the bootstrap

[04-Dec-19 03:53 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
and  zapwallet

[04-Dec-19 03:53 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
homie  aint  got  all day

[04-Dec-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if your chain is up-to-date, there's 0 reason to bootstrap

[04-Dec-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just zapwalelt or resycn... bootstrap isnt a good idea... the sync on the latest is very fast.. or it was...

[04-Dec-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was about to start testing myself a few hours ago now... damn git

[04-Dec-19 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  that lastest merge has broken the build along with other things, are you sure its right? Things were working perfectly a few hours ago for me

[04-Dec-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
which?

[04-Dec-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181

can I simply revert to where Iwas or is there something important in that merge?

[04-Dec-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have pushed to kmdHFTest branch

[04-Dec-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181

WAS  up  to  date

[04-Dec-19 04:07 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
until I reindexed

[04-Dec-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
merge conflicts... seems to work after some manual code copying :/

[04-Dec-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```-reindex throws away the block chain index and chain state (the database of all unspent transaction outputs), and rebuilds those from scratch. It is exactly like downloading the block chain again from peers, except the blocks already on disk are used.

[04-Dec-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
reindex does not make you *not* up-to-date if you're already up-to-date (except for new blocks that come in while it's putting the entire chain into a "clean" database)

[04-Dec-19 04:20 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
got it - thanks for that
