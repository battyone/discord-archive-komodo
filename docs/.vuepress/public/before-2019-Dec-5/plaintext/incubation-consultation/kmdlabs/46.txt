what point?

[22-Oct-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt it being snapshot regularly?

[22-Oct-18 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
no, but a snapshot may have to happen to get rid of old chains

[22-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
the way it works is that a notary subscribes to an oracle and says "hey, I'll notarize any new chains you'll push to your oracle"

[22-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
can have multiple oracles, but yes they are trusted atm

[22-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
we need to add checks on total emissions of the cluster

[22-Oct-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i am open to ideas on how to manage the upcoming chain proliferation, single function or not

[22-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Alright#0419
I think KMD *needs* to use fungible chains as a way to add contracts without a hard fork

[22-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise, we'll be stuck with that same contracts for a full year, unable to fix bugs without a hardfork

[22-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Alright#0419
well fix hard forking bugs

[22-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is why i like single purpose chains. it limits any damage from CC bugs. and forces us to fix all bugs

[22-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
we're going to fracture all of our work into 1000 pieces if we continue like this IMO

[22-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
what value does a single purpose chain give KMD?

[22-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Alright#0419
non-fungible single purpose chain*

[22-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe each chain attracts is set of new people

[22-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
its set

[22-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant stop these

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
dont you understand that PIRATE showed that with minimal effort millions of dollars of marketcap is able to be created

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and people can see this

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and start thinking that they can make some chain to do something hopefully similar

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they can, maybe they cant

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Alright#0419
We can't stop them, but we can make KMD better than them

[22-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they need to make a custom CC

[22-Oct-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
already there are so many CC and we are unable to test them fast enough

[22-Oct-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I just try to fix the bugs that are found, regardless of from CC testing, STAKED, dedicated chain, etc

[22-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be nice for the community if these new chains did airdrops to KMD as everybody likes airdrops

[22-Oct-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to find out which tx that is and fix the bug or this will happen on any chain with dice CC active

[22-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
Would like to hear some opinions on possibly launching a single canonical chain for the time being. I've noticed that many coins will have a "testnet" phase in which the coins are available to trade/mine, but full functionality is not activated yet

[22-Oct-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
For anyone wondering what the hold up is, we still have a major problem with momom. We could launch the cluster *right now*, but ~5% of cross chain transfers would fail

[23-Oct-18 12:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright I need to kill a couple of chains and launch 2 new to test a theory James had about momom will u be here in a few hours?

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
can launch them now if you want

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am going to use very long freq and migrate with my teatnscripta over very long time

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have to take kid to school in 30 mins

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'd u start chains that's would help

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
ðŸ‘Œ

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need freq 15

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Alright#0419
anything specific

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pow

[23-Oct-18 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need supply to migrate

[23-Oct-18 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[23-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nothing else

[23-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kill troll

[23-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And s1

[23-Oct-18 12:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think everything still on git assetchains.json atm

[23-Oct-18 12:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Actually @Alright maybe make them in their own cluster too please

[23-Oct-18 12:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just to make sure its controlled teat

[23-Oct-18 12:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Test

[23-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Alright#0419
Won't we want to test migrates with different freq chains?

[23-Oct-18 12:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes very long freq

[23-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Alright#0419
can just do 3 chains, 2 outside cluster, 1 in if you like

[23-Oct-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
James had a theory that if a notarisarion happens when momom is being calced then it fails... Yes sure do that

[23-Oct-18 12:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll send the new ones and perc to the new in 667

[23-Oct-18 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will be interesting to see of a long freq on 1 chain messes things for the others on freq 5 too

[23-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
ping me when you're ready

[23-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r

[23-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
chains started, notaries funded, ready to push json to oracle

[23-Oct-18 12:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Heading home now won't be too long

[23-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant Notaries do `./oraclefetch.sh` then `./start.sh` please

[23-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
no need to stop iguana

[23-Oct-18 12:55 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant don't do that quite yet, sorry

[23-Oct-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did you kill troll and S1

[23-Oct-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[23-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[23-Oct-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool then they do need to stop

[23-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[23-Oct-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise those keep going

[23-Oct-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still cant work out a good way to stop them...

[23-Oct-18 12:58 AM] Alright#0419
we'd need to do -stopat for production chains

[23-Oct-18 12:58 AM] Alright#0419
on notaries

[23-Oct-18 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r can you test `./oraclefetch.sh` then `./start.sh` please

[23-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure

[23-Oct-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing now

[23-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blackjok3r branch isnt compiling

[23-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it just skippped it...

[23-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
do the chains need to be on blackjok3r branch?

[23-Oct-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no STAKEDED is using it ... if you remove te branch param from it the it will be fixed

[23-Oct-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I onyl put it there to test the branch logic when testing

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was even with master

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
don't think we can run STAKEDED on master now

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
hard forked it

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
well there are hard forks

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh ok... will I will need to see why its not compiling manually and push fix berfore doing other nodes

[23-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Alright#0419
maybe not activated yet

[23-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
might be able to sync it on master if no one used the contract that hard fork

[23-Oct-18 01:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The start.sh kind of assumes that brnaches compile... I think it just baild out and uses old version if it doens twokr though

[23-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
I've built latest blackjok3r branch

[23-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
O.o

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all chains added here ... maybe its just this node

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ¤·

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will do others and see

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and utxo splitter ran without issue

[23-Oct-18 01:08 AM] Alright#0419
did oraclefetch then start work fine?

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes...

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but my iguana stopped...

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I think the old chains daemon is still running

[23-Oct-18 01:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my fault though I was testing streamer on this node and supernet was on wrong branch

[23-Oct-18 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm stats script is still pulling from git ... I need to push the json to git aswell... so much stuff still uses it

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
we need to ignore it

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] Alright#0419
have git ignore it

[23-Oct-18 01:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no like it litterally curls the json from git
