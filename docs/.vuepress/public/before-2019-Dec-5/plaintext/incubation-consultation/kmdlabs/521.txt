i am  set  up  wrong

[20-Nov-19 10:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Be back later

[20-Nov-19 10:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
I had a typo...

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Are higher segids ideal or lower

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
) instead of a _ in ac)name

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
neither and both

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
all segids get evaluated in cycle

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I have a good mixture of low 20s and high 50s

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
getkastsegidstakes will show you

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
yeh I ran it

[20-Nov-19 10:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
what segids staked the most

[20-Nov-19 10:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130

[20-Nov-19 10:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
its all about weught and # of utxos

[20-Nov-19 10:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
not any specific segid being better by code default

[20-Nov-19 10:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
the more a segid has staked, the more valid, weighted utxos are in it likely

[20-Nov-19 10:39 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I was going to try and run your staker, Im on windows but I've been using agama

[20-Nov-19 10:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'

[20-Nov-19 10:39 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
seriously got  to go

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
go for it

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
but the AGAMA embedded binaries arent up to date

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
you need the binaries pinned here

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I manually changed them a few weeks back

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
word then GTG

[20-Nov-19 10:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
drop that bat file in that folder and GG

[20-Nov-19 10:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
I ahve two things im trying to add... but I also heard joker and alright mention they were trying to code them into the daemon...

[20-Nov-19 10:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
I want the bat file to be able to gen the 64 segid addresses in Windows

[20-Nov-19 10:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then do the utxo distribution like the linux based staker

[20-Nov-19 11:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`8LABS + mining fees`
8LABS + spending the staked UTXO into a new UTXO

[21-Nov-19 12:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
How many blocks per day is average for old equipment?

[21-Nov-19 12:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Or a noob

[21-Nov-19 01:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
equipment doesn't matter much
it's based on your UTXOs (both size and amount) and that of others

[21-Nov-19 02:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ill keep looking  at  the blocks  that  are being mined

[21-Nov-19 02:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
and see whats up

[21-Nov-19 02:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[21-Nov-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`it looks like ./start.sh LABS`
are you trying to stake from a NN setup?

[21-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Oszy#5734

[21-Nov-19 02:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[21-Nov-19 02:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have that one built as well

[21-Nov-19 02:12 PM] Oszy#5734
mixed up some things

[21-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Oszy#5734
so put `list.json` in testsyncfix/src/

_doesn't understand why we have all these scripts to make things "easier" but running the scripts is actually more complex than just doing it manually 游땟_

[21-Nov-19 02:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I guess I need to figure out how to start labs correctly is all

[21-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Oszy#5734
and don't use start.sh

[21-Nov-19 02:14 PM] Oszy#5734
use chain params manually

don't even know where did you get that from

[21-Nov-19 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there's a bit that started as a "work in progress" that has been set aside for other things
