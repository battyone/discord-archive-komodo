The withdraw object contains the result... Only need validating once, then .It can be hashed and passed from one vout to another

[06-Jul-19 06:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Compare hash, don't need to validate wit twice

[06-Jul-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The initial validation will be slow especially with a million utxos. But once the game is over the winner can just keep withdrawing with no overhead

[06-Jul-19 06:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No need to merge

[06-Jul-19 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to make it so that if u sent coins to the game after it was over u could reclaim them, but meh, it takes like 20 blocks after the timestamp is over to get the result, sending there is suicide

[06-Jul-19 06:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once result is known, any coins in the address are owned by the winner

[06-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
so does winner merge all the coins?

[06-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
as they withdraw

My node crashed again (sorry I don't have the backtrace) and when I relaunched it, I waited that it is synced then when I run ``komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS setgenerate true 0`` after few seconds, I had this invalid nota error:

I don't know if it is good or bad so I'll let this log here (I don't notarize with this node : it is for mining and staking)

@phm87 thanks for the report, checking it out

[07-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
you're on latest master branch?

[07-Jul-19 07:14 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know, I'm on a late branch I think

[07-Jul-19 07:14 PM] phm87#7395
No, I'm on a old version I think:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=LABS getinfo
{
  "version": 2001526,
  "protocolversion": 170007,
  "KMDversion": "0.3.3b",```

[07-Jul-19 07:15 PM] phm87#7395
Should I try with a new branch ? Which repo and which branch ? branch master of KMDLabs/komodo ?

[07-Jul-19 07:19 PM] phm87#7395
```~/source/LABS$ git status

[07-Jul-19 07:20 PM] phm87#7395
I think that the ``komodod`` that I am using is aligned with KMDLabs/komodo branch master BUT my komodo-cli`` is old

it was not a crash : just a log "invalid nota"

[07-Jul-19 07:44 PM] phm87#7395
but I had the crash on the same node, I tried to get the gdb backtrace
