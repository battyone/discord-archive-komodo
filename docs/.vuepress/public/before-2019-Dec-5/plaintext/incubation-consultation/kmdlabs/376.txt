I don't see that

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
So I checked samples for my publisher

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
see oraclessamples bug now :/

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclessamples 68c78190c91f45d7dacff72281226a075a9a14f0ea60efd4edda15c6edea947a 8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0 3
{
  "result": "success",
  "samples": [
    [
      "I want 666 nodes",
      "8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0"
    ]
  ]
}```

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
can you reproduce on a new poll please?

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] TonyL#3577
And have only 1 sample inside

[09-May-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Also @Alright  ac_blocktime does not work with verushash so its only usign 60s block times that chain you made. The math required to add ac_blocktime to verushash is way over my head.

[09-May-19 12:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`can you reproduce on a new poll please?` - since these changes merged to jl777 branch I'll try to reproduce `oraclesdata` and `oraclessamples` issues on lastest jl777

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
the oraclessamples thing is incredibly easy to reproduce

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
create register, subscribe, oraclesdata

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
check oraclessamples

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
then register a few more times

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats what I'm actually doing

[09-May-19 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
oraclessamples returns nothing

[09-May-19 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
But I have other issue

[09-May-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
what is that?

[09-May-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r :/

[09-May-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
looks like we're rebooting that chain then

[09-May-19 12:29 PM] Alright#0419
man I thought you told me to do that

[09-May-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes just get this darn poll out of the way.and we can look at it... 
I think I may have said that it did work, but I realised it didnt a few days ago, thats why CFEKPAY was 60s block times.

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL not sure I understand what the other issue is

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possilbe to add ac_blocktime to veruahash.... BUT there is some crazy formula needed to calculate it. Need to ask miket I think, seems there is one vairable that doens tmap to anything I can find.

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
Ah hmmm maybe my thing did break it

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
maybe the 0 returns all broke it

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I tried to explain above few times

[09-May-19 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
yea like 5 people were talking to me at once, sorry 😅

[09-May-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
will read it again

[09-May-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's similar issue (just wondering if one sample dissapeared because I registered before send second sample)

[09-May-19 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
would appreciate if you could do it on a CFEKORC poll, would be easy for me to analyze what is happening

[09-May-19 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclessamples 68c78190c91f45d7dacff72281226a075a9a14f0ea60efd4edda15c6edea947a 8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0 3
{
  "result": "success",
  "samples": [
    [
      "I want 666 nodes",
      "8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0"
    ]
  ]
}``` initially I did it on CFEKORC poll, will try again now sure

[09-May-19 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
Oh

[09-May-19 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
I think I see what's happening

[09-May-19 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
it follows the history of the baton

[09-May-19 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
if you introduce a new baton, breaks shit

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
do you have the other baton txid still?

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Unfortunately no

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
txid of oraclessamples for 777 nodes

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
no worries, have some sense of what's going on

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why this behavior changed, will nail it down when I have time

[09-May-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
batons suck 😛 need new method 😄

[09-May-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think Im half way figured this out

[09-May-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
ok, I'll test your rewrite then

[09-May-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
tomorrow?

[09-May-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
:troll:

[09-May-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol it will take weeks to even get something simple working, and no way im rewriting oracles with it... but maybe with my example someone else can do it

[09-May-19 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
I'll get to this tomorrow or the next day

[09-May-19 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
don't want to lose my focus on payments testing

[09-May-19 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe rollback oracles changes in jl777 for now ?

[09-May-19 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Or it will be merged to FSM and so on 😃

[09-May-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
probably already there tbh.. lots of thing merged around yestarday

[09-May-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
I really don't think that's the problem

[09-May-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
I was experiencing the oraclessamples thing disappearing prior to my changes

[09-May-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
I think I understand why it's happening now

[09-May-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
it's only following a single set of batons

[09-May-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
so when you oraclesregister again, it creates a new baton that has no samples

[09-May-19 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
and oraclesinfo does not show the old set of batons, so it "erases" the other set of oraclessamples

[09-May-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
baton should be limited to 1 no? isnt that what a baton means, that there is only 1 of them and it has to be passed around?

[09-May-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
well...

[09-May-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
I really don't know, I'll play with it soon

[09-May-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Idea was to left space to change datafee

[09-May-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a if you want other datafee you register again

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the VerusChanges, I think we can "attach" this baton directly to the ccvout itself,a nd just pass it form vin->vout... then simple as checking what tx is unspent in the CoinsView.

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless i missunderstand something

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
ok let me know when that's ready :troll:

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
😐

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[09-May-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just theorizing

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe allow `pubkey` have only one register event per oracle

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And then some call like a `changedatafee` to change data fee

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
😃

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
needs a hard fork if you do that

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
anyone can register with any pubkey as it doesn't require a sig from the pubkey

[09-May-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
a oraclesdata requires a sig

[09-May-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just undo whatever it is you did and lets make a new solution for the problem tryuing top be solved, avoid hard forks 😄

[09-May-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
oraclesregister does not atm

[09-May-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
like 95% sure it wasn't what I did

[09-May-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
AGAIN, going back to payments testing

took me days to understand what's going on, need to keep it fresh

[09-May-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
`like 95% sure it wasn't what I did` I have opposite sure because before oracleCC unit tests passed  😂

[09-May-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
want to bet?

[09-May-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
no joke

[09-May-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
What is the point of such bet?

[09-May-19 12:48 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder end goal is to have bug-free software, not make gambling on reasons of bugs lol

{Reactions}
🤣 

[09-May-19 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
if we're each so sure of ourselves, it's good fun

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I'm making assumption now, you changed the code so should understand more how it works. Should be -EV bet for me

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] CrisF#3405
Table MAX 1 KMD

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
lol

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
no worries, man

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
wasn't trying to kick shit up, did mean it as a fun "not uh"

[09-May-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
am testing it now anyway 😫

[09-May-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, no prob. Tried to find smile with some "bro hugs" but found only some dude which look like touching boobs 🤗

[09-May-19 12:51 PM] CrisF#3405
🍻

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] CrisF#3405
No boob touching allowed.

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine your idea of a bro hug is much different than mine

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
I think payments stability is nice focus 😃 PricesCC gonna to use it

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
🤣

{Reactions}
😂 

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it should be priority to fix oracles (or at least revert whatever you changed so you have no blame) payments thing can wait man.

[09-May-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
yea going to feel like an ass hat if I broke this

[09-May-19 12:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
