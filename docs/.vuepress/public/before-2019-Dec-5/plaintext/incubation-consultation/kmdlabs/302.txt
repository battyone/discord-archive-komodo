used hundreds of ties

[20-Feb-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think it may have broken, it didn't take this long to consolidate them

[20-Feb-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont know what you did... dont know if its been changed...

[20-Feb-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pegging the fek out of CPU usage though

[20-Feb-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my guess is that with such a large balance its not able to work

[20-Feb-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if your using on MGNX that is?

[20-Feb-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

0% variance WILL NOT WORK

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it should have a check for that 🤣

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hell even 1% will work

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thnk I always use 10

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at this size, there's no point to variance 😛

[20-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so ... the math would say otherwise

[20-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly helps

[20-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Trick is to have all utxo have varieing difficulties

[20-Feb-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they need all diffrent ages and sizes.

[20-Feb-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ages only works by leaving them for a long long time

[20-Feb-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it caps at a month

[20-Feb-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm staking 70-90% of blocks, I think I'm doing fine 😛

[20-Feb-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol...

[20-Feb-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, 1% works

👍 

[20-Feb-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
had to consolidate 6 nodes just to figure out how much I had :troll:

[20-Feb-19 02:28 PM] jorian#4555
MGNX? 💀

[20-Feb-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```File "/home/genie/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/slickrpc/rpc.py", line 75, in call
    raise RpcException(resp['error'], method, params) 
slickrpc.exc.RpcWalletInsufficientFunds: sendmany: Insufficient funds (code -6)```
seems the final rounding of RND is off

[20-Feb-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1% might be too low.. its always worked witj 10

[20-Feb-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but like I said I dont think ive spit that many before

[20-Feb-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its upposed to target a number that leaves 1 coin in change...

[20-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how am I supposed to stake this useless coin if I can't split? 😭

[20-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes looking for his splitter, because he knows it works_

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it does split. ... or already has... but failed on the last sendmany

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so split that utxo manually

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you forget tx fees, maybe?

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Only guess is using a single utxo to split to 6400 ...

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe they play a role but I thin kits more liley tryin to split the change

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] gt#2812
```[master] ABORTING!!! failed to update, Help Human!```

[20-Feb-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that isnt confirmed

`./zcutil/build.sh`

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then start again

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] gt#2812
ok

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`more liley tryin to split the change`
if you build it right, there is no change :troll:

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] jorian#4555
./start.sh update fails

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] jorian#4555
have to purge komodo

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] jorian#4555
and rebuild on a 2 core machine

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what the fuck are you talking about.. it cannot split that many at once in a single tx ... IT HAS TO SPEND CHANGE

[20-Feb-19 02:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and also I didnt write the splitter

[20-Feb-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I built onto it...

[20-Feb-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It works just fine... your just using tiw rong

Well I was usig it to test 0 BR chains that have fuck all staking weight

[20-Feb-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks.You installed TOR and did IP tables rule also ?

[20-Feb-19 02:45 PM] gt#2812
yep, those should be good

[20-Feb-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure its wokring... but I can watch my extra prints and see if your node is still talking to me for a little bit before I get some sleep.

[20-Feb-19 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181

non-updated

[20-Feb-19 05:37 PM] CMaurice#1685
Hrm, seems to be as sporadic as tor is

[20-Feb-19 07:49 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Updated and assumed working @blackjok3r

[20-Feb-19 10:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks guys

[20-Feb-19 10:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll check it out today see if its working at all, my guess is that its probably going to make everything extremely unreliable

[20-Feb-19 10:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it would be good if u update please as your node is one of the very top ones, it would give more accurate data if you updated please

[20-Feb-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it'll be 16-20 hrs before I can get to installing stuff and messing about with fw on that server 😕

[20-Feb-19 10:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK. Only took 5 mins here but that's fine. Enough ppl seem to have updated to get some idea if it does anything

[21-Feb-19 01:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well.. It seems that tor still "works" but to gauge it properly we really need all nodes on it.

[21-Feb-19 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So for now, I guess we wait for everyone to install it, because changing the port for nodes that are not using it isnt going to give a very good indication. AS the total number of nodes will be far smaller.

[21-Feb-19 01:23 AM] CrisF#3405
re-doing now.  if all goes well, updated soon.

[21-Feb-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cheers its mostly Genie and Webworkers and CHMEX that need to do it I think... their nodes are just flying ahead... TBH it might not even be network, but this test will give a definitive answer either way.

[21-Feb-19 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node is just using very old hardware, which could be its entire problem... in which case I may have to just get another VPS with better specs 😦 
Seems to be doing just fine on mainnet latley though

[21-Feb-19 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CHMEX  @webworker01  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  @Nabob  @TonyL  @zatJUM  @gcharang  @SHossain @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 
I think your nodes are not yet updated. Can you please update ASAP to use TOR. This is just a test to see what it does and if its a viable very simple solution to make notarization counts distributed more to OP reaction and skill than node location, if it works, we dont need to enforce regions or any make any crazy code changes to iguana. So far it seems that nodes using tor are basically cut off from the network, as the recvmask is decided by your nodes before our packets are received.

[21-Feb-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It could also be that tor makes the network cease to function. But we cant know this until all nodes have updated. I have 1 notarization since switching on tor, so its not totally breaking it.

[21-Feb-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instructions are in the top pin 😃 its pretty simple and easy to do.

[21-Feb-19 03:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
done

[21-Feb-19 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I can update only tomorrow

[21-Feb-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats fine man. possible to just take your ndoe down until then ?

[21-Feb-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really want to be forced to change port to test this, as we really need large numbers of nodes to know if it works or not.

[21-Feb-19 04:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
updated and installed tor

[21-Feb-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks mate. Moniroting whats happening. Loooks liuke tor has very high packet loss, so going to try to send 2 packets on each send but wont ping to update for a while.

[21-Feb-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as mor nodes update notarizations just seem to start to fail... which was kind of what I expected to happen. But it was worth a try. 😃

[21-Feb-19 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh wow... im getting quite a few notarizations now 😄 Might not need the double send. Will wait for more to update. As im not sure what a double reveive would do on the receiving side.

[21-Feb-19 04:37 AM] CrisF#3405
how to tell if successfully using tor?

[21-Feb-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent been able to really work that out, but I can say that the ndoes using it, are dropping off my receive prints, and your node isnt there. Its quite funny really, I thaught that tor ndoes packets were just not arriving, but it seeme they are, just the print doesnt know what node it is, So we are gaining some privacy but only to each other 😄

[21-Feb-19 04:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, will my notarozations are down, so maybe I've got it going.

[21-Feb-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it had the efect of basically stopping them dead... but since that last 2 updates all chains isntantly started notarizing again for me. Hopefully there are not 2 networks both notarizing.

[21-Feb-19 04:40 AM] gt#2812
ive had notarizations since updating but less than before

[21-Feb-19 04:40 AM] CrisF#3405
haha

[21-Feb-19 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I been watching stats... I actually think this might be viable as a solution at least if all nodes use it... I need to think about how to enforce it... But its very easy to see who isnt using it... and just taking action such as blcoking their IP until they conform, or voting them out of their spot, should be fine.

[21-Feb-19 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is much easier than regions limiting and much easier to enforce.
