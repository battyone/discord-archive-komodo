Just have same prints on other node lol

[21-Apr-19 04:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats correct, dpow checkpoints are in komodostate and signedmasks files, but less important, as once 1 notarization happens your are protected anyway.

Hi, @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator, I should be able to get into it a little this week and quite a bit more over the weekend/ next week.

[22-Apr-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah likely by the time anyone has any free time, I will have the script done

NP.  If you need anyone to send out funds I can help out with that. (Have to get some funds first though, haha)

[22-Apr-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might do the script later tonight, but really need to finsh what I started here before getting distracted on other things. Doesnt seem a lot to go.

[22-Apr-19 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Sounds important.  No problem to finish up what you're onto.

[22-Apr-19 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
If we set it up for later in the week we should be able to get a few people involves üòÉ

`kmdlabs.io` is currently being redirected to the `.com` site so there is no change in the site itself.
The site will be moved to it's new `.io` home as time permits.
Thanks

quick question... having trouble importing a z addy...

[22-Apr-19 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
Agama Win UI only asks for WIF but im assuming the secret-extended-key-main1qd... version is not in WIF for privkeys?

[22-Apr-19 12:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
So how do you import with that type of key?

[22-Apr-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`secret-extended-key-main1qd...` is a __W__allet __I__nput __F__ormat

[22-Apr-19 01:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok...

[22-Apr-19 01:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
i see the issue

[22-Apr-19 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
without triggering a rescan... it works...

[22-Apr-19 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
i can see the address listed... going to restart the wallet now...

{Reactions}
üëçüèΩ 

[22-Apr-19 01:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
but before, with rescan... Win UI throws repeated errors and will not import... it corrupts the wallet.dat and forces it into .bak format.

[22-Apr-19 01:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
Has anyone else seen any users complain about lost wallets with the move to v 3.5?

[22-Apr-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Pirate wallet took a dump the moment it opened and I had to manually run the command in the CLI window to force import and scan the z key

[22-Apr-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
lost a 35MB wallet... new one is scanning and is half way done now...

[22-Apr-19 02:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
How'd you mean? If you can offer more details I'll let devs know. My pirate wallet was fine tho.

[22-Apr-19 02:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I don't mine to it, but get a  few mining users with  joinsplit issues from time to time. Not just on new releases.

[22-Apr-19 02:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Mostly native wallet issues are due to rough exit

[22-Apr-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
is the automated windows wallet corruptor enabled?

I'm not on Windows, maybe that's why mine is fine üòÇ

[22-Apr-19 03:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
I just DLd v 3.5 and launched it and launched Pirate. It failed to load and I saw the wallet gile change to .bak. Relaunched and new wallet.dat was created. Tried to restart it, rename and restart all same.

[22-Apr-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
So I used the clean wallet to import the key via the UI and toggled the Trigger Rescan switch. It announced it was importing in the pop up then repeated red pop ups that refresh dashboard failed.

[22-Apr-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
maybe #deleted-channel ?

[22-Apr-19 03:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
That wallet also corrupted

[22-Apr-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
so clean wallet again, import no rescan and that got the address... but starting the Pirate coin manually with the UI flag to rescan using Daemon Params still did not trigger a rescan properly so I did it manually in the CLI and that worked.

[22-Apr-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ ill paste it there as well

Major update. Might have to clear out old ~/komodo folder and bootstrap/reindex"

[23-Apr-19 07:01 AM] CMaurice#1685
is that KMD reindex?

[23-Apr-19 07:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I just bootstraped KMD after clearing out the folder (except wallet.dat and komodo.conf).

[23-Apr-19 07:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Assetchains were fine with a reindex.

[23-Apr-19 07:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
try `make clean` before `./zcutil/build.sh`

[23-Apr-19 07:34 AM] CMaurice#1685

This script should be working with DRAGON/HOUND chains. 
I did a manual migrate and that worked, was a changd in 1 RPC but apart from that everything else should be the same. Havent actually run it can someone else please check it and ping me if its not working.

The tokens stuff is just a tokenid hexstring as an optional param at teh createburntrasnaction step.

[25-Apr-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should be trivial to add that to the script as a question or something if someone can do this. üòÉ

[25-Apr-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That should get you guys started testing out token mighrates and normal migrates.

[25-Apr-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
good shit, will work on it today

[27-Apr-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess nobody checked it, because it crashed for me just then. Pushed fix.

[27-Apr-19 05:29 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I would if I didnt have to pay bills........plus I'm just a weekend non coder..."tester".... k64 looks like you guys could do business together though

[27-Apr-19 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah possibly. The labs teting platform would be suited to testing gamescc, thats what it was made for. We shall see how it turns out I guess... Still havent even launched the chain üò¶

[27-Apr-19 05:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
They only have 1 side

[27-Apr-19 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its clearly ready to go. I'm pretty sure of that. Everything we worked on is working perfectly stable.

[27-Apr-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
most of the code is in KMD itself now... you can sync staked chains with it and they work as far as I know.

[27-Apr-19 05:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
You have the other 3

[27-Apr-19 05:32 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm sure you can make a mutual agreenent

[27-Apr-19 05:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Or not....this is why people fork I guess

[27-Apr-19 05:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Open source is the JL777 way....

[27-Apr-19 05:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
You guys are the way to make it work well......

[27-Apr-19 05:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll go back to lurking

There were a fwe things I paid attention to at school. Algebra and physics, turned out to be super useful skills... while most others were like "what this is usless", I just learnt it and got really high grades... Didnt even apply for uni, because I failed English in year 10 and never did it for TEE (uni enterance thing here) school was rpetty confused why I was doing TEE subjects when I couldnt apply for uni with my overall subkect selection but they let me do it. ü§£

to do a blockchain game properly is hard. Like very hard it seems.
