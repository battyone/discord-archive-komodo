they could cut the price of these new CPUs in 1/2 if they stopped shipping them in $400 cases

[23-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and really dint cost much (got barod and CPU second hand though)

[23-Nov-18 04:34 PM] jorian#4555
nice

[23-Nov-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they really aren't "expensive" if you figure the 4x price of 4 setups that are 1/4 the power

[23-Nov-18 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
what do you use it for? mining?

[23-Nov-18 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
ultra fast compilation?

[23-Nov-18 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
showing off?

[23-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine ... it gets 1GH on verus, but hasntbeen mining it for a few days

[23-Nov-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, I forget... when/how do NNs get paid?

[23-Nov-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
compile times and really fast chain syncs

[23-Nov-18 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
saves a LOT of time

in the next bull run i promised myself to buy a beast of a desktop

[23-Nov-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jorian for me, I'm going to start branching off into PoS as well as all my PoW

[23-Nov-18 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
i will look how the market is by then

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol I did it in bear

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] jorian#4555
and you need powerful cpu for PoS? or just a heap of cores

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS is single core at least for KMD

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmmm, do we have some sort of explorer for CFEK?

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not yet ... alright usually does them ut they never gotdont this time... too busy

[23-Nov-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and you need powerful cpu for PoS? or just a heap of cores`
32 chains on 1 setup vs 4 setups each running 8

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] jorian#4555
you could ping chmex

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
weird stuff on CFEK only, seems my tx is not mined at all

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEK is contantly always stalled

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if Genie can put a couple of GPUs on it ... will move again

but the challenge is not to NTRZ CFEK?

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
problem is that the coins supply is so large PoS drives up diff higher than CPU cna mine it

[23-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its stuck at 100% PS at target 50

[23-Nov-18 04:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause it works with my version, but CFEK not

if we don t care about CFEK I can let the node running, am already notarizing it seems

[23-Nov-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just as very slow blocks ...been known about form start

[23-Nov-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
isnt porblem...a few thousand sol corrects it fine

[23-Nov-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181

ok, if the goal and the key to keep the spot is not to ntrz there is ok ^^

[23-Nov-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a few thousand ksol` = 3Msol/s+.... because, words

[23-Nov-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to notarise the new chain tomorrow to get spot CFEK is not imporant

[23-Nov-18 04:42 PM] CrisF#3405
I stopped cpu mining CFEK and started ING mining.

[23-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, that s fine, I added it on autopilot so I ll just have to refresh

hope I ll get better chances on it than I had on staking stuff @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 for the time being(until we can figure out a contract) 10% of BRs go to a multisig address, every 2 weeks, a payout will be made based on notarization counts

[23-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
so round about way of doing pay per notarization until we can make a contract to do it

[23-Nov-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought so, but wanted to make sure

[23-Nov-18 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hardest aprt about contract, is that the data is all on KMD... but KMD does not have contracts ... so the data needs toget from KMD to the LABS main chain somehow to count them.

[23-Nov-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
if you search `We don't need 100% of signers to sign each bi-weekly transaction, just some %. The % will be based on response to this message.` you'll see the people who agreed to be signers

[23-Nov-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about a few ways fo this... but nothign so far seems simple enough to be fool proof

[23-Nov-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fyi pad gateway = brokededed

[23-Nov-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
having the notary nods be paid to a seperate address on every single notarisation a micro tx, is aone way, but menas we ned to deal with heaps of dust gathering txs fo make them useful.

[23-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Alright#0419
yep, if you need the info from it lmk

[23-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Alright#0419
can give you access to WIP website

[23-Nov-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, just making sure you were aware

[23-Nov-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
another thing I tahught of is to just double notarise each notareisation to KMD to LABS main chain...

[23-Nov-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then a contract can count the txs made by each node

[23-Nov-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after X blocks pay out

[23-Nov-18 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least  i think thats possible ...

[23-Nov-18 04:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
