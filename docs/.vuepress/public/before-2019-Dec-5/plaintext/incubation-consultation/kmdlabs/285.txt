Yeah, I just resynced and all good it seems.

[10-Feb-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I've tested my fix myself here, by simply invalidationg block, causing my node to reorg a notarization... worked fine and reorged itself back into the main chain.

@blackjok3r what is the current status of TRE

[10-Feb-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
I'm confused

[10-Feb-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
which chain does it end up on after fresh sync?

[10-Feb-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what cased 2 chains,  but after resync it picked up a chain that was notarized ... the problem was that the miner (your node I take it) wasnt minigna ny notariszations being amde... when CrisF started miinng on his ntoary, notarisations form over 1000 blocks prior started to be confirmed

[10-Feb-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usin CPU mining and invalidateblock I was able to reorg notarization payments in and out of the chain and it always ended uyp back on the right chain... maybe just minign 1s blocks or less, is needed to cause it to go mental.

[10-Feb-19 05:25 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Sooo, are we at a point we can put a 'mining' chain back up on the ccid to get some coins to blast migrates, or that not needed anymore?

[10-Feb-19 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel do you mean simulating the main chain?

[10-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I suppose so - yes - something with a half decent block reward like CFEKX

[10-Feb-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
We haven't made many changes to momom recently, we've tested it before and know it works

[10-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
he will do it again once more prior to launch, but it's a not a priority until ac_notarypay is solid

[10-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
if you want to start a chain, feel free

[10-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
just start it and PR or PM the chain params to me

[10-Feb-19 06:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Nah - that's cool, just waiting on next steps.

[10-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Anyone made any progress on counting notarisations by address since fixed block?

[10-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Alright#0419
What was the problem exactly?

[10-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
I have a script for it, you need it?

[10-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Joker mentioned being able to loop through the blocks to work out how many notarisations had been, so you could count actual nn performance

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
yes, I have a script for this locally

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
do you want it? need to touch it up a bit if so

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
it will only work on ac_notarypay chains as it's checking coinbases

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
bare bones would be good - want to add it to my python stats

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
I remember why I didn't upload it now

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
because we still had chains that didn't have ac_notarypay

not as sloppy as my stats python

[10-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
but it's quicker than the bash

[10-Feb-19 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
that script is quite slow

[10-Feb-19 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
it's checking every single coinbase tx

[10-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I think the idea is to check only the last notary change-over set

[10-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, what?

[10-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
count notarisations since the last election

[10-Feb-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
hmmm just needs to change 
`for block in range(2,height):`
to 
`for block in range(<beginning height>,height):`

[10-Feb-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how we'd get that height though

[10-Feb-19 06:40 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I was thinking of looping backwards until I exceeded a timestamp

[10-Feb-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
What kind of stats do you have so far?

[10-Feb-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
have you been uploading scripts to git?

[10-Feb-19 06:44 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
still working on it - two different outputs depending on standard or notary

[10-Feb-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
what stats are you trying to show the user?

[10-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Alright#0419
just notarization count?

need to add percentage againsty possible notarizeations

[10-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
I was planning on making a stats dashboard kind of thing

[10-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
just add any useful stat we could think of

[10-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
possible should be `height/5 * 1/20`

[10-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
I think?

[10-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Alright#0419
I guess <height since notarizations started> makes more sense though

something is different between LABSTRE and LABST5 - or my programming is completely funky.

[10-Feb-19 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Bar_F1sh_Rel is there a noticeable lag between lines when it prints? maybe the time it takes *to* make the calls/prints?

[10-Feb-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I had an issue like that before because of wallet slowing calls

[10-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I'm reading the vouts from getblock and summing them against notary addresses in a table

[10-Feb-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or do you mean "Total Notarizations in timeframe"?

[10-Feb-19 09:45 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
total notarizations for the chain *should* be *block count / number of sigs* - so yes I do

[10-Feb-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
are you storing the previous calls or making 6k calls each time?

[10-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
see Alrights pastebin above

[10-Feb-19 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
well, I'm no help; I see:
```        if chain == 'KMD':
            rpcport = 7771
        else:
            print("rpcport not in conf file, exiting")
            print("check " + coin_config_file)

in a loop, ask RPC for block info (verbose), list the vouts, loop again through the vouts and read the addresses, if the address is in the address mask (a notary) +1 to that adresses notarisation count.

if it's skipping RPC replies because of latency (it could be - not sure how to check) I suppose I could queue it.

[10-Feb-19 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it looks like it should return what you're looking for
part of the discrepancy could be chain(s) moving while NNs were locked and/or on wrong chain?

back to block 2

[10-Feb-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
LABSTRE has 1/3 the sigs and 1.5x the blocks (rounding for simplicity)

[10-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
TRE also had a huge gap in notarizations

[10-Feb-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419

[10-Feb-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
I think 528 vs 1408 makes sense as notarizations on TRE weren't working for most of it's life

[10-Feb-19 11:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
These 2 chains are not the beat to test stats on as one stopped a bunch of times...a and the other had no notarizations for a day or 2

[10-Feb-19 11:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if these are working OK, we can try some new again for migrates.. Has to be checked before launch no doubt.

[10-Feb-19 11:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just a chain with huge blockreward in same clusted should be fine
