first chain to chain transfer -- not sure why these take so long

[27-Nov-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They need notarisations ... they takea while ..

[27-Nov-18 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the script everyone is using ... was mine that I wrote for colelcting a specific type of data, not really for poeple to use to send coins. It doesnt tell you wahts happening, nor does it fail gracefully...

[27-Nov-18 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It brute forces a migrate, and is designed so you can run hundreds of paralell ones, and determine which block the import failed at ... it needs a huge overhaul. I think it also needs to be re done in python, so it can give feedback about he process.

[27-Nov-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also needs to log each step, so it can be resumed in case of failure.

[27-Nov-18 02:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
logging

[27-Nov-18 02:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
yeah - I was looking for logfiles

[27-Nov-18 02:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I tried to tail one but no avail

[27-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar ... there are comments throuhgout the sript you can uncoment

[27-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what that will do is pront each command its polling

[27-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can copy paste that into another terminal

[27-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and see what error message its getting

[27-Nov-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the only way to make it work, was to keep polling each step until it succeeds

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Signing import tx on KMD...

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can manually do it wihtout doing that, but to automate the process... that was the only solution

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
all these steps tak forever

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are supposed to

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs notarisations

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a notarisations minimum time is 3 minutes

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im at 30

[27-Nov-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
max can be over 15-20 mins

[27-Nov-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and each step needs 1 or 2 notareisations

[27-Nov-18 02:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
for my second attempt

[27-Nov-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only thing I am concerned about is if the process completes 100% of the time.

[27-Nov-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if an export happens... an import MUST be valid ..

[27-Nov-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the rest is simply the script/GUI that will handle it

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as longa s the burn means the import is valid, then we are good.

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
are they not being notarized because the chaines arent being mined?

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There can be many reasons...

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarisaitons fail about 10% of the time

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they also need 5 blocks, of the chain and 3 blocks of KMD to activate.

[27-Nov-18 02:38 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Signing import tx on KMD...
pretty sure im going to be over 90 attempts

[27-Nov-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
signing import on KMD, wont stop polling as taht step has NEVER failed in the past

[27-Nov-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the ONLY step that has EVER failed is the import tx on the target

[27-Nov-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so tha ecript only checks for that

[27-Nov-18 02:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im at about 40 -- i didnt count

[27-Nov-18 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
signing import on KMD can take a VERY long time, if the chains are not being mined

[27-Nov-18 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it never fails

[27-Nov-18 02:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ok -- that makes sense

[27-Nov-18 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
migrates are more a set and forget ...they are a slow transaction and not really somehting yo uwould do often.

[27-Nov-18 02:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
BTW my UTXO error yesterday was because I had  gen=1 in conf and forgot to change it

[27-Nov-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[27-Nov-18 02:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so I had too many utxos

[27-Nov-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah dont mine on notary node man ... just dont do it .

[27-Nov-18 02:41 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
fmy UTXO reset script I hacked from you worked though

[27-Nov-18 02:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i wan mining BEFORE i notorized

[27-Nov-18 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will becasue it resets everyhting... I dont see whay you needed to remove the cleanwallettransactions call though ?

[27-Nov-18 02:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i forgot to change that chain to 0

[27-Nov-18 02:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
because it removed all my notorization count on that chain

[27-Nov-18 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what its supposed to do ...

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
until you rescan or restart

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not remving anything

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its removing transaction history from the wallet

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to make it go faster

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
di know

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant undo an on chain tx

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I know and am trying to understand the purpose

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet slows down, and the node stops notarising

[27-Nov-18 02:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i just needed the UTXO reset

[27-Nov-18 02:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
send myself total

[27-Nov-18 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I made it so tha, that condition just cannot happen here ...

[27-Nov-18 02:44 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
then utxosplitter.sh

[27-Nov-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
our wallet is special:
1) it will onyl reciev txs to its -pubkey address all others are ignored, even if hte privkey is imported
2) it wont accept txs that are under 1 coin (this cna be changed so it wont accept anything at all, or any defined size)

[27-Nov-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
3) it really does not keep tx history

[27-Nov-18 02:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i had too many utxos - and i was being lazy and adpted your script --

[27-Nov-18 02:46 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
it wont happen again

[27-Nov-18 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just run the script to fix the wallet ... if the stats script mis repots, that because its meant to üòÇ

[27-Nov-18 02:47 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
the  utxoreset.sh  i created is usleess if you do things right

[27-Nov-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wallet reset scripts for mainnet KMD notary nodes are liek 200 liens long and take over 5 mins to run ... we have it really good here üòÑ

[27-Nov-18 02:48 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
but knowing what happened is a lesson and so is removing txs from the wallet to make it run faster

[27-Nov-18 02:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im guessing faster/better  CPUs get more nota?

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I need to turn my Video Monster into a nota server i think

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very much so .... To make my 8 year old Opterons compete with $50,000 dual Xeon Golds, I had to optimize the shit out of komodod and iguana.

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but everything I created for that, is built into LABS

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so everyone has it

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¶

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im getting shit for luck outta this test server

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no advantage

[27-Nov-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh ...

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
except ping

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node is shit as

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
nerfing ping advantage is a long term goal

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ping make s afair diffrence ... spcifically ping to enpugh nodes, to get min sigs ... if we increase minsigs to a much higher number, it ay mitigate the issue a lot

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] Alright#0419
no idea how we will do it with current iguana, but is needed

[27-Nov-18 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its needed very much so, but only to a point

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
CFEKLAMEDUCKS     64

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont want it to wait like 5mins for a slow node to respond...

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
is al low number

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there has to be some cut off for recvmask to be agreed upon

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im guessing

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar seems ok... ive reset mine at 104 ...

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so no idea

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need some kind of stats site... really

[27-Nov-18 02:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@SHossain  is probably over 250
