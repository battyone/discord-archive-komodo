I think that the "help human" error means that you must sync the node yourself manually before running the script

[25-Jun-19 09:54 PM] phm87#7395
About the fact that I had 0 notas in 20 days and that it works since yesterday, I still have no clues why I had this error. But yesterday, metaphilibert suggested to me to try encryptwallet and it seems that it unstuck iguana (I'm using mylo key). Thank you everyone for the help
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"bitcoinrpc\",\"method\":\"encryptwallet\",\"passphrase\":\"xxx\"}"```

[25-Jun-19 10:07 PM] zatJUM#9924
Never heard that before

[26-Jun-19 01:09 AM] Exile13#4458
@phm87 run this while the NN is runnng or after `./stop.sh`

[26-Jun-19 01:26 AM] Exile13#4458
do i need to start iguana

[26-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Exile13#4458
i `./stop.sh` then ran iguana and set the encrypted pw, then stopped and `./start.sh` still errored

[26-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Exile13#4458
LABS and KMD are running but no notarizations

[26-Jun-19 02:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
It can take a while to get into gear before hrs after a start. If no ntx after  6hrs, probably bad

Maybe just resync

[26-Jun-19 05:31 AM] Exile13#4458
how?

[26-Jun-19 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what does your CFEKBET1 debug.log say is the problem?

[26-Jun-19 05:35 AM] PHBA2061#2530
`[CFEKBET1] ABORTING - CFEKBET1 has no network connections` somehow your CFEKBET1 has 0 connection

[26-Jun-19 05:36 AM] Exile13#4458
`tail -f ~/.komodo/LABS/CFEKBET1/debug.log`?

[26-Jun-19 05:37 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`nano ~/.komodo/CFEKBET1/debug.log` then actively debug your issue by reading the debug 游뗵

[26-Jun-19 05:47 AM] Exile13#4458
am i looking for the first error or the most recent return

[26-Jun-19 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
most likely at the end

[26-Jun-19 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you care why now, not why 2 days ago

[26-Jun-19 05:49 AM] Exile13#4458
just scrolling to the end i see alot of errors

[26-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Exile13#4458

thats the most recent error

[26-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Exile13#4458
so i cant connect to 159.69.45.70:55453 and it fails?

[26-Jun-19 05:54 AM] Exile13#4458
and that stops ALL notarizations for LABS?

[26-Jun-19 05:57 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I just check both CEFKBET1 seed nodes in <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json> are not reachable from my side, if they're not reachable from your side either then u won't be able to sync from scratch

[26-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Exile13#4458
*hold pattern* ?

[26-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Exile13#4458
the seed nodes hold the 'seed' of the chain for launch

[26-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Exile13#4458
correct?

[26-Jun-19 06:02 AM] PHBA2061#2530
for syncing purpose

[26-Jun-19 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
seed nodes are dedicated nodes that allow peers to sync
basically if you set up a node with a static IP and guaranteed it will always be on and available for others to get blocks/txes from

[26-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Exile13#4458
ok ty

[26-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Exile13#4458
ill just do some backflips

[26-Jun-19 06:04 AM] PHBA2061#2530
what  I would do in this case is manually replace the seed IP of CFEKBET1 in `assetchains.json` with 1 of these: 
```
    "addr": "46.101.113.110:55453",
    "addr": "144.76.167.66:55453",
    "addr": "159.69.201.122:55453",
    "addr": "81.19.208.78:55453",
    "addr": "149.28.8.219:55453",
    "addr": "51.38.82.189:55453",
    "addr": "94.23.1.95:55453",
    "addr": "116.203.44.101:55453",
    "addr": "103.6.12.112:55453",
```

[26-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Exile13#4458
wheres that .json?

[26-Jun-19 06:05 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you might have to cd into the ~/komodo folder and manually checkout/build pricescomp and cp the komodod to the pricescomp dir in StakedNotary/komodo

[26-Jun-19 06:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530
in StakedNotary/master/assetchains.json
