[26-Oct-19 07:12 PM] Oszy#5734
one can only guess after carefully examines them 😄

[26-Oct-19 07:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
sent .1 LABS to it on an new address... Synced no pubkey, was new wallet so gotnewaddress, validated and got pubkey, dumpprivkey, added all three to config.ini, setpubkey and launched NNvote.py. Sent .1 LABS to new address and waited

[26-Oct-19 07:19 PM] Oszy#5734
and?

[26-Oct-19 07:19 PM] daemonfox#6136

[26-Oct-19 07:57 PM] Oszy#5734

[26-Oct-19 10:55 PM] Alright#0419
oracles is fine, just an issue with how oraclessamples shows samples that are still in mempool

[26-Oct-19 10:55 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't have any issues submitting the data, just retrieving it

[26-Oct-19 10:56 PM] Alright#0419
told him to try a fresh clone, looks like daemon is outdated

[26-Oct-19 10:58 PM] Oszy#5734

[27-Oct-19 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136

`someone mining like crazy`
looks like just a run of lucky blocks, hashrate didn't move much (if at all)

[27-Oct-19 06:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*lucky blocks* 😂

[27-Oct-19 06:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
looks like there was a decent stretch of PoS... a ton of my 8 coin blocks minted last 200 blocks

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Old Man Phil#5934
I feel lucky I staked a block today on an address with 8 coins in it
