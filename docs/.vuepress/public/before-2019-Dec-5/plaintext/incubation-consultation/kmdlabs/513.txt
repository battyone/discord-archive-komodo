@blackjok3r pretty sure you're trying to fix an non-existent build error

[07-Nov-19 08:25 PM] Alright#0419
built it fine on two separate machines

[07-Nov-19 08:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 4 machines here... nad it works on 1, then Ichange something and it works on another...

[07-Nov-19 08:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now I knoiw why nobody else tried to fix it

[07-Nov-19 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[07-Nov-19 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@SHossain  I fixed KMD not starting... `daemon=1` stops `screen` from working. Update is pushed. please let me know if this works or not.

Manually building now

[08-Nov-19 12:52 AM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r Even after manually building komodod I get the output as above ^^

[08-Nov-19 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah make clean

[08-Nov-19 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or you may need to reclone

[08-Nov-19 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry, forcepushed by accident a few hours back

[08-Nov-19 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to do 3 nodes reclone :abusedsmily:

[08-Nov-19 12:54 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. did `make clean` on komodo dir and building again

[08-Nov-19 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if doesnt work, do git pull manually.. it might be conflicting

[08-Nov-19 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the build is finally 100% but every system is diffrent

[08-Nov-19 12:54 AM] SHossain#0007
let's see how this goes

[08-Nov-19 02:08 AM] gt#2812
you may have to remove and rebuild from scratch

[08-Nov-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats what I did. remove ~/komodo 
and run `buildkomodo.sh` again

[08-Nov-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then start.sh

[08-Nov-19 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
May be more build isssues.. may need to revert OCTET STING fix  if so... I guess doing start.sh 3 +times can be lived with

built fine for me on clean clone, so I'm guessing it's still the same branch switch issues as before? 🤷🏽

[08-Nov-19 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r i removed komodo dir and issued `./buildkomodo.sh` then `./start.sh` earlier. will do that again.

[08-Nov-19 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007
StakedNotary repo is using master branch

[08-Nov-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need tje exact build errors please

[08-Nov-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will be in RED from a manual build complaing of dual delcarations for cryptoconditions

[08-Nov-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Was basically tral and error to get it working, on all my nodes its ok.. but its very tempremental

[08-Nov-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Have no problem just removing it if its causing nodes not to build every time...

[08-Nov-19 02:10 PM] CrisF#3405
rebuilding again now.

[08-Nov-19 02:11 PM] CrisF#3405
komodo running fine after only 1 failed build.
Having a bit more trouble with NN

[08-Nov-19 02:26 PM] CrisF#3405
up and running after `rm -rf komodo` `start.sh`, but unable to split utxos.

[08-Nov-19 02:36 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r What should I set the fee as (if that is the trouble)?

[08-Nov-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why fee at all?

[08-Nov-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[08-Nov-19 02:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Just comment it out?

[08-Nov-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe, it depends on what the code uses

[08-Nov-19 02:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I didn't change anything.

[08-Nov-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, joker did
😛

[08-Nov-19 02:43 PM] CrisF#3405
haha, I'll have a look at the code.

<https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blame/master/splitfunds.sh#L61>

[08-Nov-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I added a small; tx fee for KMD so that the split tx dont dissapear causing wallet conflicts

[08-Nov-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know its a problem and have seen it personally happed plenty of times... drove me insane trying to sort the iguana "spent utxos" issue

[08-Nov-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, it feked me hard the other day; took 4 hrs for the tx to go through

[08-Nov-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
4 hrs on KMD chain 🤦🏽

[08-Nov-19 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So I didnt do it correctly? Cant say I tested it on my node, but I was able to split sucessfully with the change a few times.. will fix right now

[08-Nov-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So I didnt do it correctly?`
sometimes odd things can happen using jq to do math with vars

[08-Nov-19 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes i removed the "tx must not be coinbase" because it doesnt...

[08-Nov-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why I prefer bc and echoing scale

[08-Nov-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wil just put it back.

[08-Nov-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
take a few seconds

[08-Nov-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wait its something else lol.. testing fix wont be long

[08-Nov-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
KMd spiit working

[08-Nov-19 02:55 PM] CrisF#3405
Awesome!  Confirmed here.  Thanks man 👍

[08-Nov-19 02:56 PM] CrisF#3405
What was it that you fixed?

[08-Nov-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries, my mistake. I think it was a needed change thiough was causing issues for all kinds of thigns making me run in circles

[08-Nov-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
jq needs to specicfy --arg

[08-Nov-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`SPLIT_TOTAL=$(jq -n --arg txfee $txfee "$SPLIT_VALUE*($SPLIT_COUNT+$txfee)")`
`SPLIT_TOTAL=$(jq -n  "$SPLIT_VALUE*($SPLIT_COUNT+$txfee)")`

[08-Nov-19 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At some point all chains may need a txfee... but KMD actually NEEDS it now.

you and/or james can fix wtf ever one of you broke that stops 0 fees from processing properly :troll:

I launched it for height 50000 then 100000 then 150000 before trying to have coinsupply until current height:

[09-Nov-19 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has 9.49% of the supply :shexy:_

Might add a backup to use iguana split funds if that script fails... Or just a param to switch it manually.

[10-Nov-19 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`(standard_in) 1: syntax error`
If you've not manually edited the script recently, then check the steps it does; that reads like something is returning null or an unexpected string instead of a number to jq

[10-Nov-19 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either way, *something* is malformed in the process

[10-Nov-19 01:39 PM] bishop#9773
`git reset --hard` in the komodo folder prior to launching the start.sh script got the utxosplitter working again.
