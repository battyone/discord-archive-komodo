maybe we should hard fork, not sure

[06-Jun-19 01:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine weren't, but KMD is currently empty because I'm using my master wallets to push stuff around
If we want to do all new (rather than any known issues -even though I'm not sure why whose would exist 🤷🏽 ), then ping me and I can swap

[06-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
Well... this was a shit show, but I'm getting back to hacking away at CCs. I do think we should hard fork to change *all* the keys though. Opinions on that?

[06-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Alright#0419
I'd also like to explore what we'll be doing for our wallet. I'm in favor of electrum qt desktop wallet fork

[06-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Exile13#4458
I like qt wallets

[06-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Exile13#4458
Whatever needs done im down, I'm not too keen on the technical aspects like you all.

[06-Jun-19 02:07 AM] gt#2812
i think changing all keys might be worthwhile

[06-Jun-19 02:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Change of keys I'd say.  A bit of an inconvenience, but that's what NNs are paid for.
When it comes to securing other's investments the choice seems clear.

`A bit of an inconvenience, but that's what NNs are paid for.`
hardforks don't just impact NNs

[06-Jun-19 03:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, must be difficult for the pool.
Tony, too.

[06-Jun-19 03:35 AM] CrisF#3405

My labs NN address was imported into wallet.dat being used by Agama 🤦 but was not swept. I did it via CLI on desktop PC. I'm ok to wait for the 2 month hardfork window, unless it is deemed neccesary to change.

I think it's superfluous for labs: not many pubs could be corrupted (hopefully less than minsig), we have just labs, cfekcfek and cfekbet1 for now, and those are only valid for 2 monthes.

[06-Jun-19 05:24 AM] zatJUM#9924
Let's vote! 😉

[06-Jun-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah do a vote

[06-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Mylo#8306
as an innocent bystander, yeah HF - be good practise and you've got enough stuff to work on than deal with unexpected behaviour.

[06-Jun-19 09:19 AM] CrisF#3405
I trust in the knowledge and integrity of those who say that it isn't much of a security threat.
My opinion to hardfork, even though a pain is the ass, is based on the idea that it is probably a good habit for me to get into and to demonstrate LABS commitment to security.

[06-Jun-19 09:21 AM] CrisF#3405
That being said, I don't know how much of a difficulty a hf would be on others, or the level of threat, if any, posed.

[06-Jun-19 09:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I vote that we put it to a  vote.

I vote for voting on Jorian's idea on voting smk762's vote!
(when the situation permits)

[06-Jun-19 10:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Was thinking maybe make a short `reasons for hf` and `reasons against hf` list people could add to so that people could make an informed vote?
ie:
`against hf`
-  acceptable security risk (example)
-  would cause difficulties for current projects, LABS, pools, exchanges (example)
`for hf`
- set a precedent (example)
- show future projects and investors a commitment to security (example)

[06-Jun-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`would cause difficulties for current projects, LABS, pools, exchanges (example)`
imo, the "difficulty" of those examples would be more in getting them to do it and nothing more; the real issue is any "normal" users, because for that example list, it's 2 minutes and done

[06-Jun-19 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, should be quite a few more users now.

[06-Jun-19 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
What do you think should be done, if anything?

[06-Jun-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My personal preference is:
* hf now while it's "young", 👶🏽 
* field any "user support", ☑ and 
* slap the piss out of anyone that used Agama for their NN addy 🤦🏽

[06-Jun-19 03:39 PM] daemonfox#6136
Has someone proposed the full scope of the hf in question? Awaiting all claims possible to make sure the end point addresses gets a fat 0 on the new chain? Awaiting a certain amount to be identified as stolen before picking when to hf? New NN pubkeys etc are all well and good, restoring lost funds is great though messy... i think the real question is if the hf scope should include the foundations of using votes to govern the code commits. I think the NN operators need to provide consensus for all commits to the Komodo family of repositories.

No CFEKBET1  notas for more than 2 days now (no new blocks, it seems)

[06-Jun-19 08:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
seems like we fork on CFEKBET1

[06-Jun-19 08:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
mine is still notarizing on CFEKBET1, but only has 4 connections

[06-Jun-19 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
btw and fwiw:
There is at least one known instance of an R address/key pair that was never actively entered into Agama (but it was in wallet file), the user never used Agama in light (electrum) mode, and was compromised. 😖

🤔 

[06-Jun-19 09:54 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I also dropped connections on `BET1`. 5 at the moment.
Have been notarizing though. 17 in the last ~8 hours.

@daemonfox don't think you understand what we're proposing. We aren't looking to return funds via a hard fork, we're trying to change the NN keys that were compromised

[07-Jun-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577

any idea why it did that?

`any idea why it did that?`
Actually my blocks amount wasnt equal to longestchain

[07-Jun-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
using current FSM branch, which if it tests out good, will be pushed up the branches, up to master

[07-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
what is the deal with CCs? Believe you mentioned just doing return False for some of them in master?

[07-Jun-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody know where @blackjok3r is?

[07-Jun-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
for the CC that are not ready, we can return false in the validation function

[07-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
He was around last night, should be here sometime soon I imagine

[07-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
Can we just enforce ac_ccenable?

[07-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think any chain should use ac_cc without ac_ccenable to be frank

[07-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
I think leave CC validation as is and *highly* recommend chains use ac_ccenable if they use ac_cc

[07-Jun-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that will change the chain magic

[07-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
if not, we need timestamp deactivations in all existing ones we want to disable

[07-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
or exceptions for individual chains

[07-Jun-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think any production chain is using prices or pegs

[07-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
that's the only two we need to deactivate?

[07-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
what do the testers say?

[07-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
deactivate them all by default with ac_cc, and implicitly activate any the chain needs via ac_ccenable. Not sure how this will work for existing chains, but activating a bunch of CCs you don't actually plan to use is not a good idea

[07-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Alright#0419
OUR, DION, KMDICE, CCL, SEC, EQL, COQUI, AXO, ILN, RICK, MORTY

chains with ac_cc and no ac_ccenable

[07-Jun-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we can have a default set of CC that are enabled if ac_ccenable is not set

[07-Jun-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be ok as long as the chain didnt already use the CC

[07-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
yes, that works, I'll put together which ones I expect no hard forks in in the near future

[07-Jun-19 10:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm running a post activation oracle for the last week or so, will check in on it  but no problems so far

[07-Jun-19 10:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[07-Jun-19 11:10 AM] CrisF#3405
`what do the testers say?`
I may be misunderstanding the question but will give an answer a try...  
As we (jl777) discussed previously, I'd also suggest CCs (at least certain CCs) are deactivated by default.

[07-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
