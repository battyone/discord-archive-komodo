if you have 1 utxo that is like 100,000 coins every 100 blocks it will stake instantly.

[12-Jun-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the py pos64staker was an example, its by no means the best strategy.

[12-Jun-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is a coin aimed at devs after all 😄 At least staking the coin is a bit of a challenge

[12-Jun-19 05:00 PM] jorian#4555
i guess i know my issue `your better off having large utxos rather thn millions of small ones.`

[12-Jun-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did the same shit after I sold some to james, I split to 640 utxos, so they were too small... and because everyone is using the staker, using lots of small utxos and going for maximum age doesnt work any more, because everyone is doing it by default 😦

[12-Jun-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Think ive staked about 8k coins or something since then so not that bad

[12-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if everybody has big utxo, the small ones are better

[12-Jun-19 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[12-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if everybody has small utxo, the big ones are better

[12-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a game

[12-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what the others do, most definitely affects things

[12-Jun-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
think about the PoS64 game

[12-Jun-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you will understand more

[12-Jun-19 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The tools I added only give you analysis about what has happened, adnd everyone is using them the same.

[12-Jun-19 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or most people

[12-Jun-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that is like making the same chess moves, regardless of what your opponent is doing

I'll do a PR to the readme (and maybe python code) to add the fixes to the problems that I had. Thank you

[12-Jun-19 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's how to write sendmany64.py in bash with 1/2 the lines of code 🤷🏽

[12-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jorian#4555
ah

[12-Jun-19 05:41 PM] jorian#4555
i am curious in how i can merge a mined LABS coinbase with the utxo that mined it

[12-Jun-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how do what?

[12-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
the answer lies in pos64staker

[12-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
an utxo stakes 8 LABS. i want to move 8 LABS into the utxo that mined it, so it becomes <utxo_amount> + 8

[12-Jun-19 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you'd have to use blocknotify and consolidate every time

[12-Jun-19 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
raws would be the best bet to do that

[12-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
blocknotify is where you define the location of the script that is called upon a new block right?

[12-Jun-19 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
need to read into that

[12-Jun-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[12-Jun-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you'd check the block to see if it was yours

[12-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
pubkey mining is necessary then

[12-Jun-19 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess you could use walletnotify instead

[12-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
or maybe not, validateaddress would be enough

[12-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
hmm

[12-Jun-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one thing is for sure, no one else is doing it that I know of 👍🏽

[12-Jun-19 05:47 PM] jorian#4555
it was assumed that whoever uses pos64staker, uses this trick

[12-Jun-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm lazy and just do this:

`79735.61305548 LABS`, that's a lot !

This script will take the last days stakes and distribute some % of funds equally to the segids that have staked the least. Just grabbed a bunch of code from otehr scripts. it worked for me, but not sure if any bugs

Is it possible to try to stake on my LABS NN? Or is it going to lower notas?

[12-Jun-19 06:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With the thing I just made today I think we can stake on notaries just fine. Ive been thinking about puttin it on mine, but its 3am lol.

[12-Jun-19 06:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
"the thing"? listunspent stuff?

[12-Jun-19 06:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes.

[12-Jun-19 06:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What it does is pull listunspnt, filter iguana utxos out and saves then, then every time iguana asks it simply gives is one and removes it from the list, all in ram, bypasses wallet.

[12-Jun-19 06:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you could hvabe a staking wallet running and it would just ignore it... in fact the more utxo you have the better it would work, because it doesnt have to "reload" as often.

[12-Jun-19 07:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to make sure its safe though, maybe if you consolidated utxos, it would be passing iguana spent ones.

[12-Jun-19 07:01 PM] zatJUM#9924
LABS is not merged in jl777 branches yet?

[12-Jun-19 07:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181

To others who don't need to go to sleep now ;-): if I clone StakedNotary on another vps on which I have kmd sync'd and compile komodod from there, should I resync from scratch with KMDLabs' komodod, or blocks and db are compatible?

[12-Jun-19 07:24 PM] jorian#4555
pretty sure they're compatible

[12-Jun-19 07:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
