too many anarchotechs to allow it to disappear without something filling the vaccum

[03-Jan-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The thing I'm most worried about is that most places have one or maybe 2 providers at most... Especially after the nbn shit here

[03-Jan-19 09:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wireless tech grants a sidestep. microsatelites are within affordability, and not easy to sed

[03-Jan-19 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
they'll try and control it, someone will make a sim that works outside the constraints, and it'll usurp (decentralise) control

[03-Jan-19 09:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what we really need is decentralised internet

[03-Jan-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but that would be so incredibly slow....

A $2 Million Contest Seeks a Real-World Pied Piper to Solve Big In...
As fictional geniuses in HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúSilicon Valley‚Äù seek to reinvent the Internet, Mozilla and the NSF offer $2 million in prizes to decentralize it in the real world

Hahaj yeah, the internet was decentralized once

[03-Jan-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Now we need to do it all.over again

[03-Jan-19 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

server is stuck on 
`Checking for updates and building if required...`
suggestions?

[03-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Check htop

[03-Jan-19 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The build is broke

[03-Jan-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It requires a few makes and git clean -fs

[03-Jan-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I find beat way is to build it manually first

[03-Jan-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then run start

I'd be content with a few years of BBS and dialup if it meant eventual decentratised NBN

[03-Jan-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When the government paid for it, u are not getting decentralization

[03-Jan-19 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Early days the internet here was run by one guy, he sold everyone USA IPS at the end so they could use Netflix from us.... He ended up in jail and working for nbn when he got out

[03-Jan-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
we need trustless satelites to take care of it.

[03-Jan-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe some ionosphere nikoli tesla shit

[03-Jan-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181

`make -j$(nproc)`
this needs to not be nproc

[03-Jan-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nproc-1

[03-Jan-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[03-Jan-19 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
make -j$(1 thread per x RAM)

[03-Jan-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node has 24 cores lol and 64gb ram never been an issue

[03-Jan-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kmd is taking 5.6gb to build these days

[03-Jan-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The start.sh script was designed to do like small code changes not merges of 400 changes at once... It doesn't like it

[03-Jan-19 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`seems the answer is in the relation of -j to RAM, it's a litlle higher than 2:1, so if $(nproc) = 24 then 8G isn't nearly enough`
that's what I wrote the other day when I had pool wallet issues

[03-Jan-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm using 8gb and 8/core on test cms

[03-Jan-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Works OK peak is just under 6gb ram

[03-Jan-19 09:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Has anyone managed to mine anything yet?

[03-Jan-19 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_is still building_

[03-Jan-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I haven't looked yet I'm in tow. But not home

` // However, this is only reliable if the last block was on or after
     // the Sapling activation height. Otherwise, the last anchor was the
     // empty root.`

[03-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to rush out... Left 2 nodes mining and all they said was invalid blocka

[03-Jan-19 09:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Same.

[03-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Strange... How many blocks are the chains?

[03-Jan-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
` 
     // If Sapling is active, block.hashFinalSaplingRoot must be the
     // same as the root of the Sapling tree
     if (NetworkUpgradeActive(pindex->nHeight, chainparams.GetConsensus(), Consensus::UPGRADE_SAPLING)) {
         if (block.hashFinalSaplingRoot != sapling_tree.root()) {
             return state.DoS(100,
                          error("ConnectBlock(): block's hashFinalSaplingRoot is incorrect"),

[03-Jan-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess it's alerights seed node

[03-Jan-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I cant mine, but blocks are progressing?

[03-Jan-19 09:55 AM] CrisF#3405

[03-Jan-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He said he was on latest master when he started them...

[03-Jan-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Our nodes are accepting the blocks... But it seems we r submitting invalid pow

[03-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
See if genie can find anything obvious he's the professional miner jere

[03-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I rekon there is def something wrong

[03-Jan-19 10:04 AM] CrisF#3405
So someone is mining?

[03-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It could be anything

[03-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright seed would be

[03-Jan-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I left I this k one or 2 nodes mining before I left

[03-Jan-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That was a long time ago tho

[03-Jan-19 10:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
both cleared

[03-Jan-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the seed node is mining... If genie can mine or tell us anything that help otherwise might need to wait for @Alright

[03-Jan-19 10:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
kicked off oracle spawner, seems to be working

`If genie can mine or tell us anything that help otherwise might need to wait`
what chain you want mined?

bbl, gotta walk dog to shop toget bovine lactate for tommorow's breakfast

[03-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We only have 2...

[03-Jan-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All the rest deaded

[03-Jan-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems that the latest master(which all nodes should be on, unless alright made mistake) can't mine valid blocks

[03-Jan-19 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
OK, pretend I spent the last 2 days trying to figure out why my personal pool can't have more than 1 vout on KMD and tell me what you want/need...

[03-Jan-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When u build the latest master, try to deamon mine and see of u can see the reason every block is invalid pow

[03-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to merge FSM down and it was a massive merge...

[03-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea what's changed

[03-Jan-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The seed nodes should be on this build.... But maybe they just are not

[03-Jan-19 10:12 AM] zatJUM#9924
I'm on this build but cannot start iguana

[03-Jan-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Jan-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe

[03-Jan-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There has to be some error it built for everyone else

[03-Jan-19 10:17 AM] zatJUM#9924
```Already up to date.``` Built is fine IMHO

[03-Jan-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
