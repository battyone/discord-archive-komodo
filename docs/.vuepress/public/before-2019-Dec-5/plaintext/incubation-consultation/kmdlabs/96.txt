wallet cleaner is now fool prrof (I think) and works for all wallets, no longer notary specific. And the notary R address array, which contains all ntoary node R address's in the current era, is now working for all nodes not just notaries.

[21-Nov-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is mostly irrelavent at this time .. as no code uses that array apart from the getinfo call  and the dwy_mitigation filter on the wallet, for notary nodes.

[21-Nov-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to add a new RPC that returns the notaries array for staked.json for either a given era, or the current era. But I think its nearly a day here.

[21-Nov-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
was the fix for the cross chain burns validated? if so, we should make a pull request into FSM branch. if not, what problems are left with it?

[22-Nov-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just using my fix was working nearly every time, some chains ahd issues but mostly due to stalling.

[22-Nov-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
however in the very unlikley case a notarisation is confirmed out of order, we diecided to use libscotts sledgehammer code anyway... it prints a lot of errors to stdout, but it works perfectly fine.

[22-Nov-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure about PR ... I think it needs to be merged form libscotts repo, and also uncomment out a break in one function. which was stopping KMD seeing a notarisation

[22-Nov-18 07:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
after we run the next momom stress test (which is equal to FSM before verus merge) I will create this PR for you.

[22-Nov-18 07:59 AM] jorian#4555
i'm now setting up the node (long overdue) just to confirm: staked.json in StakedNotary repo still contains the old pubkeys right?

[22-Nov-18 08:03 AM] jorian#4555
@Exile13 since no-one really responded to your logos: i have trouble reading both logos. the font seems to be too confusing. KMDLABS should be easy to access for newcomers, so maybe easy to read as well?

[22-Nov-18 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I am working on the stuff to fix that today.. but having computer troubles atm ... I can only get windows working with my screen, refresh rate is too high for linux ti handle and is all artifacts

[22-Nov-18 08:10 AM] jorian#4555
oh. i had refresh rate issues on linux too

[22-Nov-18 08:10 AM] jorian#4555
but only on higher than 60 hz

[22-Nov-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need to eitehr limit it to 60hz (but I cant open the GUI to d othat atm)

[22-Nov-18 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
had to upgrade to ubuntu 18 to fix it

[22-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or n the arch wiki I see, there is a way to force the video card into the highest power state and that fixes it ..

[22-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am on 4.19 kernel

[22-Nov-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
already... I think the 4.20 RC3 has plenty of fixes, but there is modules not yet avalible that I need..

[22-Nov-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Think for now, limit to 60hz is the go.

[22-Nov-18 08:13 AM] jorian#4555
so i now have installed komodo, supernet and nanomsg. do we need the CFEK chains after tomorrow?

[22-Nov-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, just run ./start.sh (make sure supernet was cloned in `staked` branch, it shoud be by default, if yoy started a fresh VPS.

[22-Nov-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will build any updates, and sync all chains, then start iguana... you need to wait for the new staked.json before your node can join the network though, if you changed your pubkey.

[22-Nov-18 08:15 AM] jorian#4555
yes i changed pubkey, but wanto to have everything synced for tomorrow

[22-Nov-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah, you can just sue the new one, and run start.sh

[22-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am having an issue on my notary in mastertest atm, where it wants to sync KMD from scratch even though its already synced... letting ti sync for now, then will try a restart and see what happens.

[22-Nov-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really weird issue lol... I hope its somehting on my end that got messed up

[22-Nov-18 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
any new startup param like addrindex that creeped in? that triggers a reindex

[22-Nov-18 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
also debug should point stuff out

[22-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to tbe the case ... but mastertest branch might have issues still... it had liek a hundred merge conflicts

[22-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might have screwed someting up

[22-Nov-18 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
meh

[22-Nov-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
master branch is stable though as far as I know... hasnt changed in weeks

[22-Nov-18 08:34 AM] Mylo#8306
My staked kmd isn‚Äôt getting past 814000.   Just ran start.sh - do a git pull recompile, resync from scratch and that should get me going?

[22-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
i downloaded the bootstrap

[22-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
easy

[22-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
only question is: do we trust 0x03

[22-Nov-18 08:42 AM] zatJUM#9924
@Mylo at 814300 or 814000?

[22-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ...

[22-Nov-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that fix wasnt pushed to master branch üòÖ

[22-Nov-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry guys

[22-Nov-18 08:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fixing now

[22-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
actually ... I will just push mastertest to master ... we need to test it anyway..

[22-Nov-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait no I can't until I verify this node syncing issue on my node...

[22-Nov-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian @zatJUM @Mylo  
fix for KMD not syncing pushed to master.

[22-Nov-18 08:56 AM] zatJUM#9924
I'm on master test so I could sync kmd üòâ

[22-Nov-18 08:57 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks TonyL who helped me

[22-Nov-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool... if you notice anythng werid on that branch plese report it ... although it seems fine tbh.

[22-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and likely Genie would be affected I think, he was an early staker, wouldnt want him to miss out if he wants a spot.

[22-Nov-18 09:03 AM] jorian#4555
so Sat 10am UTC?

[22-Nov-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I think so... I need a bit more time, to sort out how exactly the era will change... Finally got computer sorted out and cleaned up most of the mess in here... haha

[22-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be a bit of a late night to get this all finished ... I think the komodod needs to just spit out the staked.json rather than need to amnually edit 2 files.

[22-Nov-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt be ahrd to sort.

[22-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian yes

[22-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
working on adding pubkeys now, should be changing era sometime today

[22-Nov-18 09:10 AM] jorian#4555
i'm a bit confused though: test chain != KMDLABS chain? official one?

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
read the pins

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I guess they don't clarify

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
it is not LABS itself

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
just a test chain to determine who can be a notary

[22-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
first 20 to notarize on it get a mainnet spot for 2 months

[22-Nov-18 09:12 AM] jorian#4555
alright, that clears it up

[22-Nov-18 09:12 AM] jorian#4555
so i must be awake at 10 AM on saturday to be among the first 20 to notarize the test chain to KMD that will launch at that time

[22-Nov-18 09:15 AM] CrisF#3405
The first part is the real test.

[22-Nov-18 09:15 AM] jorian#4555
be awake at 10 am on a saturday yes üòõ

[22-Nov-18 09:15 AM] CrisF#3405
yeah, haha.

[22-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
we're going to simulate launching LABS as close as possible with it

[22-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Alright#0419
10% to multisig, simulate the params as close as possible

[22-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jorian#4555

[22-Nov-18 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
what about an official notary testnet for komodo. is kmdlabs going to be it? or should we make another testnet for all currently elected notaries?

[22-Nov-18 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
if there's interest

[22-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ca333 was meant to be orginising a kmd testnet .. this software enables it somewhat, but adding external coins with it requires large changes.

[22-Nov-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was really designed only for KMD AC's

[22-Nov-18 09:32 AM] jorian#4555
yes, and kmdlabs seems to be doing more than just be a testnet
