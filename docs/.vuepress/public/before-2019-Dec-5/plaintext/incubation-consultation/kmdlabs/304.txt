well yes... we are not using ti for any privacy stuff, as out ips are open

[21-Feb-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There might be other ways to enforce hops... but tor is by far the easiest

[21-Feb-19 09:44 AM] Alright#0419
big bad tor boogeyman

[21-Feb-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree... I use it all the time, even for just random shit... everyone needs to do that üòâ

[21-Feb-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jsut red flag every single person in entrie worlds thens ee what happens ü§£

[21-Feb-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
The only legal trouble you may have would be if you're running an exit node

[21-Feb-19 09:46 AM] Alright#0419
Do DCs/ hosting providers really give a shit about tor traffic?

[21-Feb-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine doesn't but its a tiny family owned DC adn they just want my money...

[21-Feb-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont know about larger palces ther dont seem to care about m,aking money

[21-Feb-19 09:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
I have 0 utxo for dimxy1, not notarizing

[21-Feb-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
I doubt anyone here is located in a county where tor is explicitly illegal, so I don't see "legal trouble" as a valid excuse

[21-Feb-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe its more the DC ? web said he would jsut get a dedicated VPS and would use tor, no issue, just not ont eh current server hes using.

[21-Feb-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we dont even knwo if thsi si going to work... clearly it slows things down as expected, but without all ndoes on it, we dont know if the network will slow down that mcuh it stops or what .

[21-Feb-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
is it possible to immediately detect that a notary is not using it?

[21-Feb-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
"use tor" seems it will be our "put your node in this region" rule ü§£

[21-Feb-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
unenforceable

[21-Feb-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its enforcable

[21-Feb-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just detect incomming IP and make sure tis not in the list of notary IPs

[21-Feb-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
uhhh

[21-Feb-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess they could use a VPN and do the same... but it could be detected that its not changing

[21-Feb-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like its nnot super easy to do, but it can be done. Clearly if someone doesnt sue it they will dominate totally and can just be blocked/ removed from IP list

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Somehting better would be to bounce the packets from each node 2 times before sending to the proper destination.

[21-Feb-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
inside iguana itself

[21-Feb-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure if that would be as enforcable, but it doesnt need tor, and would require reverse engneering C code to disable, and still the clear advantage will be seen.

[21-Feb-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather not change iguana if I can though.

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
is the IP different each time using tor?

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
maybe it enforce it like that if so?

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be, but I dont know if it actaully is

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
connection must not come from the previous IP

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
that kind of thing

[21-Feb-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like its not supposed to always use the same exit node

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
even if they did use a VPN for that, it would slow it down

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Id rather not ahve to touch iguana at all tbh

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its very easy

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to just say "it cannot come directly from the notary nodes IP"

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its a lot harder to do anything else

[21-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
so I just give you a bogus IP and disable tor?

[21-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thinkit would be so easy to see that someone was doing this../... that nobnody would even try... like KMD ntoaris can easiuly mine 25-30-% more KMD but nobody does it.... becaseu it would be obvious they are

[21-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
we should still try to limit the trust in the notaries where possible

[21-Feb-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem needed to enforce by code... if notaries agree to use it

[21-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
I think this is fine though

[21-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
just need to see it in action and tweak as needed

[21-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
no explorer for TH, yes?

[21-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
I think before launch i will do a new env for explorers

[21-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
and keep it how I like it üòõ

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really done know if there is an explorer or not

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
well lol

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I m,ay hgave done one... but thers been that many chains now.. i lose track of it

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
I didn't make one, you didn't make one

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
so....

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
Ah

[21-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jorian#4555
so the problem is: because nodes flock together, they get to be in almost every notarization. by using tor, traffic does not go directly. so the response time advantage the flocked together group has, will disappear. at least, that is the hypothesis

[21-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
yep

[21-Feb-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no explorer. will do now it takes 10s

[21-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Alright#0419
maybe we should cut a deal with a DC and put every node in it :troll:

[21-Feb-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you could put every node on the same server ü§£

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but what happens if it goes down

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jorian#4555
can't we find a solution that just disables the response time advantage? say take a fixed 1s to wait for every node to participate and then do a stochastic random process or whatever to spread out the participating nodes evenly?

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jorian#4555
i know a DC :troll:

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
joker is the only one that will be able to make changes to iguana it seems

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jorian  we can but then anyone can just change the code to not have the sleep/wait

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
and he's adamant about not touching it

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
which I agree with

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
if it works, don't touch it

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jorian#4555
fair enough, enough bugs have appeared with jok3r touching it :troll:

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
it is secure now, may not be if we make drastic changes

[21-Feb-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana is extremly touchy and a mess, if we can not touch it we shouldnt it could turn into a gian clusterfuck very quicly

[21-Feb-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
tor it is

[21-Feb-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like we could try to do that, but it would be amnther 50 testnets and months fo debugging

[21-Feb-19 10:11 AM] Alright#0419
we can't get decent data until @SHossain @Nabob @TonyL @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ 
update

[21-Feb-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah tor may not even work üòÇ

[21-Feb-19 10:12 AM] jorian#4555
we should run 2 notary networks: notary slow update and notary fast update

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
normally these guys are on to it...

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm in airport waiting boarding atm

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to start update now

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your fine man. We can wait

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üëç

[21-Feb-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks man

[21-Feb-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
Yea, sorry üòÖ I'm antsy

[21-Feb-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was really a lot easier than I thaught it would be to set up. takes a few mins

[21-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
ping when that explorer is up, will use it to find the block at which you told notaries to update

[21-Feb-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok.

[21-Feb-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems I started it

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Feb-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nearlty done... stupid linker issues. üò°

[21-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
An rpc to fetch which block era changed at would be useful for stats things @blackjok3r

[21-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
but uhhh

[21-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
don't focus on that üòÇ  it can wait

[21-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
thanks Tony

[21-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you can work that out even easier... the only way I can think of it to just have it write ta  file when the era changes

[21-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
how could I work it out with existing rpc commands?

[21-Feb-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a block time stamp, the first block with a timstamp over the era timestamp is the change over

[21-Feb-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a gap

[21-Feb-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is larger than the blockfrom future constraint to make sure miners done mine blocks with random timestamps switching it back a fourth

[21-Feb-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I gues it can look blopck index for this ü§î  that would be mcuh faster than using getblock

[21-Feb-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can probably do this in a while... beating my head againsta a wall with this thing james aked me to look at üò¶

[21-Feb-19 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
pinging me repeatedly while I'm asleep is as useless as the tits on a boar hog

[21-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ sorry

[21-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ could you update though please

[21-Feb-19 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
as soon as I get ‚òï and wake up

[21-Feb-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ thanks
