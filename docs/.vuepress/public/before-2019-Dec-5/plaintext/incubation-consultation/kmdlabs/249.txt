The default situation for any bitcoin clone is that it will always try to keep the 8 best outgoing connections, and drop any that score low to keep latency down.
However, it will accept as many incoming connections as other are willing to keep - due to the fact that we know that not everyone will be nice enough to open their ports for inbound.
If the default condition was 8 max full stop the network would fail.

I'm too lazy to exlpain ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Lol - humour me - check your firewall.

[26-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant `git pull` and `./start.sh` on your notary please

[26-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
just added PAYME, which is simulating the chain we will use for notary payouts

`check your firewall.`

Ah you'll need to wait until sapling activates before you can split utxos

[26-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
jumped the gun on that, you can just wait

[26-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
no worries if you do it now, but can wait like ~hour

[26-Jan-19 03:04 PM] CrisF#3405
My previous start will have hopefully finished starting by then :abusedsmily:

[26-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r you around? I'm getting `failed slow_checkPOW` on my staking node for PAYME

[26-Jan-19 03:05 PM] CrisF#3405
I was getting that all morning.

[26-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Alright#0419
any fix?

[26-Jan-19 03:06 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm still in the process.

[26-Jan-19 03:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Not sure what was going on.

[26-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant sorry for the ping, please just wait until I get this chain stable. Didn't realize my staking node had problems

[26-Jan-19 03:08 PM] CrisF#3405
My resync was to help with that.  I just ran out of space for the bootstrap and didn't learn about scp till recently.

[26-Jan-19 03:39 PM] gt#2812
started the chain but stopped it

[26-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
yea please don't start it

[26-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
complications

[26-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
a few of them

[26-Jan-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
so when we actually start this chain, we will burn some LABS on main chain, put params in the OP_RETURN. Already figured out how to do this with oraclesdata. We have a problem in that using ac_script will make the premine go to ac_script address. We need to start the chain, mine 2 blocks, then pass around a tx to fund notaries to signers

[26-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Alright#0419
broadcast that transaction, stake the rest not sent to notaries

[26-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Alright#0419
need to work with joker on this as some of his latest commits seem to have unintended consequences, looking at them I have no idea why

[26-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r latest commits seem to break ac_script ac_founders_reward, premine doesn't go to ac_script as it should

[26-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
getblocksubsidy shows 0 for all blocks, even the ac_founders blocks

[26-Jan-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
founders rewards are not part of block subsidy

[26-Jan-19 05:47 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm still stuck on `"blocks": 1199524,` 
@blackjok3r is resync from scratch helped you?

`./komodo/master/komodo-cli getblockhash 1199424`
then
`./komodo/master/komodo-cli reconsiderblock the_result_of_above_here`
should fix that

It syncing megaslow. Around 1-2 blocks / second

[26-Jan-19 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe stop then start now that you have that bit fixed?

[26-Jan-19 06:22 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm almost synced, just hope that if somebody will sync from scratch it'll be not so slow

[26-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
komodo is a slow sync - can't be helped.
Thats why we need an open komodo that can be polled from external for stuff like cross-chain migrates, then komodo chain is not needed.

[26-Jan-19 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A full node without the chain .... great idea

[26-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
more like a modified explorer, the rest can be done with the smaller LABS chains as full nodes

[26-Jan-19 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't even begin to imagine the insane complexity of code that would be required to turn micro chains within the LABS ecosystem into data storage for the Komodo chain itself (as opposed to using the Komodo chain itself), or why dafuq you would even want to

[26-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Are we at cross purposes here??

[26-Jan-19 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_adds a link to point to articles about the purpose of full nodes on his firewall_

[26-Jan-19 06:37 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - I meant if someone is using LABS with their new chain to test CC's etc and other stuff they want to do - then their interaction with the actual KMD chain is minimal
Like a staked node running CFEK, CFEKX and CFEKY - what do they need KMD for?

[26-Jan-19 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*they* don't; *we* __NN__s do-ish

[26-Jan-19 06:37 PM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel we will figure out how to setup a node that anyone can do migrate_complete... on

[26-Jan-19 06:37 PM] Alright#0419
that's the only thing KMD is needed for

[26-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Alright#0419
but a full node must do it

[26-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
``Thats why we need an open komodo that can be polled from external for stuff like cross-chain migrates, then komodo chain is not needed``

[26-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
thats what I thought

[26-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
yep, will focus on it after launch

[26-Jan-19 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Thats why we need an open komodo that can be polled from external for stuff like cross-chain migrates, then komodo chain is not needed`

[26-Jan-19 06:42 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I get it - you thought I meant NN didn't need KMD - of course they do - but the average LABS user might not.

@TonyL if you syncing with private key imported on notary mode its very very clow took me 18h or so

With out key imported is much faster

[27-Jan-19 12:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I'm also having the same.
@blackjok3r you mentioned just scanning back 20,000 with `z_importkey`.  I tried, but NN wif won't work.  It needs a z_key it seems.  Is there another way?

[27-Jan-19 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
import the key with false

[27-Jan-19 12:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then use zimport key with any random z address

[27-Jan-19 12:35 AM] CrisF#3405

@Alright ac_foundsers_reward DOES NOT send the premine to the ac_script address... I did it like that on purpose.. otherwise you need to make a multisig transaction to create the chain, and well fuck that. Trying to fix verushash staker being broken now. I think I kjnow what it is. Its broken when I made stratum +c staking work at same time... isStake boolean is not bein set properly for some reason.

Cool 🐛 , what is it?

[27-Jan-19 02:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢,
When you said ```I, also, will be running for KMD NN election this year (fwiw).``` in the github KMDLabs Proposal did you mean independently, or as a LABS candidate?
If the latter I'll add your name to the LABS candidates.

{Reactions}
👏 

[27-Jan-19 02:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wasn't aware there was going to be a "LABS team" for NNs, so both I guess :troll:

[27-Jan-19 02:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
jokes aside, independently for KMD NN

{Reactions}
👍 

[27-Jan-19 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There isnt as such, we just pledghe some % of the mined KMD to LABS project. Ther more of us that dso it the less we each will have to put up. 😉

[27-Jan-19 02:46 AM] CrisF#3405
OK, thanks.
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 By LABS candidate I was refering to ```1 KMD notary node at least to pay for KMD notarisations cost. More than one, each with a single operator is better.

blackjok3r, Alright, smk762 have all commited to running for KMD notary election.```

[27-Jan-19 02:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Would `pledge a portion of possible, future KMD NN earnings` be a correct way of describing this?

[27-Jan-19 02:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Rather than candidate?

[27-Jan-19 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think Alight first said 50% but that is a bit much...

[27-Jan-19 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should not need that much

[27-Jan-19 02:51 AM] CrisF#3405
Would it be better to leave it up to the individual KMD NN candidates to decide what best suits their election platforms?

[27-Jan-19 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Jan-19 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We would all have diffrent server costs etc... IMO it would be stupid to amke it some exact amount required

[27-Jan-19 02:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pls let me know when `./start.sh` will work nicely, got nowhere last night with LABST or PAYME, and low on time to debug.

To alleviate confusion:
\* I plan on running for being a LABS notary as long as LABS will have me.
\* I plan on running for being a KMD notary as long as KMD will have me.
\* Experience thus far with the former gave me the confidence to believe I can do the latter.
 I'm not sure where the `and pledging a portion of possible, future KMD NN earnings` part came in

[27-Jan-19 03:37 AM] CrisF#3405
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Confusion came from seeing it on the Labs proposal.  Got it now, thanks 👍

[27-Jan-19 03:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess that `to pay for KMD notarisations cost` and `pledging a portion of possible, future KMD NN earnings` read and mean entirely different things to me

[27-Jan-19 03:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm down with using my KMD NN funds (or my own should I not get elected) to cover my own LABS NN costs (or that's how I read it to mean in the proposal)

[27-Jan-19 03:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, yeah, I'm not quite sure on if funds donated/pledged would be only used for notarizations or what else they would be used for.  Maybe @Alright and @blackjok3r could clarify?
