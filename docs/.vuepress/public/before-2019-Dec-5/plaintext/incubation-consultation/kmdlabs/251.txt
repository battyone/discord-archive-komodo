I get the feeling that I have that wrong though.

[27-Jan-19 05:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha :abusedsmily:

[27-Jan-19 05:21 AM] CrisF#3405
So not really sure what to write.

[27-Jan-19 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah ned to check with alright on that..I think it was that the bounty coins are just created from thin air, and that nobody ever had to pay for them.... Still not wquite sure hwo that works, so I made it cost some amount to create a chain at least.

(Not sure what I'm doing, but doing it anyways)
This is what I have written for CFEK.
```CFEK
Purpose -  To prevent possible damage to main cluster from a grossly malformed CC contract and to determine whether larger scale, thorough testing is warranted.


What it is - Chains designed to be broken. Used for very basic CC testing before creating a LABS chain for larger scale, focused testing.  This is the place to work out any bugs that could cause damage to the LABS cluster.  Not for large or critical testing. ```

[27-Jan-19 06:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Used in this manner bounties may not be required.  Possibly a small fee to have a basic check done on the CC/project.

[27-Jan-19 06:49 AM] CrisF#3405
(possibly smk762's suggestion?)``` 200 LABS (Initiates)```

[27-Jan-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
something like that sounds fine.

I like the idea of dev fund having an allocation to bounties which welcome new users to compete/collaborate with dev

[27-Jan-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bounty fund is just extra coins trhat exist... but cannot be spent until they are claimed by a bounty claim.

[27-Jan-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This makes bounties not cost anyone anything... Which was the idea from the beginning.

[27-Jan-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Chains will still need a creation cost becasue notaries need to host them...  and that isnt free.

@blackjok3r - start scripts can't get past LABST start? is there an issue at the mo?

[27-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no when I reinstalled my notary earlier... it was all working

[27-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
mine are hanging at verifying address

[27-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe the komdod.pid file is still there?

[27-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That means it didnt start

[27-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
usually... although there should have been a check for that and exit... I think I removed it because it wasnt working

[27-Jan-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Main issue seems to be getting it to build the first time... Latest master will build from fresh clone.

[27-Jan-19 10:34 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Mine are all built OK (used make clean and build) - just can't get a clean restart.

[27-Jan-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mmm... try starting the chains manually un a diff terminal... use `listassetchainparams.py` to print them out

cool - thats better

[27-Jan-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please let me know if that happens again. I know what could be causing it and have seen it before. I think that once you reindex or rtesync it should enver happen again though.

[27-Jan-19 11:03 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Is it strange that all three of my nodes (inc one NN) were all stopped and started at the same time and all needed reindex?

[27-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no...

[27-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a change4 to the code. some of it is meant to be disabled ... but I have a feeling its not in palces... I will be debugging that in the next few days.

[27-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant ok this time is real üòÖ please `git pull` then `./start.sh`

[27-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
if you tried it last time I pinged, you will need to do `rm -r ~/.komodo/PAYME` first

Without removing the actual blocks from the .blk files, it thinks they exist on load and tried to fiunmd them in the index but they dont exist.
