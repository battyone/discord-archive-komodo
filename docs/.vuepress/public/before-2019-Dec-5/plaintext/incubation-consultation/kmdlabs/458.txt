I think you need to oraclesfund now... Because CC utxo only validate when spent.. So oracles needed to spend oracle CC utxo to fund or something. 
I did make a PoC with the lottoCC that does let ccutxos be validated without being spent... But it requires using multiple CC utxos in the tx, so it spends one to make one.

[02-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
@Ondalf does the node have a balance?

[02-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
Guess it should check for that

[02-Aug-19 01:33 PM] Ondalf#1318
ah, so better fill up something i guess

[02-Aug-19 04:08 PM] Ondalf#1318
Now LABS has balance. Is that enough?

[02-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Ondalf#1318
Oh, didn't run the script. Duh... Better do first and ask then

[02-Aug-19 05:40 PM] Exile13#4458
i sent 10 LABS to the NN upon launch and its still over half

[02-Aug-19 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_sent 1 and let it earn the rest_

[02-Aug-19 06:06 PM] Ondalf#1318
yup. i think the python script errors out due passed deadline. anyhow, LABS is now seeded with few coins 😃

[02-Aug-19 07:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
idk what is going on now...

[02-Aug-19 07:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
went from avg 40-60 notarisations a day... to nearly 100 per day last few days... to 1 last 24 hours

guess i missed some giy updates...  making now

[02-Aug-19 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can try.. the latest is a bit diffrent

[02-Aug-19 07:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
we shall see

[02-Aug-19 07:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
the StakedNotary git pull was up to date

[02-Aug-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its an iguana chnage

[02-Aug-19 07:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
but just komodo had a ton of changes so guess the script is not working on mine right now

[02-Aug-19 07:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i should also rerun the iguana install script?

[02-Aug-19 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if ou were not on the last update that makes sensu had so many 😅

[02-Aug-19 07:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
i thought i was...

[02-Aug-19 07:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
that post you made i had the same bits as most of the others listed so thought i was good

[02-Aug-19 07:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm no... you will reach consensus with the changes

[02-Aug-19 07:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it works slower

[02-Aug-19 07:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
k

[02-Aug-19 07:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was imprtant to see what hapens of some ppl didnt update tho so np

[02-Aug-19 07:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
then i should tell you

[02-Aug-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
I woke to it this morning being over 13 hours since last

[02-Aug-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
I killed it and restarted...

[02-Aug-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
and nada so I wallet reset KMD and LABS

[02-Aug-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
killed and restarted and it instantly got 1 notarisation

[02-Aug-19 07:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
now none for four more hours

[02-Aug-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`went from avg 40-60 notarisations a day... to nearly 100 per day last few days... to 1 last 24 hours`
by the time you average "the last few days" in, does it move you *significantly* off average over long range?

[02-Aug-19 07:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
technically... using just last few weeks as avg... no 2 days of 100 plus this now would avg out... but I also started LABS getting 100 a day or more till most of you migrated to the EU hosts

[02-Aug-19 07:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
so really thats mute

[02-Aug-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't changed servers in months_

[02-Aug-19 08:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
k back up and running... will see what happens

[03-Aug-19 12:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
FINALLY GOT A COUPLE

[03-Aug-19 12:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
seems really slow now

[03-Aug-19 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its supposed to be.... If everyone is using same it should be ok,, but maybe its not

[03-Aug-19 12:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
looks like it kiked in now

[03-Aug-19 12:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
4 in last 100

[03-Aug-19 12:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the version you have is better that most of us are using. I guess if its working for you, we should get everyone to update again and confirm when they have, need to keep track of it this time.

[03-Aug-19 12:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
k

[03-Aug-19 12:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
going to have to fix my staked scripts figure out why it thought it was up to date lol

[03-Aug-19 12:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
i did a clean git pull several weeks ago and started from scratch so its weird that skipped the pull and make

[03-Aug-19 01:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi guys,
Do you think we could test out the multi-sig over the next little while.  I could use a bit of exp with it.  Preferably before we start receiving funding.
@blackjok3r @Alright @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[03-Aug-19 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
yea we have enough keys now I believe, will create it and send some KMD to it later today

[03-Aug-19 07:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
@blackjok3r Just updated here

[03-Aug-19 07:33 AM] Mylo#8306
@Alright @blackjok3r 
i need to get some info for creating a 2k tps cluster running on LABS to demonstrate the capability.
It's not "urgent immediately", but i'd like to start getting info together in the coming week for the marketing team including the costs for running it on LABS, setup + costs.

[03-Aug-19 07:35 AM] Mylo#8306
i think that is a 5 chain cluster.   if it's easier as a 3 chain cluster, i'm happy to have 1k tps.

[03-Aug-19 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
8192*2 tx per block.

[03-Aug-19 07:36 AM] Mylo#8306
right, and we can have quicker block times too?

[03-Aug-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Momm script can do 5000 crossxhain tx at once at last test.

[03-Aug-19 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes we can decrease block time... May be able to get that rate out of 1 chain, but that's flat out cheating.

[03-Aug-19 07:37 AM] Mylo#8306
didn't realize there were rules to cheat :troll:

[03-Aug-19 07:40 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - regardless, need to be showing the capabilities.
we'll stick to 1min blocktime with 3 chain cluster.  on success.

because the LABS notaries will fill up harddrives, it doesn't have to be  stored, however, if we can work out a way to reset the chain every 2 weeks, say on a saturday and restart it on a monday, that would be cool - automated of course.

[03-Aug-19 07:41 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe the restarts every fortnight could be blocktime experiments.   happy to test this stuff out.

[03-Aug-19 02:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok why is this so bad now???

kinda ridiculous to only get a dozen a day while others are approaching 100 a day

[03-Aug-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some of those "others" were previously *over* 100 a day, so you have to keep that in mind as well as the fact that one day (or even 2 or 3) is too small to look at

[03-Aug-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
On my KMDLabs NN, Komodo daemon stopped 2 times today, I don't know why, I relaunch it. If it stops again, I'll check logs and paste it here

[03-Aug-19 08:54 PM] daemonfox#6136

slight difference between the latest commit `e3ae855...` and the one prior to that `448d847...` <https://github.com/KMDLabs/SuperNET/commit/e3ae8559edaa82d8c9cd9aaca78b9ee55d48df38> not sure how it could affect iguana behaviour

[03-Aug-19 09:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
