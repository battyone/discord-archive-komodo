Is CFEKMYLO suppose to be paying anything for notary blocks or is it 0 reward?

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no it does not pay

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its just a test chain

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah no worries there

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
just making sure its doing what it needs to

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
normal PoW equihash, I am minig it with 4 cores on my notary not sure if anyone else is mining

[22-Aug-19 03:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol...

[22-Aug-19 03:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
well then

[22-Aug-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
minig 100% of blocks on notary isnt hurting my counts btw 游땔

[22-Aug-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Well there are 4 more 2700X threads in the mix now

[22-Aug-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Hope that helps

[22-Aug-19 03:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
already got blocks

[22-Aug-19 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. Yeah might help having both miners on opposite sides of the earth

[22-Aug-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
utxo cache is still broken. I think Im going to change how it works all together.

[22-Aug-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
finally got a spent from my own node

[22-Aug-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_never added miner after block 200 because he got sidetracked 游땭_

[22-Aug-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
miner location should not make any diffrence

[22-Aug-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think making the utxo cache costantly update on another thread may be the go...

[22-Aug-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea how its doing what its doing... maybe its adding utxo twice or something...

[22-Aug-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or not removing one some how...

[22-Aug-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Weird... the utxo my node submitted is like 1700 confirms spent lol... something is very wrong

[22-Aug-19 03:22 PM] daemonfox#6136

[22-Aug-19 03:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh i see haha... we 3K blocks deep, all ben paying in .0001 CFEKMYLO but got 0 noraizations in 3K blocks

[22-Aug-19 03:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
are those dust TXes just burning up?

[22-Aug-19 03:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
Where is it going?

[22-Aug-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should not be going anywhere

[22-Aug-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only way to spend them is to spend them

[22-Aug-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless there is a bug

[22-Aug-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
do a listtransactions

[22-Aug-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and see where they are being sent?

[22-Aug-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you're not mining with your nn, are you?

[22-Aug-19 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
i am now

[22-Aug-19 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
but before i started it was already spending and counting notarizations ive made

[22-Aug-19 03:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
one sec

[22-Aug-19 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
LOL why cant i paste here?!?!

[22-Aug-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what... you have made notarizations

[22-Aug-19 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
https://oracle.earth/ntx_test_cfekmylo/
This counts 45

[22-Aug-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
48 now

that script doesn't work for most chains

[22-Aug-19 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@daemonfox  that script counts notary pay

[22-Aug-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because you are not being paid to notaize this chain it will be 0

[22-Aug-19 03:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
OHHHH lol

[22-Aug-19 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
hahahaha funny

[22-Aug-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will accept PR for a script that uses getNotarisationsFromBlock RPC instead. 
Like the oracle.earth uses, https://github.com/smk762/DragonhoundTools/blob/master/vis/block_ntx.py

`>>>>> [jorian] Banned last checkpoint ht.3202 vs lastbanheight.3205`
:shexy:

[22-Aug-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you should not have that

[22-Aug-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I removed it yesterday

[22-Aug-19 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I forgot about it from the AWS testnet

[22-Aug-19 05:08 PM] jorian#4555
oops

[22-Aug-19 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the validation and ban is active, but its not supposed to be bannong node 5

[22-Aug-19 05:08 PM] jorian#4555
am i doing this right? been out of this way too long

[22-Aug-19 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing wrong.. I posted a commit last night that removed the ban on node 5

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
node 5 is who?

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
oh

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I willping everyone to update soon when I fix utxo cache

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then they wil unban you

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] phm87#7395
On aws maybe it was an anonymous nn

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
oh right, okay

[22-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
yes i was on holiday, i probably messed stuff up

[22-Aug-19 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was just node 5, I set it as a flat ban, because I couldnt be bothered to work out how to make n incorrect sig

That could be causing issues tbh... because thats consensus code

[22-Aug-19 05:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
might be why a round is failing to work occasionaly

[22-Aug-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it also unbans, but will update anyway

[22-Aug-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it unbans after 1 nmotarization

[22-Aug-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but then as soon as he tries to notarize again it will ban him for 1 round 游땍

[22-Aug-19 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
lol

[22-Aug-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont want to ping ppl to update 2 times in a few hours so just need to wait

[22-Aug-19 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
too late to wait now 游땥

[22-Aug-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is 3-4 nodes that do not ban him already

[22-Aug-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely split the network.. but its just testnet np

[22-Aug-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`there is 3-4 nodes that do not ban him already`
Are those the ones that aren't even running yet? :troll_lol:

_goes back to "wasting harddrive space" and finishes working on his AC miner_

[22-Aug-19 05:25 PM] Alright#0419
man I'll just give you the 0.01 WLC you'll mine

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
0.0001 x 10,000 blocks is 1 DEX == 30KMD on atomicdex

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I willl launch him a chan to mine a bit later. 
10s block time, equihash with block reward fo 1 sat

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
i'd waste harddrive space for that

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
except if its genies notary key

[22-Aug-19 05:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then its 1 coin

[22-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
you'll mine 1 DEX in significantly less than 10000 blocks 游땔

[22-Aug-19 05:52 PM] phm87#7395
Would you add adaptativepow on a testchain and try to notarize it ? I don't remember that it was notarized

[22-Aug-19 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes we will. I tried to add ZAWY24 to the AWS testnet but I had problems syncing 50+ nodes from just 1

[22-Aug-19 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`man I'll just give you the 0.01 WLC you'll mine`
and the other 59.99 will come from where?

[22-Aug-19 06:02 PM] ph03nix#3115
from the future

[22-Aug-19 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
once upon a time, some folks thought it was a waste of HD space to CPU mine 50 BTC a year, too
#JustSayin'

[22-Aug-19 06:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok you can mine a block for more coins but it has to be filled with tx.... the more tx there are the larger the coinbase. and you still get the fees

[22-Aug-19 06:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how much HDDs you got?

[22-Aug-19 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
my mining drive is 12 TB
divided by 28 chains.....
in the year 4896 it will be full
