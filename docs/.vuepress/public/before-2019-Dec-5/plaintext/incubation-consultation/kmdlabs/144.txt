we had this issue before

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These are the things we need to test ...

[05-Dec-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least we know what it is *I hope*

[05-Dec-18 06:50 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Cool - just a heads up though - I can't peg 4 cores for an extended period, 2 is OK - but noise levels in the lounge get a bit excessive üòâ

[05-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try to add a micro sleep to the staking loop üòÑ

[05-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might be enough

[05-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am still staking all chains.. so if you like you can turn it off for now

[05-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just seemed wierd - point in case - BTCH I have running under "setgenerate true 1" and it doesn't peg a single core

while I invetigat these migrates

[05-Dec-18 06:53 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Anyhow - time for the commute.
I'll check in through the day - and now I have set up the port forwarding for this VPS I can run through phone SSH for bits and pieces

[05-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all the fails you posted before are the same error

[05-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
time to start hunting thoough sorce code changes

[05-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for the time being, maybe stop staking and migtrating as its just going to fork chains

[05-Dec-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you cant no problem..

[05-Dec-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we should probvably start new ones anyway üòÇ

`CC Eval EVAL_IMPORTCOIN Invalid: invalid-code, dont forget to add EVAL_NEWCC to Eval::Dispatch spending tx bc577596ae240904b6b87b24569571cf10491632049027516f0f5cb5887d8748`
All imports are failing on sapling merge with this error ... dont really understand what could be causing it.

[05-Dec-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do you think maybe that the exporttx must be made on a sapling activated node ?

[05-Dec-18 08:23 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
It could make sense.

[05-Dec-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Getting close to just hard forking the whole network again to fix this... Starting to relaly pisse me off

[05-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
I'm doing the stats scripts now. I have notarization counts working. What else do we need

[05-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice @gt Cris mentioned you guys wanted to work on logging scripts

[05-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
what is it you want logged?

[05-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
that error indicates the CC vout is not being properly recognized. we are seeing some strange behavior with sapling activated chains.

[05-Dec-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This does not have spling enabled

[05-Dec-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but FSM has been merged in

[05-Dec-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have propagated it to master

[05-Dec-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To stop the notary nodes hard forking evey time someonde does  amigrate

[05-Dec-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have no choice at this stage

[05-Dec-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Mandatory update for komodo. 
I suggest unless you know what your doing to do the follwoing:
cd ~
cd StakedNotary
./stop.sh
cd ~
rm -rf komodo
cd StakedNotary/install
./buildkomodo.sh

[05-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
cd ~/StakedNotary ***

[05-Dec-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you knw what your doing, you cna use;
``` git clean -f
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j4
git clean -f
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j4```

[05-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
remove `~/StakedNotary/komodo`, no?

[05-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
not ~/komodo

[05-Dec-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo is in the home folder üòï

[05-Dec-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need a fresh clone or it gets bulk build errors

[05-Dec-18 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and telling noobs how to fix it wont be fun

[05-Dec-18 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
```~/StakedNotary/stop.sh
rm -rf ~/komodo
~/StakedNotary/install/buildkomodo.sh```

üòÉ Troll wars

[05-Dec-18 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah nevermind, these scripts needed to be in folder with it

[05-Dec-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this sint going to go well .. but right now the whole neteork is in a fork war and chains are straight up crahsing

[05-Dec-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Somehting that should not hard fork anythig has ...

[05-Dec-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no idea why... so we will just merge FSM in and try to help you guys debug it

[05-Dec-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont even know if this will fix the problem either...

[05-Dec-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
half of these chains might be ireversably broken./

[05-Dec-18 11:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Should I do the ./stop.sh, rm -rf komodo, build now then?

[05-Dec-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... the whole netowrk is fragmented

[05-Dec-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was trying to do the right thing and test the sapling merge on my own one hting at at time

[05-Dec-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but when bar fish tried to do migreates and I was stking on noStreamer branch it was rejecting all import TXs

[05-Dec-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
causing a fork war to happen between my node everyone elses

[05-Dec-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can even mine a block on LF atm becaus eit reorgs 150 blocks isntantly after doing so

[05-Dec-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopeing after everyone updates the mempool will expire and hte txs causing this will disapear and hte chain will resume

[05-Dec-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not we kill 102 cluster totally and start new ones with a premine and distribute coins to testers to use

[05-Dec-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¢

[05-Dec-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant test migrates becuase notarisations on some chains are no longer happening.

[05-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jorian#4555
updating now

[05-Dec-18 11:19 AM] CrisF#3405
If the chains are damaged beyond repair, can we restore them form the last notarization to KMD?

[05-Dec-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure ... the problem is is tha thte longest chain is not the notarised chain

[05-Dec-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it just flat crahses the node

[05-Dec-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as its trying to reorg hundreds of blocks

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a consensus problem

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] jorian#4555
does that mean the kmdlabs notaries didn't update fast enough?

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because of the migrates not working on some software and wiorking on toheres

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dint tall them to update

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as I wanted to test everythig was working first

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was otally unexpected ... sapling isnt even active yet .. the deamons should be exactly the same

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but something else in the Verus Merge has caused a hard forking change to import txs

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
ah

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] jorian#4555
well, shit happens

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I guess its best to just get this over an done with now

[05-Dec-18 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
opefully we cna find the issue and get it fixed before the 15th

[05-Dec-18 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are ppl working on the issues with CCs ... but they are testing with sapling active ... I have no issue juts nt launching hte main net until sapling is active... IF that date is the 15th exactly. ..but from testing the pool. it looks liek it doesnt acutally activate until FEB 2019

[05-Dec-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It could even be a merge conflict ... something I have done ... but until all nodes are on this cversion now we cant test anything.

[05-Dec-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling activates dec 15th, sprout is made illegal after feb 15th

[05-Dec-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_ACTIVATION 1544832000 // Dec 15th, 2018
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_DEADLINE 1550188800 // Feb 15th, 2019

[05-Dec-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ok cool.

[05-Dec-18 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So what it does is wait until that timestamp and then choose a block height +X and set that as hte height ?

[05-Dec-18 11:27 AM] CMaurice#1685
coincidentally just started a build of StakedChain/komodo a few mins ago, will update notary now

[05-Dec-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just I noticed that when testing hte pool.. it dint activate at the exact time stamp I set it to .. .sometimes up to 10-15mins later (I had the second timestamp set at that)

[05-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r not exactly... it is a bit more complex to get consensus safe values for activation height, the code is in komodo_activate_sapling() in main.cpp

[05-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
for the deadline, i just check the timestamp of chaintip to see if it is legal or not

[05-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if we end up with some out of order timestamps near the deadline it isnt any big issue to have sprout illegal, then legal, then illegal again

[05-Dec-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool.. yes I guess your dealing with block heights for this... its not like notarisaions where just having a gap is enough, as they are not exactly a consensuse change/

[05-Dec-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling activation MUST be the identical height for all nodes, during the transition, during resync, etc. and it can only be done once

[05-Dec-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why most activations have a hard coded height

[05-Dec-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but with the zillion chains, i was too lazy to make different heights in a table to handle all chains, plus if we had any large cluster, it would be totally impractical

[05-Dec-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
not that doing it for dozens of chains is practical and not error prone as it is

[05-Dec-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah that sounds like abad way to do it.

[05-Dec-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
therefore -> komodo_activate_sapling()

[05-Dec-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
took a few iterations to get it performant and accurate

[05-Dec-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as all nodes in a chain choose the same height then its fine. 
I am a bit confused as to why migrates broke BEFORE saplingactivated though ... I hope I can track this down... its not sapling related as it hasnt even chosen its height yet.

[05-Dec-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the changes libscott made didnt merge into the branch correctly or something ... it could be anything... I see a few busy days here trying to fix it ... but right now there are not notarisations happening so I cant test anything.

[05-Dec-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be one of the 500+ files that were changed inadvertently broke migrate

[05-Dec-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As long as we can get some chains with notarisaions happening again in the next 12-24H i willl be able to fix it

[05-Dec-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Even if we add some chains to LAMEDUCKS

[05-Dec-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and remove CFEK 102 chains.

Its extremly important that anyone staking/mining update also
