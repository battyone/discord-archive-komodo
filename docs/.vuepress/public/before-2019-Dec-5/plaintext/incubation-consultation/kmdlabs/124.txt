[24-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as a notary

[24-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it prints a print

[24-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with your R adresss

[24-Nov-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that activates protection

[24-Nov-18 03:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181

`genie@genies_notary:~/StakedNotary$ ./asset-cli CFEKLAMEDUCKS setgenerate false` ‚òπ

[24-Nov-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
basically the rules are:
you cant receive a tx from an address that isnt -pubkey
you cant reveive a tx athat is an average of less than one coin

[24-Nov-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are options to define that too

[24-Nov-18 03:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
value =0 is what we should use

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you and your feken rules üò°

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can only receive tx from yourself

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then the notary can never be attacked by @Deleted User

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000

`so you can only receive tx from yourself` the definition of staking üòï

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I need to use that to get sure I only allow 4 other notaries to run

[24-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
:trollface:

[24-Nov-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staking might work because notary uses -pubkey

[24-Nov-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mining pow does

[24-Nov-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it fills the wallet iwth dust tx fees

[24-Nov-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then brakes it

[24-Nov-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I made a rule that coinbase with nVlaue == 0 are not added to any wallet

[24-Nov-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if yiou mine  a block wiht a tx fee

[24-Nov-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it adds

[24-Nov-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

Anyone who uses tmux on their VPS, add this 
```
# creates the tmux session called ssh_tmux if none exists or reattaches to a already existing session with that name.
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" != "" ]; then
    tmux attach-session -t ssh_tmux || tmux new-session -s ssh_tmux
fi
```
to the end of your `.bashrc` so you won't have to attach and detach everytime you connect/disconnect. Helpful when abrupt network disconnections happen too. Keep in mind it can't save your session iin case of a system-restart of your VPS
