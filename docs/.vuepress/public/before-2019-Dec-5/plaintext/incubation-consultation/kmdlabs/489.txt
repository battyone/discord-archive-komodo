get on the right side of the world and we'll be able to talk more often 😛

@CrisF 
`I'm keen to help out wherever I can.  Will keep a closer eye on it.`

Thanks! Can never have too much support from other devs. I’ve got some other exciting stuff that will probably start getting detailed publicly a bit in two weeks or so too :). But sequential and not simultaneous is important haha. Luckily I’ve got some advisement from a good friend and colleague on the non-tech side of things

[20-Oct-19 04:09 AM] Biz#0842
Doesn’t take a village, but definitely helps to have  one

`Doesn’t take a village, but definitely helps to have  one` 
Haha, too true 🙂

[20-Oct-19 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is CFEKMYLO6 totally borked or is it just my server?

[20-Oct-19 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
stdout and debug look "normal" aside from the block notify error due to iguana not running
but it completely hangs

[20-Oct-19 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
screen even dies after a while
```$ screen -r 1661.CFEKMYLO6
[screen is terminating]
$ screen -r 1661.CFEKMYLO6
There is no screen to be resumed matching 1661.CFEKMYLO6.```

_removes it from json and goes back to bed_

[20-Oct-19 05:38 AM] CrisF#3405
mine seems to have died also.  Will see how re-start goes.

[20-Oct-19 05:44 AM] CrisF#3405
`./stop.sh` and `-ac_name=CFEKMYLO6 stop` aren't killing it either.

[20-Oct-19 05:45 AM] CrisF#3405
`pkill -15 komodod` did the trick.

[20-Oct-19 05:50 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well thanks to nim nob willing to take 30% losses on pirate just to make sure I can't get 30% more I really am amazed at the intellect of doing harm rather than actually making money.  Its takes quite a useless moron to inflict pain on others. But ask my doctor he did it for nearly 3 years.  And maybe hes no longer practicing.

[20-Oct-19 06:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @kevinkatovic,
You are in the wrong channel and/or Discord server (try the PIRATE Discord) and I'm having trouble following what you are talking about.
Please take this up with him in another forum.

[20-Oct-19 06:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Haven't been able to get `MYLO6` up with `./start.sh`

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 whats your mining pool link for LABS again? Considering adding some hash

[20-Oct-19 07:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
actually, nevermind... I'll resurrect the one I had running earlier....

[20-Oct-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  that is not, not responding 🤣

[20-Oct-19 07:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
alternatively, I can redirect my old mining url to your pool if you want. It's still listed on the website but has been offline for a while

[20-Oct-19 07:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
tbh, I'm not a fan of censorship, but abusive talk from non-contributing fools I consider grounds for removal

{Reactions}
🤔 👍 

[20-Oct-19 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess so... if they continue to spam, we will need to do something... But ignoring them shoul;d eventually work in any case, because nobody has time to talk to them self on discord for hours. 😂

[20-Oct-19 07:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you'd be surprised....

[20-Oct-19 07:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I forget, do we need to disable coinbase for the pool?

[20-Oct-19 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would just use it all the time myself... because it works for everything

[20-Oct-19 07:49 AM] CrisF#3405
`I'm not a fan of censorship, but abusive talk from non-contributing fools`

Yeah, this doesn't seem to be a matter of censorship to me.  This just isn't the forum for those discussions.  Take it to DM, or another appropriate place.

This is the 2nd or possibly the 3rd time that the above was brought up in here.

I don't mind swearing in many contexts, but a message that is simply `f off` to someone, isn't something for what we're doing here. 

I would like to bring projects who are serious about devving their project to Labs.  I they were to walk into some childishness like ☝ I'll be looking like a childish dick myself.

[20-Oct-19 07:50 AM] CrisF#3405
.
This just seems to be sensible to me.

[20-Oct-19 07:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
disassociation > guilt by association

[20-Oct-19 07:51 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not worried that they'll think badly of me.  Some of these people I'll meet in person.  But it would certainly reflect on my judgement.

[20-Oct-19 07:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Rant over, need to get me some sugar.

[20-Oct-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is why we need more channels... There should be one or more, for work related shit.

[20-Oct-19 08:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, agree.  `#channel-babel` > /dev/null 2>&1

[20-Oct-19 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Did I get that right?

[20-Oct-19 08:47 AM] CrisF#3405
If so, I suggest the channel `#/dev/null 2>&1`

[20-Oct-19 08:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Rather than delete, just move the messages there.
Or send to a burn address.

[20-Oct-19 09:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator <http://mininglabs.rocks>
@CrisF -  If #kmdlabs is the "wrong channel" for LABS pool talk, then wtf would make PIRATE server the "right" place?

[20-Oct-19 09:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers

[20-Oct-19 09:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you have no objections, I've setup proxy forwarding from http://pool.cryptocartography.io/ to http://mininglabs.rocks/ so the link on the KMD LABS website goes somewhere useful. 
Just setup my pool again, but it's not half as pretty, and probably best on a different server than where I put it.

[20-Oct-19 09:19 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've added the humble hash of a 1070 GPU while testing it all, but may add some paid hash later this week

[20-Oct-19 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no matter to me, it's still got the flaw in payment module and I never make anything on it anyway 😛

[20-Oct-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whats the flaw?

[20-Oct-19 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it doesn't subtract the pool fee properly and eventually pays more than it should

[20-Oct-19 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol, bank error in your favour to the user? Very generous of you.

[20-Oct-19 09:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, since NN income pays all of my server fees and I needed the summer/fall to get things done around the home, I just left it 😛

[20-Oct-19 09:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've found the where and why and fixed it in the next iteration of my pools, but hadn't planned on updating them until Nov

[20-Oct-19 09:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any recommendations for hash providers?

[20-Oct-19 09:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
recommendations for what?

[20-Oct-19 09:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
like miningrigrentals vs nicehash etc

[20-Oct-19 09:25 AM] Oszy#5734
im in favor of mrr

[20-Oct-19 09:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sounds biblical

[20-Oct-19 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
for lower cheaper hashrates,  and shorter periods of time, it's more convenient for me.

[20-Oct-19 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you can find the right renter, mrr beats nh every time
most of the chains we deal with, rentals are a waste of coinage because they set the mindiff too high

[20-Oct-19 09:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm offering liquidity on atomicDEX once listed, so just want to keep a decent baseline and set pricepoint at near cost of mining. not sure how I'll work that out, but thats the goal anyway

[20-Oct-19 09:28 AM] Oszy#5734
oh you're going to piss of kevin :troll_cool:

[20-Oct-19 09:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"cost of mining" is a hard thing to keep a regular measure of
if doubles every time kevin comes in complaining that he can't dump as many

[20-Oct-19 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its a reciprocal arangement.

[20-Oct-19 09:29 AM] Oszy#5734
better buy some now at .000001 cents idk how much you will be able to mine to sustain as LP

[20-Oct-19 09:29 AM] Oszy#5734
he dumps it to you

[20-Oct-19 09:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can get like 300x more from staking than he can from mining (per investment $)_

[20-Oct-19 09:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
funny thing is the qty of mined coins is only part of the equation. double value means half mined = same ROI. I'm happy to hold and distribute as bountys, not so happy to see constant dumping from the uninvolved.

[20-Oct-19 09:31 AM] Oszy#5734
dumpers be dumpin' right Genie?

[20-Oct-19 09:32 AM] Oszy#5734
staking ftw

[20-Oct-19 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly so 😦

[20-Oct-19 09:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm also staking (funny how short sigthed dumpage is in this respect)

[20-Oct-19 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I suppose that his constant dumping is good for *someone*, though

[20-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Oszy#5734
based on vol pretty sure he's not the only dumper :d

[20-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Oszy#5734
but definitely good for others 🙂

[20-Oct-19 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't staked nearly as much as I should, but there's no part of me that could imagine me selling any now

[20-Oct-19 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek that $100, I want $3 now

[20-Oct-19 09:35 AM] Oszy#5734
prob wants to pay for his latte with btc

{Reactions}
🤣 

[20-Oct-19 09:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can get folks selling for need, I've been there, but straight dumping is a bad plan for LABS imo

[20-Oct-19 09:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd bet everything I own that LABS can sustain 30x growth longer than BTC can 😛

[20-Oct-19 09:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I have no problem with dumping, as LP, I'm selling also (and buying). Just prefer those selling actually care about the project, not just how much lattes they can buy while they're not using the caffiene for something useful

[20-Oct-19 09:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd almost prefer if someone were dumping LABS to buy WLC rather than BTC

[20-Oct-19 09:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or dirty fiat

[20-Oct-19 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢, I was reffering to his last message about talking in PIRATE ```Well thanks to nim nob willing to take 30% losses on pirate just to make sure I can't get 30% more```

[20-Oct-19 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
I need to buy some Labs.

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll willingly take losses today for a hamburger on tuesday

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hasn't mined PIRATE outside of a solo pool, ever 🤷🏽_

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Isn't Labs going to be on the next AtomicDEX update?

[20-Oct-19 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think he took some of the good drugs when he wrote "pirate"

[20-Oct-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, which is why I;m preparing

{Reactions}
🚀 

[20-Oct-19 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, he was babbling more incoherently that usual.

[20-Oct-19 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I need to buy some Labs.`
I'm selling some at 4 KMD each...

[20-Oct-19 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
At that rate I'd have to drop from some to a few...

[20-Oct-19 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL

[20-Oct-19 09:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've already got some on mm2 via CLI

{Reactions}
🤑 

[20-Oct-19 09:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but they are special edition LABS. One of a kind.

{Reactions}
SmartChainC (2) SmartChainB (2) SmartChainA (2) 

[20-Oct-19 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Special Edition LABS came from the blood, sweat, and tears of all the labor we put in during testing
Minimum buy order: a super low, low exclusive of 20k LABS per order

[20-Oct-19 09:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, good times that :)
:labs1:

[20-Oct-19 09:48 AM] Oszy#5734
back on topic, if I already have the utxo's set for staking long ago, and i want to increase the pool balance (send like 10K or more to segid 0) , running the ./RNDsendmany.py again locks the old funds so old utxo's won't be messed up? 
or is there another script that distributes the newly arrived funds only without touching old utxo's?

[20-Oct-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
got me, I barely ever used the py bits

[20-Oct-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just bash wrote whatever I wanted it to do

[20-Oct-19 09:50 AM] Oszy#5734
i can see locking in the code but it "feels" like it messed up for me *no stakes in past 12 hours* and usually i have multiple in an hour

[20-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe it's just kevin started staking taking all the blocks :troll_cool:

[20-Oct-19 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
run a listunspent with a minconf that would let you see if the "older" ones are still there

[20-Oct-19 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
slap `|jq length` on the end of it and it will count how many there are (provided you have jq installed)

[20-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
wow there are some but not as much as i thought

[20-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
33 lol
