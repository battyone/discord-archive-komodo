[18-May-19 05:26 PM] Exile13#4458
looks like CFEKORC is running because i get a return on ./komodo-cli getinfo, but the longest chain is 0?

[18-May-19 05:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah should be 20887 now ðŸ˜•

[18-May-19 05:27 PM] Exile13#4458
ya i see that as the "blocks" :

[18-May-19 05:28 PM] Exile13#4458
listen, should i know this by now? im not trying to be the gimpy one

[18-May-19 05:29 PM] Exile13#4458
there may be others more qualified, seems like im in over my head

[18-May-19 05:31 PM] Exile13#4458
errors abundant

[18-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
you need a balance

[18-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
mine a block

[18-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
or post an address here

[18-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
I'll have to add a check for that, sorry

[18-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419

[18-May-19 05:43 PM] Exile13#4458
ahhh setgenerate true 0

[18-May-19 05:43 PM] Exile13#4458
i thought there was already a balance upon creation my fault

[18-May-19 05:43 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you need more than 0

[18-May-19 05:44 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
0 will stake a balance

[18-May-19 05:44 PM] Exile13#4458
ok

[18-May-19 05:44 PM] Exile13#4458
changed to true 1

[18-May-19 05:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530

That's why they say the people who live next to the ocean are more balanced, living next to a monster who at any point could swallow you helps you daily to realize  impermanence.

[18-May-19 06:30 PM] Exile13#4458
its really mindblowing, with all our sensory input there will only ever be *this* perspective judging itself as a node on the network. Thats why im drawn to crypto, seems the free give and take is something inherent with us, our environment.

[18-May-19 06:48 PM] Strob#3417
Hi! I'm in the process of registering too! I see in the instruction you open port 9997 for iguana in ufw but in the config.ini  iguana_port = 7776.... is that correct?

[18-May-19 06:53 PM] Exile13#4458
I kept the default value there for iguana in the config.ini

[18-May-19 06:53 PM] Exile13#4458
And opened 9997

[18-May-19 06:54 PM] Strob#3417
ok so you probably wont be able to get inbound connection?

[18-May-19 06:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you only want to register, then you only need to start CFEKORC chain with -pubkey

[18-May-19 06:55 PM] Strob#3417
Ok thanks yes but I happened to see this and I was wondering.

[18-May-19 06:57 PM] Exile13#4458
ya i got stuck attempting to activate all chains in StakedNotary

[18-May-19 07:02 PM] Exile13#4458
i can turn on mining to help you verify if you want @Strob

[18-May-19 07:02 PM] Strob#3417
that would be very nice of you!

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
don't need KMD just to register

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
I guess i should have separated this dapp from StakedNotary

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
seems a lot of confusion, sorry

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Exile13#4458
ya, no bootstrap

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Strob#3417
ok but I need to create a kmd address to get pubkey?

[18-May-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[18-May-19 07:06 PM] Exile13#4458
just run CFEKORC

[18-May-19 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
you can do it on CFEKORC though

[18-May-19 07:06 PM] Strob#3417
ok

[18-May-19 07:06 PM] Alright#0419
or just do it on any daemon and import it

[18-May-19 07:06 PM] Strob#3417
any special parameter to start CFEKORC?

@Strob ^

[18-May-19 07:08 PM] Exile13#4458
are you using tmux?

[18-May-19 07:08 PM] Exile13#4458
i reccomend it

[18-May-19 07:11 PM] Strob#3417
not yet but I saw it yes look great

[18-May-19 07:15 PM] Exile13#4458
yes, ive yet to fully optimize it, but running 3-6 'panes' in the same window is great

[18-May-19 07:17 PM] Strob#3417
For the testnet I installed the Mate minimal gui from the ubuntu minimal install and use x2go with ssh keys.

[18-May-19 07:18 PM] Strob#3417
Just because my main workstation is still on windows now. but I will install Linux on it and use tmux for mainnet.

[18-May-19 07:20 PM] Exile13#4458
oh thats cool

[18-May-19 07:23 PM] Exile13#4458
im not familiar with windows terminal options, i dualbooted several pcs over the last year to get familiar with linux, i figured most coding was easier learned from this platform. i like windows for my adobe programs even though its sllloooow, im saving for a mac for art.

[18-May-19 07:24 PM] Strob#3417
Sadly I still need windows for Zbrush and photoshop and after efffects... ðŸ˜­
