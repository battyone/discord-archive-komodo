If you can comprehend paying first person (.009)

[17-Nov-18 11:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
All first people that you recruit would be the same

[17-Nov-18 11:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Next level = (.005)

[17-Nov-18 11:12 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Then divide that out and make the math work to .01 to .015

[17-Nov-18 11:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The rest of var holders get the balance

Hi @gcharang, do you know where I can find an explanation on MoMoM.  Search on `docs.komodo`  didn't return results.

[18-Nov-18 06:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Hey! How to check if I'm doing correct notarisations? I've started iguana two days ago but seems balances on all ACs only decreasing by tx fees

Balances were 1 50 10 10 10, not much profitable üòÉ

[18-Nov-18 06:35 AM] CrisF#3405
No problem.  @blackjok3r  can confirm.

[18-Nov-18 06:36 AM] CrisF#3405
NNs are not being paid for notarizing yet.

[18-Nov-18 06:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see, I see

[18-Nov-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The balance is to make the notarisations, notary testnet is unpaid

[18-Nov-18 06:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Staked chain was a test net as well but as I remember there were some payments, that's why confused

[18-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cfek chain, has a crazy high block reward if you need coins just mine some

[18-Nov-18 06:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I just wanted to ensure that notarizing correct

[18-Nov-18 06:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Some coins were given before, but that was just to pay fees.

[18-Nov-18 06:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Since I've modified few scripts on my side

[18-Nov-18 06:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I can send some test coins if needed.

You should be able to see `MINE` in std also, @TonyL .

[18-Nov-18 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess current balance will be enough until next chain/s will be started

[18-Nov-18 06:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that should last a while

[18-Nov-18 06:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notaeisation is pretty cheap, kmd can drain quite fast though, and you either need to fund yourself or ask me or alright for a couple kmd for that

[18-Nov-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
