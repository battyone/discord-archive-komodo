just checked it randomly

[04-Jan-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm still can't pass this moment ```migrate_createimporttransaction: backnotarisation not yet confirmed (code -1)```
Export transaction had: ```'rawconfirmations': 6, 'confirmations': 6``` Before I've tried `migrate_createimporttransaction`

[04-Jan-19 09:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Are you using CFEKX CFEKY, Tony?

[04-Jan-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes

[04-Jan-19 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I've seen that message before but don't remember the situation.

[04-Jan-19 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
I think migrations require a minimum number of notarizations (2?) on all 3 chains.

[04-Jan-19 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
X & Y are both notarizing.

[04-Jan-19 09:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Have a to see what Blackjok3r says.

[04-Jan-19 09:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh maybe I need to wait notarizations, not confirmations 游땍

[04-Jan-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the step he is on only requires a single notarisation... the next step needs a notrisation on KMD adn the sendrawtransaction step needs 2 notarisations opn the target (to include the MoMoM has from KMD sent back to the AC's.

[04-Jan-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dpowconfs should mean that any confirms over 1 means the tx is notarised.

[04-Jan-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it does need 2 ntoarisation on source chain too ? not really sure... I just kept polling until each step worked and the script is currently working very reliably.

The wallet corruption fix is working perfectly once I got the entire bootstrap from the other node.... All the corrupt txs in the wallet are from orphaned blocks, and they are added to the wallet on load. Even though they have no confirms.

can have a batch of view keys released in the viewer-app.  view key changes every 5 blocks, heaps of possibilities without knowing the guts of it.

[04-Jan-19 09:54 AM] Mylo#8306
view keys are funded or they are not.

with a sidechain? or lookup of proof of funding.   dunno - it's secondary thinknig atm,   i might just be dribbling 游땎

[04-Jan-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah ... I think I get the use case for it though its a decent idea... The hard part will be sendign the keys, if we did that on chain, anyone can just get the key from the tx that sent it... so you would probably need off chain for that, kind of defating the purpose of using a blockchain to stream.

[04-Jan-19 09:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Doesn't smk use encryption for Dragonhound?

[04-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... you need the key though, and mylos idea is to change the key constantly..

[04-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
paying to stream the file is easy... paying to veiw it is not easy at all.

I remeber using one od dwy's sercvers in the scale test and it built KMD so fast, liek at least 10x faster than anything else I had used at the time... downlaoded all deps instantly... Coming from australian internet it was a huge surprise.

[04-Jan-19 10:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Realize now I'm not living in the 1st world, haha.  Might have to upgrade from the portable wifi I'mon.

[04-Jan-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha got 50mbit NBN here its not bad so far... but I'm already considering upgradeing to 100mbit lol

[04-Jan-19 10:15 AM] Mylo#8306
```
The very basic explanation in three steps is:

* Set up a payment channel with your denominations (10k satoshi in this case)
* Optionally, wait for the payment channel to be notarized by Komodo onto Bitcoin for bitcoin level security
* Send out transactions to those payment channels to be spent like any other type of transaction, one at a time or in multiples, to the destination of your choosing
```

the `hashchain` is the key.   authorized channel payments.   as you stream, you send off these payments, payments and viewkeys marry up

[04-Jan-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even my server has dual gigabit connection at he DC (server is only 1gbit ethernet tho) and for local downlaods it gets 800mbit odd ... as soon as you try pull overseas data its less than 100mbit 游땭

A restart of my miner on CFEKX got things working.

I am not sure havent noticed anything here

[04-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It appears that either someone is doing migrates with  the old version, or y0our miners are on an old version... or some how, the decoding of the burntx isnt working 100% of the time.

[04-Jan-19 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
9if that happens resync the chain, should get it on the notarised chain

[04-Jan-19 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
my miner is the same pull as my nn

[04-Jan-19 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and this is on a resync

[04-Jan-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it should be ok the same chain. Have you done any migrates ? 
its possible the change of code is unrliable... james wrote it, all I added was a decode to use the data...

[04-Jan-19 11:00 AM] CrisF#3405
My miner was on latest.

[04-Jan-19 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it only uses the data when you call the `getimports` rpc other than that its loaded into an unused array.

if its causi9ng the chains to fork then there is a problem.

Haven't tried migrationg.  Trying to make a VM on this server. Will useTony's oracle TUI on that.

[04-Jan-19 11:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Will be able to set up migrates when sort out making VMs.

[04-Jan-19 11:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Other servers all busy atm.

[04-Jan-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats cool man.. I decided to test them first... if it can migrate 5000 without any fails we are ready to stress test it. My nodes doing the migrates are not showing any errors in getinfo

[04-Jan-19 11:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, good to tests on these new chains first.

[04-Jan-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
This still look good?```Test jl777 chain

100%POW -- Dragonhound cluster  (fresh chains, just testing migrations)

add Log chain (outside observer, not in cluster, see how oracle activity effects migrations, start logging)

add new 100%POW -- new Dragonhound to CFEK -- CFEKLF cluster with Log chain (logging, outside observer)

Go sick, logging mass migrations.```

[04-Jan-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
We seem to be on the 2nd one now.

[04-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can log on one of these chains ... still trying to think about how best to do that

[04-Jan-19 11:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, next log on these then add some? Maybe a PoW/PoS like smk's?

[04-Jan-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
weather to run the logs inside the migrate script itself, seems a good way, as each tester can use this to log all import txs. I think the code I made for `getimports` can be added to `getrawtransaction` so that when you fetch an import tx with it, it shows the export details.

[04-Jan-19 11:11 AM] CrisF#3405
If the logs from each then somehow go to the oracle chain there will be data from many sources for any to view.
We should be able to (invite) get quite a few to run the scripts for the main test if it's automated like that.

[04-Jan-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am thinking we make a KMD bounty for the person with the most migrates.

[04-Jan-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then have the script push all txs to your own oracle

[04-Jan-19 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we can get enough participants we could probably nearly fill chain capacity with 4-5 chains with just using export and import txns ... would go a long way for scaletest marketing.

[04-Jan-19 11:16 AM] CrisF#3405
The actual result of the Migration Test is, yeah, for that.  And for KMD as a whole.
In addition the test benefits KMD a great deal from the potential marketing angle.

did the sendraw actaully return a txid ?

[04-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That part is the step that always used to fail. Also it can confirm then be reorged out of the chain, if people are on the wrong version and mining.

[04-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is the private key imported on the target?

[04-Jan-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep it is since I'm notarising

[04-Jan-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe that step should be changed to use `getrawtransaction`

[04-Jan-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
`did the sendraw actaully return a txid ?`
It's a good question - will print this one

[04-Jan-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, that was my first thought to try `getrawtransaction`

[04-Jan-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the send tx of import is the longest step. it requires notrisations to have heppoened on the source, target, KMD, and target again.
