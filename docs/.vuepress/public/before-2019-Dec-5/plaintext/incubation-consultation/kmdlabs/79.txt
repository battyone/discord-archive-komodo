Would that minimum ping difference negatively effect the NN network performance in any meaningful way?

[10-Nov-18 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only if nodes tried to cheat it

[10-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but like I said its not easy to acomplsh at all... maybe not even possible lol

[10-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think early on its not a probelm... as we have a 2 month turn over of notaries, thee things can be sorted later, should it really prove a problem.

[10-Nov-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```        if ( tx.IsCoinBase() && tx.vout[0].nValue == 0 )
            return false;```

[10-Nov-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats working to ignore 0 sat coinbases just fine ...

[10-Nov-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and its now in master

Dont see any reason to make the solution any harder ... going to document all the features in master branch and give them to alright to test properly and then start on BR code. ... only an entire week after I was meant to start it lol

Haven't seen this one before ```CFEKLF 148

will happen on EVERY SINGLE migrate 😂

[10-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im sorry about that, but apart from removing the print ai dont see how to solve that, its not a problem, as long as the import works... it means it cannot yet find the MoMoM hash that is valid

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What it does, is go back 100 blocks, then check every MoMoM up to the current block height until it finds one that validates, and that will print on every one that is not.... at freq 5, thats like 20 MoMoM hashes it can check against every time you try to send import tx

[10-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright  We need to fix this MAX_MONEY issue, I need your help on this one, about how to best go about it.

[10-Nov-18 12:11 PM] CrisF#3405
Where can I see the maxsupply?

[10-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( (baseid= komodo_baseid(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL)) >= 0 && baseid < 32 )
            MAX_MONEY = komodo_maxallowed(baseid);
        else if ( ASSETCHAINS_REWARD == 0 )
            MAX_MONEY = (ASSETCHAINS_SUPPLY+100) * SATOSHIDEN;
        else MAX_MONEY = (ASSETCHAINS_SUPPLY+100) * SATOSHIDEN + ASSETCHAINS_REWARD * (ASSETCHAINS_ENDSUBSIDY==0 ? 10000000 : ASSETCHAINS_ENDSUBSIDY);
        MAX_MONEY += (MAX_MONEY * ASSETCHAINS_COMMISSION) / SATOSHIDEN;```

[10-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think what its doing, is takeing the premine of 1000 coins, and as there is no block reward, that becomes the max supply

[10-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant send, or receive anything over that

[10-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So what we need to do, is add some kind of exeption for clusters of ac_cc>100 so that it allows a higher number ... or a static number set by the cluster creator.

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-Nov-18 12:19 PM] CrisF#3405
I have had a balance of over 1000 coins on that chain (LF) and over 350,000 on ING.  ED will be getting up there too.  I must be missing something.

[10-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
do you have any UTXOs >1000 on any chain

[10-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
if so, try to spend them

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
MAX_MONEY will indeed have an issue for chains that get cross chain transfers

[10-Nov-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
what should it be set to? I think for ac_cc chains maybe we set a minimum value for MAX_MONEY?

[10-Nov-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any utxo over 1000 wont be able to be spent until we fix max_money ... a minimum value seems reasonable way around it.

[10-Nov-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the main issue comes from exporting a value that cannot be imported

[10-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
can you create them, just not spend them?

[10-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
burns the coins

[10-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no it wont let you import it

[10-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its over MAX_MONEY

[10-Nov-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181

POS% on CFEK normalized with a single mini btw

[10-Nov-18 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
very quickly too

[10-Nov-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I can make it a million coins as a minimum

[10-Nov-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CPUs just cannot compete with the PoS difficulty, nice to see that a single mini (maybe even a GPU ) is enough to fix it.

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt anyone would ever migrate more than a million .. maybe the max export tx shoudl also be set at a million ?

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they cant do that

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
really dont wany ppl to mistakenly lose huge amounts of coins

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
what is the purpose of MAX_MONEY? Pretty important, yes?

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] Alright#0419
it's checks on overall supply

[10-Nov-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
code says its a sanity check

[10-Nov-18 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Why would that happen on `ED` -> `LF` and not on `CFEK` ->`ED`? Both are migrating 999 coins at a time.

[10-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
CFEK has higher MAX_MONEY

[10-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
because 100k block rewards

[10-Nov-18 12:51 PM] CrisF#3405
I see.  So as long as one has a high enough MAX_MONEY it will work.

[10-Nov-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
latest FSM sets MAX_MONEY for CC chains to 1 million if it is below

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should not be this :
```if ( ASSETCHAINS_CC >= KOMODO_FIRSTFUNGIBLEID && MAX_MONEY < 1000000LL*SATOSHIDEN )
            MAX_MONEY = 1000000LL*COIN;```

[10-Nov-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also the export TX needs to be limited burnamount to the same size... trying to work that out now

Only problem with stabilising POS/POW with a mini (not that it matters as POS was too high anyway) - is no more coins for my two little cores.

[10-Nov-18 01:05 PM] CrisF#3405
@Bar_F1sh_Rel you can stake, too.

[10-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

staking isn't automatic is it?

[10-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[10-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do `setgenerate true 0` or start the daemon with `-gen -genproclimit=0`

[10-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot mine PoW and stake at the same time

[10-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They are specifically for testing somehting we are pretty sure is fixed .. try other things, try and break it ... I put the changes james made into master, just testing that export cannot be higher then 1 million coins, then You guys can test the max money is fixed 😃

[10-Nov-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
looks like james went ahead and made ac_perc work with a pool and created the founders reward for us too... So I dont have to do that now, but it will be a PITA to merge, die to streamer options. 😦

[10-Nov-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopeing we can finish up MoMoM testing them merge FSM down to Staked Master, and start a new cluster of chains and retest with a founders reward on the main chain.

[10-Nov-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MLT was broken for us this time around, which was equal with FSM, either was a merge error on my aprt, or something else is screwing it up, so we need to test that.

[10-Nov-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  you can update to master latest and test migrating 1 million coins from CFEK to any other chain.

👌 

[10-Nov-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will not let you export more than 1 million, and import should allow 1 million.

[10-Nov-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
please test exactly 1 million and check that it works if you can

[10-Nov-18 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would test it myself, but I have loops running I dont want to stop ... stopping them will screw with my data.

is there a limit on size for migrations? i tried with .1 and got an error

[10-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you need to use 1 and more ... BUT that could also be a limitation of the script ...

[10-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can try to do the commands manually

[10-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and test that

[10-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I always just used 1 or 10 ... I never tried to break it yet, as it was already broken when using it as its meant to be used.

in staked repo - I have been using random between 1-300 calling your script

[10-Nov-18 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the latest master you should be able to send 1 million coins from CFEK to any chain...

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and any amount under 1 million

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] gt#2812
i tried 10k before but it didn’t work

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] gt#2812
will try soon

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I don't think that has hit staked yet (it's in stakednotary?)

[10-Nov-18 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is also a limitation...
