the notarisations are stored there

[04-Jan-19 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on a fresh sync you MUST remove it

[04-Jan-19 02:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and the .ind?

[04-Jan-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I just use `komodostate*`

[04-Jan-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`rm -rf blocks chainstate notarisations komodostate*`

[04-Jan-19 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then started damon , 10-15s synced

[04-Jan-19 02:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
new error 😃 that means progress :p:

```
Error: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 306 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

[04-Jan-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this make no sense... remove peers.dat too?

[04-Jan-19 02:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thats cos i didnt delete blocks hehehe

[04-Jan-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LOL

[04-Jan-19 02:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@CMaurice  I think its best to use deb 9 or ubuntu 16.04 this crash seems to be from code that isnt in komodod.

just make sure you're in the correct dir when you run it though :trollface:

[04-Jan-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
synced Y and X here a bunch of times now... latest master no issues.

[04-Jan-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
best guess is someone was on old version and mined a fork

@jl777c  the payments for streamer... The issue wasnt really about how to pay, although I like your suggestion its seems the best solution... The problem is more about how to stop people who did not pay veiwing content..

[04-Jan-19 02:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not one of mine

[04-Jan-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you mined it, and trhey are propagating it still... either way with a fresh sync it seems to sync every time.

[04-Jan-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

how long since u synced it?> maybe just hasmt found yet?

pushed `updatefirewall.sh` to StakedNotary aswell

[04-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses the p2p port form `getinfo` to make ufw rule ... you need to manually remove rules though

2959 sucessful migrates so far here 😃

[05-Jan-19 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be most of today before the loop of 5000 finishes. If they are all sucessful thats over 24H of constant migrates with no fails.

[05-Jan-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Easily is stable with that many. Next job will be to start designing data collection data structure and what we need to log. Will have a go at this today and try sort out some blocknotify scripts.

Sorry guys ... went to use dev environ here after kernel update and Virtual box broke... perfect excuses to reuild it properly using KVM.

[05-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Nearly got 1 VM up... then just a matter of copy pasting it a couple of times and keeping the base img as backup.

[05-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
back into it tomorrow... at least by then my migrate loop will have finished.

I've been doing the same, very unsuccessfully.

I goggled it, seems the original was abandoned and just about every distro has their own fork of it

What do you use for making a VM?

That's one of the big troubles I had.

[05-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Mylo#8306
Networking is a bit of a learning curve, adding a bridge on command line, then doing the forwarding (3 lines config) routing (cpl files few lines in each) and firewall

[05-Jan-19 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
and bridging..

[05-Jan-19 08:44 AM] CrisF#3405
The guide made it look so easy too.

[05-Jan-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope

[05-Jan-19 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bridge is super dooper easy here... I made 1 br0 linked it to local ethernet device ... and set all vms to use it

[05-Jan-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my router is passing an IP to each VM

[05-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Mylo#8306
```
lsmod | grep bridge
brctl show
hexdump -vn3 -e '/3 "52:54:00"' -e '/1 ":%02x"' -e '"\n"' /dev/urandom
ip link add virbr10-dummy address 52:54:00:f9:78:15  type dummy
brctl addbr virbr10
brctl stp virbr10 on
brctl addif virbr10 virbr10-dummy
vi /etc/network/interfaces <----something goes in here
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

```

[05-Jan-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the the whole thing is behind its NAT as firewall

[05-Jan-19 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah i've got a /29 pointing to 3 VMs, another 3 addresses available (if that's what a /29 is)

[05-Jan-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess it depnds what your doing... on my NN I have a virtualmachine in the cloud at the DC with a router in it... I have 172.16.16.xxx ips that auto assign.. its all in bridged mode... then to get intnernet I ask them for an IP and give them a MAC address of the VM I need open ports for and they assigne it... giving me 100% full control over ports onm these ips using local ufw.

[05-Jan-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because I have no idea what I'm doing, tried to figure out the simplest solution to things as I go along...

[05-Jan-19 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Chris maybe try Proxmox on the host thats all a webpage to manage it just liek vmware is.... I think thats what i will move to evenually.

on notary node... I used VMware ESXi 6.5 with update 1.... not sure you can actually get that though, its all a website to manage it very very easy... not exactly secure though.... I had to spend some big $$ on networking stuff at the DC to get a VPN to my own local network. So that none of my servers management tools are open to the internet.

is `CFEK` the chain with oracles?  and is it up to block 60200 or thereabouts?

[05-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
there's about 50 oracles resturned from `oracleslist`
