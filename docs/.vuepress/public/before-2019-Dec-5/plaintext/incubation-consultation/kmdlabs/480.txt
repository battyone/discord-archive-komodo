Well, while we're here might as well keep busy.

[29-Sep-19 08:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you have any ideas about making an anonymous vote?

[29-Sep-19 08:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that I'm already too busy is what started all this silliness 🤣

[29-Sep-19 08:50 AM] CrisF#3405
how so?

[29-Sep-19 08:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Do you have any ideas about making an anonymous vote?`
make CCs work with z
would be the best choice, I think

[29-Sep-19 08:52 AM] CrisF#3405
That would be very cool.

[29-Sep-19 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how so?`
short version:
I've not had the time to sit down and reroute the webpage API code for piratesolo
That and I said a 4-letter word on the pirate discord

[29-Sep-19 08:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I'm lucky that I have a bit of time now, but majorly hampered by my slowness :abusedsmily:

[29-Sep-19 08:55 AM] CrisF#3405
I don't mind 4-letter words in most cases.  I am genuinely concerned by what I wrote in the the other channel though.

[29-Sep-19 08:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same word, different server
so, I can't say much about that one other than I've always had an issue with the social engineering of policing specific words

[29-Sep-19 08:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, context matters more than the selected word/words
but context has always been important to me 🤷🏽

[29-Sep-19 08:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just use more syllables

[29-Sep-19 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-Sep-19 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or less

[29-Sep-19 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, context matters.

[29-Sep-19 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
So do words, as I've heard well stated 😀

In my case, I agree with probably 80% of what you said, but that isn't the most important thing for me.

[29-Sep-19 09:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

My issue isn't at all in that I'm being held to a "standard"
My issue is that the "standard" is applied arbitrarily and less against "nice" folks

For me, being 'right' isn't enough.
If it doesn't affect change.

I would like my 'rightness' to be worth something.

Yes, I agree.  But I still try for more.  And try again next time.

Can anyone confirm that voting with no fees is possible?  Emmanuel once posted about a no-fee kind of transaction relating to this.  I can't find the post.  His post are gone.

[29-Sep-19 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fees would be relative to how full the block is

[29-Sep-19 09:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no fee can be an invitation to spam. better to just use a valueless side chain.

[29-Sep-19 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
@johnwhitestar ☝👇

[29-Sep-19 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no fee can be an invitation to spam.`
other than "storage space", why would it matter?

[29-Sep-19 09:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Is that enforced on a chain I create?

[29-Sep-19 09:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, name is back.  Soon the avatar ban should finish then too.

[29-Sep-19 09:41 AM] gcharang#6833
there is an "experimental" txpow parameter <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-txpow>
should help deter spam

[29-Sep-19 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fee or no fee can be changed with a couple basic node settings
the only chains that would be an "issue" sending no fee on is one you cannot mine and/or no pool allows below x amount

[29-Sep-19 09:43 AM] gcharang#6833
`-ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1` is a no block reward chain
why anyone would mine it is a different issue

[29-Sep-19 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
If a no-fee tx is impossible, it should mean that jl777's original suggestion should work for an anonymous vote.

{Reactions}
🤔 

[29-Sep-19 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless there's a chain param that specifically bans no fee, then no fee is left up to the nodes (which default at a certain relayfee, but can be run differently)

[29-Sep-19 09:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, maybe that is what emanuel was talking about.

[29-Sep-19 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a whole host of possible node params that most folks never use

[29-Sep-19 09:47 AM] CrisF#3405
If it is up to the node chain params won't help?

[29-Sep-19 09:48 AM] CrisF#3405
I didn't realize nodes had those powers.

[29-Sep-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not aware of such a chain param existing, but if it did then it would supersede the node params
`I didn't realize nodes had those powers.`
Yes, you have the power to determine how much or how little you participate in network activity

[29-Sep-19 09:49 AM] gcharang#6833
an individual node can follow whatever rule they want
if the rest of the network will follow suit is the real question

[29-Sep-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if the rest of the network will follow suit is the real question`
If you block it, they will come

[29-Sep-19 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the mins and maxes effect the node, not the validity of the block
that I may or may not want to create a block with a tx doesn't stop a valid tx from being valid

[29-Sep-19 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why I said it would have to be a chain param to stop it

[29-Sep-19 09:51 AM] gcharang#6833
well, a node could choose to ignore txns below a certain fee
but other nodes could realy them and mine them
```
that's why I said it would have to be a chain param to stop it
```
agreed

[29-Sep-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, if you want to "guarantee" 0 fee transactions, just make it a hybrid chain and PoS it with your own node

{Reactions}
👀 

[29-Sep-19 09:54 AM] CrisF#3405
And that would be a new chain param right?  Not yet available?

[29-Sep-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, no such 0 fee "blocking" chain param currently exists

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Sep-19 09:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Hybrid-chain is not 100% POS?

[29-Sep-19 09:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Or is hybrid also 100%?

[29-Sep-19 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by hybrid, I mean part PoW and part PoS

[29-Sep-19 09:58 AM] CrisF#3405
Would that need a higher % POS to be effective, or wouldn't it matter?

[29-Sep-19 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it depends on the utility you need
with dual and coinage, you're going to get a block "eventually" ensuring that the 0 fee txs go through
mostly it would revolve around what you can put into a block or the number of folks you can rely on to mine 0 fee

[29-Sep-19 10:01 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it possible to create  a 'privately-mined' chain?

[29-Sep-19 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, give no one the params

[29-Sep-19 10:02 AM] gcharang#6833
or modify the source code to create a new param that will allow a set of pre recorded pubkeys to be the only allowed miners

[29-Sep-19 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
consensus code......ewwwwwwww

[29-Sep-19 10:06 AM] CrisF#3405
That does sound useful.

[29-Sep-19 10:07 AM] gcharang#6833
there could also be a set of pubkeys that can ban/add pubkeys to the allowed miner list in a M of N vote

[29-Sep-19 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, centralization is always an alternative 😛

When you were talking about a node, were you referring to a mining node @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[29-Sep-19 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, any node that produces blocks
