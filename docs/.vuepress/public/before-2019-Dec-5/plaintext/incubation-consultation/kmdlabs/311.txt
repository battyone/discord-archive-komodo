the miner was stupidly over complciated in any case and doesnt need to do any of what it was doing

[26-Feb-19 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just limit 1 notariation per block is all that it needs to do

[26-Feb-19 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405
fyi, Imported manually, start.sh has same message. std shows command prompt and has stopped there, but seems all chains running and accept commands.  Will let it run.
Just a fyi.
btw, seems like keys were imported before with `./assets-cli importprivkey`

[26-Feb-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im just confused as it should import the privkey before it is allowed to move on. That said, I did change a few things there not long ago. I will check it by wiping wallet.dat on my notary.

[26-Feb-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone who is here... Do we want to keep the wallet filter enabled by default or just make it so you need to activate it ?

[26-Feb-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For upstream merge I made it so you change 2 `0`'s in the code to a `1` to enable it. And it is toally disabled by default

[26-Feb-19 11:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
how often does it need to be activated?

[26-Feb-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In case we are under attack we should use it. Other wise it really serves no purpouse. ... I mostly wrote it so that we have a defense, so then nobody would bother to attack us with that attack.

[26-Feb-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh I think we are the only ppl who even know about the attack so ü§∑

[26-Feb-19 11:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
any downside to having it on by default?

[26-Feb-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only ppl constantly complaing that they imported X key and their funds are missing

[26-Feb-19 11:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol

[26-Feb-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like it doesnt hurt at all ... if your notary is only a notary

[26-Feb-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
use it for anything else ... and it starts to really mess with things

[26-Feb-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
needs to be guarded with making sure it is a notary node, at the least

[26-Feb-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is .

[26-Feb-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just that in testnet ppl have been importing air drops and stuff to their notary nodes

[26-Feb-19 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess for mainnet this isnt going to be much of a problem.

[26-Feb-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will just leave it active for now.

[26-Feb-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
its disabled in my branches though?

[26-Feb-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Feb-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess NN can decide on their own to use or not to use

[26-Feb-19 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
put a 0 at the start of each if .. not that it would activate anyway

[26-Feb-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it probably wouldnt work as the code sits for mainnet ntoary nodes

[26-Feb-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
at least now there is much less difference between LABS branch, which should make things easier

[26-Feb-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
needs some small mods

[26-Feb-19 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it had to be done ..

[26-Feb-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  found  a few missing &&... PR made to fix

[26-Feb-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you keep making that same error.

[26-Feb-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes üòÇ

[26-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
Large update pushed to master. I also changed `update_komodo.sh` to use `build.sh` instead of `make` so it technically now should actually build almost every time even with makefile changes. But no promises. :abusedsmily:  This update is mostly for nodes who are mining, but please update if you can, and report any errors you see. I think this went pretty smoothly.  We are now equal with jl777/FSM and upstream has nearly all of our code in it, with some parts deactivated. Congrats all who helped us get here.  üöÄ

Any idea why my LABSTH0 will not run dwy_mitigation?? Just keeps saying aborting.

[26-Feb-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught I pushed fix for that today

[26-Feb-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try git pull

[26-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
That works. Cheers.

wonder how long it takes main net notaries to realise they now have those tools üòâ

[26-Feb-19 01:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm... updated and same privkey error msg. Will leave running and see how it goes.

[26-Feb-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think using build.sh has broken start.sh :abusedsmily:

[26-Feb-19 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will check out that problem now and try to fix it

Did a manual `validateaddress` and `ismine` & `isvalid` true

[26-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe your conf files are wrong

[26-Feb-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have you got `rpcuser/pass` in komodo.conf etc

[26-Feb-19 01:10 PM] CrisF#3405
The config.ini looked ok. Will recheck.

[26-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
komodo.conf etc ...

[26-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that error doesnt actually mean that the priv key isnt imported

[26-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it can also mean that it iguana cannot talk to the daemon

[26-Feb-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try to restart iguana, and check the .conf files manually they need to contain rpcuser/pass

[26-Feb-19 01:13 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, in komodo.conf there might be  typo (?)

[26-Feb-19 01:14 PM] CrisF#3405
```cuser=ma...```

[26-Feb-19 01:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Shouldn't that be ```rpcuser=...```

[26-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
possible... the build scripts and the daemon do generate them automatically but they could change maybe?

[26-Feb-19 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Feb-19 01:15 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll change that and see.

[26-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will be it 100% üëç

[26-Feb-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I remeber trying to ntoarize 1024 chains on TXSCL and I just got that error every time ... sent me crazy.

Thanks, that's got it!

[26-Feb-19 01:25 PM] CrisF#3405
See if I can start making some notarizations now.

[26-Feb-19 01:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, already got 2.

[26-Feb-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nice

[26-Feb-19 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Interested to see what the rate on notarization looks like compared to others.

[26-Feb-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you can take note of the block heights right now and change this line of `stats.py` : 
https://github.com/KMDLabs/StakedNotary/blob/master/stats.py#L85
change the 2 the the height you want to start at

maybe be wait 24H and then see what its at. Make sure to use dwy script and cleanwalelttransactions fairly regualrly and your node will be nice and responsive.

[26-Feb-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how often will depend on your node/location etc... its up to you guys to work out that... if you do it too often your just burniung coins in tx fees

i'm the worst in labsth though

[26-Feb-19 02:12 PM] jorian#4555
probably didn't update timely

[26-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the entire chains. There ahve been many interuptions.

[26-Feb-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0BR is a bit unreliable, with only 2000 coins staking it. Some 400-500s block times happen occasionally.

[26-Feb-19 02:33 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I made a modified version that you can specify notarization depth (basic x5 blocks). I am down to about 25% - but I was at 45% until I started a second set of nodes behind the same NAT.

[26-Feb-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do they also have open ports? I do something simlair on my notary node, or at least did... run 2 nodes conencted to each otehr with open ports to get hundreds of connections on each chain. Make sure you get each block in 1-2 hops üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 02:36 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Both have open ports - but I changed the port numbers in the confs of the second set

what exactly is kmdlabs?

[26-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Markus#5464
like testing for notary nodes updates?

[26-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
@Markus KMDLabs is a coin we're launching that will incentivize testing various cryptoconditions and dapps. We'll be the first coin to use the MoMoM fungible chain scaling tech.

[26-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
It's a great place to learn blockchain development. We're trying to foster a learning environment for noobs

[26-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Markus#5464
Okay sounds interesting, whats required to take part of it?

[26-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Markus#5464
@Alright

[26-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
Right now we're prepping for launch. We've been in development for about 9 months. There isn't much to be done at the moment, but after launch, we will have some dapps and CCs available to test. Right now if you're interested in developing a CC or dapp, we can help you along the way

[26-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
even if it's the simplest dapp you can think of, everyone has to start somewhere

[26-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Alright#0419
We have our own notary nodes. All the spots are filled at the moment. There will be 2 additional spots 2 months after launch. Getting a notary spot would be the fastest way to learn as it almost forces you to

[26-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Markus#5464
Hm okay, im interested in Komodo as a platform and been following it for roughly half a year and would like to help the ecosystem cause i believe Komodo as a platform is the way to go

[26-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
LABS is a good place to be then. We're betting a lot on CCs being the future üòÉ

[26-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Alright#0419
if you're interested in getting involved right now, we can show you how to setup some nodes and test some of the dapps we've developed, but other than that I'd say just stick around and hangout until launch

[26-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Markus#5464
What is the requirements to be one of those next 2 additonal NN needed after launch?

[26-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
not be a sock puppet

[26-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
show that you can actually notarize

[26-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
that's it

[26-Feb-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
