is that line the same for you?

[20-Oct-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
same txid there I mean? open the script and look at it

[20-Oct-19 07:44 PM] Oszy#5734
damn no

[20-Oct-19 07:44 PM] Oszy#5734
oracle = {'txid': '2a44176ef5f9a0f6abd477d8b4334e338bd4e8209bdae2fe9809f1e9755bced2',

[20-Oct-19 07:47 PM] Oszy#5734
i was on many iguana

[20-Oct-19 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its in master... you can merge many iguana to mastert, seems to work perfectly

[20-Oct-19 07:48 PM] Oszy#5734
do it again from step 1 now with correct oracle right?

[20-Oct-19 07:48 PM] Oszy#5734

[20-Oct-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
yea just restart from the beginning

[20-Oct-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
maybe not an error in oraclesinfo, just didn't see one of mine appear immediately

Haven't notarized any CFEK chains in 12h+ any one else?

[21-Oct-19 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes Genie said something was wrong with them. Mine is ok, so I left it, if you can help me,, I can look at this and try work out what it was. 
I merged FSM down to the CFEK chains, it could have many bugs.

[21-Oct-19 07:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright sorry about that :(
will send a more solid PR next time

[21-Oct-19 07:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what is the oracles issue? do you have it running `oraclesfund` before `oraclesregister`?

[21-Oct-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oracles ended up extremly complex for some reasonn. I tried to find that bug he was talking about but it seems to be a race condition and rare enough that reproducing it is all but impossible.,

[21-Oct-19 07:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
maybe worth adding something for it to wait for oraclesfund and oraclesregister to be confirmed before subscribe?

[21-Oct-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really know why it needs all those things... It really breaks the UI experiance tbh. 
The voting process is far too complciated as it stands. Need to make something much simpler.

[21-Oct-19 11:10 AM] gcharang#6833
my CFEKAPOW daemon crashed and is stuck when I tried to restart it using start.sh
last lines of debug.log:
```

2019-10-20 14:17:10 socket sending timeout: 1201s

Sounds like a deadlock then.

[21-Oct-19 11:11 AM] gcharang#6833
do you need any logs?
should I just stop and start everyting?

[21-Oct-19 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had that at one point with CFEKMYLO6 as well

[21-Oct-19 11:32 AM] CrisF#3405

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator, sorry, I forgot about this `maybe we should add a form to the website?`

[21-Oct-19 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Should I still do that?

[21-Oct-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
(for NN pubkey)

[21-Oct-19 11:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure if time for this round, but worth implementing for next round. 
likewise I'll look into setting up voting/lottery via oracle.earth front end linked to oracle on backend.
could be possible with nspv also, using wif login as ID validation. I have SSL on the site, but prob best to register with an alternative wif/pub for the voting process.

I am woerking on the iguana, if anyone here can work out when CFEK chains lock up that would be helpful. 
some things you can check: 
Start daemon manually. 
Try to mine then not mine. 
Try some RPC calls. 
check stdout and debug.log

To do this, do not start iguana, just run the daemon on its own. Also try to sync a fresh chain, and see if that stops it happening.

[21-Oct-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Start daemon manually. `
that's my 1st step (reindex)

[21-Oct-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I dont see it happenign on my node as usuall... So those of you who do need to try isolate what causes itm, so I can force it to happen and fix it

[21-Oct-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL reindex seems to have fixed it, but restart now has CFEKMYLO doing what 6 was doing 😕

[21-Oct-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not logs, stdout, or anything visual seems to give any indication as to why, though

saw this in the debug log of labs. is it interesting?

[21-Oct-19 12:33 PM] CrisF#3405
`MYLO6` reindex seems to have worked here too.
Just saw a quick connection error flash by in debug.log during resync. IPV6 address.
