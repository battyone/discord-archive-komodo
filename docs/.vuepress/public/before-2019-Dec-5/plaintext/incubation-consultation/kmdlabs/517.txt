if the native block chain isn't complete it can't retreive what was sent to my native wallet which isn't loading new blocks obviously

[14-Nov-19 02:57 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Thats the problem

[14-Nov-19 02:57 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
it will never show as being in there

[14-Nov-19 02:57 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
because it could never exist

[14-Nov-19 02:57 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
because its jamed

[14-Nov-19 02:58 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
its only showing me the 79 labs that was there before the jam at block 218 or so

[14-Nov-19 02:58 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
that was oct, 26 for me

[14-Nov-19 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
I understand the problem. I told you I need to test how to fix it on linux or you can use cli

[14-Nov-19 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
I can either show you how to use cli or you can wait until I test and come up with a fix

[14-Nov-19 02:59 AM] Alright#0419
again, sorry. Didn't expect issues with linux GUI

[14-Nov-19 03:00 AM] EquihasherDataCenterUSA#1942
Well thanks anyway for now I will just keep trying to download past that blockage I can't update the cli with appimage.  So I am a loss here I will ask maybe next week or something thanks can I add you as a friend?

[14-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
sure

[14-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
I'll set a reminder to message you once we have a proper solution

[14-Nov-19 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We have a proper solution:
Since Verus has taken over the Agama project, those that have pull in the Komodo team need to kick Verus people in the ass, instead of giving Verus a pass on being so lazy when it comes to doing anything with Agama.
That or tell people to go bitch at Verus for Verus not updating Verus projects on any timetable that doesn't revolve around Verus whims...

pls note that once binaries were updated, if you were using the old binaries you were essentially on a fork and any mining/staking rewards after this time were not validated by peers on the main chain.
For staking, CLI is recommended - we have scripts to make it relatively simple to import/export bulk keys. LABS is about learning and building, and we're here to teach and share code for those interested. 
Be aware that periodically the binaries will change, and as our purpose is to be constantly testing new features, if you are staking it is worth keeping up to date.

👍🏽 (5) 👆🏽 (5) 💯 

[14-Nov-19 03:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
How do we do better at notifying the LABS users going forward?

[14-Nov-19 03:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
If we fork to add lottery winners every two months

[14-Nov-19 03:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thats 6 times a year we are going to likely break staking for regular users

[14-Nov-19 03:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
That has to have some weight in things planned going forward... or users will just not bother

[14-Nov-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
This is pretty much the only channel someone needs to watch if they care about their coins

[14-Nov-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Given what "we" do and what LABS is, I'm not sure that there is a viable "we will signal you without you doing research" option 🤷🏽

[14-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Oszy#5734
Can't be easier

[14-Nov-19 03:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
both very valid points...

[14-Nov-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I put "we" in quotes, because I haven't really contributed in months <ashamed>

[14-Nov-19 03:17 PM] phm87#7395
Is it possible to use old bitcoin alert system to warn ppl abt mandatory update ?

[14-Nov-19 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
that was a QT thing no?

[14-Nov-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That might be an option if someone were willing to get Verus folks do do anything on a real-time schedule and not just when it's convenient for them

[14-Nov-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, in order to implement that it would have to be an added if block so that Komodo and Labs were separate keys

[14-Nov-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so I imagine it would have to coincide with a Komodo hf

[14-Nov-19 07:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OceanQt does work for LABS... someone could merge the latest down and add pubkeys if they are not there yet.

[15-Nov-19 12:06 AM] phm87#7395
I think that it is @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator who is maintaining <https://oracle.earth/labs_ntx_graph/>, on the "LABS Notarisation Test - All Chains" page, I don't see mylo's key that I am using to notarize (my stats are very bad since few weeks on the kmdlabs NN, I don't know why, I'll poke at it later). Can you add it on the chart ? Thank you

[15-Nov-19 03:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Will do - I likely have to update all names to match the new keys, depending on if/how thy were reordered in https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.h

[15-Nov-19 04:44 AM] gcharang#6833
can anyone tell me what -ac_cbopret does, and what do its values like 1, 5, 7 mean ? 
I can guess that it is related to addition of data by miners to the coin base txn's opreturn

[15-Nov-19 06:55 AM] gcharang#6833
got the info from dimxy
```
if -ac_cbopret=<wxyz in decimal>
wxyz is in binary
w,x,y,z are bit4, bit3, bit2 and bit1 respectively 
z =1 means: DTO is enabled and miners will write prices data to coinbase opreturn; 
y =1 means: miners will write BTC_USD, BTC_EUR, BTC_GBP 
x =1 means: miners will write  data from -ac_prices param
w=1 means: miners will write  data from -ac_stocks param
```

[15-Nov-19 08:19 AM] AkiraX#8269
hi

[15-Nov-19 08:19 AM] AkiraX#8269
please explain CFEK

[15-Nov-19 08:19 AM] AkiraX#8269
The following examples will use CFEK. Replace CFEK with the chain you are using.

[15-Nov-19 08:19 AM] AkiraX#8269
i was mining labs to an address already

[15-Nov-19 08:20 AM] AkiraX#8269
how do i load that wallet to this computer with linux

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
"CFEK" is short for "clusterfuck", basically just testnet chains

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] AkiraX#8269
alright

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what you're asking

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] AkiraX#8269
can you help me walk through cli

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
sure, what are you trying to do

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] AkiraX#8269
basically i want to import my key

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] AkiraX#8269
and start staking my labs

[15-Nov-19 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
are all the coins held in a single address?

[15-Nov-19 08:32 AM] AkiraX#8269
yes

[15-Nov-19 08:32 AM] Alright#0419
do you know how to build the daemon?

[15-Nov-19 08:32 AM] AkiraX#8269
komodo daemon is build

[15-Nov-19 08:33 AM] AkiraX#8269
but i dont have conf file

[15-Nov-19 08:33 AM] AkiraX#8269
or just how it is on the github

[15-Nov-19 08:34 AM] AkiraX#8269
ok

[15-Nov-19 08:34 AM] AkiraX#8269
so the executables are in the src directory

[15-Nov-19 08:34 AM] AkiraX#8269
i just ran komodod byitself

[15-Nov-19 08:34 AM] AkiraX#8269
and it launched

If LABS = 2.5 loaves of bread - how big is the loaf and what type of bread? Asking for a friend.

Hmm moved staking node to another server and can't mine a single block since this time 😭 :
getting such prints in debug.log `2019-11-18 15:21:56 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found` nothing else suspicous it seems

{Reactions}
🤔 

[18-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Oszy#5734
I have noticed a significant decrease in blocks found by staking, and a lot of orphan blocks as well on my node.

[18-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Oszy#5734
could be a coincidence Tony 😄

[18-Nov-19 04:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
Didn't you forget to `setgenerate true 0`?

[18-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Oszy#5734
I guess there's more people staking more coins recently

[18-Nov-19 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
`  "staking": true,` for sure
 yeah, total amount of coins might be the clue probably but thats strange that it's 0 two days a row. Before I've moved things it was like a few hunderd coins per day just 3 days ago.

[18-Nov-19 04:50 PM] Oszy#5734
