its very easy using StakedNotary repo.

[19-Nov-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are people who will get in no matter what I think like Cris and smk as they have been helping a LOT for months now. Need to decide this, but i would say 20 places wont be filled in the first few minutes ... might be surprised though.

[19-Nov-18 09:49 AM] zatJUM#9924
Mine is already sync'd for KMD üòÉ

[19-Nov-18 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
So the start is in 4 hours or so?

[19-Nov-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[19-Nov-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will prepare the code then, and test it locally... with a 10% BR chain, and a pool for that chain to amke sure it all works.

[19-Nov-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Want to give plenty of time for everyone to confirm.

[19-Nov-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the new chain will be at least 2 days from now.

[19-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Weww... busy day tomorrow!!

[19-Nov-18 09:52 AM] CrisF#3405
A couple days will be good.

[19-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shold be pretty easy to just stop and start to update if your node is alredy up... it will build hte komodod with start.sh, and should grab theupdated staked.json from git.. but this pubkey change is a lergely untested operation... we tested eras, and I have again a LOT more ove the last few weeks when refactoring the code.

[19-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but actually using diffrent keys has nto been done.

[19-Nov-18 09:56 AM] CrisF#3405
So I'll just have to `./stop.sh`, edit `config.ini` and `./start.sh`?

[19-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[19-Nov-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you changed keys enditing config.ini will be required... i the address is new, dont forget to fund it first from old address üëç

[19-Nov-18 09:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Amazing how easy you've made it!

[19-Nov-18 09:57 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks üôè

[19-Nov-18 10:13 AM] gt#2812
will it be all new chains?

[19-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No ... I think we will kill some and we need to add a new one.

[19-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to test the 10% block reward to multisig address... as this is how we will fund notaries on mainnet... the main KMDLABS chain will use this.

[19-Nov-18 10:16 AM] CMaurice#1685
ok @Alright confirmed pubkey, address sent, morning all

[19-Nov-18 10:19 AM] CMaurice#1685
is there a difference between using staked/startall.sh and StakedNotary/start.sh ?

[19-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[19-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The stakes repo is heaps less code, and does not call iguana

[19-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or check chain sync

[19-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just compiles and launches hte chain, and i you specify a config.ini it will import the private key for you.

[19-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just stops people needing to manage multiple branches

[19-Nov-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as everyone complaines about that includeing myself.

[19-Nov-18 10:22 AM] CMaurice#1685
hehe, great, thanks

[19-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I am sure my pubkey is all good - at work currently so can't triple check till later.

[19-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks @Alright looks good pubkey listing

[19-Nov-18 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r Will @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 's chain be added to the test, or at some point in the future?  (Not sure if it's up or that's still in the works.)

[19-Nov-18 11:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If still testing hound on cfek, spamming oracles üòÑ

[19-Nov-18 11:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its still a ways off being ready for public signup.

[19-Nov-18 11:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got the gui mostly done, with username  / pass, and an oracle and R address generated for users after email confirm.

[19-Nov-18 11:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Sounds like a lot of progress!

[19-Nov-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just had an idea i would like to try out here later on after the main chan launch is over ...

[19-Nov-18 04:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we might be able to create a cluster of clustrs ...

[19-Nov-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
although I think the migrates may only be in a single direction for such a thing

[19-Nov-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as importing from one cluster to another would possibly fork something.

[19-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think ther is a way to send coins, from many clusters to a single cluster though.

[19-Nov-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
By including 1 chain from each cluster in another cluster

[19-Nov-18 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have it notarised twice... with diffrent daemons... using diffrent pubkeys.

[19-Nov-18 07:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright confirming that my pubkey is correct üíØ

[19-Nov-18 07:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@Alright  just updated my pubkey via email

[19-Nov-18 07:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
but my address was never funded - not sure if that will mess up  anything

[19-Nov-18 07:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[19-Nov-18 07:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@Alright - confirming Pubkey and R addr.

[19-Nov-18 08:24 PM] jorian#4555
confirmed!

[19-Nov-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what would that accomplish?

[19-Nov-18 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
My pubkey and address are correct @Alright

[20-Nov-18 12:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was just a thought... Maybe it wpyldbt accomplish anything... Has everyone confirmed or supplied new key now?

[20-Nov-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@kmdkrazy  we will fund all the addresses again with enough coins to notaise.

[20-Nov-18 01:18 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm really interested in cluster able to join another cluster.

[20-Nov-18 01:34 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I want to make a chatroom for every coin and have them attached to barterdex/hyperdex - insider trading only  - when you change coins you change rooms ---

[20-Nov-18 01:35 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
get people using the dex for chatting instead of discord

[20-Nov-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That would work but only in native mode üò¶

[20-Nov-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the cluster of clusters actually cant work... maybe I was dreaming when up really late waiting for a compile before I went to bed... I thaught about it, and I dont thing it would work ... The main thing I was thinking about was a cluster is going to hit a cap, where the notariser wouldn't be able to notarise any more chains, not sure what this limit is... but being able to use a diffrent notariser in more layers, would let extreme amount of chains be fungible ... Although after sleeping on it, it makes no actualy sense in reality to do that. ü§£

[20-Nov-18 01:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
small side chains in native would work ----correct?

[20-Nov-18 02:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
LTCchat BTChat - i do not know the math except pre mined chain  120 blcks would be close to spv  -

[20-Nov-18 02:03 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
then go spv if demand is needed

[20-Nov-18 02:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
just guessing from last years math

[20-Nov-18 02:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
side chains was a misuse of words

[20-Nov-18 02:09 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
call them chat chains

[20-Nov-18 02:16 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
kmdchat - make a new room bitches!!! - j/k --- no im not

[20-Nov-18 02:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
going to bed -- please use my name in a response - thank you wankers

[20-Nov-18 03:05 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
ubi-partman failed exit 10 ---- im 6 hou

[20-Nov-18 08:30 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright I have shutdown this node: 18.224.176.46 which is one of the seeds in `StakedNotary/staked.json`. If you want a replacement, can add 104.248.99.160 as this will be my StakedNotary here on

[20-Nov-18 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry guys been tied up trouble shooting new PC and fixing cars all day, likley tomorrow as well, will check the email and confirm all received keys tomorrow if alright hasn't been able to get to it. He's busy working for kmd ATM.

[20-Nov-18 09:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
up and running but still not official notary...waiting for kickoff

[21-Nov-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Update here, Alright wil set the time, I will test what I need to today 100% its the only thing on my list for today apart from migrating all my files to a new pair of 8TB drives on  main PC... So I should have plenty of free time waiting for that to complete.

[21-Nov-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Looking at about a 2 day window here... I think everyone has submitted keys.

[21-Nov-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
again sorry for delays.

[21-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
+48 hours?

[21-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
Anyone have a problem with that?

[21-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
@LabsAssistant

[21-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
see latest pin if you don't know what I'm talking about

[21-Nov-18 04:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Can we make it 54hrs?

[21-Nov-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
+54 isn't good for me, but I'll do it if that's what is best for everyone else

[21-Nov-18 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
think we have a good amount of people in asia and australia

[21-Nov-18 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
so you guys talk it out

[21-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
So the chain will begin in 54h?

[21-Nov-18 04:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm not losing sleep at 48, but wont be home until 52.5. If all it takes is running. /start  no dramas

[21-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
no, @Deleted User

[21-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
it's a test chain to determine who will be first set of mainnet notaries

[21-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
first 20 people to notarize this test chain will get a mainnet spot

[21-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. And this chain starts in 54h?^^

[21-Nov-18 04:15 AM] gt#2812
48 is okay by me

[21-Nov-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
depends on what we agree on

[21-Nov-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
is 54 greentea?

[21-Nov-18 04:16 AM] gt#2812
less preferred but doable

[21-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
Yea same, but let's just say +54 for now

[21-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
let me figure out what that is UTC

[21-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
Friday 10 AM UTC?

[21-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
is that correct?

[21-Nov-18 04:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah 54h suits far better here too

[21-Nov-18 04:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
But if 48h is better for most I ll just be here at 4 am ^^
