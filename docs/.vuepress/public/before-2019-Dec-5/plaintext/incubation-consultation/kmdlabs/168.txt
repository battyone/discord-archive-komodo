I'm keen to extend this oracle stuff to other sensors, recon it's be a good onboarding vector to give KMD exposure within the arduino geek community. They'll tend to be more willing and capable of understanding and playing with the tech via CLI etc.

you should submit the project to hackaday.com

[20-Dec-18 10:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, I've been coding more than writing, but its on my list of tasks

I'm not a fan of hype marketing, and my target audience I recon would prefer a story and schematics

[20-Dec-18 10:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be writing it up on leaflet / map geek forums too

If you do that I know someone who might be  made interested.
His project sounds perfect for something like this.

[20-Dec-18 10:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah for sure, I"m keen to have others test sensors and dashboards

[20-Dec-18 10:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's not really hype. you should check out some of the other projects here https://hackaday.io/?from=had&utm_source=hackaday&utm_medium=menu&utm_campaign=blog

if they have the hardware, I'd be keen to have a chat and see what we can do to display it on browser in a format that is useful for them

[20-Dec-18 10:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nah, hackadays not hype. I meant the ussual twitter spam link you r friends for a token and join all our social media then like me on facebook so I feel validated and then spam it to your firends so you can have another coin

hackaday is a perfect example of what I'm much more interestd in

[20-Dec-18 10:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
overall, I dont want to make $$ reselling hardware kits. I want to create a service that is useful and attracts those who build their own stuff. If staking can pay for oracle read/write operations, there's a gppd foundation for hodlers

[20-Dec-18 10:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
beyond that, I can consult on project ideas and help make dashboards etc.

[20-Dec-18 10:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
wheres the rundown on your project? seems like it merits being pinned to the channel

[20-Dec-18 10:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically, byo hardware, use this DLT to handle data storage, and let me know if you have ideas you're willing to fund seeing happen on how to make the front end look nice

the more use cases people request me to create dashboards for, the more adaptable the overall system gets for everyone down the line.

[20-Dec-18 10:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Seems to be in line with core Komodo philosophy. Tools are there for those willing to pick them up, and the community helps each other find new ways to use them.

It's close to free to use, so anyone is welcome.

nice idea and bootstrap site. I need to get some sites built before I forget how to do it. you getting some signups?

a few, but I"ve only posted the link two or three times, well hidden in the darker corners and without pingning everyone and there dog when I do

[20-Dec-18 10:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Site still needs some content and polish, but back end is functional. I only started writing content last night

[20-Dec-18 10:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think it's wise not to share too much before it's ready. the concept is a really good use case for blockchain. kudos.

thanks, it's validated the proof of concept, but a long way to go adding other sensors and  dashboards

[20-Dec-18 10:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
theres still plenty to test and see how it scales in the wild

[20-Dec-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now it seems that a chain with very heavy oracles txs will bog down hard... so you would need many chains, with smaller block sizes rather than one chain with large blocks... I think this must be a bug or some other issue though, as other CCs liek dice are validating very fast. Full blocks of KMDICE are maybe 1 second to validate. 500tx of oracles takes multiple seconds.

[20-Dec-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be an ordering of tx issue

[20-Dec-18 11:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd anticipated needing a cluster, and can wirte oracles to different chains for different users. probably a good way to segregate different sensor types. Some poll less frequently like soil moisture wouldnt be more than hourly. GPS is set at 5 min, but could be 5 sec if power and data transmit cost isnt an issue. If an enterprise client needed a dedicated chain (with another chain to backup for redundancy) ensuring uptime, that should be doable too.

[20-Dec-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive made the mempool accept the block transactions out of order sucessfully, which sped it up no end, but the block validation is still slow comapred to a full block of KMDICE.

@blackjok3r I'm not sure what was wrong, all I know is that the miner (running 9 threads) wouldn't stop and locked some things up
browser worked, but bash locked up, so did the electron app I was trying to run and xfce4 task manager finally came up after 2 minutes, but was so locked up that it wouldn't even show any info

[21-Dec-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm ok ... this was something I attempeted to fix, all the setgenerate stuff was totally messed up by verus, when they added -mint for staking mode.

[21-Dec-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There was a condition that the staking loop would never exit from its loop on shutdown, thats fixed on latest. But tbh I didnt really test PoW after those changes, as it didnt seem relavent. Did you try to stop it with setgenerate false, or just `cli stop` ?

[21-Dec-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is also every chance that by making the staking loop not lock the daemon, the mining loop could now be screwed ... and maybe the best solution fo rthis is to just do what Verus did and copy the entrie mining function so there is a seperate one for staking, although that is very slopy and hard to maintain, it would allow us to stake and PoW at the same time.

Do you have any more info on your project you could share (website, github etc)?

[21-Dec-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Did you try to stop it with setgenerate false, or just cli stop ?`
Yes, I tried setting false 1st (didn't want to shut daemon down, just free up threads for a few mins) and then tried stop after - neither worked
fwiw, it was the only time it locked; worked before and since, so it's not something specific that I can duplicate
