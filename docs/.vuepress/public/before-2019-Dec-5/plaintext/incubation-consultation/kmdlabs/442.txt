Made some nice progress today. I amlost have automatic CC vout signing working. Very close it seems. 
I also worked out some nice shortcuts that will make making all CCs easier. üòÉ

All works without horrible linker errors. Basically only took the good stuff from VRSC that we can uise without breaking everything. All seems a great improvement so far. Much simpler and easier to follow how things are happening.

Hi,
re:
```discord just went down for a few minutes along with every single websites protected by CloudFlare it seems. That made me wondering if there is any backup plan to communicate if we loose discord?```

I was also wondering about this after getting locked out of Discord.
Imagine the team would. Not sure about NNs.
One of the things that some of the NN pledges will be used for in #kmdlabs will be hardware.  We'll be able to get a server for the site, Etherpad and I've been thinking of a Matrix server or a similar comms net.
Any suggestions on what would be good for a secure backup network would be appreciated.
If anyone is interested in this area I'd love to hear about it.

@CrisF I believe one of Antara's plans is to have an external portal, certainly for devs, but also for the community. I'm sure it would play hand-in-hand in mitigating these sorts of problems

[03-Jul-19 12:21 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool, I'll have a look into that.  Thanks üôè

[03-Jul-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm also interested in something that projects can use to set up meetings etc in. if more security that Discord is needed.

I'm curious but I don't understand, could you explain what does that mean in simple terms ? üòÖ

`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/018f657e6851a037f31369346264477212a50644/src/cc/CCtx.cpp#L27` replaces:
`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/018f657e6851a037f31369346264477212a50644/src/cc/CCtx.cpp#L68` 

What this means is that each ccvout can now be signed individually, with the existing wallet code. 
So a TX can have multiple ccvins or ccvouts ,  meaning that simply ccs can work together much easier, along with things nobody has figured out yet. 
A  lot of this stuff came from @miketout  at VRSC., props to him for making it, taken a few weeks to figure out how to use it, but I think I worked out a few things getting it to work that make a lot of problems much easier to solve.

[03-Jul-19 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That exact CC I am messing with, what it does is:
1) create a tx to global CC address that is unspendable to create a "game" (game could be anything really) 
2) uses the txid of that tx to create a pubkey that nobody has the private key for, this allows other pubkeys to combine with this one to make 1of2 address where tx can be sent and not spent. 
2) We can easily validate  quickly if a pubkey has sent a tx to this 1of2 address , so no other key can send it one, it would just burn the coins and the CC contract would filter it out

[03-Jul-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for voteCC this wil be extremly useful to prevent anyonce voting twice.

OK, I got it guys. Screw D1 for now, daemonising its code is basically impoossible. 
This is my proposal for the first fungible LABS chain. 
-- LottoCC!
--- Someone (anyone) crates a lotto game that expires at some X block height. 
---- Anyone can register to this game only once with some amount of LABS coin. 
---- The total amount received to this "game" is the payout to the winner 
---> The winner is decideded by the first notarized MoMoM hash.,  after the blockheight specified at game creation

this means that no miner can take over the chain and spoof the block hash, because it takes MoM hashes from multiple chains then hashes them to find the winner.

All CCs need to be rewritten to the style joker is talking about IMO

[03-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
it makes signing *so much* easier

[03-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
so we could actually create/sign CC txes via SPV/lite clients without having to code each CC individually

Getting there. Its slow going writeing things from scratch. I do like the way its coming together though. Will have something to work with in a few hours I think. I have create game and the list working. 
Best part is I have the vouts easily identifiable and some validation built in which will make validation much simpler.

Getting there. This is fully using Verus Enhanced CCs Although I changed them a fair bit so they work for komodo CCs better. Verus still lacks ANY validation code in it PBASS so I have no example of how they hope to acheive valdiation so I wrote my own solution. Quite happy how it turned out so far. I think it works even if people mess with things but as usual I need people to try and break it to make sure. 
May need to start a chain soon, as I need MoMoM hash's, although using a simple block hash for now may suffice to get it working.

Hi @vogelfreund88 üëã
As others have said LABS coin is used for all kinds of testing.  
For example if you wanted to test parameters for creating your own coin you could use LABS to set up your own tests.
If you would like others to test for you, you could use LABS to pay bug hunting bounties.

Be good to revive it long enough to get funds off.

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For lotto testing the chain will have mental supply, I'm mostly.worried about integer overflows in the math calculations and may need to convert it to big num like paymentscc uses.

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] CMaurice#1685
hehe, why are such large numbers required?

[05-Jul-19 09:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because we cannot control what the supply of a chain will be, so we must account for the very largest outlier... Overflows in consensus code is very veryy bad, allows printing of free coins if exploited correctly. But at first I need to get my algo for selecting winner tuned correctly. So far from testing, a node with only 20% chance of winning never wins... Hut maybe sample.size was too small.

[05-Jul-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Your lotto.numbers are derived from the pubkey directly. So to test properly we need thousands of pub keys to register a bet

[05-Jul-19 09:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
because supply related to number lottery tickets, I presume.
Anyhoo, out for manual labour now, have a good break when it comes @blackjok3r

Got close, ran out of day, doesnt work atm. I overlooked the fact that once the first withdraw has been made, then the result can no longer be calculated. 
Lucky I created the withdraw object, which can be used to send an extra vout to the game when the first withdraw is made that contains the result, this can be validated on the first withdraw, and then each withdraw after that must send this object back to the game, allowing the next withdraw. This removes the need to look up every single bet tx on disk every time a withdraw is made. I think. ü§û
