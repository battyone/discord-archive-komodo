also pushed fix for ntoarypay miner. @Alright  can you update and try to mine normall please and see if it clears out mempool... I have 4 connections on the chain and 605 blocks with last notarized at 430

[15-Feb-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this was with a half fresh sync from a crashed node... about to try clean sync

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
just cpu mine?

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
diff is over 3000

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cou;dnt find anyt blocks with CPU

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] Alright#0419
yea sorry about that üòÖ

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
chain syncs just fine though

[15-Feb-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and bug was stupid.... the `lastnotarized_height` wwas being set inside an IF that never got triggered ü§¶

[15-Feb-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the attack still ruins the chaiun but it can  no longer fork it at least. Which was my goal.

[15-Feb-19 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok updating my ntoary also now. It looks like everything is finally working. Well notaries can not get paid, if a miner reorgs all the notarisation out of the chain.... but really what can you do about that? Doesnt seem a solvable problem. And toi be frank, I'm not going to even try and solve it. The chain cannot be forked anymore. Its ready to be used.

[15-Feb-19 09:31 AM] Alright#0419
Any % POS would make it significantly harder

[15-Feb-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my point exactly

[15-Feb-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is about a good as we can do it... wihtout some extremaly complicated solution that is definatly out of my set of skills to engineeer.

[15-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
@dimxy if you need coins you should be able to CPU mine them. If you need a lot, I'll send you the premine

[15-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
DIMXY1 notarized btw

[15-Feb-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. mine is waitingon KMD to load maybe 30mins and it will join you guys. Im out of here for now. Caqn be reached on discord if anything is needed super importantly

[15-Feb-19 09:43 AM] dimxy#2587
@Alright  build on Debian also was okay (sorry)
seems its was just out of disk space

[15-Feb-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419
Took just about an hour to get that running :shexy:

[15-Feb-19 09:45 AM] Alright#0419

How do I split funds when I have this message?```./utxosplitter.sh CFEKULTRADEAD
[CFEKULTRADEAD] Listuspent call failed aborting!```

[15-Feb-19 07:41 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Yeah, deadlock. Get balance shows funds, but no funds are unlocked.

[15-Feb-19 07:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
I thought I was the only one üòâ

`Yeah, deadlock.`
I can't imagine why üôÑ

well, the 1st 1/2 of that was aimed at @Alright and his mini üòõ

[16-Feb-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is why u don't make chains using equihash without PoS%

[16-Feb-19 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They break hard

[16-Feb-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its kind of difficult to know if my fix worked if no blocks have even happened lol

[16-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Alright#0419
is it still like that?

[16-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Alright#0419
Can fix it in a few minutes if so

[16-Feb-19 05:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Hi, Not sure if it's the same as spoken about above, but I haven't had a CFEKULTRADEAD notarization yet.  Re-staarted a few times and will update again now.

[16-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Alright#0419
same thing, thanks though

[16-Feb-19 05:21 AM] CrisF#3405
What is happening with it?

[16-Feb-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
I left a mini on it while I was reading jl and joker's convo yesterday

[16-Feb-19 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
ie diff is fucked

[16-Feb-19 05:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh.  This means that someone is notarizing though doesn't it?```>>>>>>>>>>> CFEKULTRADEAD dpow_sendrawtransaction (851443c3c28dd8e07e8d3d196bcc6a6e010596ee78075c16275af81588fab7c9)

[16-Feb-19 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Or is that different?

[16-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
not sure, look at what the tx is

[16-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
is it a notarization?

[16-Feb-19 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
iguana output is largely a mystery to me üòõ

[16-Feb-19 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I set up a vm on my server to stake the chains, need to launch another try at test of main chain. I'll be home in couple of hours to do that

[16-Feb-19 05:34 AM] Alright#0419
Do we need ULTRADEAD undead?

[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
also @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator did you still need a chain

[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
if we're starting another may as well make smk his as well

[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] Alright#0419
just not sure what exactly he needed

[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure I think it served it purpose

[16-Feb-19 05:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm still running ORKL, haven't made a new one

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We should attempt a test at launch

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Leave dixmys cluster running aswell

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In case it fails

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] Alright#0419
needs to be well thought out, let me pull up my old notes

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] Alright#0419
definitely some things that changed

[16-Feb-19 05:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep

[16-Feb-19 05:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not critical to add to LABS just yet, but if you're updating I can. Oracles dont need notarisations as far as I recall, but sure cant hurt

[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
LABSTORKL?

[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
if you're going to add to the cluster, I'd say we make a new branch that is the same as current master

[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
then use that in assetchains.json

[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] Alright#0419
so we don't kill it with the next bug fix

[16-Feb-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds like a good idea yes

[16-Feb-19 05:39 AM] Alright#0419
joker what is the difference between LABS and CFEK again?

[16-Feb-19 05:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm using cc_id 762, and will likely add to cluster when in production, though thats a way oof

[16-Feb-19 05:39 AM] Alright#0419
the is_STAKED = 1,2,3,4 thing

[16-Feb-19 05:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got a game idea via oracles too, which if I get some time to work on, I'd like to run trhough LABS

üëç

[16-Feb-19 05:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically its a map based territory capture game, precursor to civ clone for later on

[16-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Alright#0419
my first project after launch will be linking this discord channel to an oracle/trollbox room

[16-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Alright#0419
I love me some civ

[16-Feb-19 05:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
civ  = meditation.

[16-Feb-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Streamer here for the meta chain. And hopefully a video streaming app

[16-Feb-19 05:42 AM] Alright#0419
meditation until it turns into crying or a power trip

[16-Feb-19 05:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
meditation for meglomaniacs üòÇ

[16-Feb-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol

[16-Feb-19 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
I think oracles will be good for centralized games

[16-Feb-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have it but never actually played it lol

[16-Feb-19 05:43 AM] Alright#0419
I imagine most game devs will want some degree of control over their games

[16-Feb-19 05:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
turn based games are a natural fit via block progression/notarisations

[16-Feb-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
could probably easily port IRC/discord bots to trollbox for quick PoC of oracle games

[16-Feb-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going yo be so mad to fi ally use this thing

[16-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Alright#0419
üòÉ

[16-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Alright#0419
going to be simple as well

[16-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Alright#0419
shit man adding those dimxy chains made me realize just how much we dumbed down the process

[16-Feb-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its great when its working üòÇ

[16-Feb-19 05:48 AM] Alright#0419
stop breaking it

[16-Feb-19 05:48 AM] Alright#0419

[16-Feb-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Rofl

[16-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
do we need ULTRADEAD unstuck or just new chains

[16-Feb-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
New

[16-Feb-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That proved the attack can't fork the chain any longer so we don't need it.... Although having a chain called ultra dead that lives itnquite hilarious

[16-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
well I'm not sure I did it all that successfully on that chain

[16-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
most I was able to censor was 2 notarizations at a time

[16-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
previous chains, I had censored them for hours

[16-Feb-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There were 0 notarizations for over 200 blocks it worked just fine

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Alright#0419
that is because of constant reorg

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Alright#0419
them never agreeing

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Alright#0419
I found that very strange

[16-Feb-19 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well actually there were only no nota on fresh sync the online nodes still had checkpoints
