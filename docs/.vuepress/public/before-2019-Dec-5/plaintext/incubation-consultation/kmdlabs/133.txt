What kind of stats do you need?

[27-Nov-18 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
I'll do it with python and write it to oracles

[27-Nov-18 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
make it OSS so people can verify

[27-Nov-18 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
Not to go off on a tangent, but if we have an immutable source of data, we can have multiple websites to interpret that same consensus based immutable data

[27-Nov-18 03:31 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
BTW there is no I in team - you could fix it without much work, math or programming - I am going to bed - I wish you both a great day

webserver to host on chain data

[27-Nov-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
all data from site on chain

[27-Nov-18 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
web's stat site is the perfect example of this

[27-Nov-18 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy fix what?

[27-Nov-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The current stats website, just pulls on chain data into a data base

[27-Nov-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the website reads that

[27-Nov-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BUT it does not decode OP_RETURN for MoMoM notarisations ... comes out garbled

[27-Nov-18 03:35 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, that's my point. We can do that with any on chain data

[27-Nov-18 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
and we can put any data on chain via oracles.....

[27-Nov-18 03:36 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
i thought you work on making the playing field even - maybe I mis read  - like I said it is late here - and it is sleep time

Imagine a facebook or reddit that can be hosted client side if you like

[27-Nov-18 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
or just trust someone's hosted dapp if you like

[27-Nov-18 03:37 AM] Alright#0419
@kmdkrazy plan is to make level playing field for notaires, yes

[27-Nov-18 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
not an easy task to accomplish *at all*, but if we can do it, regions/ping/DCs are irrelevant

[27-Nov-18 03:40 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I had a concept a year or so ago about a blockchain thing that uses existting tech mixed with KMD tech "KVM"  - but i will have to sleep on it to remember -   I wanted to store ALL of Barterdex Data in KVM instead of localhost

I'll add a ccid check for mograte script when I get home

[27-Nov-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the ccid is in getinfo ... should be relatively easy

[27-Nov-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your script is the best we have as far as one for people to actually use

[27-Nov-18 04:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
last statement - you could insert tails on USB and have Bdex running  and all orders are on KVM - -- one  seed - all of the work - no down time

If you really want to limit a single nodes ability to notarize, place a time limit per pubkey noatization in the check code

Which P2P port (or daemon) is most influential on notarisation - the individual chain or KMD? (or iguana)

[27-Nov-18 06:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just do sendrawtransaction of the hex it printed as a fail.

ahh no worries.. whenever you can do it man.. no worries

[27-Nov-18 06:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could just be a chain stall... or there is some other problem ... i did 5000 migrates in a row 2 times on LF before ..

All good man, as long as we have a script that works for migrating coins easily.

@Nabob  its KMD, the chain using too much RAM or iguna or, one of the CFEK chains? 
I had komodo crash on me a few times on a 4gb VPS.

[27-Nov-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
couldnt really pin it down, what si was, as 8GB ram, nevre used more than 4GB.

[27-Nov-18 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I also had issues until adding swap space and bootstrapping.

[27-Nov-18 09:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Same ðŸ‘†

[27-Nov-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would advise 8GB total ram, 4gb actual and 4gb swap if you want to do it cheap.

Hi @LabsAssistant ,
Proposal for a KMDLabs project, a new chain and a possible test.
It's not something I can do myself.  Snowed under with some other Labs stuff and don't have the time to learn the new skills right now.  And I'd need to learn a lot, haha.

KMDLabs  --  Project, Chain & Bounty Test Proposal  --  2018-11-27...
https://pastebin.com/i/facebook.png

[27-Nov-18 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Project is basically a script that can be added to testing scripts that collects data from the tests and puts it onto a new KMDLabs chain.  And a method for getting the data off-chain and into stats/reporting programs. 
The chain would be  specifically for logging and statistical data collected in the Labs.
This project might be a good trial for the bounty system.
Usecases are many.  Like the upcoming migration stress test.

[27-Nov-18 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
We were discussing before real-life test projects for devs to get experience with CC and KMD tech.
Here's one  ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I like that idea in general .. I htink it would leverage a lot of smks work on DraginHound ?

[27-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to save doing things twice

[27-Nov-18 09:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, for sure.  This, and/or early projects like it, are the definitely the start of the synergy building.  
As these projects get rolling the crossover will be enormous!

[27-Nov-18 09:50 AM] CrisF#3405
The power of clusters is phenomenal.  KMDLabs is a cluster of people as well as tech.

[27-Nov-18 09:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the bones of dragonhound can capture and summon most any data into and off n oracle, and also encrypts it so what is stored can only be read by keyholders.

@CMaurice could you get in touch with @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator?  He's a genius at this sort of thing from what I've seen from the scaling stats site!

[27-Nov-18 10:27 AM] CrisF#3405
There will hopefully be some others who can help out, too!

@Alright ht @blackjok3r FYI:  My `DUCKS` froze up during a `sendmany` on staking node.  Wouldn't accept RPC.  `./assets-cli stop` and `./asset-cli CFEKLAMEDUCKS stop` returned no RPC.  `pkill -15 komodod` and `pkill-9 komodod` certainly killed komodod but not `DUCKS` (not really sure if it should have).
Rebooted and now accepting RPC.
