lol stupid diff wall... cant find any blocks 😂

[16-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blocked and eceived reward as it should have... only guess is that you dont have the latest. Let me know if its still broken please and I can try investigate further. @Bar_F1sh_Rel

@blackjok3r and @Alright Sorry for the"ddos attack" 2 or 3 days ago, I have lost my logs since I overwrite them when restart 😒

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
heh no worries

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
do you have any idea why that happened?

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I  fixed that

[16-Feb-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was my fault

[16-Feb-19 11:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the dwy-mitigation script was doing it

[16-Feb-19 11:30 AM] zatJUM#9924
Yes it matches with the time I run it with cron 😉

[16-Feb-19 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I was stuffing around with it ages ago, and forgot to push a change lol

[16-Feb-19 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it probably made a crazy amount of txns lol

just sent to self until it could no longer do it... either by running out of coins or too many spent in mempool

[16-Feb-19 11:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
ok

[16-Feb-19 12:18 PM] CMaurice#1685
can we mine or stake on NN?

[16-Feb-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
you can mine

[16-Feb-19 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
you can also stake.

[16-Feb-19 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have enough resources

[16-Feb-19 01:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@blackjok3r  is what's mined on this chain going to be airdropped to the live launch chain?

[16-Feb-19 01:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

wtb STAKED4 for LABSTH  :troll:

[16-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
there's about ~17k that were in CC addresses at the time of STAKED4 snapshot that is likely to not be included in airdrop

[16-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
they would be unspendable anyway

_needs to start a database to manage his wallet databases_

[16-Feb-19 01:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I made a cli thing last year to get wallet addresses from a db table, get balance and value from apis and print to console

[16-Feb-19 01:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
one of the apis broke though, so now I forget what I have and where it is

[16-Feb-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I nearly broke my brain when I once sat down and tried to calculate how many addresses I've created

[16-Feb-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
used is a much smaller number, but it's mind-boggling the number of addresses we create over time with all this testing and dumping dat files

[16-Feb-19 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol I just delete them all the time... Or reuse the same keys over and over

[16-Feb-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, but you don't reuse *all* of them (it's not like you fire it up and a single addy is created)

[16-Feb-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short of carrying the same dat file, you're creating more each time

[16-Feb-19 10:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah true it does generate a lot of addresses on startup

[16-Feb-19 10:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I will be donating some of my airdropped coins to a few people, so u will get some at launch ;) 
Thanks for everyone who has supported this project and helped out. Its been an unexpectedly long project, but we seem to be so close now. Its exciting times guys!

[17-Feb-19 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well ive checked it out. From what I can see everything is working great. Notaries are getting 3.75 coins per notarization @ 4 notaries. This obviously seems very high but 4 notaries is very low.  We should use 6 min sigs for launch at least, although as long as notarizations are distributed reasonably fairly, the total amount earn't per notary will even out, no matter what amount of notaries are participating in each notarization.

[17-Feb-19 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Using a larger number of minsigs, forces more nodes to participate regadless of their location, so by using 6 rather than 4, it will spread the payments more fairly.

[17-Feb-19 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think to know for certain though we need a proper stats script. If someone can sort this for LABSTH that would be great. Simply loop the coinbases and count how many times each notary is paid. This will give a tally of how many notarisations they participated in. Should be farily simple.

[17-Feb-19 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we cna get some numbers at 4 minsigs when I launch a 0BR chain to test those and migrates in a couple of days we can increase minsigs and see what effect it has. 😃

[17-Feb-19 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless something breaks or major bugs are found, its just a matter of getting coin emission decided and we can luanch the main chain. I have a few things to sort out fo r 0BR but the are not anyhting major, mostly need a way to make sure that the entire chain wont stop if a single staking node goes down, the stakig weight needs to be spread over either a few nodes or all notary nodes. I think I know how to do this, but not 100% aure how hard it will be or how long it may take, definatly isnt as hard as notary payment mechanisim though... So doubtful it will take weeks. We dont need this for launch right away tough. So it wont cause any delays there.

[17-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r I have the basis for this script already

[17-Feb-19 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool.

[17-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
believe I posted it here before, should I touch it up so it's output is pretty?

[17-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
the problem when I made it is that we still had chains that were not ac_notarypay

[17-Feb-19 02:53 AM] Alright#0419
so I didn't want to write exceptions for the old chains in the stats script

[17-Feb-19 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think bar fish mentioned something about one as well, we need it to make sure notary pay isn't being concentrated on a small group of nodes.

[17-Feb-19 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It shouldn't be, but if it is just using more sigswill fix it

[17-Feb-19 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
More sigs is better anyway.... As long as there is enough nodes online that is

[17-Feb-19 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
changing sigs is a hardfork, yes?

[17-Feb-19 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
or can you add to it just not subtract?

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U can I crease it with override minsigs in the daemon, it only increases on iguana side so its just a restart required for all nodes at the same time

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No change needed to any code

[17-Feb-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Daemon consensus wise

[17-Feb-19 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Number of pubkeys /5 +1 is the min .. It can be increased over this, but not lowered under it, with no issues

[17-Feb-19 03:25 AM] Alright#0419
Do we needs stats for CFEK chains?

[17-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
basically just wondering if I clean up this script, do I need to code exceptions for chains without ac_notarypay

[17-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Alright#0419
or can they be ignored

Yes @Alright just count notary pay, as all chains will use it

pushed stats.py to StakedNotary

[17-Feb-19 06:49 AM] Alright#0419
could someone run it and tell me what dependencies it needs? 
I think it's just
```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install python-bitcoinlib slick-bitcoinrpc
```
but I could be missing something

[17-Feb-19 06:50 AM] Alright#0419
right now it does a single user specified chain. Remind me when we add another ac_notarypay chain, and I'll touch it up

[17-Feb-19 07:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Just a quick note. Ran some migrates last night between dimx's - but got stuck at the rebroadcast dest with "no mom data" hoping it was just slow chain's but didn't have time to look at it.

[17-Feb-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Alright, Stats script worked for me.

[17-Feb-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405

[17-Feb-19 10:14 AM] CrisF#3405

have you wallet cleaned kmd?

[17-Feb-19 10:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Haven't cleaned on these new chains as not a lot of action.  Will do now.

[17-Feb-19 10:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, there was a mess in the KMD wallet.

[17-Feb-19 10:18 AM] CrisF#3405

Perhaps you should rm your wallet and import your key in a new one?
