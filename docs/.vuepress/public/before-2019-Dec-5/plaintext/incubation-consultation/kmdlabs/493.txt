@Mylo ok with you if i setup the potential labs notary node (vps) on one of pirate's nn servers? i have plenty space left

I thought you were raffling the notary spots but I think I misunderstood

Its the notary spots for LABSNN not KMD NN

Or start a new chain from block 0 😛 Or just add apow!

@phm87 https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX has binance deposit/withdraw, but havent implemented auto making binance orders. Does have a few mm2 options tho and can put orders on atomicdex automatically for selected coins based on binance/coingecko api prices + premium. 
Binance API lib has unused functions for making orders so feel free to have a play - https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX/blob/master/lib/binance_api.py#L85.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is that like cipi’s perl script?
I’m writing an article on mm2 integration.  If yours is, I’ll check it out and include - I ported cipi’s thing to nodejs before the makerbot project so I had something to write a front end to whilst there was a gap.

TI(re)L the LABS is a fungible cluster

[23-Oct-19 09:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Questions:
1) Is there a publicly available mining pool?
2) Does anyone run a subset of all the chains?
3) Is (2) possible?

[23-Oct-19 09:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure how similar to cipis script tbh. Mine is tui based, though the bot can be run via a command line param `./mm2_tui.py runbot`. There is some setup involved for setting coins,  buy/sell flags and premium.

[23-Oct-19 09:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
labs primary mining pool is run by CG at http://mininglabs.rocks

[23-Oct-19 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
LABS acts like KMD to notarise the testchains, which may or may not be fungible with each other.

[23-Oct-19 09:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
test chains are not fungible with LABS

[23-Oct-19 09:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
migration/fungibility requires a dPoW layer for the burn/create, which is what LABS chain manages

[23-Oct-19 09:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all LABS notaries (should) run all active test chains

[23-Oct-19 10:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
telstra, but only because I had a similar issue which had to be reffered to TIO on an iinet service previously.

[23-Oct-19 10:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still on the fkn phone. they cant even run a line test because someone put both services on one address. now one address is awaiting reconnection in a few days, and the other address has to wait for this to happen before they can run a line test and troubleshoot. Useless!

[23-Oct-19 10:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Jesus. Yeah I haven't been with telstra in ages, was never a fan of them

[23-Oct-19 10:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
me neither. leaving iinet for them was an extreme and only done expecting a stable connection. I even paid for a 3rd party to have the wiring in my house redone. This issue is completely a botched service provision on their end with my mum changing plans. I'm fkn livid.

[23-Oct-19 10:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
3 hours on the phone, and all I got was platitudes and a 10GB mobile internet bonus. Told them that would last me 12 hours and I'll be calling back for more each time it runs out until the next billing cycle.

@jl777c  Sorry this prob isn't the correct channel, but I just had a thought. Didn't the original BTCD wallet have the Coin Control code built in for the old staking method? Is that anywhere in the Komodo ecosystem anymore?

[23-Oct-19 06:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thinking that UI would be awfully useful for staking in AGAMA

[23-Oct-19 07:01 PM] SHossain#0007

We have so far funded ourselvs. The notarization fund is there, but its a multisig, and a PITA to send out. @Alright  is in charge of that.

I started with 10 and threw my mining interest rewards at it once (just because I could)

[24-Oct-19 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably something worth doing each time we have a vote lottery, send enough to last until the next round.

[24-Oct-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've had mixed feelings about it from the beginning
What does the project get out of funding the notaries that get paid on top of the "free" coins that they get to do the job?
Obviously ACs need to be funded by the AC, but where's the value in also funding KMD?

[24-Oct-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw: I also had this same thought about Komodo funding NNs' BTC amounts

[24-Oct-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[24-Oct-19 01:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
I use my rewards to fund my NN KMDLabs address, but if notarization fund is not used for that, what is it for?

[24-Oct-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its for notarizations, the multi sig holders can change that if they all agree... But I would err on the side of keeping the funding to acrue rewards and pay notarization fee s with it, because thats what peopel donated it for. Cant really take the money then use it for something else?

[24-Oct-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wasn't saying use designated donations for something else, just that the concept has boggled me since the beginning 😛

[24-Oct-19 01:14 PM] zatJUM#9924

We dont need to use rewards, its just a good way to fund it for a long time... I didnt really have any input to that aspect of the project. Wasnt even going to have a key in the multisig.

[24-Oct-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has no keys for anything and enjoys not having the burden 🙃_

[24-Oct-19 01:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Been using my own KMD from the start too... was wondering what the fund was supposed to do. Thought it was feeding other contracts etc.

[24-Oct-19 01:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Maybe it should send a small fund to each NN automatically after each lottery to fund the winners and the operators till next lottery.

[24-Oct-19 01:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
Also TY @SHossain i checked out KomodoOcean and the coin control worked exactly as I remembered.

How many of us are using whitelist and wouldn't see the funds anyway?

[24-Oct-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or am I the only one?

[24-Oct-19 02:05 PM] zatJUM#9924
Everyone can add a whitelist param with the multisig address, where is the problem?

[24-Oct-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
didn't say it was a "problem"
was just curious how many would need to

[24-Oct-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a diffrent wallet filter in my FSM branch of komodo, that is fully controllable with RPCs, also with `rescanfromheight` I think that you could  add an address, then do a rescan, to receive funds, after they were sent, while still having the filter on full lock down, but someone will need to check that 😅

[24-Oct-19 02:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Does checking mean I can blast something with the **txBlaster**?!

[24-Oct-19 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm maybe... I dont think that is needed though, sending 1 tx will be enough to know if it would work. @phm87  maybe it was, asked me to add a stop rescan at some height, its in LABS already, but I dont know the repercussions of using it, I guess if it stopped before tip, and something goes wrong, a full rescan would fix it anyway.

[24-Oct-19 02:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Interesting.  What would that be used for?

[24-Oct-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@zatJUM because no one has asked I guess 😅

[24-Oct-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like I assume, that you filter everything, someone sends you coins, you add the address to whitelist, then rescan a block range the tx was in,

[24-Oct-19 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case, wallet filter isnt really needed anymore... utxo cache latets version seems to be working very well, and wallets can be ridiculous in size without affecting preformance.

[24-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
after the lottery sounds like a plan, will need to calc about the right amount for 2 months
