you're putting way too much faith in the idea that no one is going to spend money for the sole purpose of being a dick

[15-Feb-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they gain no finacial benefit from it

[15-Feb-19 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
financial gain is not the sole reason people in this world do dumb shit

[15-Feb-19 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
some are just dicks because they can be

[15-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as its expensive for them to do it for extended periids of time it should be fine.... This is a problem for all dpow coins (hell ann  pow coins for that matter)

[15-Feb-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but cant this can be detected and the payouts done differently?

[15-Feb-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
only a limited number of candiates who benefit from this, right?

[15-Feb-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no.... the only way to pay notaries is whne a notarisation is in a block the coinbase pays them... I expeimiented with all diffrent kinds of stuff. this is all that works

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
why?

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
why not offset it

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tried offset

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even more prone to errors

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
one hour offset?

[15-Feb-19 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
my main issue is that if some dick decided to roll back every other notarization, then we're all left with 50% income **and** a feked chain

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie you cant do that tho

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if 60 blocks ago had a notarization, the coinbase for the next block is invalid unless it has a payout

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dpow is still tehre

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can only reorg in a very small window

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
better, combine it so 60 blocks ago with 2+ notarizations

[15-Feb-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so we have 2 notarizations protecting the 60 blocks ago

[15-Feb-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
then it cant be reorged and next block is guaranteed to be in consensus with payout

[15-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is starting to get directly to more compicated than what works james

[15-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry

[15-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught about this... the notarized checkpoint cannot be used

[15-Feb-19 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so then you need to track every noptarisation

[15-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and which block  its in

[15-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which with reorgs

[15-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cosntantly is moving around

[15-Feb-19 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless i use the MoMoM DB 游뱂

[15-Feb-19 07:56 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`it can only reorg in a very small window`
If I can roll back 1 notarization 3 blocks back, what stops me from doing the 2nd that's 13 back?

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as soon as its confirmed once

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the checkpoint exists

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt be that hard to track prev_notarization_height

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that number cannot be sued

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`as soon as its confirmed once
the checkpoint exists`
confirmed by what?

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as on resync it can be left out odf the chain

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried this

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i see...

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I added the last 5 previous notarized heights

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to komodo_state

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but once a reorg happens from thsi attack

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on a resync one of those numbers is gone

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and whatever you use for consensus

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
based on them is now invalid

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the chain can never sync

[15-Feb-19 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can only be based on the tx itself

[15-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the checkpoint cannot be used... unless we use GetTransaction to confirm its actually in the chain before using it

[15-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and well while possibl, if I could avoid that and keep it simple.. I wanted to try that first

[15-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I feel we are very close to a wokring soluion here that is immune to forks

[15-Feb-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
GetTransaction to make sure it is notarized twice, for mining, but for consensus a single notarization

[15-Feb-19 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
does that solution involve removing:
`ERROR: ConnectBlock(): Notarization is not in TX position 1 or block contains more than 1 notarization! Invalid Block!`
?

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its is not immune to some diuck iner preventing dpow form working an ntoaris being paid... but with enough hashrate./stakers that problem just goes away.

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It invlves stopping it from happening

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a buig in the miner

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
k

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so consensus would accept 1 notarization in last 60 blocks, but the mining would require 2 in last 60

[15-Feb-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so the consensus rule would allow, but not require a payout

[15-Feb-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
even on resync, with the 2 notarizations on mining, we get at least 1 regardless of reorgs, so payout would still be valid, right?

[15-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really sure... I think having each block be its own consensus is much simpler and and is totally immine from all forking problems

[15-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is really all I am worried about

[15-Feb-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the 0BR chainsm, will need some other solution most likley but wer do not need that to launch LABS

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS itself with 50-% PoS and hopefulyl a decent hash rate on PoW is immune to this attack anyway

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
` I think having each block be its own consensus is much simpler `
somehow, nothing about that sounds simple to me

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why?

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if a block ahs a notarisations in it

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries are paid

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
游뱡

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant get much simpler

[15-Feb-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, payout is simpler

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but the censorship attack can prevent payouts

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess nobody gets payouts in such an attack?

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
problem is limiting it to just a single one per block.... Ity onyl takes a single honest miner/staker to eventally clear this attack I hink

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless they have unlimited recources

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and continue it forever

[15-Feb-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an interesting problem.

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what happens to the deded payments?

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very much so ... it has really destroyed my brain

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notarisations will sit in the mempool

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until an nhonest miner mines them

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then they will be paid out

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
Can you try the logic of miners requiring 2 notarizations but consensus accepting just 1 and not making payout mandatory

[15-Feb-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then miners can just not pay us anyway

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this has been the hardest thing to solve for me.

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
aligning the miner code and the consensus so that changing the miner code

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
breaks conesnsus and wont let the miner do it

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I neded up haveing to write validation first.. then get a miner that follows it

[15-Feb-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the consensus needs to be a bit more lenient

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is extremly problematic to test

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and very time consuming lol

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but i wonder if the miner can mine things to create forks...

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that is the problem

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, he could mine with just 1 notarization

[15-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it gets accepted , then wipes it out

[15-Feb-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
conesnsus needs to be strong enough that the miner cannot change the ode in the miner and mine any valid blocks at all

[15-Feb-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
wont resync...

[15-Feb-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this works... I ust need to fix how it is selecting the ntoarisations... I was lazy and left a whole bunch of extra code in there that may need to be removed... needs to be more simple.

[15-Feb-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
very tricky problem

[15-Feb-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it has been 游땎

[15-Feb-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly not as easy as the idea that was put fourth

[15-Feb-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
things are usually 1000x more difficult than it sounds when it comes to consensus
