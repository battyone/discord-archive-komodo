idk weird

[30-Jun-19 03:36 AM] smellycouch#3071
hey there, sorry looks like I'm interupting.    just wondering what would cause kvsearch to miss the first character of the key value.   Notice "fooar" above

[30-Jun-19 03:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Not interupting @smellycouch Someone might be around and able to help.  A bit above my level atm.

[30-Jun-19 03:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Exile13 ,you might need to send to self to make utxos if they are all staked/earned ones.

[30-Jun-19 03:40 AM] Exile13#4458
theres 138 in there?

[30-Jun-19 03:40 AM] CrisF#3405
The won't be usable if they are staked/earned until you send them to self.

[30-Jun-19 03:41 AM] Exile13#4458
oh

[30-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Exile13#4458
sent 5 to myself

[30-Jun-19 03:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Then when they arrive, split then.

[30-Jun-19 03:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully that'll be enough.

[30-Jun-19 03:44 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@smellycouch  `komodo-cli help kvupdate` gives me 
`...This feature is only available for asset chains`. Same for `kvsearch` 
May be that's the reason why ?

[30-Jun-19 03:55 AM] smellycouch#3071
@PHBA2061   thanks, yeah I was trying to understand how it was disabled,   so I re-enabled it.  or so I thought.    I won't put junk on the main chain or anything, I'm just looking to understand better.   it does the notarizations correctly  kvupdate works.

[30-Jun-19 03:56 AM] smellycouch#3071
but kvsearch, not so much

[30-Jun-19 03:56 AM] smellycouch#3071
so basicaly, i reversed this commit:

[30-Jun-19 04:02 AM] PHBA2061#2530
probably best way to understand it is to ask James directly in #ask-jl777 
interesting commands btw, never knew they exist

oh ok, fair enough...  I'll take it easy on him I bugged just a few hours ago lol

[30-Jun-19 04:03 AM] smellycouch#3071
thank you

[30-Jun-19 04:03 AM] smellycouch#3071
i think it's something in hash_find but I'm not sure

[30-Jun-19 04:04 AM] smellycouch#3071
they really are very cool commands, you can do all sorts of interesting key storage or even build chat apps like I see @Alright  already did.

[30-Jun-19 04:04 AM] smellycouch#3071
but kinda bloaty

[30-Jun-19 04:05 AM] smellycouch#3071
so I understand why it's disabled on main chain

[30-Jun-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
should work just fine @smellycouch

[30-Jun-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
not consensus

[30-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
KV didnt have RAM usages optimized, that was the main reason it is disabled on KMD

[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
WTT my 30k LABS for 1 BTC

[30-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
0.0003 Btc per/2.6 KMD per labs at todays prices, good luck lol I've been slowly buying for less than 0.1 KMD per,  sizeable bag as well

[30-Jun-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`buying for less than 0.1 KMD per`
If LABS were to wither, die, and I was the only miner/staker left, I still wouldn't sell that low

{Reactions}
👆 (2) 

[30-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Exact reason im buying that low, however graviex has had literally 0 buying on the KMD pair for weeks just me abusing what I can assume is arb bots to get cheap LABS

[30-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Id sell my stack for 0.5/1 KMD per 2.6 is nutty

[30-Jun-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's only "nutty" if you prefer to not stake
If you prefer to have a solid passive income, then you want them before I properly split

[30-Jun-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is **heavily** invested and has been trying to let others "catch up"_

[30-Jun-19 03:44 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I will admit that I cannot, for the life of me figure out CLI, pos64staker. I should be staking I'm just the perfect example of someone who's technical capabilities are Verus Agama's "start staking" button

[30-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I understand enough to realize what this team is doing is next level, even for KMD standards, but cannot fully grasp it

[30-Jun-19 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "start staking" button is the same as issuing the `setgenerate true 0` command and nothing more
splitting across all segments, or even specific ones, is much more efficient than that button
more work from you gives you more rewards

[30-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
So that would explain the rich list containing like 5 bulk addys and the other 95 being different groups of the same number, someone splitting their stack to maximize their chance of hitting a block reward

[30-Jun-19 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[30-Jun-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
each new block a random segid is picked and addresses in that segment get "first crack at it", then each other segment gets a time delayed "chance" (in simple terms)

[30-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I knew enough to split my verus stack into like 10 addys but it seems some people go upwards of like 50, true potential of staking

[30-Jun-19 03:55 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I'd pay a small bounty for someone to put together a doc detailing how to start staking labs

[30-Jun-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
64 addys (one in each segment) is generally best

[30-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
verus staking uses an entirely separate algo, splitting on VRSC likely helps to some extent, but the strategy of it compared to pos64(LABS's staking algo) differs drastically

[30-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
pos64 very much rewards the people willing to put in the time to think about the strategy of it, verus staking much less so

[30-Jun-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true, I was over-generalizing for the sake of trying to keep it less technical 😛

[30-Jun-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, 🛀🏽 time....

[30-Jun-19 07:34 PM] smellycouch#3071
@Alright @jl777c   thank you, I'll keep trying.   maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.  studied kvsearch all last night, I'll debug kvupdate and see what's up there

[01-Jul-19 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`https://github.com/blackjok3rtt2/devilutionX` 
I just got this working with a deterministic seed so that the same game is generated with the same items. Not sure if I can actaully make it work like rogue did or not. But this looks decently promising. Diablo 1 on blockchain 😄

[01-Jul-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I thaught it was pretty cool. Hopefully I can make something work. I do love Diablo lol, might get me a bit more motivated haha.

[01-Jul-19 05:29 PM] PHBA2061#2530
am I right to assume that game items will be stored as NFT on Komodo ?

[01-Jul-19 08:16 PM] smellycouch#3071
@blackjok3r   that is way awesome.  Also would be great to have a KMD emoji, looked for one here 😃

[01-Jul-19 08:17 PM] smellycouch#3071
@Alright   So I'm still battling this one, I'll post what I have on #ask-jl777 .      kvupdate delivers a transaction, kvsearch does not find it

[01-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
why are you trying to use KV on KMD?

[01-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
just curious

[01-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
I'd have to take a look, never tried it myself, just assumed it would work if you removed the thing that disables it on KMD

[01-Jul-19 08:25 PM] smellycouch#3071
well at first, it was by accident as I didn't realize it was disabled,

[01-Jul-19 08:26 PM] smellycouch#3071
And then was strictly for purposes of being OCD

[01-Jul-19 08:26 PM] smellycouch#3071
And now I'm trying to prevent further stages of OCD PTSD

[01-Jul-19 08:26 PM] smellycouch#3071
I was fooling around with combining kvupdate with multisig to enhance its capabilities.

[01-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
KV is basically just an easy way to create OP_RETURN transactions

[01-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
and indexing them

[01-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
can you not just use pure OP_RETURN txs for your purposes?

[01-Jul-19 08:33 PM] smellycouch#3071
I almost did, but then I didn't want to re-invent the wheel as this works so well for asset chains

[01-Jul-19 08:34 PM] smellycouch#3071
or even just going one level lower with the sendmoney function, and writing my own retrieval.   but, seems cleaner to re-use

[01-Jul-19 08:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just tried kvsearch on an assetchain, and it works, may be instead of testing it on Komodo you can test it on an asset chain ?

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] smellycouch#3071
yeah, works really great on assetchains.   I can confirm that too

[01-Jul-19 08:36 PM] smellycouch#3071

When AGAMA?!? :Komodo:

[02-Jul-19 12:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
Several Windows only friends want LABS but can't Linux. I tried lol.

[02-Jul-19 12:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
It's not a super simple thing to ask an average user to Iguana and import etc.

[02-Jul-19 12:13 AM] Exile13#4458
any kmd addy can hold LABS, so any `winduhs` wallet that holds kmd would work right?

[02-Jul-19 12:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
Right but then pos64?

[02-Jul-19 12:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
In Agama

[02-Jul-19 12:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
POS like Verus.

[02-Jul-19 12:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
Both these friends hold, mine and stake VRSC daily on several threadrippers we built.

[02-Jul-19 12:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
EZ mode.

[02-Jul-19 12:14 AM] Exile13#4458
oh you wanna split..

[02-Jul-19 12:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
Exactly... And Winduhs can't cut it really

[02-Jul-19 12:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
Almost... I could do it for them...

[02-Jul-19 12:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
But that's not been the goal

[02-Jul-19 12:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
I've spent two years teaching these friends as they could learn... They want in on these things with me so it's tough to help them just yet.

[02-Jul-19 12:16 AM] Exile13#4458
what about dual booting

[02-Jul-19 12:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
But they all got VRSC going withing a few days which is a decent bar to set.

[02-Jul-19 12:16 AM] Exile13#4458
