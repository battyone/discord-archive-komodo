The first ones were ```Total migrations amount: 5
3538.277477502823 migration time (sec)```

[20-Feb-19 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Looks like an export creation bug, it happens. My bash script handles those but the Python one while it can do more migrates, doesn't catch errors as well

[20-Feb-19 07:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Which script do you mainly use?

[20-Feb-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I haven't been using any lol for ages.

[20-Feb-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the new RPC calls being g made there is no point working on those scripts

[20-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They work most of the time, and it seems the exports are saved I think, although probably in the wrong place, as it crashed on me and burnt a huge amount of coins. I dont recommend doing more than 1 migrate at a time with real funds.

the migratepython_v2 script sends the most in the least amount of time afaik

[20-Feb-19 11:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the bash script gives better console readout as it happens, but takes longer to send multiple

I haven't used the bash scripts recently.  The python was very smooth.  The older python script I had gave me some trouble. Figured it out comparing it with the newer one.

[20-Feb-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I pushed some changes to it the otherday that fixed the two "bugs"

[20-Feb-19 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just rebuilding iguana to try and run it over tor. Once I get it wokring I nede another node to monitor the output of :
`curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776/" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"ipaddrs\"}" | jq -r .[] `
My guess is that its going to  start filling up with IPs from tor nodes. Which is ok, as I am testing a fix on my node that stops it adding any IPs. 
The down side of this is that now all our IPs must be in the `peer_ips.txt` which I aleady pushed.

[20-Feb-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So we are using tor, to slow down our dPoW netowrk, but not gaining any privacy at all...

[20-Feb-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This may or may not work, but if it works it will solve he region problem, as all nodes now need to send their packets to 3 random other locations before a node, so ping times will be totally random, andnode location will no longer matter to counts at all.

[20-Feb-19 12:35 PM] CrisF#3405
Will it provide privacy in the end, or is it only to make location irrelevant?

[20-Feb-19 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nanomsg does not allow tor as far as I have been able to see, so no. 
If we can make it use .onion address's then yes, it will be possible to have nodes IP address hidden aswell.

[20-Feb-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont thik thats something I will be able to do tbh... This really isnt bad as you can get the notary IPs easily as it is... Having then on git isnt great, maybe we cna distribute them via some other means, like an encrypted oracle of someting. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

remind me again why we need to know notary IPs?

[20-Feb-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The network needs to know who to connect to

[20-Feb-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If I cna work out how to make it use a onion address then we dont need to anymore

[20-Feb-19 12:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
putting it into an encrypted oracle record is totally doable.

[20-Feb-19 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
There was some talk of tor in Verus yesterday. (0x03)

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But it really doesnt seem possible with nanomsg, and I dont think re writing iguana to use something that supports tor is going to be worthwhile just to hide Ips

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`The network needs to know who to connect to`
that's the entire point of a seed node

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you use tor

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will add all the relay nodes exit poinnts to the IP array

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so to uase tor that needs to be disabled.

[20-Feb-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or everything will toally break

[20-Feb-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as nodes never reveice the IP address of a receiving node .... There is a way to ping the IP and see if iguana is there then add it... but seems pointless as all nodes are on tor, and have no proper IP address, for outgoing connections

[20-Feb-19 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

from the docs, it looks likt it supports many GPS chips too, which really opens up the possible hardware

Well my first very cheap attempt at doing this didnt work... Cannot route iguana with `torsocks` application, as it cannot do RPC calls üòÇ

[20-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So will need a firewall rule... Decker gave me an example to work from, but I didnt want to have to do that, because of noobs... but maybe a script to install it will work just fine.

[20-Feb-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just if we do this, every node has to use it... or anyone not doing it, will gaine a HUGE advantage I think

[20-Feb-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like instead of regions, our only rule is that you have to route outgoing thoough tor.

[20-Feb-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I have my node runnign on TOR now, but its not working

hmm seems using IPTABLES rule is working. is anyone here to check the IP list on their node?

[20-Feb-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant 
Please update iguana and inatall tor on your nodes. Its ok if a few of you dont right away., Just please DM me if you updated so I can track how it affects counts. 
``` Install TOR:
 sudo apt-get install tor
 
 Check its working:
 curl --socks5 localhost:9050 --socks5-hostname localhost:9050 -s https://check.torproject.org/ | cat | grep -m 1 Congratulations | xargs
 
 Create rule in firewall to route iguana traffic through tor:
 sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9997 -j REDIRECT --to-port 9050```
its working on my node, and was fairly easy to do. Don't think any of you will have any issues.
To update it should be a simple `./start.sh` It should build and restart iguana for you.

[20-Feb-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already have the ips

[20-Feb-19 01:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wont be able to update  for a while tho

[20-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just wanted someone to see if `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776/" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"ipaddrs\"}" | jq -r .[]` is adding heaps of extra IPs

[20-Feb-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As my node is now connecting to your nodes, via tor proxy (or should be)

how can I use LABS to anonymously buy porn then?

its only iguana thats using it, to articially randomize ping times

can you add ascii porn to notary payments?

sorry i know your joking lol.. im hell tired atm.

[20-Feb-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to get some more sleep... It seems I set the stuff up right but doesnt appear that ist working... Guess if everyone updates or a few nodes activate it, we will know for sure.
