but wiont crash on restart again

[27-Jan-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
was it related to the removeorphans?

[27-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure it is yes

[27-Jan-19 04:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its iterating over blockindex's

[27-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and then one isnt there it fails

[27-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only happens on RewindingBlocks

[27-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
would depend on what orphan you deleted

[27-Jan-19 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why it diffrent on diffrent nodes

[27-Jan-19 04:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and a reindex fixes it, which puts back all the orphans

[27-Jan-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
very tricky code to be changing...

[27-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... this introduces a lot of poterntial problems for our proposed solution

[27-Jan-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it skip index's that dont exist.. but that leads to more problems

[27-Jan-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has to actually prevent the blcok getting saved at all

[27-Jan-19 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or zero ut the space, even that might not work.

[27-Jan-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
seem the tmp .blk is the way to go, that avoids most these issues

how many are eligible to stake

@ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 Getting that floating point exception here too... seems random, mageged to get backtrace checking it out atm... Seems some integer math I tried to use is not dividing correctly in some cases... It should only happen in block below 100, trying to figure out solution. With a 90% PoS target, I may just be able to revert it back to what it was.  Was testing with much less than 90% PoS when i made it. Never had any issues.

Pushed fix... Doubt its required to update. Basically I changed block validation to occur only on slowflag. This isnt optimal, but once I can get james tempfile to work , it really won't matter.
This is the exact reason the PoS does not vary its % of difficulty... because the data isnt there....

[28-Jan-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also may have the effect of spamming invalid PoW blocks... which I think was already possible.
The only real solution for this is a TempFile that each block upon receive is saved into. 
Then when the block is connected with full validation, it is saved into the actual blockchain files. 
James wrote code that does this, but it does not handle chain restart.. ie... all blocks need to be downloaded again, it cant see that they are saved. This is a problem with the index, hopefully I can track it down. 
I hope also to have the temp file somehow to flush itself of old data in runtime... Otherwise under attack nodes would need to restart constantly to purge the data.
