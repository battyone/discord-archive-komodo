how to you make a person do that ?

staked is 100% backeards compatible with every KMD AC nad KMD

[23-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's have an example to how it will work, so there is no confusion on my end.

jl777 wants a bug tested: Who puts up a bounty? JL or NN? Who pays for the bounty?
Bountysize is communicated by the NN.
Developers see the list of current bounties and then decide which one has the best work/reward ratio.
NN decide whether or not the devwork/testing was enough and grant the bounty to dev.
Dev receives the bounty in LABS (?)
Dev wants to buy ramen noodles for family -> who will give kmd/btc/usd for his LABS so he can pay bills?

My original thought was: In step 1 jl first buys LABS with btc/kmd/usd and gives the LABS to NN which tie it up in a smart contract only to be released when enough notaries sign it. This way because someone always needs to buy LABS to have testing done and it gets value from demand.

itsfine ... genie aleays managed to complain about somthing ehen 24 other people had nothign to compain about

[23-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I think I'm missing something

[23-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
probably confusion from your remark that the bounties are created from thin air :p

[23-Nov-18 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
let me just walk you through the process of dev creating a chain and tester finding bug in the contract the dev wanted tested

Yeah, fek that asshole who's already spending $4k USD a year on servers and doesn't want to spend more.

[23-Nov-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my costs are about the same 🤷  I have no problem spending anther $20 a month if need be

[23-Nov-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I have no problem spending anther $20 a month if need be`
good, let me know the details after you pay for it and set it up...

[23-Nov-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[23-Nov-18 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
So dev has a new contract they need tested
they create a chain
burn the premine about of this chain on main LABS chain
fund the notaries on their new chain with premine amount(notaries can choose what they want to be paid), 
testers transfer some amount of LABS to the new chain to use in testing
Tester finds a bug. 
Tester posts a bounty claim via oracles on main chain. 
Notaries discuss whether this claim is fair. If it is, they sign off on it. New coins are created and given to tester. The amount of coins that can be created in this process is limited on a weekly basis.

[23-Nov-18 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
please take note of `notaries can choose what they want to be paid` part

[23-Nov-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to coding his stratum_

[23-Nov-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
If you can think of a better mechanism, please suggest it

[23-Nov-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
just criticizing the idea without presenting a possible solution is not helpful

[23-Nov-18 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
you're tripping out about the "coins created from thin air" comment, but they are created based on WORK and limited to objective rules

[23-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
if you haven't noticed, all coins are "created from thin air"

[23-Nov-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
Think of it like this. If there isn't a bounty claim for a specific week, the emissions are lower.

[23-Nov-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
the bounty payouts are rolled into the emissions of the coin

[23-Nov-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would say this: My original thought was: In step 1 jl first buys LABS with btc/kmd/usd and gives the LABS to NN which tie it up in a smart contract only to be released when enough notaries sign it. This way because someone always needs to buy LABS to have testing done and it gets value from demand.

[23-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
if we do that, they may as well just give btc/kmd/usd directly to the tester

[23-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
just hire testers at that point

[23-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why not?

[23-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
the way we're going gives a very low barrier of entry for both contract devs and testers

[23-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm also true

[23-Nov-18 01:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But having the option to have it paid in kmd will increase demand for kmd as well

[23-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, going to let it rest for a while, these were just my first thoughts and I'm sure others will think the same. So it is important to have clear communication of how everything will work to avoid confusion

[23-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
Website sometime soon

[23-Nov-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
before launch at least

[23-Nov-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
If it costs a dev an exuberant amount of money to get their contract tested, we failed entirely

{Reactions}
💯 

[23-Nov-18 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea is to get people to test for cheap, while also having testers tech other keen and new testers, createing a team of skilled testers you cant get anywhere else.

@LabsAssistant you should be able to test your setup for tomorrow's chain. If you can notarize now, you'll be able to notarize tomorrow.

I think we need to add some ips of the new guys to the ip list and some of need to restart iguana

[23-Nov-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They are likely nearly all wrong, and that screws it up bad
