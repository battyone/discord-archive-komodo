[21-Apr-19 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you have them

[21-Apr-19 01:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, I saw the message last night, but only sent 10

[21-Apr-19 01:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

`    "ac_name": "CFEKDRAGON",
    "ac_supply": "200",
` 
didnt quite have 5k spare there, been mining all night tho so sent 700

[21-Apr-19 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats enough to last a few thousand blocks. If you get time, you could awyas try to migrate it over from the other chain.

[21-Apr-19 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no need though. setting up a miner to keep feeding it.

[21-Apr-19 02:30 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I'm mining too and will keep it topped

[21-Apr-19 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no please save teh coins you mine

[21-Apr-19 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need them to test ... once each one is about 10k it should last a few weeks. nottary pay on last chains was too high lol...

[21-Apr-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw rpc to check it is `getnotarypayinfo`

In order of sheet, SHossain, Alright, Blackjok3r, Mylo (not sure if he's started), CHMEX, DragonHound, ComputerGenie, gt, node9(me), TonyL, webworker01, Zatjum.  and1-89 might be there, but not sure if he's notarized in Labs.

[21-Apr-19 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`and1-89` took over dwy spot, but has not actually joined as far as I know. Though he may have got a node up at one point that I dont know about.

Is there a some bootstrap still of kmdlabs daemon KMD chain?

[21-Apr-19 03:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Wiped blockchain because of "HDD data corrupted"

[21-Apr-19 03:20 PM] SHossain#0007
i used another server with rsync command from @webworker01 . that helped

[21-Apr-19 03:20 PM] SHossain#0007
`rsync -Pprv ~/.komodo/blocks/ kmdlabs@serverip:/home/kmdlabs/.komodo/blocks/`

[21-Apr-19 03:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL try this ^^

@blackjok3r Is KMD bootstrap from not kmdlabs daemon is good to go now?

[21-Apr-19 03:29 PM] gt#2812
it should be

normal CHMEX/o3 bootstrap is good. I fgixed the issue

yes

[21-Apr-19 03:32 PM] SHossain#0007
i use rsync from time to time. but, i did it other way around

[21-Apr-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
your command i used first time to send from source to destination

[21-Apr-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Pinned a message.

[21-Apr-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
definatly better then bootstrap if you can do it. pinned

[21-Apr-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
it takes almost same time using both method for me (bootstrap or rsync)

[21-Apr-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
but, rsync should work faster with fast connections

[21-Apr-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
```pindexFork->GetHeight().1321363 is < notarizedht 1321760, so ignore it
