I'm just not sure what to do lately, we're snagged on this NFT stuff

[30-Mar-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its all tokens now

[30-Mar-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek tokens

☝ 

[30-Mar-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to take this up with jl its not anything of mybdoing

[30-Mar-19 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I didn't want it either

[30-Mar-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what's jl got to do with direction and timing of LABS?

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He's using it to dev tokens migrates

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Without labs they can't make it

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
well it's not just that

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
it's that upstream would have very different momom code

[30-Mar-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
and the point of LABS is to test KMD stuff, so we want to stay as close as possible to KMD's codebase

[30-Mar-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If we revert tokens and launch... When that code is done it will hardfork our chain

[30-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
if we don't have it's features to test, it's not very useful

[30-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
this in particular is frustrating because it's a hard fork for the entire cluster

[30-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
we can't test it on a subset of chains easily

[30-Mar-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The other option is to launch but disable clusters until the migrate code is finalised

[30-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But that achieves nothing

[30-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Apart from us mining a bunch of coins

[30-Mar-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, if that's the case and we're literally not doing any more until after elections, then I'm going to use that server for testnet instead of the shitty godaddy one I'm in last place with now 😕

[30-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
Not saying we'll be doing nothing

[30-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That should be OK, as long as the labs cluster is still working

[30-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
plenty of small things to be done

[30-Mar-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dimxy needs it to dev the tokens stuff

[30-Mar-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is heaps of non code related things needed to be done

[30-Mar-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Test ac_nk params

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not saying we'll be doing nothing`
it's literally the 2nd time in as many days that joker's said 'leave labs until election is over'

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Website wtc

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
well he's an idiot 😄

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well unless there is something alright needs u to do... That's allnwe can do

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
don't just drop everything

[30-Mar-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cris is doing website that's important but none is helping him

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
I understand that we can't really do major consensus changes right now

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
but like I said, plenty of small things to be done in the mean time

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I understand that we can't really do major consensus changes right now`
I literally don't 🤷🏽

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make a list of jobs and get ppl doing them them

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
ok

[30-Mar-19 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
let me dig up that trello 😂

[30-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
still actively working on pos64staker btw

[30-Mar-19 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
On my end I'm stuck dead. I'll be home tomorrow night for a hopeful solid week of work. Really would like to have some direction on what bthe fuck I'm meant to be working on

[30-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
should be well and ready prior to launch

[30-Mar-19 12:55 PM] gt#2812
do we have a list of things to do?

[30-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright will need to update the trello

[30-Mar-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cleaned it up a while ago but it hasn't been updated in a while

[30-Mar-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm glad it didn't launch
dafuq good would it have been to launch and then say "meh, we can't do anything because someone else wants to do something"?

[30-Mar-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well yes that was my thoughts... Once again this was direction of jl not me.

[30-Mar-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's your project 🤦🏽

[30-Mar-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Out of my hands really unless we totally fork off from kmd all together

[30-Mar-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That doesn't really help us achieve our goals

[30-Mar-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ^

[30-Mar-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so get the end bits working and then readjust the middle later

[30-Mar-19 01:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There will defiantly be stuff to be done just need to work out what... Code wise its solid I think at least if we disabled tokens migrate... But its a consensus change for all chains

[30-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can work on trying to split tokens too a diff eval code or something, so that we can maybe disable it..m but it seems a lot of work for not much outcome

[30-Mar-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, either way, I'm still flipping servers if nothing is really going to be progressing for a bit
LabsNN on godaddy and testnet on the "good" server

[30-Mar-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure as long as we still have notarizations happening that's fine. Testnet is important

[30-Mar-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for whatever feked reason, I'm massively in like last place on testnet 😛

[30-Mar-19 01:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol not sure my node would even be working I can't login to it from here

[30-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
I've lost a lot of focus on LABS because I assumed this would be a quick thing, figured I'd pick up work on it when it was ready to test. I'll continue on with little things in the mean time. I'm not sure what the timeline looks like on this tokens migrate thing. I'll make up a list of little things that can be done and get these up on the trello

[30-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
if anyone is actively looking for something to do right now, I'm sure Cris would appreciate some help with the website. I've been slacking on helping him as well :/

[30-Mar-19 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_stopped "looking for things to do" about a year and a half ago :troll:_

[30-Mar-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Website stuff is important... Its largely been left but as the dev of labs is basically finished apart from bounties it can be finalised

[30-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r would it be more work to revert these changes and create a separate cluster for Dimxy?

[30-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
or should we just focus on getting it right before launch

[30-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
I understand that means a hard fork of the cluster when it's ready

[30-Mar-19 01:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Anything u guys need on my end I can do this week. Just let me know. Testing some nk params should be done as they may be useful for us

[30-Mar-19 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not an easy thing to do man. Maybe we should find out what kind of time frame this tokens thing is expected to take if its weeks or months then for sure its worth the effort to revert it and launch, maybe we can height activate it or simply have no cluster chains until its ready

[30-Mar-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`or simply have no cluster chains until its ready`
at the risk of sounding like a 🍆, isn't clusters most of the point (or at least a large chunk)?

[30-Mar-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's why I wanted to wait. @dimxy  donwe have an estimate of how long the tokens upgrades will take?

[30-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Mylo#8306
Sorry.  It didn’t work as advertised, so I dug into it.

[30-Mar-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ahh if it fails build manually using build.sh in zcutil

[30-Mar-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
See what error is

[30-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And fix it or report it to me

[30-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Start.sh is horrible and complicated and uncommented lol

[30-Mar-19 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But it works

[30-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Mylo#8306
ACs and KMD start.  Ha, yeah np

[30-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Mylo#8306
Iguana dies atm, but I’m doing a few things so didn’t troubleshoot at the time

[30-Mar-19 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dies? I need more info on that if you have time, no rush won't be able to fix it for at least another day

[30-Mar-19 01:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
💤

[30-Mar-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no rush` `:zzz: `
🤣

[30-Mar-19 01:46 PM] Mylo#8306
Maybe because I’m not in the club yet, will dig in later and prob post issue on gh

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Mylo#8306
Having a post dinner coffee...

[30-Mar-19 01:50 PM] Mylo#8306
Splitting codebase may be better.  Some project will come along with a new feature that will be incompatible with codebase, so you’d need another cluster potentially.  Obviously wasn’t foreseeable a month ago.

[30-Mar-19 01:54 PM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r  about tokens I m going to do a PR with update for tokens on Monday

[30-Mar-19 01:55 PM] dimxy#2587
Then it is probaby better to make a new CFEK cluster for testing

@Alright @blackjok3r  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @gt @Mylo 
Hi, There is something really important that needs to be done.
We need to get `How Labs Works` clearly defined.oss
This is what new projects, tester and investors want/need to know when they first come to Labs.  It'll save much hassle answering the same questions again and again.
It needs an basic outline, like the diagram `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works/` (bottom).
Need to add at least one example case for project coming in.
I have a basic project in mind for this example run through (it doesn't have to be made, just what steps are taken)

[31-Mar-19 12:21 AM] CrisF#3405
If this isn't done before launch we will have a mass of questions and confusion.

[31-Mar-19 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How Labs Works clearly defined.`
You put shit on a chain, you take shit off the chain. 🙂

[31-Mar-19 12:22 AM] CrisF#3405
haha, don't for get `make & break` 😃

[31-Mar-19 12:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Please have a look at `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works` and let me know what to change and add.

[31-Mar-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF going for some food then I'll have some time to work on this

[31-Mar-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
~1-2 hours, will see if you're around then, but doesn't matter if you aren't

[31-Mar-19 12:24 AM] CrisF#3405
The info I complied and have been using is here:`https://kmdlabs.cc/p/KMDLabs_-_How_it_work`

[31-Mar-19 12:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Sorry it's a mess.

[31-Mar-19 12:26 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright  Great, thanks!  I'll be heading out for a meeting in an hour or so.

Test case 
-------------------
Weight loss tracker where a person or group can monitor fat loss ⚖ 
People would post info to an oracle and monitor progress
Betting options available
Thinking office pool kind of scenario, or friends/community 
Simple oracle to start
Possibly building towards marketing to smart scale companies with an app

[31-Mar-19 12:33 AM] CrisF#3405
If I have the basic steps I can write it up and make/fix diagrams etc.

[31-Mar-19 12:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Test fails ------------------- 
Weight loss tracker used to monitor fat gain ⚖

[31-Mar-19 12:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, that was SMK's idea too 😃

[31-Mar-19 12:36 AM] CrisF#3405
There is on other non-dev matter that we can finalize, or not, while there is no devving.
