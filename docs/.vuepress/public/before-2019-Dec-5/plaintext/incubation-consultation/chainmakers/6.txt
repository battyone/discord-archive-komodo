how to mine this one @blackjok3r ?

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why its usless

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we launch DICE on 4 staked chains, and made a way to play them all at the same time

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for free

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
游뱡

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and were told not to

[18-Oct-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue ti was broken

[18-Oct-18 02:11 AM] c2k#4915
hmmm游뱂

[18-Oct-18 02:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
zim horribly confused as to why this chain exists

[18-Oct-18 02:11 AM] c2k#4915
lololol

[18-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will trolld the crap out it

[18-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every day

[18-Oct-18 02:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stole my idea

[18-Oct-18 02:12 AM] c2k#4915
if a pirate be stealin your idea i be understandin...:rum:

[18-Oct-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
meh made bank on pirate ... but this chain makes no sense.

[18-Oct-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can rund DICE on any AC ...

[18-Oct-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt need its own chain... and the dealer can never withdraw

[18-Oct-18 02:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so after time, all the coins will end up in the dealer CC address

[18-Oct-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pointless

[18-Oct-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dice is a PoC

[18-Oct-18 02:14 AM] c2k#4915
for sure. i will go back to my texas holdm app

[18-Oct-18 02:14 AM] c2k#4915
lol

[18-Oct-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant actually use it

[18-Oct-18 02:15 AM] c2k#4915
i was hoping it was the next arrr and i could get in on the ground floor. missed the pirate boat until just recently

[18-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol.... STAKED

[18-Oct-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am just being held back on launching it ... because someone is on holidays 游땭

[18-Oct-18 02:18 AM] c2k#4915
yes im watching in there too

[18-Oct-18 02:18 AM] c2k#4915
i see youre ready to pull the trigger

[18-Oct-18 02:18 AM] c2k#4915
unless i teach myself how to code, most of this is way over my head

[18-Oct-18 02:18 AM] c2k#4915
so im watching and learning what i can

[18-Oct-18 02:20 AM] c2k#4915
off to sleep soon. have a good one :Komodo:

[18-Oct-18 02:29 AM] jspook16#3059
Will any of the previous Stake coins carry forward or is it starting off fresh? @blackjok3r

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the STAKED4 coins will be kept .

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but we will probably time lock them, so they cannot be staked for a certain amount of time to ahve a fair launch

[18-Oct-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the supply is tiny at the point anyway less than 1 million

[18-Oct-18 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the surrent chains are just a test net .. all will be discarded

[18-Oct-18 02:35 AM] jspook16#3059
Copy that. Good luck. I think you've made progress on the video streaming from what I've seen on your channel right?

[18-Oct-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... I have a chain that only the creator can mine, by a consenus rule, so that nobody else cna submit data to it, and I have a way of sequentially feeding in 8kb chunks of data into the opreturn in a way that allows them to be taken back out and reassembeled.

[18-Oct-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its very much a steep learning curve this stuff, no idea what Im doing, but jl gave me some good pointers.

[18-Oct-18 02:40 AM] jspook16#3059
I think that's going to be crucial. Props man

[18-Oct-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181

really really pissed over this

[18-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You do know I can break your single table in about 5 mins making this chain dead ?

[18-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please delate it

[18-Oct-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can play dice on any AC

@blackjok3r 
Don't be a dick and let folks enjoy and learn.

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
NO

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is bullshit

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we sepnt countless hours on this exact idea

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and were told to stop wokring on it

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then this chan just apears

[18-Oct-18 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
get ducked

[18-Oct-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dice cannot work wit just 1 table on 1 chains... these guys didnt even test anything befor emaking this

[18-Oct-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pushing broken products is a dick move

[18-Oct-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I will just aod up the dice queue ... with million of bets and leave it there ... then they will see

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Kmd pulp / dice runs on existing chains, any issues there?

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nope

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what im saying

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
OK, let's talk about bullshit
bullshit is me investing a month into STAKED and then you guys saying "meh, let's put it all on hold and go in a different direction"
Do **not** be a dick about this! I'm not in the fekn mood

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works on any AC there is no reason to make a new chain

[18-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked got put on hold because of something out of my control

[18-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott  disapeared

[18-Oct-18 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
because we can is feken reason enough for any of us to make a chain for anything

[18-Oct-18 04:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
For being on hold, we've sure done a fair bit anyways...

No, that was **after** you decided the whole ecosystem inside an ecosystem thing
Originally STAKED was to be what the damn name implied

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That wsa alrighs idea not mine ... andits a fucking cool idea

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
youwant a PoS chain there is already MGNX

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I saw the dice chain last night. Wondering how they covered withdrawl?

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they didnt

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
It's a feken game, get over yourself

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and in a few hours I will lock the entir supply of coins in that single contract

[18-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really need to think things thorugh before making a chain on a whim

[18-Oct-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and in a few hours I will lock the entir supply of coins in that single contract`
I'm telling you that's a bad feken idea
do not feken test me on this

whats it got to do with you ?

[18-Oct-18 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181

staked is a test net do what you want it

[18-Oct-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know its broken

[18-Oct-18 04:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hence its a testnnet

[18-Oct-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Fine, ignore me, do some dumb shit, and months from now when you think it's live and you've forgotten all about this, I'll be there to remind you

[18-Oct-18 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im pissed because we did all the testing and work to launch something like this, and weere told to stop working on it because it had some flaw, and the funds in the contract could not be withdrawn. They have gone ahead and launched a chain, that doesnt respect ANY of the limitations we found in testing, and clearly didnt test it.

[18-Oct-18 04:37 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I guess making a private untested chain within the komodo notary network is a bad idea? I think we can learn from this

[18-Oct-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And to cap it all off it was added to main net notary nodes

[18-Oct-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for no fucking reason ... without being tested at all. WTF!?

[18-Oct-18 04:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
