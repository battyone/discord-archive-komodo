[08-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] I have created a private Telegram channel where I will publish the prices and tokens that I sell, if someone is interested you can talk to me through PM and I will pass the link to you, if someone wants to use the channel to sell their KMD tokens, whatever they can do it too.

[08-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] In the channel only the token that is sold and the price is put, the exchange is done by PM to avoid spam

[09-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] the snapshot will be taken on August 15th and distribution August 30th. to participate in that round you need to have over 500KMD in a single address and you also need to control the private keys to that wallet. using Agama will be the best option for most people

[09-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] you can download the latest Agama from https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/
