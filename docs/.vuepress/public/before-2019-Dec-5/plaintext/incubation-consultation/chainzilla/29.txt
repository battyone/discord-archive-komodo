[PTYX#6840] i will ask them.

[20-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] What seems to be the going exchange between KMD to Zilla if you all don‚Äôt mind my asking. I seem to remember someone wanting 100 KMD for 1 Zilla but didn‚Äôt know if that was correct.

[20-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

If you have a minimum of 500kmd in your wallet you'll get a certain amount of Zilla. 4.8 or therabouts.

[20-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Ok so that‚Äôs about right then. Thank you @yorklab

[20-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] üòç

[20-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] For some reason.. lets not raise airdrop competition here üòé

[20-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] Is the faucet still down?

[20-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] How does one... abuse... a faucet üòõ

[20-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @tolken

[20-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] It appeared that someone created multiple addresses collected a lot of .1 Zilla and then attempted to sell over 300 I believe here on Discord

[20-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 250 yea

[20-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[castle32#9955] you dont know what are you doing üòÇ  now, you block the faucet for everybody less me üòÇ  if someone wants more zilla i sell more

[20-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[castle32#9955] pm me for buy huge amounts only

[20-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[castle32#9955] i tell you , i do it manually if you use captcha its better for me , but okay continue with that üòÇ

[20-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Go brag elsewhere, Castle.

[20-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] Blocking the faucet wont make price go up LMAO

[20-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] Faucet was only meant for people to experiment/get used to/have a bit of fun with

[20-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] the ico is still gonna happen at like 40c usd or something üòÇ

[20-Jul-18 03:25 PM] castle32#9955
thank goodness you do not like the censorship that you have had to expel me from the channel üòÇ

[20-Jul-18 03:26 PM] castle32#9955
if someone wants to buy already knows where I am, the prices have gone up because now I can only sell  in large quantities, thanks PTYX üòâ

[20-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] What a dick

[20-Jul-18 03:26 PM] PTYX#6840
üòÇ arrogance is a weakness

[20-Jul-18 03:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Better get your anti-canvas and about 50K emails ready

[20-Jul-18 03:27 PM] castle32#9955
If you thought I would not be able to get as many as I've got so far, you would not throw me out of the channel

[20-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] We love you, Castle. This is just a little of discipline.

[20-Jul-18 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
@castle32 thanks for making it interesting

[20-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] ü§¶

[20-Jul-18 03:30 PM] castle32#9955
perhaps a hard fork is necessary to avoid the centralization and censorship that you are exercising üòâ

[20-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont be a fucking twat

[20-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] And I'm sitting here just trying to get .1 freakin zilla from a faucet and you got this a-hole

[20-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] Should write a warning on the faucet; "Use in moderation" üòÇ üòÇ

[20-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Can't you block IP-addresses from the faucet?

[20-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The faucet has been down for days

[20-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He didn't get anything from it

[20-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He probably is referring to the mini airdrops but still, he couldn't have gotten many

[20-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We arw working on a new faucet that will make it not profitable to do.

[20-Jul-18 03:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] All projects attract some people that try to exploit the system.
I wonder if the guy ever contributed something to society.

[20-Jul-18 03:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Except for being a dick

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] how couls he abuse the faucet?

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] If he is a real hacker, we'll see. In that case I see value in his work, even if black-hat. But it doesn't seem to be the case. Real hackers don't brag.

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He was aggravated that I told him not to trade on the public channels

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I told him to use Barterdex

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] So, possibly he does not have that much indeed

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If he has the Zilla, he can do what he wishes with it. Just don't trade it in our public channels. That's why hyperDex exists

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[c2k#4915] wasnt there a #tradeoffers channel on slack?

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Even there, go to BarterDEX is what people will tell you

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Find someone and trade on Barterdex

[20-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Don't ever do deals on public channels with no escrow

[20-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[c2k#4915] i agree...not sticking up for him in any way

[20-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Congratulations fallas, we had our first troll
