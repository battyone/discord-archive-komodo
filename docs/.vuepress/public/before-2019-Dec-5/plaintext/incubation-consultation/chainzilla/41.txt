[Dean of Crypto#8764] So close, apparently some suspicious voting activity in the last hour for digibyte being discussed on the Komodo discord channel

[04-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] yeah close, but not enough. we gave our best so no worries. until next time

[04-Aug-18 01:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[crumb#2550] hey @PTYX i have a question regarding airdrop on august 15th. amount of zilla to be distributed among kmd holders is about 4.8 zilla per 500 kmd with a minimum required balance of 500 kmd. does that 4.8 zilla number take into account the known exchange addresses? i remember you wrote somewhere that you'd like to exclude those accounts. if those addresses will be excluded, what would be the amount zilla to be distributed per 500 kmd?

[04-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We were only able to discern one exchange address and it only holds one million Komodo more or less

[06-Aug-18 05:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[06-Aug-18 05:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tmj102212#4804] 1. Why should I invest? 
2. What will the minimum ROI be? 
3. Could you tell me how will you achieve the mentioned ROI?
4. Do you have a referral program? 
5. What is your soft and hard cap? 
6. Do you have any special offers? 
7. What is the best time to buy your tokens? 
8. Will I be able to re-sell them? 
9. What applications do I need to have in order to get tokens? 
10. How much time does a transaction take?

[PTYX#6840] I think he didn't read. The article does have a bit of a sensational title calling it the first luxury hotel in Tarapoto

[06-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Which is true, it's designed to be a 5 star hotel but it's designed to be "green" and there are acres upon acres of already deforested land that the foundation can use

[06-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] @Unknown PM me please

[06-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] @Unknown I will answer you from my point of view
1. Because you hope there are many people who want to help they develop their project from the Zilla's team.
2. It will depend on the people interested in what was indicated in the previous point
3. I suppose developing quality projects for clients, thus creating token demand.
4. The referral program is for bringing clients to the project, not for inviting people to invest, although perhaps in the bounty you find something
5. / 6.  You can find that in the litepaper without problem
7.  You can not know, the price that there is in the ICO can be greater than the one that has the token later, if it was known everyone would buy there                                                                                                                         8. Yes, you can sell your tokens in both the hyperdex and digitalprice whenever you want, surely there will be more exchangers in the future
9. Depends what you want to do, if your goal is to trade with the token, you can buy it directly on digitalprice and keep it there without using any application, if you intend to keep it in time you can download Agama, create an address and have them there, you would only have to download the Agama wallet
10.  From own experience it takes approximately 1 minute to have a confirmation, but the time is variable

If your goal is to buy in order to obtain short-term returns, you're wrong where to invest, knowing that the sale of the token will not be until this winter I do not think you'll find buyers well above the price of the ICO.
If I'm wrong about something, feel free to correct me

[06-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[coin.worxs.4us#1959] Very well said @jr.trump ; as I understand @PTYX  - following him on KMD quite some time - his main goal is to build/ improve common economic/business structures for elevating them on a higher level.

[06-Aug-18 05:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[coin.worxs.4us#1959] Therefore I think Chainzilla should not be understand as another Get Rich Quick scheme to just make some bucks. It‚Äòs - if - a long time investment just as KMD is (a building/improving and delivering platform) helping to widespread Cryptocurrency adoption!
