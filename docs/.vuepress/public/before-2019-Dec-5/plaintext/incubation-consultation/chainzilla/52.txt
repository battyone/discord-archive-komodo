[PTYX#6840] That's a mockup of the wallet ui. We did away with the normal charts and added the pie chart with a rotating function. When the user swipes through the coin options the portfolio pie will also rotate. Backend development has begun already so now it's just a matter of time.

[PTYX#6840] @Unknown we did a weekly raffle. We had people paste their address for 24 hours and we picked 2 winners of 100$ worth of ChainZilla coins
