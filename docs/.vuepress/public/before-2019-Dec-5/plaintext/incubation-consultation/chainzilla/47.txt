[26-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Very nice wallet. Looks "Easy" which is the most important aspect of any wallet: the easier it is to use, the more people are will to use it.

[26-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Definitely, the wallet is the entry point to our blockchain. So it needs to be optimized

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[smk762#7640] already done. nice gui on the redesign üõ∞

[27-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator thanks, we are excited to see it in action soon. Although, we might have the mobile version available before the desktop.

[27-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Around mid-October is when we will make the app available for public testing. We are currently getting all the accounts ready with the app stores.

[Instel7#1416] @Unknown @Unknown @Unknown Hello guys, welcome! Let us know if you have any questions! ü§ì

[27-Aug-18 05:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[mrbizzy#7075] hello. was checking info on this project. so looked also in discord. wanted to find out about mining, but seems it is not possible.

[27-Aug-18 05:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's possible. However the reward is low. 0.0001 Zilla per block

[27-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @Unknown check out the #deleted-channel channel, there's some discussion about

[27-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[mrbizzy#7075] yes that is what i mean - not possible mine it more profitably than buy it.

[27-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jonnybbig#2316] Open question. What does it mean that you must ‚Äúmove your KMD once per month‚Äù to receive the 5% reward instead of once per year? To accomplish that should I send my entire balance to my own address each month? Or is that silly?

[27-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jonnybbig#2316] Also is there a US accessible exchange to purchase Zilla?

[27-Aug-18 07:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Its not silly jonnybbig, that's what they mean. Send the balance to yourself once per month instead of year.

[27-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown the "claim interest" button just makes a sendtoaddress transaction to your own address and it effectively claims any rewards accrued in your Komodo address

[27-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We won't be on any CEXes for a while. Our focus now is on our wallet. Our ico is in January so we have plenty of time. After the airdrop, I'm sure there will be sell orders in Barterdex and the #deleted-channel channel

[27-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jonnybbig#2316] Thanks mang!!

[27-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[BoBot-BUY KMD BWK DEV $$$$2018#8821] is zilla on blockfolio

[30-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not yet. We aren't on block folio and coinmarketcap because we need 100K in volume in one day to be considered

[30-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's not an issue per se but we don't want to make a big push for people to buy or sell until the ico. You are free to trade on the DEX but the we will most likely wait until after full distribution to be listed on coinexchange and cryptopia.

[30-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If for some reason we happen to reach 100K volume in trade before the ico (completely possible) then I'll apply for cmc that day.

[30-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[BoBot-BUY KMD BWK DEV $$$$2018#8821] ok cool, also there will be more zilla airdrops to KMD hodlers?

[30-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There is one more airdrop that we have not still decided how to distribute.

[30-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Additionally, there are a few airdrops programmed for ZILLA holders buy projects that are working with us. We will announce more on this after the ICO.
