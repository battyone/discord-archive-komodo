[HardBlockMiner#4132] I'm starting to think you wait for me to be away from my computer to do these airdrops 😛

[Robert Naus#9564] @KLMJ1 so i am 17th biggest Zilla holder today, what a whale 😄

[13-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] @Robert Naus how many Zilla you got

[13-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Robert Naus  29 lol

[13-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] hah

[13-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] You got ahead because I kept falling asleep whilst waiting.

[13-Jul-18 09:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] so in theory u can sell and buy Zilla on barrtedex already and we are way over 5 months before ICO even launches..so much flexibility if u think about it

[djithbit#3171] 👌

[13-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] 😂

[13-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Robert Naus we will be on coinexchange after the main airdrop

[13-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If the market price is higher than the ico price by the time it rolls around I guess it will be a deal

[13-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] I am exited about what Chainzilla can do to move forward adoption of Komodo

[13-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yes, me as well @KLMJ1

[13-Jul-18 10:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We want to push all the right buttons to move the platform forward

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Hi everyone, welcome @Unknown, she will be taking on the role of social media management. She will train with us for the next 30 days so be nice to her and help her with any questions she might have 😀

[13-Jul-18 10:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Sounds good! More than willing to help!

[13-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] welcome @Unknown

[13-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @PTYX i think more companies will be created to do what u have in works..cryptorich is right, u target the future basically, u got chance actually make it big, just like KMD did

[13-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Soni11#8719] Hi! Thank you for your welcome, guys

[13-Jul-18 10:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Robert Naus we are working hard to make it happen 😄

[13-Jul-18 11:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] The tough part is liquidity on exchanges afterwards. Oot is having this problem now, being on a big exchange isn't enough there needs to be some sellers and volume. As for how we do that. Not sure yet

[13-Jul-18 11:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Im selling some ETH and BTC to get to 500KMD .. tell me i'm not nuts..

[13-Jul-18 11:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Regnar do atomic swaps actually count into trading volume?

[13-Jul-18 11:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Its still a trade

[13-Jul-18 11:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Just a different mechanism

[13-Jul-18 11:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] They do on dexs but they likely show up as regular transactions on main chains

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] CEXs trading volume is limited to coin balances on exchanges. Which if no one deposits....

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] So being listed on exchanges will only get us so far if sellers don't sell

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies best move you made beside getting into crypto;)

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yep

[13-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] ✌

[13-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] I can't stop buying kmd

[13-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] I think when we look at upside potential, KMD is a great bet compared to eth and btc

[13-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Probably 70% of my portfolio now

[13-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Da_Crypto_#7849] @Regnar Utrum is about to announce a BTCT Signature Campaign so the problem of liquidity will be solved in a couple of months

[13-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] I have no doubt of that. Utrum is a great project, I'm a hodler

[13-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Just tough to get liquidity sometimes

[13-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Da_Crypto_#7849] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies i wish i could do the same now 😊

[13-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Da_Crypto_#7849] KMD could jump to 4400 soon

[13-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Resistance at 33000 sats

[13-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] I'll start selling kmd rewards at $100 a coin

[13-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] But volume is low on all resistance levels

[13-Jul-18 11:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Da_Crypto_#7849] 🚀😊🚀

[13-Jul-18 11:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I am not worried once market picks up everything will go up,people will jim on again and this time more cherry-picking ensues so KMD will get much more investors and whole Komodo asset will grow alongside

[13-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Bull run should start within 6-8 weeks

[13-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] ETF news plus coinbase adds plus pent up buyers

[13-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] Did you guys all vote on kucoin contest?

[13-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yes

[13-Jul-18 11:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Transfer ETH from kraken to binance.. djeezes.. takes for ever...

[13-Jul-18 11:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies why don’t u send directly to agama and then swap for kmd?

[13-Jul-18 11:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Too late.. but this possible??

[13-Jul-18 11:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] ETH on agame?

[13-Jul-18 11:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] i have only been trading with barterdex this year 😄

[13-Jul-18 11:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to increase liquidity you have to give a user a reason to buy and sell

[13-Jul-18 11:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] if we all hold, we will lose steam eventually

[13-Jul-18 11:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our clients must buy Zilla to pay for our services. We can accept other types of payments but that will be our go-to payment option. This should give our coin a use.

[13-Jul-18 11:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I also thought that when we create the jumblr app, we add a requirement to have a bit of zilla in the wallet

[13-Jul-18 11:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Notarizations will give KMD the same type of use

[13-Jul-18 11:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you need KMD to notarize and to fulfill contracts

[13-Jul-18 11:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] and to Jumblr too.

[13-Jul-18 11:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] that would work

[13-Jul-18 11:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and with wider adoption, once the ball starts rolling we're gonna be good fo sure

[13-Jul-18 11:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I will come up with ways of giving it utility and encouraging circulation

[13-Jul-18 11:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I thought that projects that launch on ChainZilla could offer airdrops or benefits to Komodo and Zilla holders.

[13-Jul-18 11:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] things of that sort also add value

[13-Jul-18 11:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] So now.. ready for main airdrop 😀
