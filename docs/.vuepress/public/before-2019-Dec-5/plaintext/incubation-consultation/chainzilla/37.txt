[27-Jul-18 04:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Not complaining but I entered my address and it never took??

[27-Jul-18 04:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Did I do something wrong?

[27-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[c2k#4915] tx for the airdrop

[27-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[soup#2310] @Dzimmy check your address again. The same happened to me for a couple airdrops. I was missing a character

[27-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Missed again??? 😲😲😲

[27-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Goddamned!!!

[27-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dr.Terminus#3269] need zilla wallet for airdops ?

[27-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Agama is easy

[27-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] @Unknown Thanks for the help but I just double checked and I'm not missing any characters. I copy and pasted the address that I posted here into the chainzilla explorer and it worked. Any other ideas?

[27-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Just checked your address and it is indeed legit.

[27-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] No missing characters

[27-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Space before the adress might fool it

[27-Jul-18 04:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] But what i see is that it worked and you will get the airdrop @Unknown

[27-Jul-18 04:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] Thank youuu^^

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Yea I just saw that i received 0.15 Zilla!

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Don't know why I never got the "Congratulations" from the bot

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Weird..

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Unless someone on here sent me some to cheer me up! If someone did than thanks

[27-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] It made my day!

[27-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] The bot didnt follow up and jumped from 19 to 16 airdrops left notification.. you must have been in the skipped notifications.. thats all :)

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Dzimmy#4304] Thanks @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies ! I guess I should have calmed down for a second and looked at the obvious stuff before asking a bunch of questions.

[27-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] In trading, crypto and fast online activity some liquid cold metal as blood might be handy sometimes 😀

[27-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[27-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] I look to buy some  chains illa,any suggestions,price and you can get only from barterdex?

[27-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] to buy in hyperdex we have to wait for a bob update. digitalprice.io also has zilla but ptyx hasn't given the ok to start trading until the confirmation time is changed

[28-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Buddz1993#5380] How’s digitalprice as an exchange ??

[28-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I've been testing it for the past few days and it's responsive

[28-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Sri#6686
It works 😃

[28-Jul-18 03:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @ptxy will you be posting some Zilla for sale in digital price for BTC market?

[28-Jul-18 03:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[ModelCoin#0001] @Instel7 howdy! oh, I've been around for a while, but just in the KMD Slack that is.. lost @PTYX and went searching  and now I'm here 😃

[28-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @miles we weren't planning on it no. I did test a bit

[28-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] from the 500,000 that we unlocked for marketing, bounties, and op costs i can liquidate some through the exchange but it will be minimal. I rather pay someone in ZILLA than sell it for BTC at this point in time.

[28-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are working on the electrum app and we are also in the beginning stages of our first contract with Bosque Guardian. I was given the dICO app redesign last week which we approved. That will go into development soon. There will be 1 airdrop to ZILLA holders around  December that I will announce the date of in September. It's from a project that we advised and provided security services.

[28-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That is in addition to the projects we have in the pipeline for NEM.

[28-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @PTYX thanks - is the zilla for sale on the KMD market and on Bartdex not you then?

[28-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Asking only because I moved some BTC into digitalprice but can shop in KMD as well 😃

[28-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On Barterdex it's not us at the moment

[28-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The bobs are down

[28-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At digitalprice.io I tested deposits and withdrawals and set one order for 100 zilla.

[28-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Then withdrew the amounts

[28-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I have to check again to see if the confirmation times were changed to 120

[28-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] When I checked it was only 5

[28-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Got it - thanks for info - looking forward to the next stages !! 👍🏾👍🏾

[28-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Is the idea that the December airdrop rewards Zilla holders as you secure contracts / clients ?

[28-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Well for that particular airdrop we already completed the contract and delivered. So it's just a matter of timing

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It was a project that required smart contract reviewal and we performed advisor duties. I'll announce more about it soon but they are listed on our website as a partner.

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That is the idea though

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Cool - look forward to it - usual KMD style - deliver first - hype second!!!

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] To negotiate benefits for Zilla holders when appropriate. Same for Komodo holders it the project launches on Komodo

[28-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Yes - am a general holder of KMD and it’s eco system - so keen to see it grow and get recognition for being such  great tech
