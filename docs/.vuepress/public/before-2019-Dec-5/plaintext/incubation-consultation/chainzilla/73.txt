[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Claunas which coin?

[15-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Which Fiat currency to Bitcoin?

[15-Nov-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> My review is submitted and waiting for approval :zilla3:

[15-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Senda> Doneüëç

[15-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Thank you guys ‚úå

[15-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> 46 days until the ico

[15-Nov-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ü§î time flies. I've been working on Chainzilla for about 6 months now.

[15-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Yes time does go quickly in cryptos.. my first buy was over a year ago now

[15-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I don't like this recent crash though first time I have been down overall lol

[15-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Also let's hope the markets conditions are a bit better by the time the ICO finishes üòÑ

[15-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yes.... It has made me rethink the ico date.

[15-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> But I think we should just play it by ear

[15-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> Yes btc guys

[15-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @CombatWombat Don't worry, bad times comes and goes it has always been like that

[15-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> I made a wire to litebit

[15-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> For me was the cheapest so far

[15-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Do you have usd or euro?

[15-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Just trust that the real value of the tech will prevail at the end

[15-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> Gbp

[15-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Because euro is easy to trade for BTC

[15-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> @Instel7 I know.. just sucks this is the first time I have actually been down .. not that bad really seeing as we have handled this for almost a year now haha

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> don't worry strong hands here lol üòÇ

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I bought ETH the first time a year ago too, when it was $1,200 LOL

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> ouch haha

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I'm still holding it anyway

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> but in all seriousness I need at least one of my coins to go up so I can get in on the ICO

[15-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> done!

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Claunas can you make sepa transactions?

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> 46 days seems so far away but is just around the corner

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> must be exciting for you guys

[15-Nov-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> and maybe some nerves?

[15-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It is yes. I'm more excited about the wallet though.

[15-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's a little nerve wrecking now that the market took a dive but we have clients and projects underway. That makes it easier.

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> So far Agama has been my favourite wallet but looking forward to your guys wallet

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Agama is very robust, but not good looking üòÜ

[15-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> The market will bounce back there is just way too much advancements in this space for it to stay like this much longer

[15-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> The preview for the wallet looked good

[15-Nov-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Anyways I should head off have a great day/night guys

[15-Nov-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
