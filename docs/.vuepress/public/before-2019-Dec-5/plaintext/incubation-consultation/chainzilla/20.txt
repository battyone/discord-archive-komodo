[15-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's being tuned.

[KLMJ1#2767] I had my finger on the button for 20 minutes. Working hard to catch you up  @Robert Naus

[15-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's expected

[15-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Also this one was only half

[15-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] For 10 people instead of 20

[15-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'm testing some things

[15-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] @PTYX so they appear like it is airdrop

[15-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] and now the silence for the next airdrop

[15-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @KLMJ1 u will i quit , will try to participate in different way

[15-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] I think you did OK out of it.

[15-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] Happy to solve puzzle rather than outright speed.

[15-Jul-18 08:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] No they lasted less than a minute when I first joined. I missed all of them until I made it a priority to catch them.  Sadly sometimes they were 4 or 5 zilla for 5 or 4 people that I missed.

[15-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @PTYX  will the chainzilla.io be pure ICO or with KYC or?

[15-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Fully legal ICO yes

[15-Jul-18 08:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] With our own in-house ico tech

[15-Jul-18 08:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[djithbit#3171] Yes.. just enjoy the moment.. not to look too much ahead.. only much older and the inevitable there.. üòÅü§§

[15-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] I remember when the internet came out. I was like why would anyone need that? Ain't making the same mistake again. I think crypto is even bigger.

[15-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Yup

[15-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @KLMJ1 forget internet i said the same thing about computers before and i didnt have my own laptop till i was 29, i was very hostile to any new technology back in the days, but  blockchain is something else entirely, but than again, its possible that the result will be the same as with any technology that was suppose to "free" people , so to speak

[15-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] What is scary is if USA have their own coin and do away with paper money.

[15-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] Total control. Could even decide what shops you could use.

[15-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] nothing much me think, so the budget deficit wont be trillions of USD but trillions of some fedcoin same thing
