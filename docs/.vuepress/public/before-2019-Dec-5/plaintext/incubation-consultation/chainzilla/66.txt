[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> I typed out one seed and got "NXT" in green pop up where it usually says Iguana. Thought "I got it!" Then I didn't. After that I'm done. Too disappointed after that fake out to keep going :/

[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Anyone else worked out why "no plurals" was explicitly stated? I think I've got that one.

[03-Nov-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> yea i think there's 1 in particular that is plural by the look of it

[03-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> same

[03-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> There's so many variables on the BIP39 word list that anyone who solves it will totally deserve it. Like, moon or lunar? Or crater? Dragon or lizard? Or something else? Then with the clown orgy I get shoulder chest wrist clown face, and I'm hitting more than 11 words! I just want someone else to solve it now and put me out of my misery!!

[03-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i don't think it is bip39 only that's the thing

[03-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> @Oszyü§™ what makes you think that?

[03-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i am sure of some of the words and those are not in the bip39 word list. also, you can enter whatever words as a seed when you create a wallet.

[03-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Ok- but it would be practically unsolvable unless you restricted the words to those on a word list. Maybe the ones you think you've sure of, actually are wrong?

[03-Nov-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i think that's why it hasn't been solved yet.

[03-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> who knows. maybe you are right.

[03-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The words are not on a word list as far as I know

[03-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> At least some of them aren't

[03-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I've seen people very close. I don't want to give it away too fast.

[03-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Then I've had no hope all day üò≠

[03-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i want to sleep tonight

[03-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yes, there are few people very close, cmon keep trying üòÅ

[03-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Go to sleep. Tomorrow I'll release a clue.

[03-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I think someone is gonna solve it today

[03-Nov-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> At least he got free lunch out of the deal

[03-Nov-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> how do you think, what is (6) point? right after pizza?

[03-Nov-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> what it can be? volcano? mountain? rock? root?

[03-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> any suggestions? )

[03-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> looks like roots to me

[03-Nov-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> too many synonyms ... it can be root, but if we count this like rock - it has many synonyms ... hill, for example ...

[03-Nov-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> I think that is the (1) point though

[03-Nov-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> It is the starting point

[03-Nov-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> thats one im confused on decker. i was thinking volcano or roots

[03-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> I don't understand two things, a clown and a dog with a bandage.

[03-Nov-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> here can be a few traps ... clown, dog with bandage, dog with pizza, mountain / root ...

[03-Nov-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> too many words can be applied to these pictures.

[03-Nov-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> not  mountain

[03-Nov-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> volcano, vulcan ...

[03-Nov-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> my guess first five words after moon are kmd ecosystem coins

[03-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> kmd haven't clowns in ecosystem )

[03-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> i think girls with mcdonald bitcoinhush (btch)

[03-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> or dogs

[03-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> @Voight why do you think "clown with girls" = btch ?

[03-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i believe this is less kmd related that it is meme related

[03-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> +1 ... it's meme related ...

[03-Nov-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> @Decker  hahah i don't know man

[03-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Decker already coded a brute force script üòÇ

[03-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i was going to  do that but need the right words for that üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> brute force only solves the order problem üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Well, he created his own word list

[03-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> With possible options.

[03-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Pretty genius

[03-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> good job then üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i thought i'll be smart enough to figure out without a script. üòÑ i failed myself.
