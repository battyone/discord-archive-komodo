[cheeweon#5786] after  adding zilla to agama wallet first, when ever loging  in agama,   do i have to add zilla newly ?

[31-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] when you have loggeg into Agama using the right seed/privkey you can activate other coins like ZILLA when you need to

[31-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] just make sure to use correct seed/privkey

[paddycy#4865] Hi guys, is anyone aware of any incubation programs for the blockchains that chainzilla is currently supporting?

[03-Sep-18 12:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @paddycy t.me/totemtribe can you please clarify?

[03-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[paddycy#4865] @PTYX for example WAN chain has an incubation program where they sponsor some startups that wish to implement blockchain, if they qualify their standards that is

[03-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's something that we are talking about and planning but it's a few months away from implementing because we already have 2 projects we're preparing this year and I'd like to get our apps ready before we onboard anyone else. The plan is to create a sort of competition in which each quarter we are presented with a range of projects or companies looking to implement blockchain. we filter out the best project and help them launch at minimal cost.

[03-Sep-18 04:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @Unknown @Unknown @paddycy t.me/totemtribe @Unknown Welcome guys! Let me know if you have any questions!

[gfhhgj#1929] Hello curious about the airdrop for KMD

[03-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] should we have an equal balance of KMD to ZILLA?

[03-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] nevermind

[03-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] just read the pinned post

[03-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] wish i would have known i needed to keep 500 in a wallet 🤦

[03-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] everyone No zilla listed in my wallet, how to check if airdrop was successful?

[03-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] check from block explorer first. enter the address where you held more than 500 KMD into zillaexplorer.io and from there you can see how much ZILLA you got

[03-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and btw pinging the whole channel to ask a question is not good manners

[03-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @Unknown

[03-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @crumb did you get that @ everyone?

[03-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I thought we deactivated the ability to tag everyone

[03-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] no, but this is general principle

[03-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] OK just making sure

[03-Sep-18 09:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] not to get people into bad habits

[shnu#0359] 😉 cheers!

[04-Sep-18 04:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] @crumb thanks for the info.. I am not aware that ‘everyone’ sends a ping to all.. will make sure not to use it going forward unless needed...

[04-Sep-18 04:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] I checked and there’s some zilla received to that address but how to check the same  in the wallet ?

[04-Sep-18 06:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[paddycy#4865] @Instel7 thank you!

[04-Sep-18 01:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown you have to import the privatekeys into the native wallet or use the seed and activate the zilla wallet

[04-Sep-18 02:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Seko#7408] Will the Chameleon Wallet be compatible with the Ledger and will it be possible to receive rewards?

[04-Sep-18 03:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The ledger integration will take time but it's on the list of features. The v2 of Chameleon will have ledger integration.

[04-Sep-18 03:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Rewards for Komodo will be available in mobile and desktop.

[04-Sep-18 03:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Seko#7408] Thx

[04-Sep-18 03:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Things we are working on: Website 2.0, Bosque Guardian blockchain and dashboard, Abee Ride smart contract review and advisorship prior to the ICO, and Chameleon.
