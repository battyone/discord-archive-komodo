[George#8986] will they announce it from the official komodo twitter page?

[17-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] komodo already announced hyper several times üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Retweeted... üëç

[17-Jul-18 12:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] ah okey

[17-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] HyperDEX is still in a soft launch stage. when it will have a proper launch, they'll probably all shout it from the rooftops

[17-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'm sure they will but I'm getting ahead of the curve

[17-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] more exposure is always good

[17-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] indeed

[17-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] PTYX I have 1 question about chainzilla

[17-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] so can any one, without any programming skills create a blockchain with the chainzilla platform?

[17-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If pass our initial interview yes

[17-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't condone launching blockchains for people with lack of teams to provide it maintenance, community, or utility.

[17-Jul-18 12:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] Ye sounds logical

[17-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] But wont people say its not true decentralized if you can decide who gets to create a blockchain?

[17-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] chainzilla is just helping with the process to create your stuff on komodo, nem, erc20, qtum platforms

[17-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] you don't have to use them.  chainzilla is not going to be a blockchain platform on it's own in a traditional sense. they just help companies/projects to apply it to their specific situation

[17-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's never meant to be decentralized

[17-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are a company

[17-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] And we provide a service to other businesses. We use decentralized technology to create the blockchains and apps for our clients but the process of choosing our clients is not decentralized

[17-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We must adhere to strict rules. We must know who we are building for and where the funds are coming from. Our clients go through a KYC process.

[17-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Just out of curiosity.. how many hours a day are kmd and zilla devs dedicating towards the projects.. coding etc.. must be enormous no? üò±

[17-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] 24 üòÇ

[17-Jul-18 12:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We've only been around for 2 months. Currently we are working with Komodo and NEM. So the time is split between the two.

[17-Jul-18 12:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] In terms of marketing and the apps we are working oj

[17-Jul-18 12:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But yes it's a full time thing

[17-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] My full time thing is 8h a day at work...

[17-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] what is this?

[17-Jul-18 12:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] the action was on a different channel üòÑ

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] yeah sorry for that hehe

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @Catalyst at least you got lucky this time

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Was there an airdrop?

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] Yeeeeeah

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Where???

[17-Jul-18 12:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Always another channel so bots arent able to grab it

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @brainland why do you paste your address over and over

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you were included in the airdrop we just had

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] FOMO üòÑ

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Why i missed ir?

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] ohhhh!!! so that's why

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are doing airdrops in temporary channels now

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] it was not here it was in bounty2 section

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] My address is alway on standby. I mistakenly press "enter" at times

[17-Jul-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to deter the terminators

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] once the drop is done, the channel is deleted

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] lol

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it prevents bots from adjusting to the channel. people complained about bots, so i found a solution

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] that's why i pasted my address in general and then thought wot is happening then say @Cryptoon  tag and went there straigh

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] I will miss them all then

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Just delete the whole channel. Lets start afresh üòÑ

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] there are other parameters the bot looks for too

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] typing your address doesnt make sense, as it's in a channel that doesnt exist yet

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[TLMTroublemaker#2623] Thats good üëç

[17-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] ^ exactly

[17-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] How to notice an airdrop then.. have to check channels?

[17-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] check sounds and unread messages

[17-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] While being in a channel .. there is no sound..

[17-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] hmm, i don't know

[17-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Only when you are out of discord there will be sound.. tried it

[17-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] When the bot comes alive it does an @ everyone

[17-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] so, just watch unread messages very closely

[17-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] It pings you

[17-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] i think you can set it to vibrate when there is @ everyone thing

[17-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Ah my phone is on mute ...

[17-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Shame

[17-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] the phone will vibrate

[17-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Not mine.. its turned of
