[24-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[raghavmehra#1454] And how much is 1 Chainzilla worth?

[24-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] 1/3 th of 1 kmd for now.. or 0.5$ ish

[24-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] Or just buy ico

[24-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] If you are long term holder of kmd it is a free gift :)

[24-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[raghavmehra#1454] I read in the annoucements page that if I have 500 kmd I get 4.8 Zilla. Is that right?

[24-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CVIII#3171] As it is now.. yes

[24-Jul-18 10:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] Can I buy zilla now for hyperdex in the amount of 500?

[24-Jul-18 10:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] You can yes. But there is limited amount available on hyperDex

[24-Jul-18 10:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] & already day I got stuck with the swap kmd> zilla

[24-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] I could not buy today even 1 coin, but yesterday I got 60

[24-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] wow nice

[24-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] what price

[24-Jul-18 10:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] 2.7 zilla - 1 kmd

[24-Jul-18 10:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] that's actually nice 0.37 kmd for each piece of zilla

[24-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[26-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[userpike#6501] I got it also. I think it's legit

[26-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @JvdP it was him don't worry

[26-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Yep, it's legit.

[26-Jul-18 06:48 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
why you use external page for subscription ?

[26-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] what was the source of the email addresses?

[26-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JvdP#8992] But that's super-easy to spoof

[26-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i didn't mean that üòõ

[26-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] where did they collect the addresses from?

[26-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JvdP#8992] Ah. I think from the Slack signup.

[26-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] ah, ok

[26-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JvdP#8992] At least that's the only place I gave this address to.

[26-Jul-18 06:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i thought that too, but just in case wanted to know from source

[26-Jul-18 06:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] That website is from an email marketing tool we're using

[26-Jul-18 06:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] For distributing our newsletter

[26-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @Instel7 could you confirm where did you collect our addresses from tho? i don't mind the email, but i'm usually allergic to spam and so i would like to know how my address ended up in an email campaign.

[26-Jul-18 06:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Anyway would be good to share this msg in ann here + write on email about the address source to be 100% clear

[26-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Sure, wait for ptyx to be online he'll surely answer that

[26-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[miles#6381] @st3rling0x i have a KMD > Zilla swap that stuck from earlier and failed - cant seem to get anything through today

[26-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] have tried a few different amounts - most is just unmatched - but the one that matched never made it to step 3  - just fyi

[26-Jul-18 11:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] ok I'll check fast to see if I see anything

[bluemagestrut#3169] can‚Äôt find a match on hyper. i did get some trades several hours earlier

[26-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] I just reboots the bob

[26-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @st3rling0x - got a match  and made it to step 3 this time - but now it seems to have gone to sleep

[26-Jul-18 01:38 PM] st3rling0x#1568
stop trading for now. we r not sure what the issue is. ive seen two reports of similar behavior

[26-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] no worries - no biggie, just wanted to let you know

[26-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] thank you üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] yesterday the manager from digitalprice.io tested zilla and said it was successfully added. it will be live soon for anyone that want to trade

[26-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626] @PTYX  Why not stating your price in Komodo? There is time for your ICO and by that time Komodo may be different in usd terms.

[26-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I pegged it in USD because we have to use the funds to develop the apps, pay for marketing, and operations.

[26-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] my hope is that KMD is worth alot more by then and all KMD holders will be able to get more ZILLA

[26-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] amen to that

[26-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] if i had some more cash - a few days back was a steal when BTC took off and alts dipped

[26-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] still good to buy now as well
