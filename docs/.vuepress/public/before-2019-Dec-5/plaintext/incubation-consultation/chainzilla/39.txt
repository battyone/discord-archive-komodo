[Faisal#8405] i have zero correction too

[01-Aug-18 12:48 PM] PTYX#6840
no, that is most likely becuase you are using native

[01-Aug-18 12:48 PM] PTYX#6840

^ya

[01-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it seems some clients got banned with the new update

[01-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] all my spv nodes and backup servers didn't have issues

[01-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but my personal wallet did

[01-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] there was an update a few days ago. i assume it's because of that

[01-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] How to resolve this? üòÉ

[01-Aug-18 01:11 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
i'm not running the command in agama i just synced it

[01-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] right now there isn't much we can do other than wait for a new release. however, if you have your privatekeys you can use SPV if you need to make a transaction

[01-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] backup your wallet.dat as always

[01-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] All your wallet.dats. There are multiple wallet.dats in each asset folder

[02-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] I have a question and I hope someone can help me...I try to understand from technical view Komodo against stellar

[02-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] I  argue with someone that stellar in his point of view is scalable and decentralized

[02-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[bogybogy#3962] Where I know stellar is fork from ripple

[02-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[02-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[traiderqwerty#3252] Hi, I installed Agama on Linux, but there I do not have the opportunity to create a zilla wallet, what is my error?

[02-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] it is sufficient if you just create a KMD address. if i give a very simplified example, you can think KMD address as a multi-currency bank account. account number stays the same, but you can store different currencies on the same address.

[02-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] again this is a very simplified analogy and technically inaccurate, but for new people it can be explained this way

[02-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @traiderqwerty use the KMD address that you got and you can just activate the Chainzilla through Agama UI later.

[02-Aug-18 01:02 PM] traiderqwerty#3252
to activate zilla should i download the full blockchain komodo? but if I have a sid phrase for a zilla wallet, can I just run it in lite mode without native komodo?

[02-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] spv is enough. you don't need to run native

[02-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Spv works well and we have plenty of servers running

[02-Aug-18 01:05 PM] traiderqwerty#3252
but what I missed ?,  because I do not have zilla in activate?

[02-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] what version Agama are you using?

[02-Aug-18 01:05 PM] traiderqwerty#3252
Last

[02-Aug-18 01:05 PM] PTYX#6840
Then you should see ChainZilla in the Activate Coin list

[02-Aug-18 01:06 PM] PTYX#6840
If you're not on the latest version, you won't see it in the list

[02-Aug-18 01:06 PM] PTYX#6840
He latest version is here artifacts.supernet.org/latest

[02-Aug-18 01:06 PM] traiderqwerty#3252
is there any option in the settings that should be included so that zilla is available?

[02-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] Chainzilla should be available 'out-of-the-box'. no need to do anything special

[02-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working on our standalone wallet

[02-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It takes time

[02-Aug-18 01:10 PM] PTYX#6840
For now Agama should work fine though

[02-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] log in using your list of seedwords in 'Lite mode'

[02-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and then you can activate additional coins

[02-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[traiderqwerty#3252] Ok thanksüëçüòâ
