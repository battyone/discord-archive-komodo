[Faisal#8405] you can i think set it to vibrate for a specific channel

[17-Jul-18 01:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] like you can set it to vibrate when there is a tag in chainzilla channel

[17-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] We just had our meeting with NEMüòÄ

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] That was quick

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] How‚Äôd it go?

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] How was it yea?

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Zilla to the moon?

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] @bo .. do the same with btc - kmd?

[17-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] NEM or NIM (nimiq)?

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] btc fees are high, I wouldnt do it if you arent trading for at least .5 btc

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Other coins are alright

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] ChainZilla will be working in a more official basis with NEM

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] LTC - ETH

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] dont know if ETH is supported by hyper yet

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] PTYX, sounds like a good meeting üòâ

[17-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] wow that's great news @PTYX !

[17-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[17-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] What will you do for NEM? Or what will they do for you?

[17-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Komodo is the Minimum Viable Blockchain and NEM is the minimum viable token

[17-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] 2 seperate platforms to cater to separate markets

[17-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not everyone will want to launch a native blockchain.

[17-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Collaboration with NEM will bring us exposure to their huge community

[17-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] I may have a need for a securities token soon.

[17-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] I may have a need for a securities token soon.

[17-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] One thing nem offers that Komodo doesn't is private blockchains. Which are becoming a thing.

[17-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Or a "permissioned ledger"

[tolken#2655] Good to know, thanks PTYX

[17-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[BlackzetSS#9025] @PTYX  it's really cool !!!

[17-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] might be a better option than eth for what I need

[17-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It depends. Eth is good for complex smart contracts

[17-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Although QTum might be the way to go since it's erc20 compatible

[17-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] You can port an ETH smart contract to QTum

[17-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[castle32#9955] What is the difference between ARDR and KMD?

[17-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] @PTYX  I‚Äôm gathering specs from some people in a company, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what they want to do yet, but things like managing shareholder accounts, dispersing distributions. That sort of thing. Ultimately if the company goes public, making the shares available as a security on exchange.

[17-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] I don‚Äôt think they need their own blockchain. Seems overkill.

[17-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Awesome, send over the information when it's ready to hello@chainzilla.io and we'll take it from there. If we close a deal you qualify for a referral fee of 10% of the total.

[Robert Naus#9564] faucet is not working for me right now

[17-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] it should work, give about half a minute or minute and try again

[17-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] for me it worked on a 5th try or something like that

[17-Jul-18 05:57 PM] PTYX#6840
@pbca26 can you let us know if we need a plumber?

[17-Jul-18 06:04 PM] PTYX#6840

[17-Jul-18 06:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] maybe it's just me, but i don't think these kinds of price movements are healthy. this tends to bring out the FOMO crowds and all kinds of other weirdos

[17-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] better slow and steady

[17-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] Btc is skyrocketing

[17-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] yeah, let's hope so

[17-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] the market is still relatively small, so you when you have deep enough pockets, you can take the market up or down as you please

[17-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] when we get to trillions marketcap, i will be much harder to move it so much

[17-Jul-18 10:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Can create a little fomo train.. then we get up in the morning.. seeing it went up a bit more and some will fomo here etc.. üòÇ

Thats how i saw the stockmarketcrash evolve in 2007.. but in reversed way ofcourse..

[17-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Was there an airdrop?

[17-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Or was my phone showing old notifications?

[17-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] Silent but deadly

[17-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] @Cabey yep, there was. In #bounty2

[Jonathan#3687] Skynet is getting smarter in it's tactics üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] @PTYX would you consider leaving the channels for a day or two after the drop? It shows they actually happen and doesn't cause confusion üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't see how that is necessary since they are recorded on the blockchain so you can verify I paid them out.

[17-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If we use the channel more than once it increases the chances of a bot adjusting

[17-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The bot tags everyone when it does an airdrop so it should ping everyone with a notification setup for direct mentions

[18-Jul-18 12:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Oh I'm not suggesting you reuse channels

[18-Jul-18 12:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Just avoids confusion when people like me see an alert to come here then can't find any record of it in here

[18-Jul-18 12:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Also I'm not suggesting Zilla isn't being paid out, I've caught a few I know it is üòÑ

[18-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] oh sure

[18-Jul-18 12:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
