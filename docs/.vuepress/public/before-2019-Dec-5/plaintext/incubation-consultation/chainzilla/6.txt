[KomodoBo#8264] Nice video. Shared the Twitter post. I'm looking forward to the interview

[13-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Bardzo piekne

[13-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Thank you @Herman

[13-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I watched the video, nice and simple;) I think all that chainzilla needs next 5 month is to enlist more team members, after all people who will be looking into chainzilla ICO will wanna see at least half dozen team members.

[13-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Sign me up as C.O.W. boardmember

[13-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Chieff Of Whatever ðŸ˜‚

[13-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] That will certainly help ðŸ˜‰

[13-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @PTYX  very good video overview. I shared it to my FB group and will tweet it out when I get a chance.

[13-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Robert Naus we can run an ICO with 2 people.

[13-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't know what you mean by having 14 people

[13-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Also, the members on the website are core members, we are working with CryptoGeeks and other advisors in regards to infrastructure.

[13-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the problem is the misinformation around running an ico

[13-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] if the infrastructure is setup properly you can do everything with minimal man power.

[13-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I said 6 ðŸ˜‰ itâ€™s given..as you offering services and when you get interest how do you expect people to believe you will be able to deliver on several projects at once with just 2 people Charles? Itâ€™s kinda must..I think my point of view is clear.

[13-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it's 7 of us right now

[13-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] plus all the outsource

[13-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] Thatâ€™s cool just web says only 2 atm so once u got all advisors there it will be more clear

[13-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] Trying to see it from common person perspective

[13-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Bitcoin started with like 2 or 3 devs in the early days :p

[13-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Robert is right in the sense that to evaluate ICO's many people look mainly at the team. But I think a good team with 7 members is better than an average team with 20 members (or only 2 good members among them).

[13-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] You can't make the team bigger just for some people to like the project more

[13-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i'll take it into  consideration

[13-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[frogman#3992] Just to make sure I understand this right - you offer turnkey blockchain project development services for novices?

[13-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[frogman#3992] What happens when the chain breaks or there's an issue that necessitates developer involvement?

[13-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] in exchagne for a small fee you can list my name and linkedin profile as an advisor on your site ðŸ˜‰

[13-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown first of all we don

[13-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] even a DIY has to undergo an interview and approval buy us

[13-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If the DIY setup has no team, i won

[13-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] because who will we train to take care of it?

[13-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We do offer add-on services for code base updates and monitoring services but that is not enough so the project definitely needs a team and infrastructure.

[13-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] goodby oksi

[13-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Alecandro a wallet you own the private keys to

[13-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Ideally agama

[13-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Alecandro#1179] Okay cool so the agama wallet is good t

[13-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Alecandro#1179] Dope

[13-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @PTYX do exchange wallets get the airdrop as well?

[13-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] No because you don't own the private keys the exchange does
