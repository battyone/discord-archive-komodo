[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Transfer all to one adress and try to sell

[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's not really stealing per se

[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] and later people say that the project did not take off and there were scams and frauds

[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Just not really ethical

[16-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 'exploiting the system'

[16-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I have not stolen anything, I have bought and used the faucet with my directions manually and who says something else that proves what it says

[16-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] It's up to the maintainers of the faucet to have an opinion and take action if they want

[16-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] nice chainzilla promotion

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] He might have bought the ICO.....

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] the ico isnt live yet

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Else, explain how he exlpoited the faucet

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so no.

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] ffs

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I don‚Äôt like this, this should not be possible really,since it is,not much u can do but shouldn‚Äôt be.

[16-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Look at this transaction that went into his address

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 230 transactions of 0,1 zilla

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Let the guy be. Go exploit too

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] To his main adress

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Are you in on it too?

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Otherwise you can see why this is not really a good way to behave

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] he still wanted to sell here üòÑ

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] funny ppl here LOL

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Am not but I don't know why its now a topic

[16-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] 82,25$ üòÑ

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] not really fair for people that want to legitimately claim the faucet with one address

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But bump into an empty faucet

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Because some guys are exploiting it like this

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] That's why it's a topic.

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] ok

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Has the bot airdrop ended here?

[16-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] Stop accusing, you have no evidence, I have not done anything that is bad, I have claimed as any user in my directions manually the reward of the faucet and I can pass if the owners of the faucet wanted a record of how I made it manually, as well as the purchase agreements I've made, so shut up

[16-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] http://explorer.chainzilla.io/tx/a08aeee21444267a90d047f45f0135077d72f2f52448f24df2cbcd347f2d5af0

[16-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] it's a valid discussion i think

[16-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This is evidence?

[16-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] There are 235 payments in one transaction, there is not way to do this manually

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] That is not proof of absolutely nothing, just that to save commissions I have made the transactions together

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 251 payments, sorry

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] PTYX appears, let it block this address and faucet

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] that all

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] If there is a genius, it is called having the Zilla wallet in native mode where you can do that completely manually, stop accusing without having any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it works.

[16-Jul-18 02:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] to check and explain

[16-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] To more than one of here it seems that he would like the centralization and modify the transactions to his liking, it seems that they do not understand what the blockchain is, very sad ...

[16-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Cryptoon - Today at 16:03
Nah dont block address, that would be blockchain censorship, which I also don't like

[16-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Is what I said here

[16-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I just said it wasnt ethical

[16-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] The only evidence you provide is transactions, which do not prove that the addresses of origin are mine or that have not been claimed manually, therefore you only say absurd conspiracies

[16-Jul-18 02:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] @castle32  Maybe you did it by hand but the point is that you wanted to sell it here

[16-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] you're smart

[16-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I know nothing about how it all works but u simply abusing it. Fine u can do that, get away with it but don‚Äôt play some kinda hero bcs u just little weasel that just can‚Äôt play fair.

[16-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I want to sell them because I prefer to have KMD that Zilla that give me more liquidity to exchange

[16-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[deathsgrip#5269] What‚Äôs faucet and how do you use?
