[Mastermind#1578] hello

[15-Jul-18 02:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I've told a few people regarding our first premier contract which is with a conservation project. We are working closely with rafael's team to prepare their blockchain on Komodo

[15-Jul-18 02:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] They are also in the process of building the website since the past half of a year they have been focused on the infrastructure and physical part of the project.

[15-Jul-18 03:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] hi so i have never really been in airdrops and such , i recently got my KMD from swap and saw this accouncement in KMD channel how exactly this airdrop thing works again ? do i need a zilla wallet to see them ? or do something specific ?

[15-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you have the latest Agama wallet you will see that ZILLA is activated

[Mastermind#1578] @PTYX my wallet version is v0.2.39 beta

[15-Jul-18 03:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] You need to upgrade to v0.2.41

[15-Jul-18 03:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] how do we update again ? download it again or is there a update option i dont see in agma ?

[15-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @yorklab thanks i just google but confused about update process,  1 instructions says  uninstall and then install new download, other website says download and select option reinstall current version  which one is the right way ?

[15-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yeah you download the new version of the zip file. Then you extract and run. Then when prompted select reinstall current version

[15-Jul-18 03:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Itll show it uninstalling the old version and then reinstalling the new one, but your wallet remains intact even if its uninstalled

[15-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] thanks doing it now just downloaded

[15-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Before though, you should back up your wallet.dat file if you're using native

[15-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yea did that

[15-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] If you're using spv or lite mode you wont have a wallet.dat

[15-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @sir send me your ZILLA address, i'll send you a small tip for helping

[Cryptodamus#6225] No problem, want more people involved!

[15-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so once this is done i open my usualy KMD in native and i see Zilla too in there ? or do i need to activate zilla seperately ?

[15-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] No you select activate coin and zilla will be in the dropdown

[15-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] oh ok

[15-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Then just copy paste your zilla address and back it up somewhere

[15-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Then when PTYX initiates an airdrop, you can just copy paste your address in here and you'll get some $ZILLA

[15-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @sir ok thanks

[15-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i wonder if i have missed any other drops of this kind on agma i never activated any other coins before

[15-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] wait uninstalling agama will it delete all the downloaded blockchain data also ?

[15-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @GoldmanSocks thanks i am using native mode though i got the setps to activate coins but was wondering if ill be downloaded whole chain data again ?

[15-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am currently on the popup which says " do you want to uninstall agama and all its modules ? "

[15-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] Native mode should download the whole chain, however if you had one previously downloaded it should pick that up and run with whats already there. If windows app data is not stored in program files so if you uninstall or remove all modules it should not delete wallet data etc. To be safe open up a file explorer in windows and type in %appdata% look for the folder for agama and backkup/copy first to a safe location usb stick etc.

[15-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yes the chain state files remain iirc

[15-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Which means itll only have to resync for like 15-20 minutes

[15-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i have backed up wallet but not chain data though

[15-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i dont want to download the whole thing again my net sucks

[15-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Maybe less

[15-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] it worked üòÉ thanks

[15-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so if i activate zilla on native it will use the chain data already there from kmd ? or download it again seperately ?

[15-Jul-18 03:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] @Mastermind will use what is already there, however it has to resync/verify and that will take a while to complete but not as long as a download of the entire chain.

[15-Jul-18 04:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] thanks üòÉ or i can use lite for zilla but i think as i already have kmd chain data i can go with native itself

[DJ-Crypto#8569] Any way you do it is totally up to you. Fast = lite   hurry up and wait/secure = native

[15-Jul-18 04:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] what daemon parm to choose ?

[15-Jul-18 04:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i dont know about what exactly that means

[15-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] none means foreground = keep the app open/updates  background = it runs without being a "active window, so minimize it"

[15-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] oh gotcha

[15-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] I do background....alwasy at the back of the bus anyways....lol

[15-Jul-18 04:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] then if I hit close window by mistake its still running.....
