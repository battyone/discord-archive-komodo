[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> Honestly, I love it. Not that I have any, but i hated MEW hence did not really hold any ERC tokens or ETH. Now that it is in Agama, I might get more comfortable with that system.

[07-Nov-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> This whole metamask & MM based exchanges, the gas, spend $5 on transfer so you can sell you tokens for $2 didn't really work out for me üòÑ

[07-Nov-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PeLe2288> so how are fees goin to work in agama for erc20?

[07-Nov-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> I trust the KMD team and Agama dev much more than any other wallet providers

[07-Nov-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I reached out to the sequence team and they seemed interested so it's a possibility. They have some interesting solutions for compliant blockchains for payment apps

[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> that's a tough one. our development team is pushing to have the beta ready before december ends. i mentioned some time ago that we had to push the delivery data back around 7 weeks. The graphic design phase took longer than expected to iron out.

[08-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> so we should be able to test both types of devices when we launch beta
