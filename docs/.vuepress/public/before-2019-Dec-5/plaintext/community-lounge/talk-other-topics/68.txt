also, the JS that is compiled in C goes to a 32 bit machine model, last I checked. so to do 64bit calcs it will be a lot more than twice as slow

[04-Apr-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
doing 64bit in JS as efficiently as possible vs. a -O3 compiled C on a 64bit processor would likely be close to 10x

[04-Apr-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the latest JS -> compiled wasm has a 64bit machine model, then i can see it reaching 25% to 50% the speed

The amount of corporate welfare going on in this country that is just accepted and unquestioned is stupid. Especially the dairy subsidy. Remember when trump was getting mad at Canada for tarrifing American dairy. They literally did that to even the playing ground, because unlike America Canada does not subsidize it's dairy industry.

Over the past five years, while studying bitcoin, I have often heard arguments that are hard to agree with from smart young friends. If you dig into the reasons, you can't explain yourself in the end except the logic that someone you trust believes. 

blockchain world has a new rose-light dream abound, which has to do with the reality that one wants to hide: poor knowledge and full of morale.

The ideal that is too good to be real and the worship of someone who is too noble to be human is the Holy Grail of a young day. the problem is that once you drink the Holy Grail, you can't "gaining knowledge by the study of things" with your head, and once you're done with it, you might have to pour in your three to 40s for a restoration campaign.

I would like to pay tribute to those who chose to struggle for the truth that contradicts the majority's beliefs.

[06-Apr-19 08:42 AM] designer#4893
the reason why global IT companies like IBM want to design a platform that integrates logistics and finance based on blockchain is also because they need a global supply chain free of government interference. 

of course, a strong government like the United States can disable the system by blocking IBM headquarters or prosecuting executives. 

however, it is difficult for the Venezuelan or Zimbabwe governments to stop WorldWire in that way. blockchain will allow a large number of global citizen who have been unable to participate in the global supply chain. 

the reason is that blockchain allows the citizens to overcome government's interference.
