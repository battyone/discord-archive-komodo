there are many different qualities of a leader, but one of the important things is that understanding the "game environment" you play is important. 

In particular, the most important of these frameworks are "zero-sum" and "positive-sum" games. I play a 'positive-sum' game, but if I use a strategy optimized for the 'zero-sum' game, I think it's a short cut to ruin.

I think its important to focus on the positive tech progression on the Komodo platform and less about the 'exit Sam' over at K64. This Antara release is very significant and will be seen as its deserved come the time the market recovers. Looks like good and positive information is flowing from most of the ecosystem projects too which have leveraged the Komodo tech. Utrum looks pretty nice, ARRR is as private as private gets, Redfox is building companies on the tech, KMDLabs looks like doing some serious tinkering too. All very good news. And thats just a few that spring to mind.
