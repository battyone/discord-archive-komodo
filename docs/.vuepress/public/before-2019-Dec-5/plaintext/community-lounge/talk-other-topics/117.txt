[19-Sep-19 03:15 PM] Layla32#5958
Hello

[19-Sep-19 03:15 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes but the shell phrases he uses really have a very hollow ring - maybe I am wrong, but it appears to me as if he doesnt have much of an audience left there anyway

[19-Sep-19 03:15 PM] LocoMB#8593
hi Layla

[19-Sep-19 03:16 PM] dan.#2473
you cant really discuss things there, honestly, without getting banned.

[19-Sep-19 03:16 PM] LocoMB#8593

[19-Sep-19 03:17 PM] LocoMB#8593

[19-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Layla32#5958
Premier offre is 1,300,000 for 3 bitcoin and yesterday night he say 2,500,000 for 3xbt

[19-Sep-19 03:17 PM] LocoMB#8593

[19-Sep-19 03:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
- Layla - please save your money

[19-Sep-19 03:18 PM] LocoMB#8593

[19-Sep-19 03:18 PM] dan.#2473
