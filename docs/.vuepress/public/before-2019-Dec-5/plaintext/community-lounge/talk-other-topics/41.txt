```It would probably shock the average person on the street to discover that the government collects more tax from cigarettes ($9.8 billion) than it collects from tax on superannuation ($6.8 billion), over double what it collects from Fringe Benefits Tax ($4.4 billion) and over thirteen times more tax than it does from our oil fields ($741 million).
Turnbull is increasing the tax on cigarettes by 12.5% a year for the next four years. ```

@ejlfox @rahaf84427714 @samahhadid @amnesty @hrw you should support @elonmusk a lot. When he succeeds with electric energy there will be less wars for energy sources, less corruption (like Saudi Arabia) and overall less people suffering. @amnestyusa @Anti_Slavery
