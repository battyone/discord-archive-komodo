`basically any substance in excess is dangerous to your body`

`common sense is not enough?`

[15-May-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```100% of the population is weak to coke
it's just a biological fact```
a fact is a thing that can be supported with evidence, "common sense" is not evidence (as it's subjective and not objective)

The Neurobiology of Cocaine Addiction
Cocaine produces its psychoactive and addictive effects primarily by acting on the brain’s limbic system, a set of interconnected regions that regulate pleasure and motivation. An initial, short-term effect—a buildup of the neurochemical ...

What makes certain individuals particularly vulnerable to addiction and others relatively resistant? Extensive epidemiological studies show that roughly half of a person’s risk for addiction to cocaine or other drugs is genetic (Goldstein, 2001; Nestler and Malenka, 2004). This degree of heritability exceeds that of many other conditions that are considered highly heritable, such as type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, hypertension, and breast cancer.

[15-May-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ranked by....and societal harms.`
again, this is a subjective measure

[15-May-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it talks about "others relatively resistant" to cocaine -> not 100%

[15-May-19 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Henningfield ranked nicotine as the most addictive substance` <- from your same link
But since no "societal harms" it's not a "issue" and it anecdotally kills more more people than all other drugs combined.

[15-May-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many billions of people are addicted to caffeine?

`Maybe i'm using wrong words.`
You're not using the wrong words, but rather adding an emphasis to it that isn't real

[15-May-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
oxygen dihidroxide is probably the most addicted chemical

there are more factors to a drug being an "issue" than the drug itself and/or addictiveness

[15-May-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
many of those factors are purely societal

[15-May-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can also see with my own eyes how removing personal responsibility and declaring something an "issue" is potentially more socially "dangerous" than any drug

[15-May-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can assume that robbing banks and getting away with it is addictive, does that mean that bank robbers should get a societal pass and we should outlaw banks on that purpose alone?

[15-May-19 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that's on the politics spectrum, i'm not for policing drugs, i think it's stupid and counter-productive`
To that end we agree

[15-May-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've never robbed a bank, but I've known many criminals and I've never met one that didn't enjoy the "high" of doing the act

```The objective of CESAR's Maryland Hospital Study, which began in 2016, was to identify illicit drugs that caused overdoses in patients at two hospital emergency departments in Maryland. Emergency physicians were battling a spike in accidental drug overdoses and related deaths, thought to be linked to a group of designer drugs called synthetic cannabinoids that mimic the chemicals in marijuana, known on the street as Spice or K2. ```
They started with the premise of ` these drugs are bad`, so there's that...

I guess. We were trekking for hours and I asked one of the guides for a leaf to see what it did. It just made my mouth numb and my heart race. We got back to the village and ate dinner. I didn't feel any other effects but not something I'd do daily.

HERE TO BRING THE FREEDOM

[16-May-19 01:00 PM] designer#4893
<IMO, bitcoin development scenario>

bitcoin development scenario I think is largely classified into the first half and the second half, or more specifically, in six stages. 

First, the first half is as follows. first, geeky and criminals who are well-versed in computers, and a small group of young people are dealing with bitcoin. this is the period from 2009 when the bitcoin was born to before the bubble in 2017. 

secondly, companies that are interested in the smell of money while bubbling and bit coin demonstrate commercial viability. However, due to the lack of regulation, the moral hazard of companies dealing with bitcoin is serious, resulting in various incidents. this is the situation since 2017. 

third, as trust in the bitcoin market gradually recovers, it is incorporated into the regulatory financial system. as government regulations are strengthened and institutionalization is carried out, the complicants are eliminated. financial institutions treat bitcoin as legitimate investment assets and include bitcoin in their investment portfolios. from now on, it is likely to be realized mainly in the western region within the next five years.

until the first half, the bitcoin is treated as a speculative asset. however, since the bitcoin market has matured and the volatility has decreased, the bitcoin has become a currency since the latter half of the year. I think the second half of bitcoin development is as follows.

[16-May-19 01:01 PM] designer#4893
fourth, the bitcoin acts as an internet key. bitcoin serves as a measure of international value and return of all types of digital currencies. In the digital world, a bitcoin-based system is realized. Internet companies and financial companies cooperate to actively develop businesses that utilize bitcoin, and internet companies encroach on retail finance. since then, central banks and the IMF have begun to seriously consider holding a bitcoin. 

fifth, the global financial system collapses due to the financial crisis, and heads of states meet to discuss measures. depending on the level of gold and bitcoin held by each country, the right to speak at the negotiation table is different. world currencies are emerging under the dominance of hegemony and bitcoin directly or indirectly affects the new global monetary system. the central bank and the IMF incorporate the bit coin into the reserve currency. this is the time when gold and bitcoin coexist. 

sixth, as the transition to the digital age accelerates, digital gold bitcoin gradually replace the role of gold. gold is competing with bitcoin, losing its financial function and being used only for industrial purposes or precious metals like silver.
