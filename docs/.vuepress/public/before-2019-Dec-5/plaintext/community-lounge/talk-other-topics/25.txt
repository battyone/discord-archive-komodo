we are all being monitored.

[13-Oct-18 06:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm not wrong

[13-Oct-18 06:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
yes... and that is what justifies the level of scrutiny that we are under

maybe elliptic curve cryptography or whatever the fuck is inscrutable but the coincidences and incidents have been too plentiful for me to buy that we are in a figurative #safespace here

[13-Oct-18 06:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe jl has some next level opsec but fuck man, who knows

[13-Oct-18 06:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah same here, no family no connections, constantly walking away from anything of meaning.

crypto is our last and best hope. it is an arms race.

not some nonsense by border police that "the cash is illegal" so we will take it from you, even though you did nothing wrong. how do people tolerate that?

If you bought $1000 worth of XRP in January it would now be worth $79.

If you bought $1000 worth of Bud Light in January, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for a nickel deposit, you would have $79.

I am flabbergasted.

U. Mahadev first finds how to do classical homomorphic encryption on quantum circuits, uses this to generate provably random numbers and then finds an incredibly clever way to verify quantum computations with a classical computer.
