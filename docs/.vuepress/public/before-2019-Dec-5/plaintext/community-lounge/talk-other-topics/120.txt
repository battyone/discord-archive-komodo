Ecosystem is good, if it's just bare

[21-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Priva99#5191
When CZ touches it, it becomes a money making scam

[21-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Priva99#5191
The "Stack" the bare bones of it, is a good model

[21-Sep-19 12:40 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I mean binance is good exchange. No doubt about it. And relatively "safe" for an exchange. It's just that now they only do ieo's and suck every penny away. It's like nobody else is doing any money, except binance.

[21-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Priva99#5191
We are going down guys... BTC

[21-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Priva99#5191
No I agree

[21-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Priva99#5191
He had a perfect model

[21-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Priva99#5191
He had taken the wind out of Ethereum's sails

[21-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Priva99#5191
He didn't list a ETH pairing since May 2018

[21-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Priva99#5191
But he listed bullshit IEOs

[21-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Priva99#5191
And then the DEX has like 60+ shitcoins

[21-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Priva99#5191
Nice UI

[21-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Priva99#5191
It's nice... And now he has a futures trading platform

[21-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Priva99#5191
Staking and lending

[21-Sep-19 12:43 PM] Priva99#5191
And he had to go and get greedy

[21-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Priva99#5191
Fastest to reach Angel status, in history

[21-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Markus#5464
k64 is rebranding to wash off dirty hands

[21-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Markus#5464
glad i didnt invest and get rekt

[21-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Priva99#5191
Rebranding?

[21-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Priva99#5191
They never had a brand to begin  with

[21-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I invested in k64, but I sold immediately when rfox said they didn't get the money. I only lost like 5-10%, so it's not too bad.

[21-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Markus#5464
i learn from previous mistakes that i never invest into something what is not holding their promises and actually have proof of code and activity

[21-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Priva99#5191
Like Digitex

[21-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Priva99#5191
I've seen to many of these

[21-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Priva99#5191
I always know what I'm getting into.

[21-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Priva99#5191
I had Bitconnect lol

[21-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Markus#5464
well i had bcc too but i made profit on it

[21-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Priva99#5191
I took those as well

[21-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Priva99#5191
It's only a Ponzi if u lose

[21-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Markus#5464
i got fucked by hashflare mining lost 1 bitcoin when they decided to fuck everyone and say "we wont pay cause payout exceeds maintenance fee"

[21-Sep-19 12:52 PM] Markus#5464
so only got 2 months of mining out of 12 months

[21-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Priva99#5191
But I knew I could lose all on any given day

[21-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Priva99#5191
K64 lied

[21-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I have Digitex bag too. I was already in house money with it when beta launch failed. Should have had sold all then, but didn't. So I'm still holding my "moon bag". Maybe there is still like 1% chance to success if they ever open. üòÉ

[21-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Priva99#5191
Lol bruh

[21-Sep-19 12:53 PM] Priva99#5191
Digitex?

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
He didn't show a working product or a demo, for nearly 2 years

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
And no GitHub

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
Well a GitHub with 2 repos

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
One for ICO tokens

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
One with nothing

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
Now he created a DAO?

[21-Sep-19 12:54 PM] Priva99#5191
And started as a futures exchange

[21-Sep-19 12:55 PM] Priva99#5191
Be careful with that CEO

[21-Sep-19 12:56 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Yeah, that Digitex CEO is clueless.

[21-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Priva99#5191
He's a nutcasw

[21-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Priva99#5191

[21-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Markus#5464

No, seriously. 5 years ago they said you could build scalable apps in the ICO legal document titled "TermsAndConditionsOfTheEthereumGenesisSale.pdf". 

It's since been removed from ethereum,org but there is an archive of the document.

@Aeetes You are right, Sam is a criminal psychopath. Beware for the whole group, he is not alone, with him was still @Meyse aka. Max Theyse, @Diesmaster aka. Chris van M., Wilhelmus Hendrikus F., MrKomodoWorld aka Ricardo B., and many more... I can send you the whole table, with everyone and evidence. Report the group to Politie. Have a nice Weekend

[21-Sep-19 08:18 PM] Aeetes#0080
@Geert He is alone now

[21-Sep-19 08:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont think meyse backs him anymore

[21-Sep-19 08:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And diesmaster is pretty young, not sure what his role is in it all but dont believe his intentions are bad...

[21-Sep-19 08:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Come on guys, KomodoWorld has done a lot for Komodo. When people invest lots of money in a project they tend to believe in it more and project their hope as fact because that is what they have been lead to believe. That is why you get smart people like doctors fall for Nigerian scammers.

HyperDex why nigerian scammer?? Scammers are in every country

[21-Sep-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Because the love/inheritance scams usually originate from there

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Same goes for komodoworld, I saw what he did and offered to help after the hack. He‚Äôs a solid dude

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
which are obviously scams but smart people still fall for them

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hyperdex is right

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So please do not attack victims of this scam as if they were the scammer.

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] Priva99#5191
Did he leave?

[21-Sep-19 08:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think getting tricked in a scam happens sometimes when you deal in crypto. I have been scammed multiple times.

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
cloud mining, exchange shares. It can be an insipid trap where your greed holds logic prisoner

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] wanda#4668
KomodoWorld is still with k64 and will be with it when it is k65 xD

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Priva99#5191
Did KomodoWorld leave this discord?

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For now üôÇ

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Priva99#5191
Is he really still going along with it?

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Priva99#5191
K64

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Priva99#5191
At 2 sats

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also yes, for now üôÇ

[21-Sep-19 08:31 PM] Priva99#5191
He is done here

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] Priva99#5191
He drinks the hopium

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] Priva99#5191
Too much of it

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Everyone deserves a second chance

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] Priva99#5191
But he is still there lol

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Emmanuel as well, i know that K64 was his only chance to get out of some debt, so when you are in that position, it is easier to see why people are passionate even in the face of so much pushback.

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] Priva99#5191
Emman is my friend üò•

[21-Sep-19 08:32 PM] wanda#4668
getting tricked is hard.. he did not want to see it and could leave it long befor... but still going along with k64 makes him a scammer on this point

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No it does not

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It means he was tricked

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] Priva99#5191
No it doesn't

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] Priva99#5191
He's still tricked

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] Priva99#5191
He will see the light

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are a victim in all of this, maybe more so than the rest of us that did not have anything invested

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] wanda#4668
Why can he be so blind?

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] Priva99#5191
Takes time

[21-Sep-19 08:33 PM] Priva99#5191
It has happened to all of us

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Priva99#5191
Have u never had a girlfriend that everyone told u wasn't looking out for u
