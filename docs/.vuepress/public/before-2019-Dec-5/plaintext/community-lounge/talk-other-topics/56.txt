yea I'm not sure what their PR team is like but I was reading through their correspondence and it is not the way a professional company should handle it.

I get that they probably get scammers just as much as we do in here and telegram, but I think it's reasonable to assume someone who lost their coins would be frantic.

[27-Feb-19 09:53 PM] Regnar#6164
Warith didn't handle it well either, but I get the panic. Reading through the chat logs Coinomi posted was ridiculous, they took a frantic person who claims to have lost his life savings via a backdoor that he believes coinomi put in, and expected him to cooperate by turning over everything he knew without some assurance they'd reimburse him if the flaw likely resulted in the theft. Then probably made it worse when they quoted "stolen" lol

@Deleted User I also think that Finniy is Satoshi.
Satoshi Nakamoto is most likely an intellectual from economics.
Satoshi is too economical to be regarded as an engineer.

Hal Finney, Cryptographer and Bitcoin Pioneer, Dies at 58
Mr. Finney made advancing online privacy his life‚Äôs work, and he took part in the first Bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi Nakamoto sent him 10 Bitcoins.

A suspected of Satoshi Nakamoto dies of Lou Gehrig's disease

Hal finney is an early bitcoiner.
On November 9, just a week after Satoshi's white paper, he asked a few questions about the concept of bitcoin, and when Satoshi answered, he became a bitcoinner.

He is from Caltech, and he believes that personal freedom through the Internet is in encryption technology, and he has made achievements in it.
Hal finney got a quick understanding of Bitcoin.

He asked Satoshi Nakamoto about the chain fork problem and so on. realized that Bitcoin's system is the solution he's been looking for all his life.

But he says he wants to see some official or concrete work because the white paper is not enough.
Then Satoshi said, "conversation with him was good, In persuading himself, he said, "I've already considered writing the white paper before I started writing it," and he said, "I want to show you the source code in the near future."

As a response to a genius with respect for a craftsman who's been on the same path his whole life,
It's a touching conversation.

(The question wasn't new, but thank you for asking the most necessary questions at this stage.)

Anyway, saw the New York Times down there,
In 2009, Hal finney discovered the outbreak of Lou Gehrig's
he paid for the treatment by selling the initial Bitcoin.
life of a craftsman who had to leave as soon as he met the solution he'd been looking for all his life.

If Hal finney was really Satoshi, we would have to pay tribute to a genius' humble retreat.

Low-income people don't want to venture, so  they'll take part only when they hear that they're safe around them.
One thing for sure is that now, like 1993 on the Internet, it's a very early stage with no Google or facebook.
If bitcoin survive, bitcoin will be change the world.
So it's all about checking whether Bitcoin is strong or not.
the rest are footnotes, worries, misunderstandings.

that's really strong. It is appalling to those who trample; it is wonderful to those who trust and see. 
even if was hit a strong punch, bitcoin stand up and smile.

for intellectuals, the odd currency, bitcoin, is uncomfortable. 
however, "blockchain," the principle of bitcoin's operation, is attractive. 
a neolithic man who first met the iron said, "the iron is sharper than stone, but it is useless because it melts when it touches a hot fire." 
dissolve in fire is not a weakness of iron but a strength. 
because of this, it can be combined with various instruments, making it a much more sophisticated tool than stone. 
blockchain that cut the monetary phenomenon of bitcoin is just rusted iron that does not dissolve in fire.

tokenization revolution does not ask for your permission.

tokenization is a monetary phenomenon implemented in a blockchain. 
It is engineering and humanistic.
Global companies like IBM, MS, Amazon, and Toyota are also struggling to get on the tokenization revolution, 
even as the mainstream society and you saw bitcoin as a tulip. 
this revolution does not wait for the public to realize. 
now you have to acknowledge and study the obvious fact that bitcoin is a strong and serious phenomenon.

because of the "poor quality" of journalism that only focuses on interest,
we are already very late.

If government regulation can not stop the Internet, it is natural that the government can not stop bitcoin. 
but as the Internet has changed the government, the government has also changed the Internet. 
then the government will try to change the  bitcoin more than the bitcoin changes the government. It's hard to tell who will change more and what kind of change will take place, but it is clear that it is worth nerving and watching.

evidence of Bitcoin's strength has abounded in the past. 
sadly, people think of it as a group brain rather than thinking on their own. 
the brain of a group that the majority chose ignored or rejected bitcoin, and mainstream media exaggerated only the stereotyped facts that the brain of the group chose. 
In particular, the media has disturbed the 'brain of the group' by mention the words bubble, tulip, drugs, and ransomware.
you can't understand this "serious phenomenon" unless you wake up and study on your own because the brain of the group is in a sleep of idleness.

On July 24, 2017, Bitcoin's chapter 1 ended and a new chapter began.

CFTC has licensed bitcoin-based derivatives such as futures options. people in the so-called banks of banks around the world have begun to look at Bitcoin as part of their asset list.

'Chapter 1' was perhaps an easy game.

It was a time when patience alone could pay off if one understood that Bitcoin was strong. 
but as the wall-street progresses, the previously unconcerned but belatedly realized financial 'first-class players' come to the plate with resourcefulness and abundant funds. 
If you invest recklessly, you may encounter a disaster.

One era has ended by allowing the Bitcoin futures option.
Now 'Does Bitcoin survive?' is no longer a meaningful question. 
It's time to ask seriously whether you, your company and your country can survive the Tokenization Revolution.

[02-Mar-19 03:45 PM] designer#4893
the topic of the new chapter, which will be developed after 2019, is standardization. Bitcoin, crypto-currency, blockchain and distributed-ledger platforms are now ending their birth cycle and entering a growth phase. standardized warfare is hot in the growing industry. 
In the midst of such a fierce war, mainstream media are exaggerated continue by sticking to the old view of 'Will Bitcoin survive?' 
In other words, they treat young adults who grow taller each day as premature babies who cannot come out of incubators.
It's pathetic.

funny is also people need to make sites like "skeptical science" like science was not ever skeptical in the first place

[03-Mar-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the models used to "prove" global warming used the equation (total change) - (specific list of factors) = (human contribution)

[03-Mar-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
missing from the specific list of factors were things like massive solar events, which clearly are making a lot of radiation and therefore heat that reaches the earth

[03-Mar-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i think also missing were xrays and other things, but the concept that humans are responsible for all things that are not in a specific list of factors, implies that the specific list of factors is 100% complete

[03-Mar-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
can anybody really imagine that humans are causing solar flares?

[03-Mar-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
or that c02 levels on earth causes solar flares?

[03-Mar-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
earth atmosphere used to have a lot of methane and was totally different than today, but still that doesnt affect solar flares. though it could well be that solar flares affects the earth

[03-Mar-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
unfortunately, the politics peoples realized that it would be a tough sell to get people to spend money on efforts to stop the solar flars

[03-Mar-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so they came up with the co2, which is definitely increasing, to blame for all things bad

[03-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
would we be incrementally better off if co2 levels are lower, probably, but still the global temps are most likely determined primarily via solar radiation.

[03-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so we could spend trillions of dollars to reduce the co2 levels, but it is solving the wrong problem. and it could be that short of launching massive solar energy collectors to absorb significant solar radiation, we wont be able to control the solar radiation that hits the earth

[03-Mar-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is like having a really hard to read font on a wallet that sends your passphrase to google spellcheck servers. where the bad font is the "co2" and changing the font might make the GUI easier to use, it wont affect the passphrase to the google servers issue (solar radiation fluctuations)

If the chart is not manipulated it show parameter changes against almost 1 mln years, and the pick today looks significantly higher the the past (where humans had no impact over those parameters). I agree maybe CO2 is not such a problem (until it really goes to dissolve all ice on earth) and flood big lands and cities

@Deleted User  CO2 levels depends on temperature - small change of temperature level changes allows oceans to free a lot of CO2, so these are strongly correlated, since we got a lot of water in the oceans / a lot of CO2 storage capacity.

it seems then that the temperature sets the co2 level and not the other way around

both ways probably

[03-Mar-19 10:14 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
different process can initiate changes

[03-Mar-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
say a massive set of solar flares heats things up significantly,we end up with a lot more co2. ultimately it just makes a lot more sense that earth temps are based on solar radiation levels. there was that technical youtube vid that clearly showed how the data was missing a lot of significant factors and all those attributed to humans

[03-Mar-19 10:15 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but Im not scientist  we may all be manipulated, do you know a true scientist who is not paid by some  oil companies and sounds hones ? Lobbist are surely on both sides

[03-Mar-19 10:15 AM] gt#2812
how long do solar flares last?

[03-Mar-19 10:16 AM] gt#2812
haven‚Äôt these trends been going on for decades (steady rise in temp and CO2)

[03-Mar-19 10:17 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's not  about "assigning some factors to humans" - it's simply observing parameter levels and see how big they are before us and today. IF there is significant diff today and over 1 mln years period - it's a clue that humans impact earth temperature. It's not a proof, just a clue, and only if charts / data are not manipulated.

[03-Mar-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
solar radiation levels go in cycles, some of them very long term

[03-Mar-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
a decade is no time at all to the sun

[03-Mar-19 10:19 AM] gt#2812
yeah the sun in measured in millions

[03-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the sun spins around the galactic core and some areas have more/less gases that affect how it burns

[03-Mar-19 10:20 AM] gt#2812
seems massively coincidental to have a long occurring raise in radiation along with the rise of fossil fuels

[03-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
not really

[03-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
last big ice age ends, civilization is able to start

[03-Mar-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so that probably synchronized things. anyway coincidental timing is no proof at all

[03-Mar-19 10:21 AM] gt#2812
i didn‚Äôt say proof

[03-Mar-19 10:21 AM] gt#2812
but it does seem somewhat suspicious

[03-Mar-19 10:22 AM] gt#2812
i don‚Äôt doubt they‚Äôre people who are working with that as a possible assumption (radiation)

[03-Mar-19 10:22 AM] gt#2812
there‚Äôs even that famous sci fi book ‚Äúthe three body problem‚Äù which deals with a culture stuck with a ‚Äúsun problem‚Äù

The rise in atmospheric temperature didn't stop at the exact random date agreed to be the end of "the Little Ice Age"; therefore, it must be due to man (because it immediately went to a plateau after every other ice age end, right?)...
