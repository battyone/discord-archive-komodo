> My understanding tells me that you can't see from outside in a Lightning channel who is sending & receiving which flagged BTC. 

But, there is still an on-chain txn when the channel closes, which will look like a similar BTC txn. So even if the investigator wasn't running a lightning node, they would be able to track the "tainted" BTC to every satoshi. But how they will treat people that received this BTC through lightning is upto them.   @Acura

afaik, the only way for it to come out "clean" would be if the channel were open for a long time and much transpired before closing; given enough ins and outs it could be "buried" to a lessor extent

what threatens the world economy now is deflation, not inflation. as seen in James Bullard's interview, the Fed is now restructuring its policies to generate inflation.

[23-Feb-19 02:13 AM] designer#4893
deflation that Japan experienced in the 1990s and the risk of deflation that the world is now facing is different.

The biggest mistake that IT companies are making with their blockchain strategies is that they view Blockchain as a platform business.
Open blockchain should be considered as a protocol, like TCP/IP. If the security model of the system is not competitive in nature, it won‚Äôt be sustainable and scalable in practice, and it will be deemed as securities.
These companies that claim to be building the next generation blockchain have no genuine direction. The only direction they have is to creat a less replicated machines to show off their meaningless TPS.
Forcing/convincing others to build apps on their blockchain platform won‚Äôt do much. Employees will soon or maybe already have self-doubts and many unanswered questions.

[23-Feb-19 03:05 PM] designer#4893
At the end of the day, what matters is the payment system with the largest network of users. All these people who're trying to build psudo-money and their own internet will die.
Only businesses that build useful services on top of the payment system will survive as it has been. After all, the winner will be Bitcoin that scales.

[23-Feb-19 03:17 PM] designer#4893
by the time blockchain become mainstream, what people love most is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is neither fast nor cool, and it is also less efficient. However, the optimized systems are likely to be linked to the bitcoin in some way. I hope that become Komodo. Bitcoin is strong and special.

[23-Feb-19 03:20 PM] designer#4893
Bitcoin is a currency phenomenon. money phenomena are the product of popular psychology and imagination. many minds and property are tied up. systematically, bitcoin is both simple and deep. It responds well to any system and is strong enough to build up structures. maximalists believe that bitcoin is simple and strong, so they can stack complex systems on top of it.

Bitcoin is integral rather than differential.
Bitcoin is Log scale rather than linear.
Bitcoin is the humanities rather than economics.
Bitcoin is epidemic dynamics rather than social phenomena.
Bitcoin is macro-religious phenomenon rather than micro-social phenomenon.

for the first four years after planting, bamboo shows nothing but one fragile bamboo shoots.
during those four years, all growth takes place in the ground.
In the meantime, the fibrous root structure has been formed,
It spreads deep and wide into the ground.

to prepare thoroughly for growth and leap above the ground in the dark. then, only in the fifth year does bamboo grow to a height of up to 25 meters.

Issuing a stable coin to a blockchain should be read as a long-term intention to secure the trust of the JPM coin using the dollar. 
securing trust will earn you an independent currency position, which will eventually become a dollar coin that crosses the border freely. 
In fact, governments that control foreign currencies should block stable coins, rather than coins such as bitcoin.

sometimes it's sad to read comments. 
the public may have to follow someone. 
trusting elite is as dangerous as not believing.

[26-Feb-19 06:39 AM] designer#4893
For bankers, bitcoin growth could not be overlooked. This is because it strongly implies that it is possible to settle without the arbitration and guarantees of the authorities.

The first bitcoin tested their intellectual ability. they would have considered whether they could legally block bitcoin. If it is true that the government can not prohibit bitcoin on their behalf, it is necessary to study and judge by learning the unfamiliar technical concepts.

There are not so many executives of financial firms who have passed these intellectual tests. But even if it were a minority, it was clear that some of them had a reasonable conclusion. It is concluded that the new technology can fundamentally change the financial sector and can not prohibit pressure on the government by using the influence of banks.

After waiting for the bankers who passed this test, the test would have been a moral issue. This is similar to when a place like a theater where many people gathered was lit up. When smoke starts to appear and smells, the crowd asks for answers in confusion.

Honest information is rather dangerous at this time. More confusion can hurt more people than fire. Someone in a position to know the situation can only reassure people once they lie. It is wise to keep order.

[26-Feb-19 06:45 AM] designer#4893
situation can change again depending on the morality of elite, who monopolized information after maintaining order. good leader will find a way to help the public adjust to the new truth by taking advantage of the time gained through the information, authority and order he has gathered. 

however, ordinary leaders will prioritize valuable resources to ensure the safety of themselves and those close to them.

Goldman Sachs made a study report on bitcoin early on. In 2014, Goldman Sachs separated the concept of bitcoin, bitcoin's underlying technology, and so-called blockchain, through a report. their conclusion was, 'bitcoin are not, but blockchains are promising.' 

One can see that the proposition of "bitcoin is fake, but blockchain is real" is absurd even with a little coolness. bitcoin introduced the technology of blockchain to the world. the technology is so powerful that it has proved unstoppable, including the government. technology is real, but it is hard to accept the proposition that the first invention that proves it to be real is fake.

[26-Feb-19 06:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
Some very interesting commentary there @designer may I ask what background you have that gives you such informed insight?

[26-Feb-19 06:48 AM] designer#4893
philosophy

[26-Feb-19 06:50 AM] designer#4893
Nevertheless, the proposition was very appealing. If Bitcoin is real, we should do something about it ourselves, but if it is a problem with blockchain, it is something that majors, experts, the government and banks can take care of. In other words, the proposition appealed to the sluggish public who wanted to watch the movie, hoping it wasn't a fire in the midst of the burning smell.

What is it that bankers have gained by publicly denouncing bitcoin that Bitcoin is a destructive innovation that rocks the existing order?
They've earned time.

when is a more appropriate question than why large financial companies want to use blockchain to make their own currency. 
American banks originally had the authority to issue money. The authority was taken over by the federal government. Money is a broader concept than we thought, and Americans have a tradition of enjoying the autonomy of issuing money. Even if Bitcoin is a threat to large financial companies, the culture has a low level of consciousness that blocks the idea that using blockchain may bring back the right to issue banknotes from the government. 

In the context of Bitcoin's 10-year history, JPMCoin News is an episode that shows one side of the intelligence and morality of U.S. financial business executives. Nevertheless, if you want to reduce this incident to a piecemeal act, you need to look back to see whether you are too trusting or not at all. Human history is full of examples proving that it is hard to completely distrust Elite, but it is not a good end to complete trust.

[26-Feb-19 06:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
The premise that blockchain can be trusted only by having some benevolent custodian of the private keys is laughable. Much like the current centralized data paradigm, it will be hacked, and people will lose money.

in military terms
Apple Pay is tactical weapons.
Bitcoin is a strategic weapon with respect to the balance of power.

Tactical weapons face an opponent called regulation.
Strategic weapons face an opponent called politics.

tl:dr dont quantify all contributions, then attribute all differences from the quantified contributions and the aggregate total as human caused -> humans cause lots of unpredictable climate events like solar flares. bad humans. stop the solar flarings
