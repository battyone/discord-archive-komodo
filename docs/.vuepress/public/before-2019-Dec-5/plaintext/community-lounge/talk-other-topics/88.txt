some kind of fund I think?

[28-May-19 12:35 PM] Regnar#6164
I've had them for years actually lol. Basically they do dPoW but with hashes of legal documents, loan packets, mortgages, etc. They integrated into regular business systems, and store hashes on their chain, which gets stored on Bitcoin as well.

FCT price floats, but entry credits EC (used to store hashes) is pegged to like $0.001 cents, so FCT is comprised of a number of EC depending on the price if FCT, so $10 FCT is room for 10k EC. If demand for EC goes up, more documents need to be hashed. It wont increase costs for businesses, but the price of FCT rises to create more EC, so demand for 100k EC brings FCT price to a floor of $100. (This math assumes there is only 1 FCT in existence, there is actually like 8MM)

It was a cool setup, just tempted to move some over to ARRR

My position remains the same. #Bitcoin will likely be replaced by a new technology & it’s manipulated

It’s possible it’s built to last, but not probable, so keep your position to an amount you’re willing to loose

changes in the world through technology are made when the technology reflects reality and improves in a better direction.

1. Ignore utter collapse of $BTC adoption
2. Deny huge fees & txn backlog are problems
3. LN needs just 18 months more
4. Roger Ver is defrauding ppl & spamming the network
5. Gavin tried to hijack the project so we removed him
6. Our better plan is Store of Value, not P2P...

Starting next month, Binance's 'decentralized' exchange will start geo-blocking 29 countries including the USA. Of course, this will be possible to circumvent fairly easily through a VPN but just goes to show that it's a non-custodial exchange (so far?) - not decentralized.

It is correct to think of it as a bullshit if you do not include detailed explanations or examples while using ambiguous words such as 'things like that, various, complex, various'. just wrapped it up for false reasons, such as boredom, waste of time, or level difference.

usually they find that there's no clear responsability, the things get debated for years then either all acquitted or one scapegoat gets the maximum sentece

Would it be my own delusion to say that today's disastrous reality of poor quality jobs is a favorable condition to create an innovative company, just as the outbreak of Black Death triggered a renaissance in a dismal Europe?

I think this is a time of unprecedented opportunity in human history.

I want to do something that is innovative, wandering to the fullest extent of my heart's content, regardless of the dire realities of the world. 

If you fail miserably, you will gain experience from failure, and if you succeed, you will gain the confidence to challenge another unknown world.

1. Hacker get access to compromised account w/ 1200BTC but can't withdraw

2. Hacker puts his own limit $100 buy orders on illiquid pair BTC/CAD

3. Back to compromised account he dumps the 1200BTC on BTC/CAD to himself

4. Hacker is fully legit owner of 1200BTC
