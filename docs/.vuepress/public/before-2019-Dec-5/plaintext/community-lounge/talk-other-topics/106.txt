"[The Librem 5] will also have a removable battery, a feature that Apple long ago abandoned in the interest of svelte devices." Hats off @Puri_sm!

Added disadvantage of a phd is that you take yourself off the jobmarket for 4-5 years

[12-Aug-19 06:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
While others are getting more experience you are researching something that often has zero added value to companies

[12-Aug-19 06:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless *maybe* in pharma tech or something like that

[12-Aug-19 06:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Other then that you are just crippling yourself for a later jobhunt

it depends:
- in France PhD students are paid 1400‚Ç¨-2000‚Ç¨/month, tuition is about 400‚Ç¨/year, so financial value is not a problem here.
- on whether the PhD is fundamental research vs applied research, sometimes the final results of applied researches PhD / postdoc are working products that have medium to high Technology readiness level.

@PHBA2061 not really sure how you think even 2k/month is worth putting a carreer on hold for 5 years without any other benefits to that later career though :p

[12-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As I said, the times a phd actually offers a benefit for later job opportunities are far smaller than when it does

[12-Aug-19 11:45 AM] PHBA2061#2530
in France and EU in general  it's quite different though, compared to PhD programs in the USA, PhD programs in France only take 3 years to complete (because the requirement here is PhD students must acquired an master diploma or a engineering diploma before applying for PhD program), the PhD thesis topic must be chosen/identified during the application process, it's like a job interview, only 1 student get selected, most of the time their thesis topics are already chosen beforehand by the research director, and their researches are funded by organisations or/and companies. So I would say PhD students in France & in EU in general have better preparations & have a clear vision of what they're going to do for their PhD program.

I think it's a mistake for Komodo to be using Amazon's AWS

[12-Aug-19 12:02 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
You should find an ethical alternative

[12-Aug-19 12:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
do you mind explain why ?

I‚Äôd like to kindly remind everyone services like @awscloud are exempted from US sanctions according to General License D-1 issued by the @USTreasury https://t.co/TutphJPvC4 Amazon is over-complying with the sanctions, crippling access to information in an oppressed count...

I think Amazon is totally against what Komodo represents

[12-Aug-19 12:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is a very slippery slope, kinda like saying no one should be using android because google made it and google are working with china or microsoft to allow bing in china

[12-Aug-19 12:07 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
And many other things by Amazon, like listening to conversations through Alexa, giving away people's facial recognition data etc

[12-Aug-19 12:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Not discounting shit big companies do but we cannot just rule out a company because of it. Missile systems might use some linux code and they have been used to bomb civilians, should we not use linux? Tech is used for good and bad.

[12-Aug-19 12:10 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I remember someone from Komodo mentioning that they are exploring alternatives

[12-Aug-19 12:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Probably good anyway just in case
