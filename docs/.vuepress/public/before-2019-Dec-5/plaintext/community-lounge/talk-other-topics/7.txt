[18-Jun-18 12:17 AM] AkiraX#8269
I was interested in deepin

[18-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Deepin, it's good, it looks nice.

[18-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
is it chinese?

[18-Jun-18 01:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
@AkiraX It's made by a company called Deepin Technology Co., Ltd
It looks really good, i'm not gonna lie. 
But i've had good experiences with Linux Mint (it's Ubuntu based), it's what i'm used to. 
I'll give a try to this Deepin and Manjaro, which is derived from Deepin, i think, by what i'm reading.... I've seen some people here using it.
Thanks for the tip!

[18-Jun-18 02:55 AM] Jax#4739
@AkiraX Keep in mind  there have been spyware controversies surrounding deepin. It's allegedly as bad as Windows 10, but using Chinese analytics servers for its telemetry.

[18-Jun-18 02:56 AM] Jax#4739
However, they have stated the following: https://www.deepin.org/en/2018/04/14/linux-deepin-is-not-spyware/

[18-Jun-18 02:56 AM] Jax#4739
People have recommended using the Deepin desktop with a different distribution of debian

which coins would you bag if you have some BTC to spare besides KMD

[22-Jun-18 07:21 PM] Tyrael#0138
at 3800$ i would buy ETH,Cardano,Qtum,Zcash depends on the price, maybe some substratum.

[22-Jun-18 07:22 PM] Tyrael#0138
buy CHIPS, it is immune to this bear market

[22-Jun-18 07:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
those coins are very volatile and huge volume, I agree it is probably a good buy , since they will probaly be the first to pump when the market corrects, not sure about substratum though

LiteCoinCash (LCC) released a new whitepaper to fend off 51% attacks... Thoughts on "beekeepers"? https://www.reddit.com/r/LCCofficial/comments/8ssszl/litecoin_cash_solution_to_51_attacks/

We are now ready to announce our proposed solution to strengthen the Litecoin Cash network from 51% attacks while democratising the mining process, all without changing anything for current sha256 miners. We're dropping a preprint version here first so that you the community can have a first look before wider release.
