Opinion | Bitcoin Has Saved My Family
‚ÄúBorderless money‚Äù is more than a buzzword when you live in a collapsing economy and a collapsing dictatorship.
https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/opinion/sunday/24hernandez/24hernandez-facebookJumbo.jpg

[06-Mar-19 09:23 AM] designer#4893
February 23 edition of the New York Times featured an article by Venezuelan economist Carlos Hernandez entitled 'Bitcoin is saving our families'.

Hernandez, like other economists, would have argued that bitcoin was not a currency and could not be a currency if it was a society that did not need bitcoin.
However, Hernandez, who is a living person who needs to feed his family in a place where economics and politics are collapsing before being an economist, testifies with such a force.
"Borderless currencies (like bitcoin) are more than just fashionable in a collapsing society,"

If the bitcoin is popular society, that society is definitely not a good society. But in such a desperate society, bitcoin has a unique value.

If it is an intellectual who does not change the idea that bitcoin is meaningless tulip, that is assuming that over 150 countries will not suffer social collapse as it is now and forever.

the fact that human history is not going to walk that flower road was the starting point of my accidental journey five years ago when I dared to anticipate the future of this bizarre and bizarre bitcoin.

Wall Street Attracted by the Security Token

Putting securities on the blockchain is as natural as trading stocks on the Internet. Securities are rarely owned and traded in paper form. Investors are already familiar with trading hydrostatic electronic data while leaving it to the depository. 

However, stocks and bonds can be stored and traded only on a centralized platform under the jurisdiction of the regulatory agency as the trace of paper certificates remains strong. Regulators are justifying control in the name of linking electronic data with physical certificates. 

When securities are issued in blockchain, they go beyond the meaning of electronic rights to paper certificates. Blockchain tokens are divided infinitely. The right can be easily divided by freezing the token using an electronic signature Securities-type tokens are similar to real securities being stored directly on their smartphones. Financial firms cannot control all servers, after all, prevent direct transactions between users. This means that the remaining claim to multinational companies will be used as a strong global currency. 

In some countries, Samsung Electronics or Apple shares may gain more credibility than their own currency. Today the most fragile certificate is paper money issued by governments without restraint. However, even the people of the damaged government are coming to the public as the smartphone that Samsung and Apple have in their hands. The Chinese government is threatening to strictly ban the STO.
‚úç

[06-Mar-19 01:13 PM] designer#4893
Of course, if a company's securities token feels it threatens the status of a key currency like the dollar, the U.S. government can stop the token from being popular and crash it into meaningless code overnight. What regulators can't do about Bitcoin can be done to Apple or Amazon's securities token. 

This is why U.S. financial officials can be more attracted to securities-type tokens than Bitcoin. However, many governments that have forced their own promiscuous currency to the public are in trouble. Bitcoin could have misled itself as if buying tulips, but it would not be easy to develop a rational logic that prevents tokenized Apple securities from being used as currency.
‚úç

[06-Mar-19 01:19 PM] designer#4893
There are no significant statistics for the Security token issue (STO) market. However, polymath, the leader in securities-type tokens, expects to grow to the $10 trillion market within two years. The rationale for this optimistic market outlook is that regulators, including the United States, have a forward-looking attitude unlike ICOs. 
STO will proceed on the premise of cooperation with regulatory agencies. In the United States, cumbersome licensing procedures may be omitted by limiting the amount of money collected However, since token is also securities, it is mandatory to audit, disclose, and retain company ledger and be subject to securities related tax laws. In addition, the obligation to prevent money laundering should be complied with in the course of token issuance and distribution. 

As for STO, which raises funds by issuing new securities through blockchain tokens, different governments are likely to respond differently. However, the flow of existing securities being traded on a blockchain platform is not a matter of whether they should be bought or not, but a matter of time. In particular, considering the preparedness of major institutions, including NASDAQ, the timing will be earlier than expected.

very interesting article ...

[08-Mar-19 01:07 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Agreed

[08-Mar-19 01:09 AM] PTYX#6840
What is interesting is that Komodo phased out the z-transactions just in time

[08-Mar-19 01:09 AM] PTYX#6840
A very Satoshi-like move

[08-Mar-19 01:14 AM] PTYX#6840
it's likely that this sort of bans will be adopted in EU and other parts of the world

[08-Mar-19 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Mar-19 02:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
Never any coverage on the yellow vests here in the states. They really don‚Äôt want anyone getting any crazy ideas. Like exercising their right to protest a corrupt oligarchy.

They don't necessarily have to be successful at banning them. That won't stop them from hunting down the people that use them, develop them, or facilitate their use. Same as the drug war.

[08-Mar-19 04:24 AM] PTYX#6840
It seems that in the coming years there could be a polarization in regards to jurisdictions that completely ban anonymous cryptocurrency and others that embrace it.

[08-Mar-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The answer to that is to make everyone use them üòâ

[08-Mar-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just liek the drug war if everyone is on drugs there is nothign they can do about it apart from improsion minorities, and evntually this just makes drugs legal, like weed these days lol.

[08-Mar-19 04:36 AM] PTYX#6840
Hopefully there won't be as many victims as there are in the drug war

The drug war is a thing because the criminal cartels who own the politicians hate competition. The coming war on privacy coins will be a thing because the big banks may lose the billions they make laundering drug money. Oh the irony.

Unfortunately @Deleted User , in the ussa, being able to afford health insurance means having a boring job for some of us.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all they do is kill you with drugs

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
Because I‚Äôd prefer not to go bankrupt if i get cancer or something serious.

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
It‚Äôs basically a medical extortion racket to keep you working for the man. imo

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181

If you get cancer, stay happy too.

[08-Mar-19 09:01 AM] nocturnal#2177
@actionslacks what happened with obamacare? We are clinging on to free health care in the uk although the politicians are trying to take it away...
