if the tech is good someone will open source it

[20-Feb-19 02:25 AM] nocturnal#2177
so that quote basically says 'as soon as it becomes open source it poses a threat to blockchain'

[20-Feb-19 02:25 AM] nocturnal#2177
would be another way to look at it

[20-Feb-19 02:28 AM] nocturnal#2177
although apparently you can 34% attack it

distributed ledgers with consensus is the tech

[20-Feb-19 02:32 AM] nocturnal#2177

Last year I was waiting for MimbleWimble, this year I'm waiting for Coda

[20-Feb-19 02:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
some production level usable product

[20-Feb-19 02:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
would be even more amazing if Coda can be used in Komodo ecosystem this way or other

[20-Feb-19 02:45 AM] nocturnal#2177
what do you mean by horizontal/vertical scaling?

[20-Feb-19 02:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Coda is scalability solution based on zksnarks

[20-Feb-19 02:46 AM] nocturnal#2177
ah i see

[20-Feb-19 02:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coda fits perfectly in komodo scaling solutions as I understand

[20-Feb-19 02:47 AM] nocturnal#2177
they say they aspire to being scalable to "millions" of users tho

[20-Feb-19 02:47 AM] nocturnal#2177

social/philosophical question...

[20-Feb-19 02:50 AM] nocturnal#2177
does the complexity of the technology equate to a form of centralisation?

[20-Feb-19 02:50 AM] nocturnal#2177
i.e. centralised around a small number of people who have that knowledge

[20-Feb-19 02:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
yeah

[20-Feb-19 02:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
its still much more decentralised

[20-Feb-19 02:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
but in some sense

[20-Feb-19 02:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
its just placing the centre in a different arena

[20-Feb-19 02:53 AM] nocturnal#2177
overall i'd probably rather have the centre in the realm of tech geeks than lawyers and bankers

[20-Feb-19 02:53 AM] nocturnal#2177
except that once they have the power they will probably become as rich and corrupt

[20-Feb-19 02:55 AM] nocturnal#2177
thats true

[20-Feb-19 02:56 AM] nocturnal#2177
i think i'd rather have access to power gained through knowledge and study (if it worked out that way)

Referring to changes in speed, capacity or price of Bitcoin, the critics are denying the reality of the online jungle, which is slowly emerging by the Internet and smartphones today. It's funny that you stay in the jungle all day and still overlook the disruptive innovations.

my think - Atomic Swap

Atomic swap are executed by the system. there is no need to stop because it is not policy. 

It is the basis of Atomic swap that can be reliably exchanged even when there is no third party intervention and the transaction is completely zero-knowledge. Bitcoin core developer announced in the fall of 2017 that they had succeeded in dealing with Atomic swap between Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Atomic swap is a key device in the side chain, a kind of adhesive that connects disparate blockchain to each other. In an online world that isn't face-to-face, you should eliminate the risk that your opponent won't send things for money. starting with an online bookstore, Amazon was also at the heart of the solution to eliminate this risk. beyond this risk is the foundation of business. If the blockchain ecosystem becomes huge and the atomic swap connect it, projects that have escrow as a basic function will inevitably face a crisis.

the claim of the Bitcoin maximalist, who claims that Bitcoin will ultimately destroy the financial giant, should be weighed from the perspective of an ecosystem in which blockchain are systemically closely connected.

not to mention blockchain skeptics, few people have actually run or experienced blockchains. perhaps this is why the discourse on blockchain is led by scholarly commentators who value an ideological approach. they value vocabulary and categories. just as the night suggests that new concepts and new words appear when you wake up, the fences of the opportunistic category are sloppy. the more dizzy the phenomenon is, the better it is to have a system and approach it than nothing more than nothing at all.

but now is the beginning of the blockchain technology. It should be considered that there are too many things to be done and that there are many attempts to disappear in the near future. too much confidence in the vocabulary created by convenience can be confined to the maze of categories. the word sidechain is still a sketchy and ambiguous concept to be a category.

though very old, the glowing eyes, and the still strong Indian accent, were welcome and impressive. The old gentleman, who has experienced everything and has a wealth of experience investing in various unicorns, always emphasizes "people" and "teams." there are a lot of things that Vinod Kosla has said.  "CEOs should spend more than 80 percent of their time hiring good people, and the rest of their time making sure people stay in the company," and "Don't forget that the team you're currently making is the company you're making."

After all, the biggest difference between the Million Dollar Business and the Billion Dollar Business seems to be which good people are leading the company and working under them. When you visit a good company, the energy and the emotion you get from the people of the company is very different, and it's hard to quantify it, but it's probably because of the "Aura" that these good people are blowing outward.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/opinion/amazon-hq2-new-york.html
infrastructure of a company is now a social asset, and those belonging to a corporation are losing their civic identity and building the identity of their corporate employees.

consumers are no longer a one-time consumer, but as a subscriber for the enterprise, they are sensitive to the policies and identity of the enterprise. at the base of this phenomenon lies the issue of the public nature of cyber resources.

what they have is not just a matter of money. services they provide are becoming an essential infrastructure that exceeds essential services that nation has traditionally been in charge of, and so their authority is beyond that of public use.

nevertheless, it is difficult to bring this infrastructure into the public domain. existing public domain does not have the expertise to understand and control this area. Rather, the flow will appear the other way round. platform will be the nation of future, enterprise will be government of future, and consumer will be a member of community and protection.

already, there are signs that the younger generation is feeling that the world. as soon as people who are ignorant of the construction and operation of offline systems, believe in contracts instead of laws, views instead of votes, and Wikipedia instead of universities as a source of knowledge, and build new economies among themselves without adapting to existing institutions, existing world will disappear without a trace.

Perhaps a maybe stupid question: If someone owns BTC¬¥s from the Darknet, so to speak they are "flagged", who sends them via Lightning into a channel, sends something there and there, and at the end closes the lightning channel again, are they still "tagged"? As far as I understand it, you can't see what's happening in the Lightning, the only question is how the history of the BTC will be displayed.

[21-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Acura#2748
My understanding tells me that you can't see from outside in a Lightning channel who is sending & receiving which flagged BTC. So the question how can the outsider know who owns which flagged BTCs if they have been swapped in the lightning channel?

[21-Feb-19 03:14 PM] Acura#2748
I mean, I can open a Lightning channel myself and close it myself.
