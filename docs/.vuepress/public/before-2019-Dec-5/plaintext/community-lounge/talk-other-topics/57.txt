No coincidence: the consistency of actions shows @coinbase is used by governments to attack #bitcoin

Fatal Flaw In Climate Change Science

then comback and try and argue about climate science

no doubt climate is changing and worlds is ebing polluted but plant food isnt the problem 😆

I'm not going to argue about climate science after watching a video.  In fact, I'm not going to argue about it at all.  Climate science spans several very difficult disciplines and involves at least tens of thousands of scientists world wide.  If you care to argue about it, argue with them, here's a place to start https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/

Scientific consensus: Earth's climate is warming
Most leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing the position that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.

when you grow cannabis in higher CO2 concentrations it grows liek 2x faster, which removes in turn 2x the CO2 from the air... so the solution to higher CO2 levels is to plant more plants and increase CO2 levels so the plants eat it faster. 😆

its how you agregate it and all that... not the data or where it came from. If you INGORE DATA

[03-Mar-19 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then you ignored it

I'm on board with the criticism that cryptocurrency and the whole movement makes of government in terms of taxation, central banks, coercion and bureaucracy, but not the physical sciences.

beelive what you want... the point of science is to make a new theory when something is disproiven not ignore all the data that disprves it.

How many reference would you like showing Gavin admitting that there are more than 2 dozen assumptions in the base calculations that are, in his own words, "likely wrong"?

[03-Mar-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what "goes nowhere" is bastardizing "we don't know what else it could be" into "it absolutely is"

Then you should be talking to the scientific community, not KMD discord.

[03-Mar-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@gt if you're asking me, the answer is "because I rarely state anything as a fact without knowing what I'm on about"

[03-Mar-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not getting into it.. I just posted the video because it was very informative, I even commented on it, that nobody would even watch it... Im not debating ppl who havent watched it.

Show me **one** person that supports the belief that AGW is significant who isn't also financially motivated to continue down that path

`well it’s hard to state anything as a fact because “facts” are somewhat nebulous`
that which is measurable is as close to fact as we have; however, there is bastardization in the "math" of "Climate Science". Celsius, itself, is evident of that (once nothing more than flat numbers of 1-100, now graduated with "precision")

[03-Mar-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well 0 and 100 vary due to air pressure.... so its nto exactly accurate anyway lol

[03-Mar-19 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The climate is changing.. the jet streams are broken... Things are getting worse and it just not due to a TRACE GAS in the atmnosphere that doesnt amke any logical sense so matter haow much money you spent trying to convince me otherwise.

6 billion human bodies doing human activities produce 0 heat in the atmosphere outside of the carbon emissions they produce 🙄 ffs, even an average non-indoctrinated 4 year old knows better than to believe that

if thre is one thing I agree on them with, cutting down all the trees is a terrible idea... the solution to that is to plant mroe trees and stop cutting them down, not cut more down and install solar pannels

it would take literal acreage of solar panels just to supply what I and my businesses use, by the time you multiply that out there might be 4 trees left on the planet

if not to combat climate change, we shuold reduce emissions anyway because of the health hazards

[03-Mar-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CO2 is plant food. its not bad... everythign else that comes with it... is bad

[03-Mar-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they focus ont he wrong thing

[03-Mar-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
pollution = bad
cutting down trees = bad
CO2 is plant food, the higher the amount in the air, the faster trees grow

[03-Mar-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the sun ... controls the climate

[03-Mar-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so stop pollutiing ... and taxing ppl for no reason.

[03-Mar-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whole thing is upside down and backwards liek msot otherthign government does

[03-Mar-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we shuold reduce emissions anyway because of the health hazards`
@Cryptoon to that end, I don't entirely disagree
but any claim that man is "harming the planet" (and not just harming man) irks the shit out of me because it's always abstract and can never be validated (specifically to the extent of being unable to state what the climate "should be" - because "I don't know what it should be, I just know that it should be this" isn't science)

[03-Mar-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`reduce emissions` yes ... but not of CO2 ... all the other far more terrible pollution that seems to be ignored while the focus is on CO2.

[03-Mar-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because if you don't demonize CO2, then you can't create a trillion dollar industry "studying" CO2 😛

[03-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no money to be made in showing that CO2 is CO2

[03-Mar-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do envy the IPCC on certain levels, though; it's tough to create a business that revolves around nothing other than existing to exist and making a fortune in the process

[03-Mar-19 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@blackjok3r the earth's atmosphere is like 50% CO2, even if we reduce you would still get huge amounts just from natural processes

[03-Mar-19 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
forest fires etc

where did you get that number 🤣

i don’t have a skin in this game but haven’t humans lived in a relatively small window of what CO2 levels were present in the atmosphere. from what i’ve read is that people people are more concerned about returning to previous levels of CO2 that had completely different fauna etc

If it's "too late", then all of the claims fail on their base, because the claim is that we can control climate and alternatives will "reverse the human effect"
Both cannot be true

[03-Mar-19 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
