We have a saying here, it's called 'samson sex'

[09-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Samson is a popular kids show

[09-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And samson sex is actually put in the dictionary, and it means when you plant your kids in front of the television to let them watch their tv shows

[09-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so the parents can go upstairs to have sex 😄

_wonders what people did before TVs and then remembers "OH, yeah, that's right; parents just had sex when they wanted to have sex"_

also called millenials
generation z is for ppl born around 2000

[10-Jun-19 10:47 PM] metaphilibert#0926
the guy who first proposed "generation Y" to name the generation after "Generation X" was really stupid (and ppl making consensus about this terminology also as it was validated)

[10-Jun-19 10:48 PM] metaphilibert#0926
he saw the X as a pure letter and his best idea was to choose the next
and the fact it was the second last did not perturb him at all 🙄

Not sure best place to throw this question out but here seems like “why the hell not”.
I’m not sure I get the Nothing at Stake and Oracle breakthroughs that Verus and  JL developed. I’m not a “noob” per se but def not dev level understanding of code/chains. 
Anyone got time to school me?

Nothing at stake attack is a situation where a disproportionately low amount of coin supply can be used to swing consensus to an attackers version of the chain in PoS systems.   They created a way to stop it. Oracle breakthrough is by using local timestamps one can prevent someone gaming a data feed, important for betting and prediction markets . If someone’s timestamp doesn’t match up then it is rejected by the network

Thank you I think I get the staking idea a little better. 
So current “oracles” use or plan to use some other method -complex data conglomerates? that are not as simple as the timestamp (and I think I read a JL post about > 1% changes as well as time....🤔) ??
