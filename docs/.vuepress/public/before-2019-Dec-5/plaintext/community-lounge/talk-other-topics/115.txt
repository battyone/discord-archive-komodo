cool, you, the mimble wimble enthusiast, are free to hire some grin devs. let's get it started. send them here. I think you're having a little fun here. so congrats.

silly me for suggesting that the atomicdex devs build in support for a coin like grin

[16-Sep-19 09:10 PM] jorian#4555
This is offtopic man

[16-Sep-19 09:10 PM] jorian#4555
If you want to seriously suggest things with a serious plan, go talk to one of the devs

[16-Sep-19 09:11 PM] jorian#4555
Saying grin needs listing only because you feel it's a good idea isn't going to get things going

[16-Sep-19 09:13 PM] jorian#4555
And don't be sad that we didn't jump to celebrate the greatest idea this bear market

[16-Sep-19 09:31 PM] liqdmetal#8650
It's all good, i was not trying to be disruptive nor to turn the channel into a pissing match.  I think that all privacy (or not) crypto coins are excellent.  The more code/networks to choose from the better.

[16-Sep-19 09:33 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i started the suggestion in the atomicdexbeta channel, whereby someone shilled me piratecoin

[16-Sep-19 09:34 PM] liqdmetal#8650
one guy did give a good answer but did not follow up with al ink.

[16-Sep-19 09:35 PM] liqdmetal#8650
and the discord owner? or mod? anyways he starts coming at me with there is problems with grin plaintext transactions anonymity details... so i got sales pitch on one end, and then attacks on grin an unrelated topic. all i did was suggest adding grin to the atomicdex

[16-Sep-19 09:36 PM] liqdmetal#8650
That is the facts man

[16-Sep-19 09:37 PM] liqdmetal#8650
if devs here dont see merit in adding more coins, specifically grin, then so be it, they dont have to code it

[16-Sep-19 09:38 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i mean if i were boss of the devs here i would be adding more coins constantly as fast as reasonably possible

[16-Sep-19 09:40 PM] PTYX#6840
Adding more coins randomly and without a strategy isn't ideal.

[16-Sep-19 09:40 PM] PTYX#6840
We must leverage the community, marketing reach, and anything else that we can of the coins that are added.

[16-Sep-19 09:43 PM] liqdmetal#8650
I am just happy there is an atomicdex.

[16-Sep-19 09:45 PM] liqdmetal#8650
I understand that development of code such as this is a gradual process.

[16-Sep-19 10:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree. Atomic Dex has been 5 yrs in the making. Most other projects haven't even existed that long. Expecting kmd to throw precious time and resources at implementing an currently incompatible coin that didn't even exist a year ago, for free, is misguided at best. This atomic swap software shared and supported freely to everyone who wants to use it. No one is shilling anything. Implying that there is some selfish agenda among this group is laughable.

[16-Sep-19 10:03 PM] liqdmetal#8650
I guess I imagined all that which happened there. In fact it is in part because grin is bleeding edge that it should be included in the atomic-dex. Calling me misguided for seeing merit where merit is due is laughable.

[16-Sep-19 10:05 PM] liqdmetal#8650
I mean grin did do an atomic swapwith eth on testnets already

[16-Sep-19 10:05 PM] liqdmetal#8650

how are the funds in an address of which neither party has the prvt keys (control of funds). who has the custody of the coins at this stage?? also, what if bob is sending all his btc so he cant send both the deposit and the payment

[16-Sep-19 10:20 PM] liqdmetal#8650
who controls that address when neither party to the exchange does

[16-Sep-19 10:42 PM] Moderator#9338
`who controls that address when neither party to the exchange does`
the exchange parties never lose control of their funds until the trade is final. the DEX protocol ("blockchain") handles this in a trustless way.
hence being a trustless p2p crosschain atomic swap technology.

that article is outdated. 
the new xcat procotol is more efficient:
```
1 - Taker Sends <dexfee>
2 - Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>
3 - Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>
4 - Maker Spends <takerpayment>
5 - Taker Spends <makerpayment>
```

[16-Sep-19 11:06 PM] ca333#0118

[17-Sep-19 06:15 AM] dan.#2473
In mm1 Alice got bobs deposit and  bonus

Does this technically open up att  vector for Bob to be a nuisance ? Albeit I doubt anyone would bother

Maker, on the other hand, stands to lose more. Since Bob did not follow through with his end of the bargain, the AtomicDEX network indicates on his public AtomicDEX trading profile that he failed in a commitment, thus decreasing his profile‚Äôs reputation. If Bob continues this behavior as a habit, he may find it difficult to discover trading partners.

[17-Sep-19 06:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
From later on in the doc as well

[17-Sep-19 06:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So long as the frequency of "Bobs" failing is low, the occasional extra <dexfee> paid by an Alice is a minor issue. However, if there is a sudden spike in misbehavior, the AtomicDEX code has in-built contingency plans which can provide refunds to Alice(s).
