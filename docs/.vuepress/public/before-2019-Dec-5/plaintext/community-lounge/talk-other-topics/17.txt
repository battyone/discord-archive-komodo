How does encryption and all those things work though? Would the government see all messages and data, or just the fact that 2 parties communicated on a certain date?

perfect law makers would be good level devs with law knowledge - who understands caring for exceptions more? and could create more logic structures better then a programmer ?

[04-Sep-18 05:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem is that most politicians are lawyers... how the fuck do they know anything about tech?

[04-Sep-18 05:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no need to understand tech - just understand assumptions and results and at least avg complicated logic structures

[04-Sep-18 05:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
law = complicated logic structures, if, else, function

[04-Sep-18 05:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
lawyers are learning logic while studying, but logic in practice is programming, which they do not learn. If you ever were doing programming for real you know what is the difference

[04-Sep-18 05:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
dev in reality is law maker - he creates conditions for the app to work proper and all exceptions must be handles properly. If not nobody will use your crappy app

[04-Sep-18 05:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
same is with countries nowadays - people living some countries because of bad law which creates chaos, internal wars or just bad economic situations

[04-Sep-18 06:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But they create policies that should be based on a basic understanding of the thing they are making laws about. If the laws/policies are de facto bad, it doesnt even matter how they are programmed :p

[04-Sep-18 06:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In my country I don’t like politicians creating policies regarding the economy/environment etc while having no basic understanding about it.

law creation anv law change could be done online using decent forums (which does nto exist yet) and voting. No need to politiciane to make law. Specialist could do that, and people can vote. But actually you need to change democracy or consitution, as to have only specilist making law about economy you would require 1. univerisity degree for people creating law 2. university degree for people voting for a specific law or sth like that (here uni degree is just a kind of trust, but you could also use other trust if there was sth other ... in the future of decentralized profiles trust can be created using also other mesures then officia, but official can still exist as major)

When SEC turns on the blue light, U.S. financial companies will create a variety of financial products based on the crypto-currency. When financial engineering meets Bitcoin, the result is likely to be a new financial dinosaur, not a breakdown of a financial dinosaur. This is because it is a property of trust to be attracted to large droplets and make larger droplets. Just as the Internet has left the hope of decentralization of power and equality of speech and created IT dinosaurs, crypto-currency provides a business opportunity that can eventually become bigger for financial companies, which is a betrayal of Bitcoin philosophy.

sadly, traditional financial institutions are eager to invest in crypto-currency.
