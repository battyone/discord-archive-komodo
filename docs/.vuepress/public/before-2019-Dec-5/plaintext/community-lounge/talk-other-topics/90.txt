if most people could command line we wouldn't need windows

[08-Jun-19 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I could be wrong, but I don't recall using all that mess and 3 repos for barterdex 🤷🏽

[08-Jun-19 12:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
i barely recall using barterdex in the first place

[08-Jun-19 12:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
that was just last year right?

[08-Jun-19 12:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I remember @grewalsatinder being on the edge of hating me over my initial opinions of it :troll:

[08-Jun-19 12:13 AM] PTYX#6840
There was barterdex and hyperdex @actionslacks  The latter being the ferrari of the two.

[08-Jun-19 12:13 AM] PTYX#6840
the initial barterdex was difficult to use and finally it just didn't complete swaps at all

[08-Jun-19 12:13 AM] PTYX#6840
hyperdex worked great for a bit, then also stopped making swaps

[08-Jun-19 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The latter being the ferrari of the two.`
Only if Ferrari started using moped engines and nail polish for paint

[08-Jun-19 12:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
i got bdex going pretty wel when there was volume

[08-Jun-19 12:14 AM] PTYX#6840
the gui still is very nice

💩 

[08-Jun-19 12:14 AM] PTYX#6840
but yeah, the engine needs improving. maybe mm2 is the solution

[08-Jun-19 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm2, mm3, or even mm9000 isn't going to change that some of us poor bastids can't use electrum

[08-Jun-19 12:15 AM] PTYX#6840
why can't you use electrum?

[08-Jun-19 12:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because I don't live in a metropolis and have post-modern internet

[08-Jun-19 12:16 AM] PTYX#6840
gotcha

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] PTYX#6840
you need to bounce that signal off sputnik and to cipis servers

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
56k all day

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
mm2 is electrum only?

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] PTYX#6840
i think native too @actionslacks

[08-Jun-19 12:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "best" we can get here is a 20M lie that's actually 17 by bonding 2 10s

[08-Jun-19 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm isn't electrum only, hyperdex is

[08-Jun-19 12:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bonding + daemons = no fun, sir

[08-Jun-19 12:20 AM] actionslacks#4072

[08-Jun-19 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

ln is the anti-atomic-swap

[08-Jun-19 12:23 AM] Easteregg69#4081
This is off-topic. No doubt.

[08-Jun-19 12:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ln is also the anti-Bitcoin, but I'll save that rant for another day

[08-Jun-19 12:25 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Might as well hang out with the crook's chance given.

[08-Jun-19 12:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
crooks launder their money with banks, not btc

[08-Jun-19 12:26 AM] Easteregg69#4081
How would you know?

[08-Jun-19 12:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's in the news fairly regularly. banks launder billions for drug cartels and no one goes to jail. I have to give a blood sample to buy bitcoin with my bank account.

[08-Jun-19 12:28 AM] Easteregg69#4081

[08-Jun-19 12:33 AM] actionslacks#4072

[08-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Easteregg69#4081

[08-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Easteregg69#4081

[08-Jun-19 12:37 AM] actionslacks#4072

[08-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Easteregg69#4081
@actionslacks Now a days some numbers rank lower than others. Of course i got hit. By the team.

[08-Jun-19 12:45 AM] Easteregg69#4081
