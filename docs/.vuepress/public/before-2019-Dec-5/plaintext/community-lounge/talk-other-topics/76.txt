It is likely a bid to not have to deal with censorship in the future though

they started out as a social networking platform

[07-May-19 01:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
like twitter but with more characters

[07-May-19 01:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
the browser started from an addon called disenter that allowed users to leave comments on any website without a risk of being removed just because of "i don't like you" reasons

[07-May-19 01:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
i.e. wikipedia

[07-May-19 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh, so if you handle a twitter but are not twitter you get banned... heh, who would have guessed

[07-May-19 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
pretty much so

[07-May-19 07:22 PM] jansako#3330
Adding my 2 cents to the 'censorship' debate. 
Freedom of speech means the government will not arrest you for speaking up. 
It does not mean that anyone is obligated to give you a platform for your BS.
It does not mean anyone is obligated to listen to you.
It does not mean the owner of an establishment can't throw your ass out for being an idiot (by their own definition, including people being offended at other people etc...).
If someone comes to my house & promotes [insert stuff I do not want to see in my house], off they go. I will censor the F* out of them, as is my right.
If I am [insert social network/business name here], I should be able to do the same.
Obviously there are consequences to that, including losing the business of people that do not agree with such behavior.

[07-May-19 07:23 PM] jansako#3330
Twitter or Discord is NOT public space.

[07-May-19 07:23 PM] jansako#3330
./rant off üòÉ

[07-May-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems you cant not censor, as not censoring what you are supposed to censor, will get you censored. so in a way you dont have the rights

[07-May-19 07:35 PM] jansako#3330
If the 'censorship' is mandated by law, that has more to do with the kind of peeps we elected to be passing those laws.

[07-May-19 07:36 PM] jansako#3330
If for not censoring you get censored by others (not in a 'breaking the law' sense), you make the decision to censor based on the relative value of doing what is right vs. being ostracized for it.

[07-May-19 07:37 PM] jansako#3330
In case of a business it would be simply the cost of the two approaches...

[07-May-19 07:39 PM] jansako#3330
In general if I have the right (not obligation) to keep certain speech in or out, why would other people not have the same right with regards to me?

[07-May-19 07:40 PM] jansako#3330
It hurts as fuck if you are the one unfairly targeted, of course!

[07-May-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is if the basic premise that some forms of speech can indeed be outlawed

[07-May-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if you believe in freedom of speech and then get banned globally for that...

[07-May-19 07:41 PM] jansako#3330
The thing is that your fredom ends where my freedom begins

[07-May-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
when people are arrested for posting cartoons that offend some people, it seems quite strange

[07-May-19 07:42 PM] jansako#3330
If I make a cartoon praising ol'Adolf and the virtues of Nazional Socialism, I should probably get in trouble...

[07-May-19 07:43 PM] jansako#3330
like literally praising, not making fun of him...

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
lifetime in jail?

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jansako#3330
So if you are promoting the curtailing of my freedoms & saying I can;t touch you because of freedom of speech... I don;t think so

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
what if he was your grandfather?

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jansako#3330
?

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jansako#3330
who?

[07-May-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is against the law to praise your own grandfather?

[07-May-19 07:45 PM] jansako#3330
It can be if he is a mass murderer...

[07-May-19 07:45 PM] jansako#3330
I do think the punishment should fit the crime though

[07-May-19 07:45 PM] jansako#3330
that must be said

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ok , if saying something becomes illegal, then when does thinking something become illegal?

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] jansako#3330

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
why not?

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] jansako#3330
thoughts vs actions

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
saying something is not much of an action

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jansako#3330
thoughts cannot infringe on other people's freedoms

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
when did that change?

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jansako#3330
actions can

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
sure, actions can

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jansako#3330
saying is an action

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jansako#3330
pen is mightier and all that

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
why isnt thinking something?

[07-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it affects the universe

[07-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is we are not so far away from being able to decode thoughts

[07-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
how does one person saying something infringe on another persons freedom?

[07-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
cant you just ignore it?

[07-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i am assuming you are not yelling on my front lawn

[07-May-19 07:51 PM] jansako#3330
if you call the SWAT on me because I took you out in Counter-strike, how do I ignore it?

[07-May-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you talk to invoke some action, that i see can be equated to an action

[07-May-19 07:52 PM] jansako#3330
it matters where you say it

[07-May-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but just talk, without a third party being activated

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jansako#3330
can you give me an example of what that woudl look like and be 'illegal' or 'censorable' now?

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jansako#3330
without the 'call for action' element

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not yelling "FIRE" in a crowded theater

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe someone posts on their website that they like hitler

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
that is illegal i think

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] jansako#3330
because I think the intent makes all the difference

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
should that person be imprisoned for doing that?

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] jansako#3330
Promoting ideologies aimed at curtailing basic freedoms is illegal in many countries

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] jansako#3330
was the intent of the post to promote such?

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe its just a blog

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant know the intent

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
does not matter what it was

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
yes, we can

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
the post does nto exist in a vacuum

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is thought control

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
nope

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jansako#3330
are there actions as well? e.g do you have a hakenkreuz tatoo?

[07-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
intent is from thought, isnt it?

[07-May-19 07:56 PM] jansako#3330
intent is thought aimed at certain action

[07-May-19 07:56 PM] jansako#3330
intent is a consequence of thought

[07-May-19 07:56 PM] jansako#3330
result?

[07-May-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
without knowing the thought, hard to know the intent

[07-May-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
thought police is what is needed

[07-May-19 07:57 PM] jansako#3330
you look at evidence of thought, patterns

[07-May-19 07:57 PM] jansako#3330
nope

[07-May-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can always know the intent
