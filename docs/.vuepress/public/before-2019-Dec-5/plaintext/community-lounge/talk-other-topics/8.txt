one of the leaders of block.one/EOS lives in Old San Juan. I have yet to see or hear of any real construction or real progress done with EOS funds in Puerto Rico, besides 1000$ dinners and 1000$ conferences.

Monero forking off Asics was bad IMO. I can see a time in the future where chains that aren't secured by Asics being vulnerable out of lack of hashpower. But that's all speculation.

[29-Jun-18 12:32 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Asics take the hashpower threshold and blow it out of the water. Forcing you to compete with Asics as well which gets you cost sunk; destroying your motivation to kill the cow your milking.

bitcoin can break off the constraints of low confidence and low development in Africa. Regardless of the political situation of individual countries, bitcoin follows the global supply chain. If an individual participates in the global economy as a producer or consumer and receives financial support, the vision of time and space will be expanded. That means there is more possibility of studying, saving and investing for tomorrow. 

It would be like a huge tsunami to visualize a huge population trapped in a low-trust trap entering the world economy with their cell phones in their hands. The reason why elites like Rosiello gave up their comfortable and stable profession in Europe and conducted " into Africa " is probably because they saw the tsunami in advance.

Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, is considered one of the top three female characters in the world of cryptography, which is dominated by men. 

After graduating from Columbia University with a master's degree in international finance, he had a career in credit suisse. When working in credit suisse, he was in charge of the financial network in sub-Saharan Africa. vividly witnessed banks failing to function properly due to lack of financial infrastructure and outstanding manpower.

what is the value of decentralization other than resistance to the censorship you think?

[01-Jul-18 12:27 PM] Audo#5667
For example identity/alias verification... right now it's done by trusted third parties such as banks, google or facebook (i.e. login with facebook buttons).

These providers are not interoperable.

You give a lot of power to a central serivce provider (like Facebook)

You cannot use their service without their permission, they become gatekeepers

They can change the rules at any point, maybe they decide to charge you more money for the service.

With decentralization we can take these things from privately run businesses to the public domain. We could have a public internet alias that no one really controls, but yet everyone can plug into.

absolute power is absolute corruption. by decentralizing social structures we might actually stand a chance against total centralization

there is one more question.

bitcoin and bitcoin cash which do you think is a real bitcoin?
personally I think the bitcoin cash is a real bitcoin.

[01-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Jazzy#0001
I don't think the question even needs to be asked, which is to say I think it's bitcoin

[01-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Jazzy#0001
The 'real' bitcoin depends partially on what you quantify that as meaning and what people at large agree on

[01-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Jazzy#0001
But given it's natural as evolving software and the overwhelming community consensus that bitcoin is still bitcoin, I don't think there's any reasonable argument to stand on otherwise

@Deleted User If you go by the whitepaper, Satoshi's early comments on bct, and leave out economically driven changes, the answer is:
c) neither

Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin the second that more than 51% of people accepted that CoinBase got to decide "the real Bitcoin" based on economic leverage

It can be seen that the most powerful regulators of the world monetary system perceive that central bank cryptocurrency issuance and circulation are policy decisions that change the basis of international monetary policy.

Digital-Currency Fever May Spread to Federal Reserve
For years central bankers have seen digital currencies as a curiosity to keep an eye on, but now they are increasingly looking at whether they should create their own.

Ripple Is Literally Paying People to Use Its Cryptocurrency
Ripple is giving away millions of dollars worth of the XRP cryptocurrency in an attempt to get people to spend the asset and not just invest in it.

"While the number of bitcoin transactions determines the number of bitcoins in the world (more transactions = more mining = more bitcoins), all the XRP in the world was simply created in 2013. At that time, Ripple generated 100 billion XRP, keeping 80 percent for itself. "

How can anyone attribute a value > zero  to anything where the primary asset holder trades it for marketing (disguised as charity) with a value far less than the asset's apparent market value?

That said, I"d happily accept free XRP to use for buying KMD

That said you're totally right about how on earth ripple's value is so high and it's because the market is as retarded as the author of that article

"(more transactions = more mining = more bitcoins)"
The fact that anyone believes that to be true is everything that is wrong with this space. The same amount of BTC is created if there's 1 miner or 100 million miners ü§¶üèø

To create accounts and contracts on EOS, you have to buy (badly named) RAM, whose supply depends on the cartel of block producers. Naturally, they have been buying up RAM to create a shortage and drive up prices.

more fun facts about the Eos shitshow

[03-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> @ because people are sheep and are automatically assuming the traditionally system will win. So they buy xrp, because their whole entire goal is to help the traditional system "crossover". What they don't realize is just like Komodo Ripple builds and sells white label products and has been pushing these to the banks over their crowd funding XRP token. Why would a bank buy into XRP when they could just launch their own model with the help of Ripple and recreate the same situation ripple has with XRP and hold 80% of it.
