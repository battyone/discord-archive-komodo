That moment when you get P2PK to mostly work but screw up the P2PKH bits ...
😛

[21-Jan-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Like what seems like overly so... But I huess its like that for a reason, best I was able tto manage to "fix" it was to make sure they are only called on connect block rather than every time CheckBlock is called.

[21-Jan-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've sadly reached the point where revamping the payout that I was trying to avoid would have been less work LOL

[21-Jan-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the least work is to use `disablecb` 😂

[21-Jan-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've always agreed that's less work, but that also requires adding to the payout code a deduction for pool fees

[21-Jan-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I've always sought to avoid doing that

[21-Jan-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which was pretty easy.... Once I worked out the math... my ZEX pool has been running constanly with only1 restart for sapling update since the beginning of the coin.

[21-Jan-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never had any problem, or anyone complain payouts are wrong

[21-Jan-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
besides, your method still defeats the entire purpose of getblocktemplate being a thing 😛

[21-Jan-19 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I guess so... It sell needs to construct teh block and turn it into hex to submit it with the valid PoW... Seems like 99% fo that shouldnt be needed either but I wasnt able to work out how to remove it. 😄

[21-Jan-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
getblocktemplate was literally added so that pools could manipulate the payout more readily

[21-Jan-19 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is fine for BTC .... but making all kinds of funky coinbases.... like what james is doing with MAMARA kind of becomes impossible I think.

[21-Jan-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you underestimate my level of determination :trollface:

[21-Jan-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've reached a point where I'll make it work if it kills me, if for no other reason than to prove to you (and likely you alone) that I *can* 😈

[21-Jan-19 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly because you said I wouldn't be "the one to do it"

[21-Jan-19 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is petty and ego-centric like that_

[21-Jan-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... Well I guess once you work it out, you should be able to make it work with most things

[21-Jan-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its definatly something everyone else has thrown in the too ahrd basket

[21-Jan-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The only really "hard" part about it is understanding how the mechanisms work; beyond that, it's mostly just substituting LanguageA for LanguageB

[21-Jan-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
for marmara there is a marmarapoolpayout that generates a pool payout transaction based on available coinbase and supplied poolshares

[21-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So it would need a heavily modified pool or a new one from scratch then?

[21-Jan-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
MARMARA stakes with "locked" utxo only

[21-Jan-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
really with all the variety of possible coinbase restrictions, doing pool payouts in coinbase is not universally possible for all possible combinations of -ac_params

[21-Jan-19 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is why I made `disablecb` seemed the simplest solution at the time, and appears to work just about perfectly.. The other ZEX pools had an issue with payments getting stuck because of invalid address being used my miners, that seems a pool config issue rather than the chnage to `getblocktemplate`

[21-Jan-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`doing pool payouts in coinbase is not universally possible for all possible combinations of -ac_params`
Admittedly there will be some exceptions, but I'm still of the mindset that we should be able to cover more than just the 1 model that's "always" existed (which is why I've been working on expanding the library into something useful, rather than literally only using it to create a single rawtx)
