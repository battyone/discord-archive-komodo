even if they say they will convert 1:1, seeing is believing just like any other promise tbh

[19-Sep-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the two devs that had unpaid invoices just got banned

[19-Sep-19 02:32 PM] jorian#4555
another chain? VRSC maybe @Cryptoon ?

[19-Sep-19 02:32 PM] dan.#2473
theyre deleting stuff left and right

[19-Sep-19 02:32 PM] dan.#2473
im actually in disbelief

[19-Sep-19 02:32 PM] dan.#2473
how sociopathic the whole situation is

[19-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah twilightpunkster supposed to step away

[19-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but still ruling discord

[19-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not looking good, also reasoning behind banning the two devs etc is that they supposedly were accepting payment in k64 instead of euros

[19-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so no money now at all

[19-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
good luck defending that in court lol

[19-Sep-19 02:35 PM] jorian#4555
if i were to run a business like that, i certainly wouldn't feel the need to disclose such things on discord

[19-Sep-19 02:35 PM] jorian#4555
not being a CEO anymore as well

[19-Sep-19 02:36 PM] jorian#4555

[19-Sep-19 02:37 PM] dan.#2473

[19-Sep-19 02:37 PM] dan.#2473

[19-Sep-19 02:41 PM] jorian#4555

[19-Sep-19 02:48 PM] jorian#4555
what is that

[19-Sep-19 02:48 PM] joe2x4#5987
K64 is most assuredly a hot dumpster fire

[19-Sep-19 02:48 PM] Geert#4612
Sam is pathological liar now i am sure

[19-Sep-19 02:49 PM] joe2x4#5987

[19-Sep-19 02:49 PM] dan.#2473
"lost"

[19-Sep-19 02:49 PM] Geert#4612
They never had funding @joe2x4

[19-Sep-19 02:50 PM] joe2x4#5987

[19-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Geert#4612
Psychopathic sociopath with pathological liar syndrome

[19-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Geert#4612
Jackpot

[19-Sep-19 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
if the screenshots above are recent, that points to him trying to scrounge for funds to pay people back

[19-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Geert#4612
Ponzi scheme!!

[19-Sep-19 02:51 PM] joe2x4#5987

troll_lol 

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] jorian#4555
anyways, the game on the expo were just games. nothing special, nothing blockchain in them

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] jorian#4555
they did put a lot of money in the show

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] joe2x4#5987
Apparently the plan was to dump k63 on exchange, get some funding from that, fake an expo to court GS or some vc. But they ducked it up. Amateurs

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
the whole situation is strange. it would be good if it just came to an end. if they move from the kmd chain that might be the best thing.

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] joe2x4#5987
Ohh they are definitely moving

[19-Sep-19 02:55 PM] joe2x4#5987
As well as move office 5th time lol

[19-Sep-19 02:56 PM] jorian#4555
i don't know why changing a blockchain will suddenly change everything

[19-Sep-19 02:56 PM] jorian#4555
it's not that the VRSC codebase allows for much more than KMD, game-wise

[19-Sep-19 02:57 PM] dan.#2473

[19-Sep-19 02:59 PM] dan.#2473
