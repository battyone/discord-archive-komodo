Good morning to everyone,Im around  Komodo  from 2017 and holding my tokens and get more ,is cheaper tha. Coffee so is worth to buy daily,I'm not a tech person but I learn alot from Komodo platform ,In the view of Komodo team how a project like Stellae fail ?why I ask is to understand the technical issues with a project like Stellar  thanks  gents for help

[17-May-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
stellar forked ripple

[17-May-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ripple has what are called validator nodes

[17-May-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
these nodes have total power over the blockchain, create blocks, censor tx, freeze accounts, likely even edit prior tx details

[17-May-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for many years ripple had 8 validator nodes, all run by ripple

[17-May-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so a distributed infrastructure with centralized control

[17-May-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
since these validator nodes are all powerful, you cant really let just anybody become a validator. else they can really mess things up with these great powers

[17-May-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so all the new validator nodes add a list of trusted validators, which they use to resolve conflicts

[17-May-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems all the stellar validator nodes went offline (centralized control over validators), maybe somebody pulled the plug on the power by mistake, who knows

[17-May-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
since the only trusted validators were offline, the other validators had no idea what to do, so they shutdown waiting for instructions from their masters
