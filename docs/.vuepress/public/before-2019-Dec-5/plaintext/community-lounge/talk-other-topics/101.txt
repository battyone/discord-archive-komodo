Facebook has already contacted Fed before the release of the Libra White Paper. What did they talk about? Libra Reserve's currency basket consists of dollars, euros, yen and pounds (yuan is out!) It is obvious that the dollar will take up a major part. Libra's success means that the dollar will soon play the role of a key currency within the digital currency ecosystem. In other words, both Facebook and Fed can win.

Stimulated by the Libra, China is stepping up its CBDC development. From China's point of view, Libra has no choice because Libra has "yuan passing." China will be the first and most successful country in the world to distribute CBDC. Of course, the U.S. has no intention of giving up the hegemony of the digital currency ecosystem to China. Facebook is cleverly appealing this point.

More than 70 percent of the 28 companies participating in the Libra Association are U.S. companies. Even if the number of Libra association companies increases to 100, there is a high chance that the U.S. company will take up more than a majority. Chinese companies will either be excluded at all or have very limited roles. The U.S. government can monitor and control Libra whenever it wants.

The variable is Wall Street. There are no Wall Street banks in the Libra Association yet. Wall Street is wary of Silicon Valley encroaching on its territory, and if it doesn't get to the banks of Wall Street, which have a lot of lobbying power, approval of the Libra may be longer than expected.

“libra will not share customers’ account information or financial data with Facebook unless people agree to permit such sharing.”

If users "don't agree," libra means they don't share user data with Facebook. Facebook will provide vague and abstract terms written in sesame letters and people will inadvertently click on consent to provide information for convenient service use. eventually, user data between libra and Facebook is likely to be shared

Hi everyone,  

With a lot admiration for your work and open-source values in the Komodo community, I wanted to share a project that might interest you:  

https://timetosolve.com

It's an effort to build urgent climate solutions, designed as **open-source tools** that communities can adopt/configure to best serve their needs.

I'm currently looking for collaborators and early members of the project/community, and I feel many of you have experience + values that are an awesome fit for the work to be done.

If you're interested in getting involved, just send a reply/DM, and share a brief intro about what you enjoy working on and how you'd like to contribute  

Likewise, if you simply want to share ideas/feedback and discuss climate innovations, it would be great to have your voice in the mix

I've had to cryptically dance around talking about this for months, but here, finally, is the complete story of the fraudulent hostile takeover of @Cryptopia_NZ by Intranel from its founders Adam and Rob.
It is alleged Intranel inside-job hacked Cryptopia. https://t.co/s58...

You think Hollywood with their massive budgets would create new franchises instead of just rehashing old ones for targeted audiences .   Then again we all know how lazy Hollywood directors are

A Black Woman Is Taking Over as 007. It’s About Damn Time.
According to a new report, Daniel Craig will pass the martini to “Captain Marvel” actress Lashana Lynch, who will be introduced as the new 007 in the still-untitled 25th Bond film.

well......she's 007 but not james bond

[18-Jul-19 04:09 PM] PTYX#6840
i don't particularly care either way but from what i grasped they are replacing bond with a new codename or whatever

[18-Jul-19 04:10 PM] PTYX#6840
as long as they bring Q back it'll be alright. Hopefully they don't replace Q with a K (karen)

what do you think the cartoons for kids will look like in say 5-10 years

[18-Jul-19 04:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hard to say there has been some good newer cartoons,  Avatar: the last airbender and Korra  are pretty good

Nothing wrong with including a diverse cast just have to change or evolve the story,  extreme ghostbusters is a good example.  Problem is when they go too PC with it and are more focused pushing their moral agenda than on the story

[18-Jul-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's "diverse" and then there's "pandering"

the virtue signalling downward spiral. all vestiges of 'the patriarchy' must be erased from popular media. the fact that hollywood is willing to sacrifice it's profits to this end is evidence of the determination of it's controllers.

Sasha from Wavesplatform is holding actually an AMA:
Question to him was: Q: What will the new consensus be? I.e. how will it be 'provably secure'?
His Answer:
Good question 😃 In Q4 2019 we'll have another Waves blockchain release, with two important features - new provably secure consensus and sidechains. new POS will be based on VRF functions, and will make even theoretical attacks on Waves chain impossible.
