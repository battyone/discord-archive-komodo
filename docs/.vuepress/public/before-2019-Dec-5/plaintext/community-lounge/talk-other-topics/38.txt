interesting that centralize Neobanks are trying to reinvente the wheel by entering into the space using crypto and blockchain tech as a hype hook in an intent to boost their margins and profits in a very low margin sector. I believe that in order to actually be relevant and solve real words problems while being widely used by  the unbank wherever they are and whoever they are, the solution can only come from banking capability develop on top of a protocol as a fully integrated extra lawyer. Example what Komodo are doing in integrating projects like √ò. We need to remember that banking and services should be  seamless experience not a hype classy thing. Finance is a tool in service to economic agent not a trendy thing
