yep .. al I typed was 'and no reason given?' in respect to kicking one of those devs out they didnt pay .. and that was - 9 hours ago or so

[19-Sep-19 03:24 PM] dan.#2473
k64 needs to put their money where their mouth is, thats all anyone has ever asked

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] dan.#2473
including those freelance devs ^

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] BanHammer#8115
never going to happen

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] dan.#2473
... and about half a dozen other things

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] BanHammer#8115
TP lied to everyone

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] BanHammer#8115
about everything

[19-Sep-19 03:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah the one freelancer gave me some background on how TP was twisting what had passed

[19-Sep-19 03:26 PM] BanHammer#8115

[19-Sep-19 03:26 PM] BanHammer#8115

[19-Sep-19 03:26 PM] dan.#2473
TP has probably sold a bridge or 2 in his lifetime

[19-Sep-19 03:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
happens ...

[19-Sep-19 03:27 PM] LocoMB#8593
that dumpster fire image is quite appropriate

[19-Sep-19 03:27 PM] dan.#2473
yeah at most, i would recommend never putting more than a few hundred on a moonshot

[19-Sep-19 03:27 PM] dan.#2473
you just never know, and if it does take off, thats more than enough

[19-Sep-19 03:28 PM] dan.#2473
well thats one less discord i dont have to waste my time on reading

[19-Sep-19 03:37 PM] dan.#2473
in the defense of k64, they really did never did ICO did they?

[19-Sep-19 03:38 PM] dan.#2473
they probably could of gotten some more funds, especially given how hyped it was

[19-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that's true

[19-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they did big otc sales though

[19-Sep-19 03:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
before the GS partnership

[19-Sep-19 03:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
for lawyers to sort out - which hopefully will happen ..
oth, this was a tech-startup attempting to utilize blockchain technology for a certain use case, so not much cryptocurrency at base

[19-Sep-19 03:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
think Theranos in small

[19-Sep-19 03:41 PM] dan.#2473
imo to put it nicely i do think its a legit company, with legit intentions, with management/PR/lying/HR issues

[19-Sep-19 03:42 PM] dan.#2473
theres just been too much BS dialect

[19-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how do you recover from such big mismanagement/reputation damage though

[19-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dan.#2473
not sure you do tbh

[19-Sep-19 03:45 PM] Geert#4612
I made report to FBI and Politie in Nederland
report for Sam, Max and Riccardo

[19-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dan.#2473
i know no one wants to admit, but curious how much people lost in general

[19-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Geert#4612
lost about 1000 Euros

[19-Sep-19 03:47 PM] dan.#2473
sorry to hear that.

[19-Sep-19 03:48 PM] dan.#2473
I literally just invested the other week at lows, $350 USD

[19-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I almost invested 3k kmd back in may

[19-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
was pissed I didnt when k64 pumped and I would have x5ed my investment in june ish

[19-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
glad I missed the boat now

[19-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Geert#4612
Only bought because @KomodoWorld scambag... my mistake I learn from it but Im sorely disappointed

[19-Sep-19 03:49 PM] dan.#2473
ill give him the benefit of the doubt

[19-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh, if it turns out to be a scam, I think Komodoworld will probably be the biggest victim financially wise

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[19-Sep-19 03:50 PM] dan.#2473
TP sure knows how to spin a story

[19-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Geert#4612
Sorry you also lose money @dan.

[19-Sep-19 03:50 PM] dan.#2473
yes

[19-Sep-19 03:50 PM] dan.#2473
thanks, wasnt much, and i was willing to lose it

[19-Sep-19 03:51 PM] dan.#2473
look at it this way guys

[19-Sep-19 03:51 PM] dan.#2473
if TP was that good at talking to us, imagine how good he was talking to GS (let's assume there were meetings)

[19-Sep-19 03:51 PM] dan.#2473
its just that dotted line never happened cause, its absolute insanity

[19-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I still hope the money is there and everyone gets rich, even if it's not me ðŸ™‚

[19-Sep-19 03:52 PM] dan.#2473
eh maybe it works out. itll be a while though

[19-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, only time will tell. This is all a relatively very small time period

[19-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe in a year we will look back at this and be proven all wrong etc

[19-Sep-19 03:54 PM] dan.#2473
id shit my pants if that happens

[19-Sep-19 03:54 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[19-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
better buy some diapers just in case ðŸ˜„

[19-Sep-19 03:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I see I'm tagged, @Geert you and your other sockpuppets (layla, Rikkert, etc,) can go fuck yourself. I hope you were well paid. If you're planning to use Komodo technology be assured that your project doesn't conflict with what the small mafia running Komodo is doing. Otherwise you can get the bad ending of a shaft. I stand 100% with my support for K64 and I'm also out of here. Good luck to all, the tech great, some people not so much.

[19-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Geert#4612
Scammer and rude also..  I hope YOU were well paid @KomodoWorld

[19-Sep-19 03:57 PM] dan.#2473
:PeepoThink:

[19-Sep-19 03:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
LoL

[19-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Geert#4612
Scambag calling Komodo mafia :troll_lol:

[19-Sep-19 03:58 PM] dan.#2473
ok lets just settle for a second

[19-Sep-19 03:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ahahah you should change stock photos sometimes

[19-Sep-19 03:59 PM] dan.#2473
@KomodoWorld isnt it a bit odd that every bit of news or promises never happened?

[19-Sep-19 03:59 PM] dan.#2473
not 1 thing

[19-Sep-19 03:59 PM] PTYX#6840
Where is hollowman?

[19-Sep-19 03:59 PM] PTYX#6840
So basically now Sam is blaming Meyse

[19-Sep-19 04:00 PM] PTYX#6840
As I said would happen. Those around him will take the flak.

[19-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Meyse maybe he can enlighten us what went down?

[19-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Geert#4612
All lies and Riccardo helped them, report him to Italian police the scambag

[19-Sep-19 04:00 PM] dan.#2473
K64 didnt have to offer a buyback to disgruntled investors, but they did offer, and again, delays, delays, words, words

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] dan.#2473
the vortex keeps deepening

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Geert#4612
Max is in the same group... in the last day k64 team will scapegoat Sam no no no

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] PTYX#6840
@Geert i doubt they broke any laws.

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] PTYX#6840
But that doesn't excuse the facts

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, I still believe Komodoworld is a solid dude, I saw what he offered to help when the hack happened etc. But sometimes even the smartest people can have different views or believe lies/whatever

[19-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Geert#4612
They broke laws @PTYX

[19-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As always, trust the proof. We have yet to see proof of confirmation of funding or wrongdoing of either party.  (cfr scam/maffia stuff)

[19-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Geert#4612
Selling something and giving false information to increase the sales is fraudulent in Europe

{Reactions}

[19-Sep-19 04:02 PM] PTYX#6840
According to laws in the Netherlands they are operating within a scope to collect funds from investors and not be considered a security or have any oversight.

[19-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
this is crypto man, not a security

[19-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as ptyx also says

[19-Sep-19 04:03 PM] PTYX#6840
It's fairly broad in the Netherlands.

[19-Sep-19 04:03 PM] PTYX#6840
But again, that doesn't excuse the facts

[19-Sep-19 04:03 PM] PTYX#6840
Just stating that legally they are probably OK

[19-Sep-19 04:04 PM] dan.#2473
i dont know netherland laws, but if thats the case, thats pretty fucked

[19-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Geert#4612
Going for dancing see you later every one
