citizens who grew up in the democratic school of Athens tend to believe that they can navigate the rough waves of history in the illusion that they are the masters of history. they are shouting in favor of all matters and opposed to all matters. and they can kill a leader who just in favor of the thing they just approached. because the public is a model of irresponsibility, fools who believe in democracy as taught in school hope to be cautious and prudent.

ZH article:
"this week saw Italian lawmakers from 5 Star asking Parliament to pass two draft laws:

One law would instruct the central bank‚Äôs owners, most of them private banks, to sell their shares to the Italian Treasury at prices from the 1930s.

The other law would declare the Italian people to be the owners of the Bank of Italy‚Äôs reserve of 2451.8 metric tons of gold, worth around $102 billion at current prices."

is it possible to trace a monero transaction ? i heard they had some issues but where are they now in terms of "private" transaction ?  (sry if it's not the right channel)

[08-Apr-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on who you transact with

[08-Apr-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
large parts of the early monero chain had weak to no privacy

[08-Apr-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
over the years it evolved to be much better

[08-Apr-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so more luck of the draw than anything whether you end up interacting with these earlier tainted utxo, but the hard part is that is it not easy to know the history of each utxo when transacting

[08-Apr-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so only externally correlated DB can shed light on if your current tx is pure

Blockchain world's last collateral asset, Bitcoin

Will Bitcoin find its role in blockchain platforms led by Samsung or IBM? those who are optimistic about blockchain but pessimistic about bitcoin predict that the coin issued by a leading company will replace bitcoin. the controversy has been around since the early days of Bitcoin. those who understand Bitcoin as a technology weigh on the prospect that Bitcoin will be replaced. 

on the other hand, those who value Bitcoin's historical significance are skeptical about the prospect of Bitcoin giving way to coin with better technology and a strong issuing entity.

not all Bitcoin attributes are inevitable. for example, the maximum amount of issuance, 21 million or an average approval time of 10 minutes, and the capacity of a block are accidental properties. However, the status of Bitcoin in blockchain phenomenon is inevitable. Whatever it was, it needed the ultimate collateral assets to boost the ecosystem of blockchain. Bitcoin is the ultimate collateral asset in a blockchain world that does not require a higher guarantor, as even ethereum began with its investment in bitcoin. Although no one guarantees this finality, Samsung, IBM, Facebook, and Google cannot replace it.
