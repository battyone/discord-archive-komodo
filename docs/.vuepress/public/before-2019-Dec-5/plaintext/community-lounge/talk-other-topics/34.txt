Hmm very interesting

[21-Nov-18 02:17 AM] Godballz#9524
Off topic question: Can a DeX or even an exchange have a coin that recognizes many types of different crypto addresses and automatically utilizes stored crypto assets to convert them in real time for trade across platforms? Basically a coin that can become a btc or vrsc or eth etc upon transfer since exchanges carry large volumes of each coin anyway and already track conversion rates. Of course it couldnt borrow escrow or orders so it'd have to be based off fees stored in accounts. Jw if this can exist or if it already does as I'd imagine it'd improve crypto usability and ease of use and in turn, adoption

[21-Nov-18 02:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not clear on the question exactly.
you saying a DEX which can auto trade the portfolio of a person, and with a choice of which is the main trading coin for that portfolio, like if user wants to have more liquidity in BTC then the goal of portfolio is it get more of BTC by auto trading etc?

As I understand it it already exists in the existing version 1.0 of `marketmaker` API, and is also GUIed in BarterDEX GUI under advanced UI interface.

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in BarterDEX, user can trade ANY coin to ANY coin, and also set the percentage of the coins to auto trade based on either price range or margin range.
It's the perfect tool for market makers

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the missing part is to have the arbitrage to centralised exchanges

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which at 1 point was also there in C code made by James

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] Godballz#9524
Like if I traded you a btc for 3000 kmd

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

and it worked amazing back then

[21-Nov-18 02:28 AM] Godballz#9524
Oh cool

[21-Nov-18 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the cross exchange from barterdex to centralised exchange code is still there in the C code repository if some C dev wants to use it

[21-Nov-18 02:30 AM] Godballz#9524
See that is the future, at least to get more inexperienced users in

[21-Nov-18 02:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if extended, it can be extended to use almost any centralised exchange API possible, and that means an arbitrage opportunities between DEX and CEX and also multiplying liquidity on BarterDEX

[21-Nov-18 02:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a super amazing opportunity for a new project utilising just this tech part.

[21-Nov-18 02:30 AM] Godballz#9524

[21-Nov-18 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is not so straight forward and neither diffcult as I understand, knowing that the major part of the required code help is there in C code made by James

[21-Nov-18 02:34 AM] Godballz#9524

joker added custom rpc calls for it to streamer chains which wouldn't be so simple to port to BCH

[21-Nov-18 09:39 PM] Alright#0419

*Protocol projects, companies, and investors will need to dig deep and find true north. They will need to align their activities with long-term value creation. But if the next five years are anything like the last, expect to see value continue to flow from centralized corporate entities to less centralized networks and applications.
The hard work is happening, but it takes time. And growth is rarely neat or linear. While today‚Äôs value capture feels like an evolution of capital markets, the crypto revolution will continue to experiment and push boundaries, and ultimately, shift value from centralized systems and structures to *less centralized* systems.*
