most exchanges have their terms and costs hidden away

[04-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Markus#5464
exchanges should just use cold wallets and make withdraws 1-2 times a day

Bitmex  never  hacked

[04-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Andersen#8337
withdrawal 1 time  a  24 hrs

[04-Oct-19 09:35 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
DigitalPrice was compromised due to the Agama vulnerability: as I understand they used Agama in Lite mode to transfer funds from their cold wallet to their hot wallet.

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] xeonrider#3120
Agama was the komodo wallet right

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Yup

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] xeonrider#3120
well, things can get hacked. Can't do anything about that.

[04-Oct-19 09:37 AM] xeonrider#3120
Just patch patch patch

[04-Oct-19 09:38 AM] xeonrider#3120
maybe some ducktape

[04-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Andersen#8337
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠   thats  mean  DP   use  both  wallets as  hot,   not  cold wallett

[04-Oct-19 09:38 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
True...

[04-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Oszy#5734
`Does anyone know a good resource to get minimum funding for example to get dPoW, maybe 1-2 listings (beaxy) and server costs?` 
do some private sales, get investors interested in your project

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Oszy#5734
forget beaxy most of the people won't sign up there to trade cus kyc

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I should rephrase my statement: active hot wallet and storage hot-wallet

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] xeonrider#3120
hah, like I know any investors at all xD

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Oszy#5734
try to get on smaller exchanges, tradeogre, altsbit, atomicdex

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Oszy#5734
well if you don't tell us what your project is about, we can't invest innit

[04-Oct-19 09:39 AM] xeonrider#3120
very simple

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Oszy#5734
make a discord, have a whitepaper draft at least

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] xeonrider#3120
a black jack game

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] xeonrider#3120
oh god

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] xeonrider#3120
no

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Oszy#5734
ok i don't know how serious is it right now just telling ideas

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Oszy#5734
everything starts somewhere

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] xeonrider#3120
a simple blackjack game, you play, bet and stuff

[04-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Oszy#5734
without an exchange

[04-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Oszy#5734
you could get your own channel in ecosystem projects just have a github with the code so we can verify 🙂

[04-Oct-19 09:41 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Hmmm, I'm tempted to suggest another chain, but it's not my intention to hijack potential Komodo bussiness...

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Oszy#5734
then investors will come if your doing good stuff

{Reactions}
☝ 

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] xeonrider#3120
investors who look at code?

[04-Oct-19 09:42 AM] Oszy#5734
I do

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
@xeonrider if u think blockchain based then im not sure how well u can compete against CHIPS, might want to find a easier target

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] xeonrider#3120
dont want to compete

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Oszy#5734
CHIPS is different..

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Oszy#5734
let him do his idea

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Oszy#5734
this is not a competition here

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] xeonrider#3120
so, basically advise is to drop exchange stuff

[04-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
True but he might get ppl more interested if he will do something what ppl are not already doing

[04-Oct-19 09:44 AM] xeonrider#3120
and no dpow

[04-Oct-19 09:44 AM] Oszy#5734
people can trade or invest OTC if it's a legit project and you can be trusted and for that all you need to prove is a working product

[04-Oct-19 09:44 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I would consider a listing on atomicDEX, xeonrider

{Reactions}
☝ 

[04-Oct-19 09:45 AM] Oszy#5734
but that takes time too they will add coins later

[04-Oct-19 09:45 AM] Oszy#5734
just focus on your project first

[04-Oct-19 09:45 AM] Oszy#5734
show us something 🙂

[04-Oct-19 09:45 AM] Oszy#5734
And I might invest 😉

[04-Oct-19 09:46 AM] xeonrider#3120
haha

[04-Oct-19 09:46 AM] xeonrider#3120
sorry, I wont do a whitepaper

[04-Oct-19 09:47 AM] Markus#5464
@xeonrider whats is ur goal anyway

[04-Oct-19 09:47 AM] Oszy#5734
a description and documentation is very much needed if you want us to understand how things work

[04-Oct-19 09:47 AM] Oszy#5734
we all know what blackjack is

[04-Oct-19 09:47 AM] Oszy#5734
but how you planning ot use blockchain is what we are interested in

{Reactions}

[04-Oct-19 09:48 AM] Oszy#5734
don't want to end up like "we_dont_say_the_name_of_that_project" do you

[04-Oct-19 09:48 AM] xeonrider#3120
?

[04-Oct-19 09:48 AM] Markus#5464
Does not feel too serious since he refuse to even  do a whitepaper, would not invest

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Oszy#5734
take a look at #kmdice and get some ideas if you haven't already

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Oszy#5734
that is a good blockchain game project

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
@Markus just to get dPoW for now

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Oszy#5734
they dont have whitepaper

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
and a list

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
thats it

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
maybe 20 bucks for a better linode

[04-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Oszy#5734
why do you want dpow for something that's not even ready?

[04-Oct-19 09:50 AM] xeonrider#3120
because its a security feature. I am not writing a whole new antara thing, its not even worth calling an ecosystem project

[04-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
a new smart chain is very much a whole new antara thing

[04-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
unless you are writing a cc to use on any chain

[04-Oct-19 09:51 AM] xeonrider#3120
just a dapp that uses RPC, and assets, and its own coin (which is super easy on Komodo)

[04-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Markus#5464
like JL777 use to say, in a car u first make the engine and u dont sell the car before u have a working prototype

[04-Oct-19 09:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
well, I was not asking for it, just asking if there were resources

[04-Oct-19 09:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
I am not that long here

[04-Oct-19 09:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
I forgot it gets a bit hostile here when I ask questions

[04-Oct-19 09:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
thanks all

[04-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Oszy#5734
I am trying to say you don't need dpow unless you did finish coding and everything works fine. show us the game, let us test it, decide if we want to fund you, then you can dpow

[04-Oct-19 09:53 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I don't read it all as hostile, but as well-intended advice.

[04-Oct-19 09:54 AM] Oszy#5734
I really just trying be objective here, based on past experiences, and seen enough project launch and fails because of said things

[04-Oct-19 09:55 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Any thoughts on this?

[04-Oct-19 09:55 AM] Oszy#5734
` I was not asking for it, just asking if there were resources` - Yes, there are people here who might be interested in said funding, and usually we'd like to see a working product or code first. This was my advise.

[04-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Oszy#5734
Nothing hostile, no hard feelings, I like the idea of your project.

[04-Oct-19 09:56 AM] xeonrider#3120
I am not starting a big project. It seems that dPoW is a security feature of Komodo and it comes across as a necessity before releasing the coin out in the wild.

[04-Oct-19 09:57 AM] xeonrider#3120
I just dont want to have an angry mob chasing me because I didn't have it in the first place.

[04-Oct-19 09:57 AM] Oszy#5734
This is why i advised you to have a channel or discord where we can privately test your game, before you'd launch it

[04-Oct-19 09:58 AM] xeonrider#3120
so there are no kickstarter platform of any kind or like programs

[04-Oct-19 09:58 AM] xeonrider#3120
I mean I can pay that in installments but the whole sum is just too much

[04-Oct-19 09:59 AM] xeonrider#3120
but thanks anyway

[04-Oct-19 09:59 AM] Oszy#5734
because if you want an app that's 100% non-exploitable, dpow is not enough on its own, that is to protect the chain only, you need komodo guys to try to exploit it believe me 😉

[04-Oct-19 09:59 AM] xeonrider#3120
ehm now you are scaring me

[04-Oct-19 09:59 AM] xeonrider#3120
no, I just want to prevent something

[04-Oct-19 10:00 AM] xeonrider#3120
its probably a break even project

[04-Oct-19 10:00 AM] xeonrider#3120
maybe get me a better job

[04-Oct-19 10:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just spin up a chain and develop your application.  No need for DPoW when no reason to double spend on the chain

[04-Oct-19 10:00 AM] Oszy#5734

[04-Oct-19 10:00 AM] Markus#5464
@xeonrider Do you have any previous experience from blockchain developing?

[04-Oct-19 10:01 AM] xeonrider#3120
Yes, but its Ethereum

[04-Oct-19 10:01 AM] phm87#7395
I run several testchains without dpow to test ideas and changes

[04-Oct-19 10:02 AM] Oszy#5734
If you need help testing, we are always here and welcoming new projects, we have no intention to double-spend on your chain trust me, you don't need dPow right now.

[04-Oct-19 10:04 AM] Oszy#5734
You could even use a chain with mining disabled just use PoS with 0 reward

[04-Oct-19 10:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@xeonrider #kmdlabs offers dpow on test chains under an incetivised testing model. Might be a good place to develop in early stages without spending all your beer money
