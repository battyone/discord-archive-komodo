try ewbf, maybe? afaik that usually happens with banning and too much "bad" info in shares

[08-Oct-18 09:30 PM] wookie#7663
ok, will try. thanks

[08-Oct-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wookie make sure you use old ewbf, I don't think he put 200,9 back into the new one

[08-Oct-18 09:32 PM] wookie#7663
how "old" is old? I'm seeing 0.0.x, 0.2.x and 0.3.x

[08-Oct-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

4 and 5 are for the lemming coins

[08-Oct-18 09:33 PM] wookie#7663
ok, thanks!

[08-Oct-18 09:59 PM] wookie#7663
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 thanks! That did the trick!

[08-Oct-18 10:00 PM] wookie#7663
I've never used ewbf before, tried dstm and it worked the first time so I stuck with it.

[08-Oct-18 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
good to hear
now that you're sure it's working, besure to runit with `--fee 0` 😉

[08-Oct-18 10:01 PM] wookie#7663
would it make any difference between ewbf vs dstm for pirate mining? (I know I'm hardly getting anything in pirate with gpu, but something is better than nothing)

[08-Oct-18 10:01 PM] wookie#7663
oh, it's just me mining on it.

[08-Oct-18 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a lot of personal preference among the closed-source miner apps, but I've never had any issue with ewbf, so I never went to anything else

[08-Oct-18 10:02 PM] wookie#7663
actually.....I think i'm still getting the error, every 6-7 shares, the miner loses connection

[08-Oct-18 10:02 PM] wookie#7663
it'll pick right back up like dstm did

[08-Oct-18 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is there no errors showing in the knomp terminal?

[08-Oct-18 10:05 PM] wookie#7663
does this matter? It's the only thing in red

what's the white stuff before that in the terminal?

[08-Oct-18 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the miner's not the issue, it's the pool

[08-Oct-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
what hardware should be bought to mine kmd

[08-Oct-18 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
z9 or z9 mini

[08-Oct-18 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
GPUs or ASICs
I lean toward ASICs for profitability

[08-Oct-18 10:21 PM] wookie#7663
before I got onto pirate, I was mining kmd with my 1x1080ti + 1x 1060 3gb, I got average 0.5kmd/day, now maybe ~4pirate/day

[08-Oct-18 10:21 PM] wookie#7663
@SHossain was it you that bought used z9's?

[08-Oct-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
no.

[08-Oct-18 10:22 PM] SHossain#0007
i never buy any used electronics

[08-Oct-18 10:22 PM] wookie#7663
nm, I thought someone said they did

whats the expected shelf life of the z9/z9 mini, sorry am new to mining

[08-Oct-18 10:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User They've only existed for a short time, but assume 1-2 years based on previous similar equipment

[08-Oct-18 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000

[09-Oct-18 12:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@BlackJesus  it is a coin for the Bibox exchange which convienently has a BTM/BIX pair.  It can be used for trading fees and also comes with a revshare of the trading fees in the coin that the fee was collected in.

[09-Oct-18 02:45 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Any link for versus cpu mining

[09-Oct-18 02:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cpu for verus is in-wallet

[09-Oct-18 02:46 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Agama?

[09-Oct-18 02:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they have their own flavor of agama

[09-Oct-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie you wont find a block solo ... i have 550Mh/s on it and only get  i block every 6 days

[09-Oct-18 02:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm aware of the diff, just answering the question asked 😛

[09-Oct-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im on this pool as its in AUstralia with low ping.

[09-Oct-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
has been stable as, wlthough there is now a 1% fee .

[09-Oct-18 02:48 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Thx

[09-Oct-18 02:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I really ought to put cuda in one of my 13 card rigs and try a run at it

[09-Oct-18 02:50 AM] DR3WSKi#8767
Is it worth doing w just CPU’s mine are all on xtl right now

[09-Oct-18 02:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't think of it when I answered, but if you go the nheqminer route and join a pool, it likely will be better than the long haul of doing solo

[09-Oct-18 02:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as "worth doing" that's going to be entirely up to what hash you have and what profit margins you can live with

[09-Oct-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CPU mining here on a ryxen 2700X is getting me like 24 coins a week....

[09-Oct-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but power is basically free with solar, and just 1 CPU.... so its free coins.

[09-Oct-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Price per coin? And thx for info

[09-Oct-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea I am only mining to hold.

[09-Oct-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Got on verus a bit late 😦

[09-Oct-18 03:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I just looked at that pool @blackjok3r, have you ever looked at the worker names of some of the block finders? 😂

[09-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181

there are AMD miners for VRSC now

[09-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
price about 15 to 20 cents

[09-Oct-18 07:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't figure it would take too long after the cuda miner came out

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i saw it outperformed the Nvidia

[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but not 100% sure

[09-Oct-18 07:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sweet, now maybe AMD folks can make back some of the $ the we NV miners beat them out of with equihash 😛

[09-Oct-18 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
just got a shipping notification for the latest round of z9mini's :shexy:

[09-Oct-18 01:32 PM] $tefano.#3560
me too 😄

[09-Oct-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_didn't buy any this time around, he sunk all of his duckets into PIRATE_

[09-Oct-18 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
I doubled the size of my massive farm, to 2 z9m's 😉 Gotta put this PSU to full use

[09-Oct-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
600 watt PSU 😮

[09-Oct-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they still make them that small?

[09-Oct-18 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
I never even thought to power multiple devices with one PSU before, to be honest. I have multiple PSU's which are under-used

[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a 1000W gold and this thing bitmain sent me, which supposedly can run 2 z9m's I think

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
`3. This batch of PSU comes with only 10 PCIe connectors so cannot be used with more than one Antminer.`

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
use splitters

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am just seeing this on their site. I didn't buy a PSU in batch 3, but I did buy a batch 2 one. It seems to have enough connectors

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] $tefano.#3560
innosilicon VS z9 mini in italy, my experience 

price of z9 mini now is ~1024$ (psu included +  shipping + duty tax of 22%)  for 15K/h and for 300 watt
price for innosilicon is ~4504$ (psu included + shipping + duty tax of 22% ) for 52K/h and 700 watt

4 x z9 mini = 4096$ - 95$ for 1 psu because 1 psu is for 2 z9mini  =~4000$ for 60/khs and 1200watt
so 4 x z9mini are better than a 1 innosilicon with +500$ less than innosilicon, +10 k/h that is +576,22€ 
(1 K/s = 4000/60 = 66$ x 10K/h = 660$  => 576,22€  )

electricity in italy is about 0,30 cent so 500 watt a day is about 3,6€
436,53€ + 576,22 = 1012,75 / 3.6€ day =  € 281days 

after 281 days innosilicon is better than z9 mini

[09-Oct-18 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
whoa the speed text

[09-Oct-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@$tefano. I'll check the numbers later, but to start with 1 PSU runs more than 1 mini, so that number is off by $300-400+

[09-Oct-18 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
the description doesn't make sense to me, because I see 10 connectors on my batch 2 psu, and 6 are still free

[09-Oct-18 02:11 PM] $tefano.#3560
1 psu x 2 z9 mini with 2 connector out

[09-Oct-18 02:11 PM] $tefano.#3560
every z9 mini 4 connectors

[09-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto there's 10 because they cord them for S9s

[09-Oct-18 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i was wondering, since the z9m only uses 4

[09-Oct-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why make a 2nd production run when you can sell more of the same?

[09-Oct-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, makes sense

[09-Oct-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`1 psu x 2 z9 mini with 2 connector out`
That's fine if you want to turn your nice, shiny new 1250 watt PSU into a 600 watt PSU and buy another for the next 600

[09-Oct-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for me, $12 in splitters is cheaper than $110 in PSUs

[09-Oct-18 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
so when the new z9m comes, I read that it is best to have power off while connecting the new mini to the same PSU (1.2 gigawats?!?!?!?), so what is the preferred way to power down the asic? I've never turned it off, and all I see is a "reboot" option in their shitty web gui

[09-Oct-18 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
ssh in and do a `halt` ?

[09-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If they don't have the loop wire on the PSUs anymore, pull the connector that goes to the control board

[09-Oct-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They used to have a green loop wire that is a connector "switch"

[09-Oct-18 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for the info. I don't see a green loop wire on my batch2 z9m

[09-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not on the z9, on the bm PSU

[09-Oct-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you have a non-bm PSU, just flip the switch 😛

[09-Oct-18 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pulling the power plug out of the wall works too

[09-Oct-18 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, love doing that 😃

[09-Oct-18 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
In theory, will connect all plugs for both z9m's to the PSU, *then* plug in PSU to wall, and then hopefully magic happens

[09-Oct-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[09-Oct-18 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
this one time, I filled every jumper position with spare jumpers I could find, on a 486 motherboard. The CPU smoked and caught fire when I turned it on. Guess that experience has always stuck with me

[09-Oct-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_can actually picture that_

[09-Oct-18 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 thank you for being a trove of mining knowledge, genuinely
