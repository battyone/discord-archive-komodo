always mining at maximum timestamp prevtime+4(?) will give a slight advantage, no?

[12-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, local time + 4

[12-Aug-19 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
so setting system clock 3-4 seconds in the future will give a slight mining advantage

[12-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Alright#0419
also stratums will definitely need some tweaks so that they mine at the correct diff

[12-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Alright#0419
how often will diff lower if chain is stuck? just constantly?

[12-Aug-19 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, during the same block

[12-Aug-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
I mean there isn't like a specific timeframe?

[12-Aug-19 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
like 1 second, diff lowers, another second, diff lowers

[12-Aug-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
diff is just lowering constantly?

[12-Aug-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
oh it seems to be that already, nevermind

[12-Aug-19 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
in blocktemplate at least

[12-Aug-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if in RST or exp() mode, diff is adjusting every second

[12-Aug-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 good luck with this 🤣

[12-Aug-19 07:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm reserving judgement until it's "done"

[12-Aug-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i think its pretty close now, i dont expect major changes unless some viable attacks are found

[12-Aug-19 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
8 million diff

[12-Aug-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems 2 fast blocks and now very hard diff so exp() needs to kick in

[12-Aug-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
will take another 10 minutes for the 8 million diff to come into CPU range

[12-Aug-19 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright was this real hashrate, or timestamp fiddling?

[12-Aug-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
8 million is the highest diff we have seen during testing, 1.2 million was the previous high

[12-Aug-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
interestingly it got there in 2 blocks

[12-Aug-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
solvetime of 1302 seconds

[12-Aug-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
was accidental timestamp fiddling 😅

[12-Aug-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
stratum got block template as soon as prev block came in

[12-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
then used curtime from that as blocktime

[12-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
and 1 block made the diff sky rocket

[12-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
was about to design an attack around that, should I?

[12-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
think I can make blocks take very long time on a CPU mined chain

[12-Aug-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the attack? slowing down coin emission is not really an attack. speeding up coin emission would be

[12-Aug-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
yea, just slowing down blocks

[12-Aug-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
best I can think of so far

[12-Aug-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can boost mining ROI somehow in a significant way, maybe it is a viable attack, but it seems that is not really the case

[12-Aug-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow the 8 million diff block was solved

[12-Aug-19 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
yes I saw that, dumb luck from my ASICs

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
I think I can keep diff very high with minimal hashrate though

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
implied hashrate to solve 50 million diff

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
sorry what?

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but if diff is high you are not getting many blocks

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
yep, a nuisance attack

[12-Aug-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
no real gain

[12-Aug-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
try to find attacks that make money

{Reactions}
😂 

[12-Aug-19 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
btw, that is exactly what a normal stratum will do if it's using p2p notify feature

[12-Aug-19 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
which most do

[12-Aug-19 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
so default behavior of most stratums is to nuisance attack the chain... 😅

[12-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but they would need to switch away pretty fast

[12-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so getting a couple fast blocks, not increasing coin emission

[12-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
quite an improvement over status quo

[12-Aug-19 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
no, what just happened there is default behavior of knomp on one of these chains

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
solving a 8 million diff in 1 second?

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
so if people start setting up stratums for these chains and don't realize they can't use p2p notify, we'll have problems

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
it wasn't in a second

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
it's because blocktemplate for knomp is only updated when a block comes in

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
then it uses the "curtime" value for nTime

[12-Aug-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
which will always be the second after the block came in

[12-Aug-19 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
well it updates every 55 seconds

[12-Aug-19 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
so if it finds a block within those 55 seconds, it will always be +1 second

[12-Aug-19 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
and make diff go up

[12-Aug-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
not optimal behavior for mining apow chains

[12-Aug-19 07:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just make it use the nTime from the block template?

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
only updates block template when block comes then every 55 seconds after that

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
with p2p notify thing

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
it's not a problem if stratum just uses rpc polling

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
and does it very quickly

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it need something to trigger it from daemon? or just poll more often?

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is mining at harder than required diff for 54 seconds

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[12-Aug-19 08:00 PM] Alright#0419
look, doesn't matter

[12-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Alright#0419
just have to say "DON'T USE p2p NOTIFY"

[12-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
ok I think this can *kind of* be used to make money... well at least prevent others from making money while you switch off to something else

Let's say you have a switching setup, you're mining ZAWY24 and decide you want to switch to something else for a bit, you raise the diff to ridiculous levels, leave, mine something else then come back once diff normalizes?

[12-Aug-19 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
is basically the same as normal switching, but instead of gaining more blocks, you just make everyone else get less

[12-Aug-19 08:22 PM] Alright#0419
idk, still formulating ideas, I just find it strange that a miner can raise the diff(drastically) at will by changing nTime

[12-Aug-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of DAA allow that, just to a lesser degree

[12-Aug-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are using ASIC vs CPU, it is not clear you are gaining, i guess you can use CPU and fiddle timestamps, but not clear how much you can gain

[12-Aug-19 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
curious how the cumulative pow thing is affected by this(thing that determines when or when not to reorg to another chain)

like can I just keep mining at these massive diffs and the network not reorg to the honest chain(longer but less pow) because of it?

[12-Aug-19 08:30 PM] Alright#0419
ok let's say chain is at very high diff because of time stamp thing I just mentioned, it's stuck at block 100

honest miners wait until diff comes down and produce block 101 with low diff, then block 102, 103, 104, 105

I ignore their 101-105 and produce my own 101 at block 100+1 second and very high diff

if my 101 chain has >pow than their 105 chain, will the network jump back to my 101?

[12-Aug-19 08:30 PM] Alright#0419
then have to wait for diff to come down again

[12-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
`log2_work=27.501231` is this that number?

[12-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
"cumulative pow" I mean

[12-Aug-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but how will you mine such high diff blocks?

[12-Aug-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are mining much higher diff blocks, it seems it is expensive? especially with less blocks

[12-Aug-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
just curious of how it works

[12-Aug-19 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
don't normally think of an attack vector until I try some wonky shit first 😄

[12-Aug-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
now you see how it works, start trying wonky

Since Litecoin blocks are 4 times faster than Bitcoin’s, the network can handle a sudden decrease in hashrate much better.

If 75% of hashrate disappears overnight, Litecoin just acts like Bitcoin for 2 wks (10 mins blks) and then diff retargets and everything is back to...

it sounds like everything is working like it should

[12-Aug-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. so far only nuisance attacks that dont make money

[12-Aug-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so for a low hashrate CPU mined chain, it seems just fine. and if the hashrate is high, much less room for attackers to play games

[12-Aug-19 09:03 PM] zawy#5864
The way to attack is to pester the public chain into higher average difficulties that reduces average rewards for mining.  Perhaps someone with 25% HR could assign a +1 stamp whenever he found a block..I'm not sure this can actually raise avg difficulty for others.....but if it can, and if it's like other chains where 70% of miners leave if difficulty rises 30%, then he can simulatneously do 5 to 10 block private mines and submit those.....at much lower difficulty cost due to the public chain not having gained much work due to 70% leaving.  After he submits, the difficulty is a lot lower, so normally a lot of miners jump back on.  So he could only do it periodically

[12-Aug-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but exp() sort of defeats this

[12-Aug-19 09:06 PM] zawy#5864
He would do it to try to be just below the level of exp() kicking in.  He only needs to make avg difficulty higher by say 30% to see a lot more than 30% of miners lose interest

[12-Aug-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but even RST activating will start adjusting the diff to the actual hashrate

[12-Aug-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure you can boost the diff 30% consistently without triggering RST

[12-Aug-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but in any case the coin emission is not increased, which is the bigger picture issue

[12-Aug-19 09:08 PM] zawy#5864
Yes, if my math and general idea is correct and the chain work uses the targetB, this is not supposed to be possible

[12-Aug-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
all these thing slow down coin emission, which seems relatively benign

[12-Aug-19 09:09 PM] zawy#5864
private miners trying to boost the public chain difficulty when they start their private mine is something that happens.....it's just something to be aware of and to try to prove to yourself they can't benefit
