`Anyone know why I'd be getting -bash: ./komodo-cli: No such file or directory in my /komodo/src directory after updating to master branch`
Because there's no file named `komodo-cli` in your `/komodo/src` directory :trollface:

`  "sapling": -1,` Is this referring to the wallet address?

@NutellaLicka

[09-Dec-18 12:25 AM] SHossain#0007
`"sapling": 451,` means, sapling was activated at that block of the chain

You can mine KMD with the GPU, but you'd make more if you mined something without ASICs on network and sold for KMD

[09-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Alright#0419

@webworker01 while both sprout and sapling addresses are supported, it would be best to phase out sprout addresses sooner than later, for obvious reasons. Maybe just do sprout payments once per day ? some way to incentivize people to switch to a sapling address.

Hello, I asked this in another section that discussed the update, but I haven't seen a reply as of yet.  I actively mine Komodo, at the time I started the first valid wallet I located was on my cell phone in the Coinomi wallet.  I was wondering if there is any action I need to take prior to the update being executed.  I plan to update to the new desktop wallet after the update, but as of  yet the links are still not active to download.  Please advise .. thank you.  Very Respectfully, WX2

[09-Dec-18 09:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@ronyi this happened to me, I had to try and build it about 3-4 times before it successfully built. I'm not sure why though

[09-Dec-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as coinimi updates, there wont be an issue. just make sure you update prior to the next time you are sending coins

[09-Dec-18 10:28 AM] ronyi#5719
@NutellaLicka yes, but i think(permission issue?) sudo ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) worked smoothly for me....

[10-Dec-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@webworker01 
I am back today, I think I can make the payment processor work for pirate, sapling should work by just using a sapling address, can have a go at this today. Unless you have it sorted?

[10-Dec-18 12:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think the problem is when there is a mix of sapling and sprout addresses that need to be paid out

[10-Dec-18 01:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, I am happy to do some testing with you. I am trying to get the RKT chain up and running at the moment

[10-Dec-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just had a look at the pool code, and yes that will be the problem.

[10-Dec-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My pool should actually work already with the Z-tx that web made for Pirate.... however if that happens, then there will be an issue with the sendmany.

[10-Dec-18 03:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
One way around it is by forcing sapling addresses from the start. Easy for a new pool, not so easy for web and their pool with a lot of people on it currently.

[10-Dec-18 03:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
A small change to the `var getProperAddress` in the payment processor should ensure that the pool won't accept sapling addresses

[10-Dec-18 03:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
(In web's knomp anyhow)

[10-Dec-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah ... it seems like you need to have 2 seperate configs... one for sapling address and one for sprout

[10-Dec-18 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and people will need to move over after it activates

[10-Dec-18 03:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a difficult problem to manage. I think for your pool, you'd be better off forcing sapling addresses from the get go. That way you don't have to worry about sprout

[10-Dec-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont have a pirate pool... Just wasnt sure if they needed mine for it or not..

[10-Dec-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught that my pool didnt work with z-tx payments, but I juts read the code and it looks like it will work just fine.

[10-Dec-18 03:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I believe snomp has z transaction and shielding in the payment processor as well

[10-Dec-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am testing my pool with an ac_private=1 chain now.. will test just with spaling address's ... and ignore the sprout stuff. It seems like having seperate ports for sprout and sapling will be the only way to do this for pirate.. every other chain works already.

[10-Dec-18 08:12 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
I have a noob question, what is a sapling? 
Necessary to mind KMDs? Also, any other coin that is on the KMD ecosystem to mine that could also still be profitable for 1070s GPU rigs?

[10-Dec-18 08:54 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
*mine

[10-Dec-18 09:05 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Hmm okay. How does that directly/indirectly affect miners, if it does?

[10-Dec-18 09:15 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Ah alrights. It's clearer now. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. 

As to the other question on, are there any other coin to mine in the komodo infrastructure already?

[10-Dec-18 09:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely is

[10-Dec-18 09:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is a bunch. VRSC (good for CPU/GPU), ARRR (mostly mined by ASIC's, if you have cheap electricity and a lot of GPU's this could still be profitable), KMD (self explanatory), HUSH. They're just a couple I can think of

[10-Dec-18 09:18 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
VRSC. Ah yes, not the first time hearing about this. Will be looking at this as i only have CPU/GPU hardware to mine
