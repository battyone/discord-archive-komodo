RFOX and CRYPTO both give exact same error ðŸ˜¦

[24-Jul-18 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
are RFOX and CRYPTO both PoW assetchains?

[24-Jul-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-Jul-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can CPU mine them both just fine

[24-Jul-18 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
downloading the RFOX chain now, will check as soon as it's updated

LOL I've been here a bit @HashUnlimited 
I tend to be wherever KMD dev is most active

[24-Jul-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thanks dude... spent all day trying to get it to work, kind if pissed me off to end at that.

the only thing I can think is that your clamore isn't working right

[24-Jul-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ˜¦ don't think there is any updates since years lol

[24-Jul-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guess I can have a look at it a bit later... maybe there is anohter linux miner that will work

[24-Jul-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think they were all lower hash rate, but I really dont care if they are low hash or not.. as long as I can mine empty blocks, I can test what I want to test

[24-Jul-18 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well I killed my miner after 2 blocks, but that was just "fill in the blanks" config for me

[24-Jul-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I put rpc user and pass and rpc port then disabled everything

[24-Jul-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
using kmd-nomp

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to remove the `"StratumHost" : "127.0.0.1"`

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because it complained of invalid JSON.

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything else I just changed to false...

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
payouts etc

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
merkle root mismatch points to the transaction part of the block. hot hint is always additional tx data

[24-Jul-18 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I restarted deamon a heap of times... mad no diffrence

[24-Jul-18 11:20 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
and it wonâ€™t make a difference if done a million times

[24-Jul-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
james merged CC upsream to dev, so I cant compile it... but its doubtful thats an issue as CPU mining works fine.

[24-Jul-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@HashUnlimited it also happens with a ruleset change
@blackjok3r do you have a good komodod build?

[24-Jul-18 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no idea... but I have a heap of AC CPU mining on it for weeks

[24-Jul-18 11:21 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
I see from the texts that it is NOMP based, thatâ€™s why I am stepping in

[24-Jul-18 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
what I mean is, are you sure you don't have a bad test build that has a funky ruleset from one of the PoS tests @blackjok3r

I dont think so, but I did just compile it from a build 6 days ago I know works... so I will retart my pool and see what hapens

[24-Jul-18 11:23 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
I will have to have a look but the basic question is why not expanding the original repo? so others can profit as well

[24-Jul-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"why not expanding the original repo"? I need more â˜• 'cuz that makes me go "huh"?

[24-Jul-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I see a message on starting npm start/... that says block template polling is disabled

[24-Jul-18 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems like a major issue

[24-Jul-18 11:25 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
If you like we just create a KMD branch and that way we can share what we do

[24-Jul-18 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a mis config in the pool software for sure

[24-Jul-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r " block template polling is disabled" says to me that you have `blockRefreshInterval` set to 0 or something invalid

[24-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I set it to 0, becaues I am using blocknotify

[24-Jul-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I have nfi what I am doing

[24-Jul-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd never set it to 0 but if you set it off, then it's safe to ignore when it tells you that you set it to off

[24-Jul-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it should not be zero... its worth a try

[24-Jul-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that being said, it's possible that because you're not polling, you're on the wrong block

[24-Jul-18 11:30 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
That might indeed be an issue as block notify alone isnâ€™t enough, you want to use walletnotify as well

[24-Jul-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if the daemon has block 9, you can't build block 8 ontop of it

[24-Jul-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... I put it to 500

[24-Jul-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
block decode failed

[24-Jul-18 11:33 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Thatâ€™s fine but you will only call blocktemplate on blank blocks thus never incorporate fresh transactions but only the ones in your mempool

[24-Jul-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it made mo diffrence

[24-Jul-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
mo money mo problems

[24-Jul-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
te block notify script updated the block, and the RPC error about block decode failed went away, but the invlaid block error is still therre

[24-Jul-18 11:34 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Whereâ€™s a block decode failed? Daemon log?

[24-Jul-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I already posted both above

I mean its only runnig a single card... but I didnt wnat to break the chain by pointing any more than that at it

[24-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doubt more hash will help though

[24-Jul-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
looks to me like you're trying to build a block on top of the wrong block

[24-Jul-18 11:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so remove block notify?

[24-Jul-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no

[24-Jul-18 11:37 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
That would be a header mismatch

[24-Jul-18 11:39 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Thereâ€™s something to the transaction part like strTxComment which he is not hashing correctly

[24-Jul-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
isn't header mismatch when you're trying to build 9 with the header from 8; rather than when you're trying to build 8 on top of 9?

[24-Jul-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r what do you have for txfee in the json?

[24-Jul-18 11:40 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
he is getting merkle root mismatch and that check is explicitly for the tx section

[24-Jul-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
probablu wrong I left it as deafult

[24-Jul-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what should it be?thers a 5 there somehwer one sec

[24-Jul-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
try with tx fee as 0.0001; it shouldn't be the issue, but that's the correct fee

[24-Jul-18 11:41 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
feel free to play, I needed around 7 weeks to find it while considering myself pretty experienced

[24-Jul-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
mine is so edited that it's hard for me to help with stock setup sometimes ðŸ˜¦

[24-Jul-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
flooding same error after chaging fee

[24-Jul-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not using a magic value, as I coundt find anywhere to put it

[24-Jul-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also didnt start deamon with -pubkey, so that should not be doing anything

[24-Jul-18 11:43 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
crapcoin-cli getblocktemplate

[24-Jul-18 11:43 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Then decoderawtransaction for every tx inside

[24-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
when you run the daemon from terminal, you'll get like: `RFOX: p2p.32268 rpc.32269 magic.4406ad4c 1141288268 1000000000 coins`
the magic for stratum would be `4cad0644` -- magic = 4 hex values and in the stdout, they are 'reversed' because of endian

[24-Jul-18 11:47 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
magic for stratum?

[24-Jul-18 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as for -pubkey, it gets ignored when using stratum, because the stratum builds the equivalent of a rawtransaction

[24-Jul-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@HashUnlimited most nomp forks use "magic" to decode P2P connections

[24-Jul-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
aka "pchMessageStart"

[24-Jul-18 11:49 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
which is pretty much deprecated as it comes with a nice blocknotify. in fact most daemon will get you the blocks and kick you

[24-Jul-18 11:51 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
if you like to go down that road of hacks, you need to make sure to fake the correct service bits as well

[24-Jul-18 11:51 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Which NOMP isnâ€™t doing so itâ€™s treated like an SPV client

[24-Jul-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's about a 50:50 split on which is faster: P2P or notify

[24-Jul-18 11:52 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
we will serve you blocks if we got a semaphore available, otherwise look somewhere else.

[24-Jul-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know where to get the magic from, and I remeber something about reverseing it... but where do I put it?

[24-Jul-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no magic values in the kmd-nomp software

[24-Jul-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
do I just add it into rfox.json in coins?

[24-Jul-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes

[24-Jul-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`    "peerMagic": "4cad0644",`
