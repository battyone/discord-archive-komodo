which motherboard? do you have a link?

[18-Oct-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for what I mentioned earlier, it's a server/ws board that I got a while back from newegg, but the amazon link is: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QC5DZEU

[18-Oct-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure if it will even work, but can't hurt much to try 😛

[18-Oct-18 03:26 PM] SHossain#0007
from the spec link of the processor i see it supports `FCLGA1151`

[18-Oct-18 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
are LGA2011 and LGA1151 same?

[18-Oct-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Guess I looked at it wrong
Well, now I'm back to debate of i9 or threadripper 😛

[18-Oct-18 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i was wondering how is that possible and why i never seen a mb that supports 2 desktop CPUs 😛

[18-Oct-18 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
for sure i want one

[18-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
or 64 of them

[18-Oct-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I push my budget limit, I can afford 6.4 of them, maybe 😛

[18-Oct-18 06:11 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Dual with desktop cpu? No way unless it’s a xeon e5-2xxx :-P
While for 4 cpu  boards e5-4xxxx is required.

[18-Oct-18 09:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Has does one go about making a CPU rig?  Just a bunch of multi CPU motherboards and associated CPU ?  Anything else to it?

[18-Oct-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a "CPU rig" is nothing more than a "bare bones" PC

[18-Oct-18 09:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok simple enough,  wasn't sure if there was something more to it

[18-Oct-18 09:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog i have a fancy mobo + CPU sitting on a piece of cardboard box, no case of any kind, wires everywhere, mining VRSC

[18-Oct-18 09:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is that "bare bones" ?

[18-Oct-18 09:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
for efficiency of capital costs, I think recent laptops win out

[18-Oct-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
except for the "fancy mobo" bit :trollface:

[18-Oct-18 09:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe CG has some crazy math research to dump on us

[18-Oct-18 09:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i could have spent less on mobo, i spent like $150 instead of $90ish

[18-Oct-18 09:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not doing this at scale

[18-Oct-18 09:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i mine VRSC on 3 laptops and 4 desktop/servers

[18-Oct-18 09:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
solo mining since the olden 384 times

[18-Oct-18 09:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am often surprised which machines outperform others

[18-Oct-18 09:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, is it better to go completely barebones with consumer desktop/laptop is the hash from server CPUs comparable or better than the desktop CPU ?

[18-Oct-18 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
laptop get better watt per hash

[18-Oct-18 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
lower power costs per coin, it works out to

[18-Oct-18 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
laptops also take up way less space

[18-Oct-18 09:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And easier resell value

[18-Oct-18 09:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to account that even tiny compact "lunchbox" desktops need to have a monitor/keyboard connected for maintenance (which always fucking happens)

[18-Oct-18 09:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC has had so many mandatory upgrades

[18-Oct-18 09:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
those old library "thin" desktops are the shiznizzle

[18-Oct-18 09:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
but laptops don't need to have monitors and laptops within cable distance/etc, they are less maintenance in that respect

[18-Oct-18 09:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am a tiny miner, but I see that the time you spend maintaining rigs is the biggest "hidden cost" that almost nobody accounts for

[18-Oct-18 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
I rented time on beefy AWS boxen for VRSC, when that was a reasonable thing to do. nethash is basically too high for AWS prices now

[18-Oct-18 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you find something that is viable, let me know 😃

[18-Oct-18 09:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's why I went asic ,  just interested in spreading out into other kinds of mining.     I think CPU /GPU will have a place still in the future ,  I'm surprised no one has done a BOINC based system with a proper business model . I think we will see it in the kmd ecosystem in the next couple of years

[18-Oct-18 09:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Right now I only have ASICs and CPU VRSC miners warming me, I like diversifying into both instead of being "all-in" with one or the other

[18-Oct-18 09:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
each allow for different opportunities

[18-Oct-18 09:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have a few old ati radeon 58xx GPUs that mined BTC back in the day, wondering what they can pull in VerusHash now

[18-Oct-18 09:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
What I hear is that there will be "blood on the streets" next month when ETH block reward goes from 3 to 2, and those ETH miners will scatter their 1080ti's to the winds of all the altcoins in weird places

[18-Oct-18 09:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
raising them hashrates, to the tears of many a hobby miner

[18-Oct-18 09:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes it's already starting can find 1080 at like 400 1080ti at 550

[18-Oct-18 09:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
one of them places they go is VRSC

[18-Oct-18 09:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
would I pay $500 for a GPU right now, a used one, to mine VRSC? That is a hard question

[18-Oct-18 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i mined a ridiculous amount of VRSC, that is timelocked, in the 384 block days, so my perspective is warped. But VRSC is at something like 35 cents now. Not sure the math works out to buy the GPU

[18-Oct-18 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if you have it already

[18-Oct-18 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it makes a lot of sense to point it at VRSC

[18-Oct-18 09:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I'm considering getting the vega gpus they are going pretty cheap and its replacement isn't coming out anytime soon

[18-Oct-18 09:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i really know nothing about GPU mining VRSC, I have always done CPU solo from the beginning. It's hard to keep track of

[18-Oct-18 09:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i5/i7's are the sweet spot for cost/hash it seems, and I like CPU mining for some reason

run by that script you have been working on?

[19-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To start with, it'll be just znomp fork that's got changes made for KMD (and assetchains) with all of the unnecessary bits chopped out
As time goes on, I hope to finish porting ckpool from sha256 to equihash and use that

hey guys any idea about how much KMD can be mined a week with 10 Vega 64's?

[19-Oct-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many sols does 1 get?

i am hearing people saying they get way higher hashrate on ccminer, not just some small %

[19-Oct-18 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
or compared against nheqminer

[19-Oct-18 04:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am seeing a 25% hashrate increase in ccminer over vrsc full node, shaking my head

[19-Oct-18 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure I can trust those numbers, so I will collect more data

[19-Oct-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
50% hashrate increase? Am I dreaming?

{Reactions}
🤔 

[19-Oct-18 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
ccminer vs vrsc full node mining has a ~65% hashrate improvement, same hardware. quite the tax on the solo miner

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCsa2c1IDR4 <- looks like it should give you the basics (I have not checked any of his links, so do own due diligence), from there you can just substitute "ZCash" with Komodo (and an actual KMD pool ,of course) and you're good for that
Once you get that down, hop over to #deleted-channel and someone can give you the rundown of how to get a zaddress needed for PIRATE and then it's a similar process

@dukeleto you said staking won't be active by default on starting updated verus

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what's the command to start staking ?

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c

[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
should be `setgenerate true 0`
no?

[19-Oct-18 07:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought that's only for mining 🤔

[19-Oct-18 07:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I started komodod with no gen params since CPU mining is waste

[19-Oct-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if they are using the same params we do, `-1` = all cpu, `0` = staking, and any other number = that many cores

[19-Oct-18 07:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh cool! thanks 🙂

[19-Oct-18 07:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[19-Oct-18 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder verus stakes by default until the new 0.4.0 release, then you have to turn it on, I am not using that yet, so I am not sure how

[19-Oct-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I executed that command genie gave. chain was doing validate/resyc again so will see once it's done.

[19-Oct-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
