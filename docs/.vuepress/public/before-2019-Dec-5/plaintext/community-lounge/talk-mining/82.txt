[04-Dec-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what I was goign to do was offload the heavy lifting to the daemon as an RPC call... but found out 99% of the code in each module is litterally a copy pase of the daemons code, and calling via an RPC would just amke it slower.

[04-Dec-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the whole ling needs to be redon from scratch incl;uding the stupid stratum protocol itself. 😦

[04-Dec-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a terrible implementation / design... and seems somwhat unfinished

[04-Dec-18 08:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like "this works" fuck it im not doing any more

[04-Dec-18 08:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
copy pasted code everywhere .. its shocking how bad it is... and i dont ahve the skills ytet to totally re do it ... so I am leaving my implementation as is,

[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was hoping to remove the PoW check aswell.... whil this is easy enough to do, its pointless as the way Verushash and Komodo PoS/verusPoS were implemented, its not as easy as I thaught to automaically verify in the daemon vian an RPC

[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the names of each algo is an array, but the functions are all sperate and chosen by an IF ELSE staement\

[04-Dec-18 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I used that as an example because one of you two mentioned it, my point is that if you use a full library, then you have a full library and if you use a stripped library then you can't make all txes work

[04-Dec-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no libraries have CCs in them... and as we want to use a CC later down the track we cant use a library unless we write it.... which I have no intrest in doing.

[04-Dec-18 08:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either way.... the way a pool works... your going to have replicatred code verywhere....they are just a bad idea.

[04-Dec-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the cc isn't in the coinbase tx
I don't know why you keep getting stuck on grasping that
every cb follows rules
if the rules require x then you do x and if the rules require y you do y
it's not feken 🚀 science

[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we will ahve a CC in the coinbase .. at least I think thats how it needs to work...

[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
every X blocks, it will generare a speical coinbvase that is sent to all notary nodes

[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wont happen often, as it will slow down things a lot

[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but say every 1000 blocks or 10,000 blocks

[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a speical coinbase will be created toi pay notary nodes

[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
paying per notarisation is a very very hard thing to implement

[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, if you need a special tool for labs, that's for labs and nothing to do with anything here :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the point is, once we prove it can be done

[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then other ppl can do it

[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and having to tools to use such things help other people to do it

[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if I ddint need s speical pool for labs, why would I have bothered to do any of this... its java script 🤣

[04-Dec-18 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the point is: we're not making drivers here, so if it can be done in LanguageA then it can be done in LanguageB

fpga's that you can plug and play like the blackminer are

[04-Dec-18 10:27 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
and at its price its very attractive

[04-Dec-18 11:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah, the hash power... I want to order one. According to the verus channel one fpga miner is equal to 100 cpu rigs.

[04-Dec-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had some talks about those earlier today. They are very close to an ASIC but you can just write any algo into them via software. Forking constantly toi avoid them is a fools errand.

[04-Dec-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, but I saw the announcement in the VRSC discord that they were in talks with the guys making them to either change the code a bit or otherwise they would fork to have it adjust

[04-Dec-18 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
I'd like to test a new normal coin pool with sapling activation in few hours in the future. so, we can confirm mining normal blocks first, then sapling activated ones automatically. I'll prepare the test repo and params very soon. Anyone interested to join?

@Cryptoon being polite only goes so far. That company kept the fact that their rigs can do VerusHash a secret, as long as they could. Now the secret is out. VRSC can "brick" the fpga's for a few weeks/months maybe, before a new bitstream is written. VRSC doesn't have a lot of good options that I am seeing

Latest word on the street is the @VerusCoin mining network has been taken over by FPGA miners. 20-40X power efficiency and ~50X the hashrate of high end CPUs + GPUs, it's not looking good for CPU/GPU miners. What happens next?

FPGA is going to be the future it seems

[05-Dec-18 02:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which isn't too bad a medium between asics and gpus.  More raw power like an asic ( but less than ) but with adaptability like a gpu ( more effort to get that adaptability ). If a mass consumer market comes out of these things prices will drop even further,  maybe to the cost of a high end gpu

[05-Dec-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems the biggest hurdle is the complexity of programming them, but as they are a new thing I expect that to improve over time, especially if the code is open sourced by most players, mining might be good for that, once a better code is out, and the advantage is over hopefully miners release old code and the knowledge spreads fast, will be looking to get one to play with for sure.

@Alright verus said they will come to some "agreement" with the company to cripple their bitstreams, or fork, is what I have heard. Doesn't solve the problem of other companies or private individuals using FPGAs to mine Verus at all. Seems like a very poor solution

[05-Dec-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not what I understood

[05-Dec-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I missed some conversation

[05-Dec-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what I understood was that some sort of less powerful fpga would be made avaiable for the community

[05-Dec-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
to allow price points similar to GPU/high end cpu

[05-Dec-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c made available by who?

[05-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
faster performing fpga would still be available, just different points on the price.performance curve

[05-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
made available, presumably by the fpga manuf

[05-Dec-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
$2500 price is just out of reach for most people

[05-Dec-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so getting a lower cost offering seems like a decent approach

[05-Dec-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
I guess the original promise of VerusHash only being CPU-friendly and not even efficient on a GPU, feels like that ship has sailed

[05-Dec-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
the power efficiency of these FPGA miners is amazing

[05-Dec-18 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
now GPUs are roughly equivalent (not a bad thing) and FPGAs can control most hashrate, when they come online. It's not bad or evil, it just changes everything about verus mining

[05-Dec-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
all along it was known that ASIC would arrive, let us not make it the end of the world, it is just part of the process

that has always been the best choice, worked pretty good for BTC

[06-Dec-18 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
guaranteed that all "ASIC resistant" coins are actively mined by fpga, including XMR

[06-Dec-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you can write open CL that runs on fpga now, so basically GPU software on ASIC level hardware

[06-Dec-18 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a safe bet is stocks in fpga manufacturers as they will get a giant sales boom, like the GPU makers did
