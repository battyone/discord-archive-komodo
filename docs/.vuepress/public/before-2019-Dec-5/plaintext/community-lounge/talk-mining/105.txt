that is good to know

[07-Mar-19 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's in a 20'x20' shop now, I kinda kept taking up more space *before* I "needed" it

[07-Mar-19 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
atm, I'm torn between adding on for the GPUs or just dumping them off on some sucker willing to buy them

[07-Mar-19 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
would be nice to get my tractor back inside and out of the weather 😝

[07-Mar-19 06:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
keep a few of your best GPU's to spec mine weirdo coins and dump the rest and buy new gear/toys, is my non-financial advice

[07-Mar-19 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL every PC we have has 2-3 of them in it (not counting the actual mining rigs)

[07-Mar-19 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I bought a Blackminer F1 fpga to play with,  as a test to see if I like them

[07-Mar-19 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I just haven't had the time 😦

[07-Mar-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
i wish buying A9's was easier, but it's either used from Ebay or email people in China. ordering an f1 was fast and easy on their website

[07-Mar-19 06:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll quit before I buy a used ASIC from someone I don't know

[07-Mar-19 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know how bad I abuse them, no chance I'm paying good coinage for something like that :troll:

[07-Mar-19 06:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
i plan to have a combination of ASIC/FPGA/CPU miners, no GPU's for me

[07-Mar-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I had a plan for CPUs, but it got put on hold for a while

[07-Mar-19 06:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
i love it when I have 10% of nethash on some weirdo cpu mineable coin

[07-Mar-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yeah, I think we had similar plans 😃

[07-Mar-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are a lot of CPU mineable coins, the more I look, the more I find

[07-Mar-19 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was astounded at how many channels and detailed info that discord has

[07-Mar-19 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
vrsc is definitely not a speculative CPU mining coin anymore

[07-Mar-19 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I went too stupid during the bull to afford what I want for CPUs

[07-Mar-19 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
the new ryzen line is coming out very soon, everything will change soon

[07-Mar-19 06:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
ryzen 9's are pretty sexy

[07-Mar-19 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol I still can't afford more than one of the last ones 😛

[07-Mar-19 06:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are a lot of coins that use something called CryptoNite Adaptive, which are basically monero forks that actually try to stay cpu-only

[07-Mar-19 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i avoid threadrippers, which are crazy expensive, but have the highest performance

[07-Mar-19 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
threadrippers are not for mining, by a long shot

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
currently Ryzen 2700 is best for CPU mining, in hash/watt

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`threadrippers are not for mining, by a long shot`
threadrippers are what I was looking at getting 😕

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
so expensive

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you want the fastest gaming machine, or the fastest build server, it makes total sense

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
but for mining, Ryzen 2700

[07-Mar-19 06:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hmmm

[07-Mar-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
when you look at hash/watt, it's very clear

[07-Mar-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, threadrippers have a crazy price premium that is not linear, they are the "top of the line" and the price reflects that

[07-Mar-19 06:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I guess I should actually put my i7-8700K together before I start thinking of buying more 😛

[07-Mar-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
threadripper motherboards, just themselves, cost more than my entire Ryzen CPU mining rig

[07-Mar-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it's a different socket than Ryzen AM4, so yeah, everything is mo' money

[07-Mar-19 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the i7-8700K  has literally been sitting on a shelf (haven't even opened the mb box) since the i9-9900K arrived 3 1/3 months ago
ffs, I need to get back into mining 😛

[07-Mar-19 06:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`everything is mo' money`
like the now pointless unopened b250 motherboards I have LOL

[07-Mar-19 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I bought 4 as "spares" for expansion right before ASICs came out

nicehash?

[09-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jorian#4555
seems so

[09-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jorian#4555
at least the time between that block and the previous block was normal, and not the 3 secs we've been seeing lately with big reward blocks

[13-Mar-19 10:14 AM] jorian#4555
that last one is by far the biggest ever

[13-Mar-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes about 1% of all rewards for a year!

[13-Mar-19 10:19 AM] ph03nix#3115
nice

Ow wow your explorer biggestrewards stats looks nice! Just saw it now.

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So when a dev node picks up a big one that goes straight into the dev fund?

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
nice

[13-Mar-19 02:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think he also needs to pay bills once in a while 😄 so just fair that he got it.

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
congratulations to all big block miners :Komodo:

Holy shnickies!?!

[13-Mar-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wonder if @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 finally got a big block today

[13-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
wonder if we'll ever see @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 again

[13-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hasnt posted since saturday

[13-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not that long, no?

[13-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or did he say he was going to take a break? 😄

[13-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Alright#0419
I've never seen him abruptly disappear without saying anything to anyone

[13-Mar-19 09:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm he has a couple of times, no? Maybe just sick?

[13-Mar-19 09:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Other times he want away he was still active on bitcointalk forums but hasnt posted there either

[13-Mar-19 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So maybe its something serious 😦

[13-Mar-19 09:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He said he was gonna Finnish the solo pirate pool setup before he returned.

[14-Mar-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So just a break to focus on coding for a while

[14-Mar-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
sounds fair

[14-Mar-19 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has spent the entire last 7 days in bed, sick, and his pool got none of the rewards during that time ☹_

fek, at times I was praying to be

[15-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Next bullrun when the cold wallets wake up, there will be a block for you CG 😃

[15-Mar-19 09:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
Binance Hot Wallet is back to 1.4m KMD

[15-Mar-19 09:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
and strange that mMWQV ( whalebro ) is not claiming rewards

[15-Mar-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think WQV is binance coldwallet tbh ;p

[15-Mar-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
Currently mining VRSC with an F1 FPGA @ 225 MH/s at roughly 1 MH per watt. I would like to hear what the current best CPU rates for VerusHash v2 in MH/watt, maybe @Alright knows

[15-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
No, sorry, no idea

[16-Mar-19 11:17 AM] newvulcan#9571
Hi, I'm having some problems with finding ZEX blocks on my mining pool. All other coins are working fine including KMD, ARRR, ZCL and HUSH. I'm using S-NOMP with the following config file for ZEX:{
"name": "ZADDEX",
"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"sapling": true,
"requireShielding": true
}
My komodod command line is: ./komodod -ac_founders=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -ac_name=ZEX -ac_reward=13000000000 -ac_pubkey=039d4a50cc70d1184e462a22edb3b66385da97cc8059196f8305c184a3e21440af -ac_cc=2 -ac_halving=525600 

The error that NPM throws is  "We thought a block was found, but it was rejected by the daemon"

The matching error line in the debug file is ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED

My guess is that something is wrong with one of the config files above. Just to add tried the same thing with knomp and got the same errors

P.S. -NPM isn't throwing that error, your pool software is

[16-Mar-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan probably related to your pool not dealing with founder reward correctly

[16-Mar-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan if your pool wants to support the new KMD AC version of HUSH, plz join Hush discord and I can add you to a channel for pool ops:  http://myhush.org/discord/

Show foundersreward in getblocktemplate if ac_founders enabled by ...
This enables mining pools to have KMD AC daemons tell the pool software which blocks contain the FR, instead of it being something hard-coded by admins in a config file.
This was suggested by LuckPool

@dukeleto  
I already made a pool and all that that does all of that automatically... although it might not be what you want, because it limits everything to Knomp only.

[16-Mar-19 02:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r it sounds nice to be able to give potential pool ops a known-working setup with Knomp

[16-Mar-19 02:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will also make sure snomp works ok, because that is used a lot
