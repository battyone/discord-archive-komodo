Best to ask in #mining channel on pirate discord!

@Cryptoonthanks man much appreciated

[17-Mar-19 12:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No poblem, good luck finding those blocks though! ⛏

Anyone else find these numbers suspect?

[17-Mar-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@webworker01 any thoughts (especially about why it *always* returns to the exact same flat average)?

[17-Mar-19 03:27 PM] newvulcan#9571
Kinda answering my own question, but in case anyone is interested  - yes you can run k-nomp and s-nomp together. Just make sure the website ports are different and also the cli is listening on a different port too.

as far as I can tell, it's a GPU miner using BFG 😕

[17-Mar-19 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they kept "pre-connecting" with `mining.suggest_target` and it was a pure flat value showing
once I nulled `mining.suggest_target`, that's the result
so either the shares math is off or `mining.suggest_target` allows for something funky
(and yes I have tolower)

[17-Mar-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess I'm going to have to readd some printouts to see what diff they are operating at and submitting 🤷🏽

[17-Mar-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they've found valid blocks, so I'm operating on the assumption that shares are factually valid (or at least that it's not an intentional "share scam")

[17-Mar-19 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
might be something different, I just assumed bfg because that silliness was luke's idea and bfg is his iirc

JUST IN: @BITMAINtech has unveiled a new miner for the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, which it says, has three times more hashing power than its predecessor. https://t.co/kLnS8Un6l9

Thoughts?

[19-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
This one might get me into mining :p

[19-Mar-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thrink they are going to move away fromt hat algo, although james said KMD would not I guess.

[19-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I always thought zec also wasnt moving from equihash

[19-Mar-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Their github would say diffrently 😉

[19-Mar-19 10:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So if they change algo there is going to be a tonne of miners shifting their farms onto KMD and ecosystem. Hmm...

[19-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That would require a higher kmd price to support mining costs

[19-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
More hash divided over same amount of rewards, so reward/hash lowers, so the value of rewards needs to increase in order for the miners to make it profitable?

[19-Mar-19 10:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It would. The miners with higher cost would be pushed out. But where else would the equihash farms go

[19-Mar-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If the landscape changed and farms needed a new target, it's far more likely that they would pick PIRATE than KMD

To preserve the Zcash community’s values around security, reliability and accessibility, Bitmain had previously Tweeted real-time updates to ensure more transparency and will continue to provide shipping updates of the first batch of the Antminer Z11. These commitments to transparency will continue to provide the Zcash foundation and community with the security, reliability and accessibility they desire of manufacturers.

well, i am glad I didn't buy a bunch of A9/A9+'s

[19-Mar-19 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly because you have to email them, ugh

[19-Mar-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`well, i am glad I didn't buy a bunch of A9/A9+'s`
literally the only reason I didn't is because the market spiked down like 12 minutes before my deposit cleared; otherwise I would have bought A9+s yesterday

[19-Mar-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was supposed to buy some last week, but I was ill
timing has always been an overall positive for me :shexy:

hi all, let me try to ask here too... i am trying to figure out how exactly to calculate (average) kmd profit based on difficulty and variable hash rate?

[20-Mar-19 12:02 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
currently i am trying to use formula like: `input_hashrate / (current_net_difficulty * 8192) * block_reward * 3600` for hourly calculation, but comparing with some other calculators, my numbers are way too much lower...

[20-Mar-19 12:02 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
this formula is based on zcash and as far as i understood `8192` is some work size on zcash, not sure if that's the same figure for KMD too?

[20-Mar-19 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
I'm no miner but if I look at the pirate calc this should be the calculation:

input_hashrate / current_net_difficulty * 3 * 60 * 0.25

[20-Mar-19 12:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
input_hashrate / current_net_difficulty * 3 Block Reward * 60 Mins * 0.25 Free for all mining

[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
75% is reserved for notaries

[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@CHMEX ok i see... didn't know about notaries part...

[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
let me try that out a bit

[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
also there are sometimes big blocks found

[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
but also, where did you see that pirate calcl?

[20-Mar-19 12:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
biggest so far 55k KMD

[20-Mar-19 12:14 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
55k KMD reward??

oh my!!

[20-Mar-19 12:15 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
i didn't know it can escalate so much

[20-Mar-19 12:16 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
but is there a way to get info about block reward from daemon maybe?

[20-Mar-19 12:16 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
i have noticed that Pirate for example has it in `getinfo` response, but i cannot find it for KMD

[20-Mar-19 12:17 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
also, sorry for noobish questions, equihash is something i never worked with, all this is fairly new to me

[20-Mar-19 12:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
the block reward is 3

[20-Mar-19 12:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
correct it does not have it in the response

[20-Mar-19 12:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you have questions just post them here 
There are some very knowlegable and professional ( equihash ) miner reading

[20-Mar-19 12:20 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
👍 tyvm!

[20-Mar-19 12:48 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@CHMEX thanks for that calculations info, but it seems to me that this is also missing some part here...
```
input_hashrate / current_net_difficulty * 3 Block Reward * 60 Mins * 0.25 Free for all mining
1000/290852329*256*0.25 = 0.00022
```

[20-Mar-19 12:48 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
this is for pirate, therefore 256 block reward

[20-Mar-19 12:49 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
but anyways, if i multiply my result with 3600 seconds, i am nowhere close to what calculator you linked is suggesting (around 5 Pirate for 1ksol)

[20-Mar-19 12:50 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
i made my calculations with 1kh/s actually, but i suppose that's the same thing?

[20-Mar-19 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for PIRATE, remove the `* 0.25`

[20-Mar-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for KMD, you `* 0.25` because Notaries create ~75% of the blocks, so you have a "max" of 25% possible

[20-Mar-19 12:51 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ok, i can do that, but still not even close to 5 Pirate :/ not even 0.5 with my calc

[20-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
290852329 is the difficulty

[20-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not the nethash

[20-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
76.56Mh/s is nethash

[20-Mar-19 12:53 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@Cryptoon yeah, that's what i'm trying to use in my calculation... difficulty...

[20-Mar-19 12:53 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
290m currently (https://dexstats.info/piratecalc.php?yoursol=1&include=1 also say so)

dont you need input hash/total hash instead of input hash/net diff?

[20-Mar-19 12:54 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
my only input is miner's hash rate... everything else should be provided by daemon...

[20-Mar-19 12:54 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
well, "everything" =) that's difficulty and reward only...

[20-Mar-19 12:54 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
let's say i can use constant reward...

[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and diff is something i'm getting from daemon...

[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
as we speak, these are my numbers: `1000/303999827.12*256*3600*0.25`

[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
and that's around `0.75`

[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So the formula is: 1000/76560000*256*60*24

[20-Mar-19 12:56 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah sorry for 0.25 again ^^

[20-Mar-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1000/76560000 * 256 * 60*24

[20-Mar-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is 4,8

[20-Mar-19 12:57 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ah, so you are telling that i should use net hash instead of difficulty??

[20-Mar-19 12:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes

[20-Mar-19 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think so?

[20-Mar-19 12:58 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
alright... let me give it a shot

[20-Mar-19 12:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
Sorry i copy pasted your calc wrong

[20-Mar-19 12:58 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
no probs ;)

[20-Mar-19 01:00 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
alright, yeah, this makes sense now!
