Got mine up an running at 650. This batch doesn't seem to be stable above

[30-Aug-18 01:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Interesting,  what hashrate are you getting

[30-Aug-18 01:53 AM] bishop#9773
At 650, they are averaging around 14.06-14.25 ksol

[30-Aug-18 01:53 AM] bishop#9773
compared to batch one that will run at 750 and hash 16ksol easily

[30-Aug-18 02:03 AM] marktyler#0324
Ugggh, today I just got hit with a 25% customs fee, importing into the USA.

[30-Aug-18 02:10 AM] vrcninja#5651
After the miners were delivered or before?

[30-Aug-18 07:34 AM] Jax#4739
@dukeleto UPS or USPS?

has anybody got their miner+power adapter in same shipment?

[31-Aug-18 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dukeleto 3 shipments, 3 matching boxes.  

Question about the Z9 mini temps.    What is a good range for PCB and Chip temps?   

Is 60-80 PCB ok and 70-90 Chip temps ok?   Trying to watch the fans and that seems about when they kick in.

[31-Aug-18 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
56 is highest chip temp i have seen on my z9 mini

[31-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain OC it

[31-Aug-18 09:40 PM] marv101#8481
can anyone point me to a website where pools are compared easily?

[31-Aug-18 10:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
UPS delivery asked me for $270 customs fee by check-only. BY CHECK ONLY. I had none, so I gotta pick it up at the local office now. Checks?!?!

[31-Aug-18 10:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
they won't even accept BTC?! that's blashphemy!

[01-Sep-18 12:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I warned about checks @dukeleto !

[01-Sep-18 12:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I had my power supplies and mini's in the same shipment 👌

[01-Sep-18 12:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@xRobeSx i remember reading that but i wasn't sure it would happen, oh well

[01-Sep-18 12:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My PSUs and minis came in different shipments

[01-Sep-18 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mostly because I refuse to buy BM's shitty PSUs 😛

[01-Sep-18 01:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
To get 750 frequency I saw a video that you have to gointo the firmware and change antfrequency

[01-Sep-18 01:15 AM] bishop#9773
you just have to ssh in and vi the config file

[01-Sep-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BM has now added specs to the Z9
`Max Hashrate, 44 KSol/s`
With the same number of chips as 4 minis.
(which would `Max Hashrate, 64+ KSol/s`)
The question now is: did they lower the max freq or use "weaker" chips?

[01-Sep-18 01:00 PM] bishop#9773
Guessing most, if not all of batch 2 (and perhaps inclusive of the non-mini), were binned chips from batch 1. Would explain them removing the frequency adjustment in advanced settings

[01-Sep-18 01:01 PM] bishop#9773
I never ordered a full z9 because I figured with the OC potential of the minis, they would have used less chips and OC'd them from the start since specs were largely missing

[01-Sep-18 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, we finally agree on something
that's the exact same reason I passed on buying "full" Z9

{Reactions}
👌 

[01-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
@bishop removed the frequency setting?

[01-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
I just got a mini and I can change the frequency from the web control panel

[01-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
that's not normal?

[01-Sep-18 01:34 PM] bishop#9773
Batch 2 is hit or miss. Some reports have the dropdown under advanced settings like Batch 1, others, like all the ones I received of Batch 2 just have "Balanced" under the advanced settings so runs at the default 500

[01-Sep-18 01:34 PM] bishop#9773
you can still get around it by manually changing the config file, but they don't OC as high as Batch 1, at least none of my Batch 2 have been able to hit 750

[01-Sep-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#InspectElementIsOurFriend 😉

[01-Sep-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
FWIW, the Aug24-Sept4 batch will flash back to the May fw and OC in a manner like batch 1 & 1.5

[01-Sep-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
although I haven't had one hit as strong of an OC as the 1st batch and a half

[01-Sep-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

freq-settings still there

[01-Sep-18 04:26 PM] SHossain#0007
this is the latest firmware that was shipped with the minis https://file11.bitmain.com/shop-product/firmware/Antminer-Z9-Mini-201805262047-500M.tar.gz

[01-Sep-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain That shipped in batch 1, 1.5, and **some** of batch 2

[01-Sep-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some of batch 2 shipped with 8122018 and not 5262018

[01-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in 8122018 the only available settings is "balanced" (500) and a commented out "turbo" (550)

[01-Sep-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure why they even bothered to keep the page with a "setting" that only has 1 option 😕

[01-Sep-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either way, 16.6 avg is a thing of the past without manipulation

[01-Sep-18 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe, if batch 2 are binned chips from batch 1, OC'ing them will bring down their lifespan noticeably. Bitmain QA probably had data that made them decide to remove those OC options for a reason

[01-Sep-18 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
how to reduce the fan rpm?

[01-Sep-18 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
mine's running at 3240, i want to run around 2000+

[01-Sep-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain Use "Customize the fan speed percentage"

[01-Sep-18 04:51 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. what number to put there? i used 80% and the rpm raised to 5000

[01-Sep-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
33%?

[01-Sep-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends if they are 5500, 5600, or 6k RPM fans, really
edit: if 80% = 5k then they are 6250 RPM max

[01-Sep-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure why you'd want to overheat the chips, but that's the way to do it :trollface:

[01-Sep-18 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[01-Sep-18 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
will try

{Reactions}
👍🏿 

[01-Sep-18 05:00 PM] SHossain#0007
how about if i use an additional quiet fan at the back while reducing rpm?

[01-Sep-18 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how about if you take the advice of engineers and let it do it's thing? :trollface:

[01-Sep-18 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
noise

[01-Sep-18 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't like constant noise and need to work from the same room

[01-Sep-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
jokes aside, I used to have a fan curve calculation of 2 fans vs 1 and I forget if there's any major difference or not, but I'm thinking maybe

[01-Sep-18 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
with everything stock, i get 56C temp on chips

[01-Sep-18 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any added effect by push-pull is still going to be limited by the pull fan though

[01-Sep-18 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
that's true

[01-Sep-18 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh my chip temps are all 70+ 😛

[01-Sep-18 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't mind if the temp is even 60 or 65. just the constant NOISE 😛

[01-Sep-18 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
my laptop already makes a lot of noise when i'm syncing or compiling something

[01-Sep-18 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no idea what 60-65 is like 😝 
I OC each rig to failure and then back it down 5-10%

[01-Sep-18 05:07 PM] SHossain#0007
😄

[01-Sep-18 05:07 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the stable freq?

[01-Sep-18 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007
with OC

[01-Sep-18 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Batch 1 & 1.5 I maxed @ like 765 (assuming the same for the "old" Batch2 models)
"new" Batch 2 most are maxing @ like 675-715

I wonder if the full will be able to be overclocked

[01-Sep-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm assuming that it's "locked down" in the same manner as the "newer" Batch2 minis

[02-Sep-18 06:24 PM] wookie#7663
I need some help. I've been mining for weeks/months non-stop, then I lost internet connection for a few minutes today. I shutdown the miner. After I re-established internet connection, I started up the miner again. But the miner just keeps crashing. I have a 1080ti and 1060 that I've been using for months with no problems. I use DSTM's CUDA miner on a pc and I mine on miningpools.cloud. Any help is appreciated.

[02-Sep-18 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
@wookie start the miner from a cmd window and see why it fails

[02-Sep-18 06:26 PM] wookie#7663
good thought, trying it now

[02-Sep-18 06:32 PM] wookie#7663
@Alright I got this error: 
#  backup.komodominingpool.com:5555 not responding

[02-Sep-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
they likely changed where the stratum is

[02-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
look for the latest from their site

[02-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
then change the .bat file to reflect the latest

[02-Sep-18 06:34 PM] wookie#7663
their miner startup code hasn't changed

[02-Sep-18 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
their backup stratum may be down

[02-Sep-18 06:34 PM] Alright#0419
did you try the non-backup one?

the pool's page still shows the same thing

[02-Sep-18 06:36 PM] wookie#7663
i redownloaded the miner but I still get the same error

[02-Sep-18 06:36 PM] Alright#0419
try just `zm --server komodominingpool.com --port 5555 --user <ADDRESS>`

[02-Sep-18 06:37 PM] wookie#7663
just tried it,  I still get the same error

[02-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Alright#0419
see if a different pool works

[02-Sep-18 06:37 PM] wookie#7663
would I get this error if the site is black listed by my internet provider?

[02-Sep-18 06:38 PM] wookie#7663
they've been cracking down on miners around here recently
