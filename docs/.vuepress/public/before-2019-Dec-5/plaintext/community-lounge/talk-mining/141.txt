ok, we can stop

[03-Aug-19 07:49 PM] zawy#5864
how many blocks into the attacker are we?

[03-Aug-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 30k and slowed down

[03-Aug-19 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch @hellcatz please stop now

[03-Aug-19 07:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
stopping

[03-Aug-19 07:50 PM] hellcatz#5825
ditto

[03-Aug-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
seems 35 blocks happened

[03-Aug-19 07:50 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[03-Aug-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in 5 minutes

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
now will be 12 minutes or so to get back to diff 5, so a total of about 40 blocks in 20 minutes or so

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] zawy#5864
ok, let me know the time and block count to when the 12'th block is < 1 k and start up again

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that is double the coin emission

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i had the boosters

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it really made the diff jump up pretty fast

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and it didnt allow so many blocks so fast

[03-Aug-19 07:51 PM] zawy#5864
I don't have booster and it jumps that fast

[03-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of 30 fast blocks, would be 15 slower blocks with the booster

[03-Aug-19 07:52 PM] hellcatz#5825
^ i actually had 100Ksol running for > 50% of the time...

[03-Aug-19 07:52 PM] hellcatz#5825
so we may of had a total ~150 to 170Ksol

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
someone is having fun with the pool

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] zawy#5864
mine is hitting 50k in 30 blocks

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but the blocktimes are very fast

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] zawy#5864
on 100k attack

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
with the boosters what i saw was that the diff rose a bit faster, but the effective diff being so much higher, it slowed the blocks down

[03-Aug-19 07:53 PM] hellcatz#5825
what you do to your console @SHossain üòÇ

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't know

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
this doesn't go away

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can make the 30 blocks 20 blocks and take 15 minutes, then coin emission isnt changed

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
are you running it in screen?

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
tmux

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
dettach & reattach

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] zawy#5864
half the time I'm getting 50k in 20 block on 150k attack

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
?

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i was monitoring many things in that. did detach and reattach. didn't help

[03-Aug-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but how long do those blocks take?

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
stop/restart pool?

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the booster combined so when blocks are really fast it made the effective diff 100x higher and slowed the blocks down. it doesnt solve at those times, so you dont see the effect onchain but it does prevent the 30 blocks in 5 minutes

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] zawy#5864
most of them are 1 second

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not with the booster

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
complete restart is the only way to fix that termal display

ok. exited the pane and started over

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] hellcatz#5825
@SHossain maybe it just a console char encoding differnce in render and data provided...

[03-Aug-19 07:55 PM] SHossain#0007
all good

[03-Aug-19 07:56 PM] zawy#5864
OK let me think about that

[03-Aug-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the boosters all combine, so if 1 second per block it can be a 300x multiplier

[03-Aug-19 07:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
```ht.268 block12diff 116 vs 660, make harder
ht.269 block12diff 120 vs 660, make harder``` those prints though

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
pool back up

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
as time passes, the boosters drop out during the block, so the eventual solved diff is about the same, but it prevents the crazy fast blocks, after 4 of them

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
those are debug prints @mrlynch

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
mult at 121

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate mult of 450 to solve this diff

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
5 minutes

[03-Aug-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@zawy no idea how you would model the boosters

[03-Aug-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but what i saw was after a few fast block, the much higher effective diff, at least slowed it down so was taking 10 seconds per block

[03-Aug-19 07:58 PM] zawy#5864
mine's 400x in 8 blocks

[03-Aug-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the booster is in addition to

[03-Aug-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so with 8 fast blocks it would be 280x 400x

[03-Aug-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
over 112k

[03-Aug-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
which would take a lot more than a 400 diff to solve

[03-Aug-19 07:59 PM] zawy#5864
ok, how does the boost work?

[03-Aug-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i detect 4, 7, 12 blocks that come in fast and if so 4x, 7x, 12x

[03-Aug-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
all combined

[03-Aug-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i used T/3, T/2 and T as the time window for 4, 7, 12 to reduce noise

[03-Aug-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but those are just guesses. i figured if 12x the rate of blocks are coming in, then 4x the diff is not a big gamble

[03-Aug-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but it decays during that block, so it is just a delaying effect, but that seems to be exactly what we need, we need to slow the blocks during the fast rising times by 2x to 4x

[03-Aug-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
down

[03-Aug-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
277: 2.53

[03-Aug-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
blocks happened with CPU pretty fast

[03-Aug-19 08:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
fire it up?

[03-Aug-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
like if you get 10 blocks all 1 second apart, why monkey with 10x, that is 600x the implied rate,

[03-Aug-19 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
wait for jl777 to announce for ASIC mining

[03-Aug-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we will see the same double the overall block production

[03-Aug-19 08:04 PM] zawy#5864
```the booster is in addition to
so with 8 fast blocks it would be 280x 400x
over 112k```  But if that were what it is, you would have seen 112k in 8 blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but the 7 blocks all happen very fast

[03-Aug-19 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
285: 1.88

[03-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
as the diff is at very low levels, it is very easy to solve, so when there is big hashrate, best to make it take as close to a minute as possible

[03-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
before we know exactly how much hashrate there is

[03-Aug-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
say after 4 fast blocks, it does an exponential decay from very high diff down to where it should be

[03-Aug-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point we get the next block and that diff goes onchain to help us

[03-Aug-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is now, all we get is some very low diff that goes onchain

[03-Aug-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so 10000x the diff, exponentially decay it down, at some point it is solved, and we get an idea of the actual hashrate, onchain, on block 5

[03-Aug-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if it solves immediate at 10000x, then next time start at 100000x

[03-Aug-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the way to look at it is that if the recent solve times are fast, we have a time budget available to check the "blood pressure", so boost the pressure way up, then reduce it until the next block is solved. somehow calibrate the range of diff and exponential decay to fit in the time budget we have

[03-Aug-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are wrong and slow down the block by 2 minutes, that is actually good as we just had 4 blocks in 8 seconds

[03-Aug-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i can just guesstimate this, but if you can work out the math to make it ideal, we could see no net increase in coin emissions

[03-Aug-19 08:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
left 1 cpu thread mining.. ping me when asic is required please

[03-Aug-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch since zawy isnt saying i am crazy it seems there is  a chance the booster trick will solve the fast blocks. will need ZAWY13 before the next ASIC as we have shown ZAWY12 is subject to double coin emissions

[03-Aug-19 08:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks for the hashrate!

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
anytime!

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] zawy#5864
I forgot how much benefit we can get from measuring current solvetime.  I think I can do 10x increase per block after 3 blocks, so 1E6 possible in 10 blocks

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] hellcatz#5825
my asics standing by mining KMD atm  hehe

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks @hellcatz and @mrlynch

[03-Aug-19 08:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
pleasure

[03-Aug-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
ZAWY13 maybe tomorrow?

[03-Aug-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the miners proved we still dont have things perfect, yet

[03-Aug-19 08:14 PM] zawy#5864
oh, what's the problem?

[03-Aug-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is double coin emissions doing what you suggested about the 100k miners going on and off

[03-Aug-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
3 fast blocks can imply 1000x the hashrate, so i think we need to temporarily boost the hashrate 1000x and exponentially drop it to 10x or whatever the normal calc would be
