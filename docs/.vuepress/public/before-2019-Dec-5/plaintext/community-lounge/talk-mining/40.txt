I do not trust myself to set up a pool properly.

[11-Sep-18 05:33 PM] coinr#7073
Either do i.  Had one set up for me .for game credits with a bunch of L3s, but had enough to hit multiple blocks a day.  I just dont have the balls to wait long lol

[11-Sep-18 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Only one other rig there with me.`
That I can mostly get behind. One of my main issues with pools is that people are lazy and just flock to whatever pool "everyone else" is on and it creates a dominance factor that isn't good for crypto (albeit that it's mostly a moot issue in KMD mining)

[11-Sep-18 05:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would it make you feel better if the "pool" operator was a KMD supporter and Notary Node Owner?  

If I were to google search a noob friendly znomp setup for myself, what terms would I use?  

Exactly those?  
Thanks again for the input.   I am not adverse to giving this a go.   I do have a few VPS to use for this purpose ( I assume this is advised ).

[11-Sep-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The other main issue I have is that for every 100 people in a pool, there's 99 less nodes in the network 😦

[11-Sep-18 05:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Fair enough.   I am game for this.   Always trying to learn.

[11-Sep-18 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you're looking for a pool that's run by a notary, xrobesx has one (he's also got a z-nomp github repo for running your own komodo pool)
Decker made a tutorial for running a solo-pool on Ubuntu that's pretty decent

[11-Sep-18 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure how much of either is still currently effected by z-nomp's overwinter updates, though

[11-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers also notary and own pool I think?

Got 4 of my 8 minis IP tommorow electrician is coming to install my plug so I can run all 8

[11-Sep-18 09:19 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Think I'm going to buy 2 a9 zmasters to add to my minis

[11-Sep-18 09:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@FishyGuts you got fucked bro I had a 870 tarrif on 5 of mine I called ups and had them manually change it then when I picked them up from ups. I had 0 tarrif to pay ;)

[11-Sep-18 09:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Change the tarrif code*

[11-Sep-18 09:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I learned that after the fact.   I am waiting for one more rig and will get the opportunity to test that out.

[11-Sep-18 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_paid $64 USD to Customs for his batch of 19 minis and is glad he owns a business_

[11-Sep-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is a good temperature to keep the z9 mini at?

[11-Sep-18 10:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am trying to decide how much to overclock. the UI was disabled but I used "copy as curl" in chrome and edited the form data, works fine

[12-Sep-18 01:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@BlackJesus  explain the process for this,  looking at a huge tariff soon

[12-Sep-18 01:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto  60's ,  heard some problems with this new batch running at 70s

[12-Sep-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
People looking for an easy to setup pool, I have a pool called Knomp and a script that does all the configurations for KMD and AC automatically via a one line command. Its not super easy to do, and could use some polish, but its not bad.

[12-Sep-18 08:25 AM] $tefano.#3560
Great! New goal for our komodo pool, thank you
130.000 KMD paid and 1 Mh/s 
LUCK +63.28% :Komodo: 
:shexy:

[12-Sep-18 08:27 AM] $tefano.#3560
We will continue to work to keep the service up, new stratum for Latin America and Africa soon

[12-Sep-18 02:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@$tefano. this afternoon ill be adding another 120k sols to your pool. I was too lazy to setu my znomp :(. plus I'm in the process of moving cities and setting up my miners remotely in TN wilst I live in Wisconsin.

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@polycryptoblog just call the international ups hot line and tell hem they have the wrong tarriff code and get them to manually change it to 8470.50.0150 as the tariff code which will remove the fees.

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
has anybody ever gotten a high-pitched horrible beeping sound when trying to overclock a z9 mini? I couldn't tell if it was the fan or some error noise

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You will have to send them an email stating that you had them manually change the tariff code.

[12-Sep-18 03:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@dukeleto none but I had single boards go down on startup with a 700 clock speed had to bring them back to 650.

[12-Sep-18 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a way to get rid of tariffs?!?!

[12-Sep-18 03:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[12-Sep-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
can that be done after the fact? I bet it takes them a while to cash that check

[12-Sep-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
my z9m makes a crazy horrible high pitched noise when overclocking above 625, tho it still seems to hash. 625 seems to make it happy

[12-Sep-18 05:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they have to send it through customs again

[12-Sep-18 05:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
but it will pass

[12-Sep-18 05:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its those damn trump tariffs why this happened

[12-Sep-18 05:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
btw all 8 of my miners are up and running had to pay a grand to get my l6-30 installed by a licensed electrician zzz

[12-Sep-18 05:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
could have done it myself but I"m not licensed in th state of tennessee

[12-Sep-18 05:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
homeowners insurance problems that my parents dont want.

[12-Sep-18 05:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How long does it take to go through customs again, do you know what happens if they don't accept it

[12-Sep-18 05:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
like a day max

[12-Sep-18 05:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
didnt take long at all for mine

[12-Sep-18 05:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If they dont reclassify it. It'll just end up with the same tariff it had before they reclassified mine though for me

[12-Sep-18 07:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok cool good to know,  I'll give it a shot

[12-Sep-18 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto Don't ever buy an S9 if you think minis are loud 😂

[12-Sep-18 07:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlackJesus As much as I hate Trump, he and his shitty tariffs have nothing to do with why your miners from China go through Customs. In fact, it started long before he was even born.

[13-Sep-18 12:26 AM] RuLzU#4177
Sup everyone

[13-Sep-18 12:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Bueno

[13-Sep-18 12:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 everything that comes through america goes through customs and he has alot to do with the tariffs we are experiencing. Don't be daft...

[13-Sep-18 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlackJesus I'm not sure why you're pissy over a duty fee of 0.31%, but whatever...

[13-Sep-18 02:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It was 27.5%

[13-Sep-18 02:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
On the dollar @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[13-Sep-18 02:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
My 4k order had a 1k dollar tarrif on it

[13-Sep-18 05:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thats rough

[13-Sep-18 07:25 AM] $tefano.#3560
@BlackJesus thank's . in the afternoon il will add other 100 K of my new z9 ❤ 
ups arriving .. 😎   I really love UPS carriers delivering from China 😂

[13-Sep-18 07:26 AM] $tefano.#3560
16k is the max z mini overclock at 700 ?

[13-Sep-18 11:18 AM] userpike#6501
@$tefano. do you have the full size Z9s already or just minis?

[13-Sep-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlackJesus Look at your bill again. 99.9% of what you paid went to UPS and was not tariffs

[13-Sep-18 11:46 AM] $tefano.#3560
z9 and z9 mini, innosilicon A9 it's  awaiting shipment

[13-Sep-18 11:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161

853 GOVERNMENT CHARGES

[13-Sep-18 11:47 AM] $tefano.#3560
i know @BlackJesus

[13-Sep-18 11:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
tariffs always go to the state not the damn shipping companies

[13-Sep-18 11:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they are beholden to the state to collect before delivery or they'd be held liable. It's the reason they request social security numbers on all international shipments.

[13-Sep-18 11:49 AM] $tefano.#3560
vat + customs duties 😑

[13-Sep-18 11:49 AM] BlackJesus#6161
All my stuff is running on your pools now @$tefano.

[13-Sep-18 11:49 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think im going to drop another 7 on 2 innos so I can be king of da pool. lol

[13-Sep-18 11:50 AM] $tefano.#3560

[13-Sep-18 11:52 AM] $tefano.#3560
sure @BlackJesus

[13-Sep-18 11:52 AM] $tefano.#3560
😄

[13-Sep-18 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"government charges" is a broad and vague bunch of horse shit
You need to demand that UPS justify what they are screwing you for

[13-Sep-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "Duty and I.R. taxes" on miners is 0.3464%

[13-Sep-18 11:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, I got around paying that fee so I'm not going to remind them about it all.

I had to pay a contractor 1k the other day to install a l6-30p plug in my parents laundry room...

[13-Sep-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Every reason I use FedEx....
On a shipment of 19 miners I paid $54.04, because that's 0.3464% of $15,600

[13-Sep-18 12:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That monitor in the top right isnt permenant I ordered a cheap monitor, because I'm taking that monitor with me to milwaukee. I got to get my old barebones rig up and running so I can portal into my parents network and control my miners from wisconsin. Moving from a celeron on it to a r5 2600

[13-Sep-18 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
use a dongle
like: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074P1K5W2

[13-Sep-18 12:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I don't think that'll achieve my goal. I need that barebones on top to just always be on so I can teamviewer into it and have access to the LAN that my miners are operating on.

[13-Sep-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It replaces the need for a monitor on any rig that you're not going to be physically at. Specifically for folks that want to use tv or ssh

[13-Sep-18 12:12 PM] BlackJesus#6161
But I honesty dont need a monitor on it. To teamviewer into my rig.

[13-Sep-18 12:12 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm going to be 700 miles from my operation II NEED a way to access my miners and the network they are on.

[13-Sep-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Which is exactly why I suggested a dongle instead of a monitor

[13-Sep-18 12:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
oh wow I just realised I can flash the firmware of my non overclockable z9 minis to the overclockable version lol.

[13-Sep-18 12:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Now all 8 of them are on the overclockable firmware

[13-Sep-18 01:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
btw if you cant overclock your z9 mini flash this firmware its the original firmware with overclocking enabled released by bitmain'

👍 I was able to manually edit (through "inspect element") the web page and OC most of batch 2, but hat a few that only stuck when "downgrading" to the May fw

[13-Sep-18 01:53 PM] $tefano.#3560

👆 May 26 mini fw (official and overclockable)

[13-Sep-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as for the Z9, I'm not sure if there is one

[13-Sep-18 02:20 PM] $tefano.#3560
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👍

[13-Sep-18 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
"copy as curl" from Chrome is an easy way to OC your z9m

[13-Sep-18 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
look at your Network requests inspector tab, press "save and apply" with default (no OC settings), then "copy as curl" and change 500 to the freq you want

[13-Sep-18 03:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
then you have a CLI command to run to change freq, better than inspect element every time 😃

[13-Sep-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, because what I really want to do is to install a 60MB app just to avoid using a feature that's basic in every useful browser on the planet 🙄

[14-Sep-18 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at 90F outside temp, they are running @ mind-70s C

[14-Sep-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the ones at full 750 overclock, anyway
