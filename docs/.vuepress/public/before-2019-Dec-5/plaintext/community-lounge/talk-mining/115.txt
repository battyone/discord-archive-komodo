Just put a disclaimer 😃

[09-Apr-19 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, because people read things 👍🏽

[09-Apr-19 10:13 AM] jansako#3330
I would think if you consistently make 50-100% over 'regular' mining, a 20% loss here and there is acceptable

[09-Apr-19 10:15 AM] jansako#3330
all about how you communicate the value of your service, but that is just me speculating.

[09-Apr-19 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and who pays for all of the development and security of this service?

[09-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jansako#3330
The end users, through 'pool fees'...

[09-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jansako#3330
But then you already know that.

[09-Apr-19 11:03 AM] jansako#3330
Really, this was nothing more than a suggestion based on your earlier posts about how you can get much more out of mining than just a straight mine-dump cycle.

[09-Apr-19 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The end users, through 'pool fees'...`
so, basically you're suggesting I drop $100k to *maybe* make some extra down the line? I'll pass

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jansako#3330
Not at all. This was my initial statement:
_ if what you do with your miners is scalable, would it be worth for you to offer it as a service (via a public pool or something) & make (more) profit via the pool fee?_

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jansako#3330
Seems the answer is 'No'.

[09-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jansako#3330
Good enough.

[09-Apr-19 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"scalable" and "scalable for free" are differing concepts

[09-Apr-19 11:33 AM] jansako#3330
I don't know what the second one means... there is no such thing as 'free', I believe you pointed it out before :troll_cool:

I'm out of pocket that expense on nothing more than "maybe people might use it"

[09-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jansako#3330
Just like any other product ever released.

[09-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But you have it working already?

[09-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That's what jansako meant I think, if it works and if it's possible for jansako to also use it for a fee, that would be nice

[09-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if not possible, too bad

[09-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
indeed

[09-Apr-19 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon that I have something working with the only access being me and the security involved in and for outside users is an entirely different level and structure

[09-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
I do not want to cut into your profits.

[09-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
If synergy is not possible, let's move on.

[09-Apr-19 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not that it's "not possible", it's that there's a huge cost and dev cycle with not a lot of upside

[09-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jansako#3330
Maybe let's call it 'realistic', instead of 'possible'

[09-Apr-19 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and $ aside, if I could find the people to do that, chickenpool wouldn't look like just another pile of nomp shit

[09-Apr-19 11:41 AM] jansako#3330
_remembers trying to put a team together to work on BarterDEX_ 😃

[09-Apr-19 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek, I tried to put together a team to rebuild nomp for a komodo base....
the "frontend" guy never even joined the repo and the other dev got ill and then went on to other things
🤷🏽

[09-Apr-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
a dude buddy is selling quite the GPU farm on another discord

[09-Apr-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
he said is is switching to writing his own bitstreams for FPGAs

[09-Apr-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1060s? 😕

[09-Apr-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just report the facts, ma'am

[09-Apr-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_almost comments_

[09-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems a bit steep

[09-Apr-19 07:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
hello komodos

[09-Apr-19 07:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
just curious

[09-Apr-19 07:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
could i mine kmd on a 12 core mac pro 3.46 ghz?

[09-Apr-19 07:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
or you need a megarig?

[09-Apr-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
you need GPU or ASIC to mine KMD

[09-Apr-19 07:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
aha ok

[09-Apr-19 07:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
ty

[09-Apr-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nocturnal you could mine various cpu-friendly coins, but not KMD

[09-Apr-19 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@nocturnal there are more than you would ever think: https://discord.gg/9EuFvJ

[09-Apr-19 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wow that's a lot of GPU's. Are GPU's profitable still? If so, what are they mining?

[09-Apr-19 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also 15k for a container is pretty steep

[09-Apr-19 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
😛

[09-Apr-19 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I could get you one for 1.5k

[09-Apr-19 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Are GPU's profitable still? `
GPUs, yes
1060s, prolly not

[09-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought 2 20 foot seacontainers for 1k€

[09-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Built insulated storage in them for inside warehouse

[09-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pretty sure you could build the setup he’s got in the container for the infrastructure alone for 3-4k maybe

[09-Apr-19 08:40 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I considered doing exactly the setup listed but with 1070's a year and a bit ago. Decided against it, I'm lucky I did tbh, wouldn't have been very profitable

[10-Apr-19 03:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
F1 mini: https://www.hashaltcoin.com/en/batches/14

[10-Apr-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
a new Veriblock 9GH/s bitstream today to registered users in the Zetheron discord chat.  The new bitstream with extremely cold ambient and high voltages can hit 600MHz x 15 cores = 9GH/s local hash rate, though some is lost to nonce overhead poolside, and most people with 'normal' ambient probably only get 8-8.5GH/s.
```

[10-Apr-19 11:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c FPGA devs sure know their customer base, I think they charge 4% dev fee on those bitstreams

[10-Apr-19 11:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
that bitstream is about 50X more hashrate than blackminer F1

[10-Apr-19 11:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
poor VBK GPU miners, never had a chance

[10-Apr-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`charge 4% dev fee on those bitstreams`
closed source and just using the "FP" part loosely?

[10-Apr-19 11:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
you are free to program it in the field, it's just super hard, lol

[10-Apr-19 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 closed source and they seem to mostly only support winderz, because of crazy fpga OS drivers not existing in linux, methinks

[10-Apr-19 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
7 kinds of puking

[10-Apr-19 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
each card starts at 5-10K for the zeth rigs

[10-Apr-19 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
depending on level of cooling insanity

[10-Apr-19 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
win only? then in that case, I'm glad I've been too busy to buy one 😛

[10-Apr-19 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
blackminer F1 is $2000 and no dev fee and is as stupidly simple to use as a z9m

[10-Apr-19 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
it looks exactly the same, damn HAC names a think "blackminer" and can't even paint it black

[10-Apr-19 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
F1 and z9m look identical next to each other

[10-Apr-19 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
and F1 stole their web admin interface, made it prettier

[10-Apr-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
glanced at them when you linked last night and gave a passing thought to picking one up

[10-Apr-19 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
defaults to dark theme, which is inherently better

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a fun way to spec-mine shitcoins

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
look at all this fun: https://www.hashaltcoin.com/en/calculation

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was thinking VRSC 😛

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 me too :abusedsmily:

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
but this new Zeth bitstream going to kill our dreams

[10-Apr-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
50X more hashrate, fuck

[10-Apr-19 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
has a whopping 8VRSC to his name

[10-Apr-19 11:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
i caught the vrsc bug early and have lots of 384 timelocked blocks with my name on them, some mature, many not

[10-Apr-19 11:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have been making somewhere around $5-10/day on VRSC with the F1, depending on market insanity

[10-Apr-19 11:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes big FPGA people jump on and off of VRSC

[10-Apr-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
early vrsc I had no decent CPU and no liquidity to do AWS
by the time GPU was worthwhile, I was on other things 😦

[10-Apr-19 11:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
14Gh/s miner keeps jumping on and off luckpool, really messes with my stats on vrsc

[10-Apr-19 11:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
I spent a few hundred bucks on AWS when there was 384 blocks and it turned out to be a decent investment. I still have various CPUs mining it, mostly because it's work to change them over to other stuff. But monero forks are way more profitable than VRSC on a cpu

[10-Apr-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the day before I was about to buy a thread ripper was the day all the FPGAs started being publicly known about LOL

[10-Apr-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that news saved me a ton of $ 😛

[10-Apr-19 11:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
I came pretty close to making a decent-sized vrsc CPU mining farm and ended up returning various HW that had already arrived but I hadn't unboxed yet

[10-Apr-19 11:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
in the end, it taught me a huge amount about CPU mining and all that knowledge translates to other coins, which are actually CPU-friendly

[10-Apr-19 11:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
If people want to try something totally different, I can recommend BLUR: https://blur.cash/

[10-Apr-19 11:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a CPU-only solo-mining only coin, pools are aggressively worked against, and they are also interested to add DPoW. It's a friendly community

@dukeleto  just wondering what will be happening to BTCH, since Hush is moving over to an assetchain

[11-Apr-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
is there an RFOX mining pool?

[11-Apr-19 08:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
Chickenpool      chickenpool.com   has RFOX

[11-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[11-Apr-19 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c overkill much on the RFOX hashrate?

[11-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
hard to control the hashrate delivered

[11-Apr-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog the plan was for BTCH to become CPU-mineable with verushash + 50% PoS, but I don't consider verushash to be appropriate for that anymore. BTCH + HUSH will both have cryptoconditions, jl777 has interesting ideas relating to that

[11-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
been pretty far down the HUSH rabbit hole lately
