Network Hash/s: 3.47 MSol/s  down almost half of yesterday

[23-Aug-18 05:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and so it begins @dukeleto

[23-Aug-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Who really didn't see the Bitmain limit of non-KYC at $0 for US coming when dipshit decided to tariff the shit out of everything we buy?

Bitmain will be requiring KYC information to purchase mining equipment in the very near future. I can see this not going over so well with various privacy-loving miners, reducing Bitmain marketshare and also creating an underground market to resell miners sans KYC ⛏️...

Underground market 😏

[23-Aug-18 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
you know some people will be selling miners for 20% more and no kyc bullshit, from the back of a truck

[23-Aug-18 05:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can see possibilities there :p

[23-Aug-18 05:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
'Ohno half my miners got fried because of bitmain crappy quality, just threw em away'

[23-Aug-18 05:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
"10 of my miners died" when actually they got sold for 20% more

[23-Aug-18 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto Setting aside new tariffs and import bullshit, how did you, and others like you, not see this shit coming 100 miles out with "institutional money" being poured into Bitcoin?

[23-Aug-18 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
this move from Bitmain makes perfect sense to me ,so I am not sure what you mean @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Aug-18 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Bitmain is in a hard position right now

[23-Aug-18 05:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are *begging* for money, via IPO. To get that money, they have to follow crazyass rules

[23-Aug-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this KYC bullshit is a crazy rule so they can get their crazy IPO money

[23-Aug-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
something any startup would do, if VC's were waving millions in front of them, or billions

[23-Aug-18 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Can you start a company in the US without KYC stuff?

[23-Aug-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's my point, you're sounding surprised that this happened and I'm not seeing how anyone didn't see it coming in advance.

[23-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Start holding company on the cayman islands, use holding to start a company in the US

[23-Aug-18 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty much no. You can start a company, but you need to know who your customers are, if you have any sizable revenue

[23-Aug-18 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, I am not a lawyer

[23-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Use some panama lawyers as representatives

[23-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So your name doesnt show up

[23-Aug-18 05:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i think it's a big change, from no KYC, but it makes sense to me. Mostly, it's annoying to see the space embrace KYC, but not surprising

[23-Aug-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
Mtgox went bankrupt right after they asked for my selfie, so maybe I am jaded on the whole KYC concept

[23-Aug-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon it depends on the "type" of business transacted if regulations (those lovely things Congress invented to bypass the Constitution) require KYC or not

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
if your business goes across state and country borders, tons more laws apply, in terms of AML

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm mining business could be one of those thing the pesky regulations apply to because of AML stuff probably

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that too

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you are a brick layer and Bob from the next town pays you a lot of money to lay bricks, Uncle sam don't care too much that you don't have Bob's selfie

[23-Aug-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you are selling black boxes across the world to dudes named Anon for tons of money, Uncle Sam cares a lot, and wants his tax money and wants to make sure nothing fishy is going on

[23-Aug-18 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_pays tax on every coin he mines that Uncle Sam can find, that's why he mines privacy coins 😈_

[23-Aug-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've mined exactly the number of coins that it takes to buy equipment and pay electric bills 🤐

[23-Aug-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't forget that tragic boating accident

[23-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah mining has really taken a dip because of the crash :abusedsmily:

[23-Aug-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
where your private keys went to the bottom of the lake

[23-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Damn that bubble!

[23-Aug-18 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what's a "private key"?

[23-Aug-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm mining for long-term gains, so I'm still not understanding this whole "crash" thing when everything is up on any long-term scale...

[23-Aug-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you live the 100% cryptocoin life, then you must pay all your monthly living expenses and mining expenses from your holdings

[23-Aug-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's very different than having a fiat income stream and hoarding cryptocoins

[23-Aug-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't understand miners that have fiat income streams and still sell their coins daily/monthly to pay elec costs or whatever. They just don't get what is going on.

[23-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They are not fulltime miners then

[23-Aug-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC was $790 when S9s came out and people made $ minging then, I don't see how they can't make money when BTC is up 8x and the cost of an S9 is down 4x and puts out 16% more hash

[23-Aug-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Oh, that's right...
BTC is the only coin there is 🙄

[23-Aug-18 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I think I only ever mined BTC for like 3 weeks with my S9s 😛

[23-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
People are inheritly lazy

[23-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If they wouldn't be it would be harder for smarter people to have more than others

[23-Aug-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, if you can't make $ in the current mining environment then you should stick to making a living pumping gas for those that learned basic math is primary school

[23-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If everyone was equally lazy/stupid etc, there would not be inequality, but there would also not be any prosperity

[23-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So be happy there are more stupid/lazy people than smart ones, because that makes it a lot more worthwhile to go the extra mile

[23-Aug-18 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm plenty happy there are so many dumb people (at least until I'm forced to talk to them on discord 😛  )

[23-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
😄

[23-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can imagine hahaha

[23-Aug-18 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
speaking of mining and dumb shit.....
@blackjok3r hows it going with trying to turn CHIPS from sha to verushash?

{Reactions}
abusedsmily (2) 🤣 (2) 

[23-Aug-18 11:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make files are hard :P

[24-Aug-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is thinking that hardforking CHIPS as an air-dropped, notrarized equihash assetchain would have been finished weeks ago_

[24-Aug-18 12:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
but AC's don't have anything with lightning, CHIPS is based on a much more recent btc

[24-Aug-18 12:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto verushash has lightning?

[24-Aug-18 12:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
changing chips to verushash keeps all it's lightning features, converting CHIPS to an AC loses those features

[24-Aug-18 12:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well then, git er done

[24-Aug-18 12:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I misunderstand why CHIPS is changing to verushash

[24-Aug-18 12:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`maybe I misunderstand why CHIPS is changing to verushash`
because @blackjok3r wants to make it minable for notaty nodes

[24-Aug-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
VerusHash is genuinely interesting, and it might get used for BTCH if it gets upstream'ed to KMD from Verus soon enough

{Reactions}
🤦🏿 

[24-Aug-18 12:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_waits for BitcoinPrivateGoldReservePlatinumZenVeriHush coming to a market near him soon_

trollface 

[24-Aug-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not that I wanted to make it mineable for Notaries, James wants it CPU mined

[24-Aug-18 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
VerusHash solves that, as it can only be CPU mined

[24-Aug-18 12:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what if I told you that I'm currently CPU mining 6 assetchains?

[24-Aug-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I got stuck, I have no idea how C++ and Makefiles work... I got all the right functions in the right places but not 100% sure how to Height activate them , and wasn;t able to get it to build. Always complained about the CPU AES and AVX includes being wrong.

[24-Aug-18 12:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the fact that GPUs aren't very efficient at verushash doesn't make it a CPU only algo

[24-Aug-18 12:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
true...eithetr way, I couldnt get it working and no ones is helping me with it... so seems dead... Guess we wait until BR falls to 1 sat and then try to use chips. :trollface:

[24-Aug-18 12:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
VerusHash is most effectively mined by CPUs

[24-Aug-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
sure, not CPU-only. CPU-optimized maybe

[24-Aug-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's nothing wrong with the block reward falling to an inflation minimum once CHIPS is actively used and fees will be plentiful

[24-Aug-18 12:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only problem is shortsighted greed between now and then

[24-Aug-18 12:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I CANT EVEN MINE IT! anyway this argument is long over, you won by default because I wasnt able to do it.

[24-Aug-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
>> what if I told you that I'm currently CPU mining 6 assetchains?
I am mining 12 or something, maybe more.

[24-Aug-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure it changes depending on the difficulty.

[24-Aug-18 09:57 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Alright guys...I got one here for ya....i downloaded the zcash/equihash miner to mine KMD. My 1060s work. My 1070 founders edition are half the sols/s of the 1060.....not a gpu expert but the 1070s i dont think are able to overclock....is there a solution or am I wrong in my assumption?

[24-Aug-18 09:57 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
I am back to mining the other coin Nexus with my 1070s because they work good on that miner....

[24-Aug-18 10:00 PM] cryptojokermic#0314
Is there a diff mining program I need to download.

[24-Aug-18 11:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So, it's 8/24 - Did anyone get their Z9 mini shipment notice yet?   I just logged on to Bitmain and no update for mine.

[25-Aug-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are 1st paid 1st shipped

Taps toe waiting patiently.   
I have 9 coming, and want to get those beasts running ASAP.  
My grow tent / heat solution was setup last week and I am ready to throw these hot bricks inside.

[25-Aug-18 12:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How's the guy complaining about being 4 days late, when they specifically gave a date range when ordering...

[25-Aug-18 12:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Not sure.   I know the date range started today so I am wondering if anyone has gotten shipment notices.

[25-Aug-18 12:59 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I personally haven't, I'm excited, but also wondering how long my mini's will take to get through customs

Is there really nothing to mine with a decent profitability with an s9?

[25-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Orrrrr is he trying to get the diff down so his own profitability rises?

[25-Aug-18 01:23 PM] bishop#9773
All depends on your electric rates 😛

[25-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah he was paying .105

[25-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which seemed pretty steep?

[25-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My company pays like 0.06€ or so

[25-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
@FishyGuts got a notification from the shipping service today, mini getting delivered tuesday

[25-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
can't find any announcement similar to what they did for the first batch though

[25-Aug-18 04:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i missed a call from UPS this morning. probably, they wanted to talk about the customs tax for 4 Minis

[25-Aug-18 04:11 PM] bishop#9773
Guessing $50ish per unit from UPS

[25-Aug-18 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
i paid more than that for the APW3++ power supply.
