@webworker01  Getting an interesting message from the mining pool.  Could this be a false positive or is it a problem?

🐔 ChickenPool has been intentionally restarted 🐔 
This was to change the number of blocks per payout for KMDICE to reduce the backlog of waiting payments created by some notarization timetable issues and a wait that seemed to create an exponentially growing number of waiting payments.

in reference to A9++'s, all we know is this? `1. Delivery time: Shipment will be made in July based on payment sequence.`

[17-May-19 11:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
people are paying 2500/miner and all they tell you is shipping starts in July. Not even a specific date? Lame

Still waiting for batch one

[18-May-19 01:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
shipping in the beginning or end of July is a huge difference

pretty interesting to see pools working with Efudd firmware

[18-May-19 10:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
article also mentions Pirate and KMD by name

[18-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
20% more hashrate from same hardware!?

[18-May-19 10:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
Efudd firmware usually takes a % dev fee but evidently they have something worked out with Luxor, I think the default is 4%

[18-May-19 10:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
so on Luxor people will only pay 1% dev fee, and 0.5% to start. It's an interesting way to attract miners to your pool and your hashrate-boosting firmware

[18-May-19 10:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think because they let you adjust hashrate + voltage on each board, that let's it squeeze more hash out. Default UI must run all boards at the same speed/voltage

[18-May-19 10:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's especially good for later batches, which often just have 1 "bad" board that makes the entire rig run slower

[18-May-19 10:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not sure it's worth it to run efudd firmware on batch 1's, they can run at max speed already
