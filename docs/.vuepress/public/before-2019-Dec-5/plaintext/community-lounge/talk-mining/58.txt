I also saw the Zeon 180k now it only gives 70 per day

[20-Oct-18 10:42 PM] WeyezOD#1176
Been running my A9 for 5 weeks now. Rock solid. "Set it and forget it"

[20-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Hermes#6934
oh that's very good to know

[20-Oct-18 10:42 PM] WeyezOD#1176
As for the loudness ... it's NOT the A9 that's loud, it's the damn PSU

[20-Oct-18 10:43 PM] Hermes#6934
directly from the supplier right?

[20-Oct-18 10:43 PM] WeyezOD#1176
No. I bought from a third party on Alibaba. I have a commercial account there

[20-Oct-18 10:43 PM] Hermes#6934
nice will look into it maybe

[20-Oct-18 10:44 PM] WeyezOD#1176
DM me if you need a reference vendor to purchase from

Question tho ...

[20-Oct-18 10:45 PM] WeyezOD#1176
My A9 has fallen off the pirate.io pool 4 times in the last 6 hours. Wondering if the problem is on my end (my internet connection sometimes fails) or if it's the pool

[20-Oct-18 10:46 PM] WeyezOD#1176
I know the pool is pretty 'saturated' now and @webworker01 might be implementing some changes so thought I'd check status here in the Discord

[20-Oct-18 11:01 PM] WeyezOD#1176
No problem. Just troubleshooting before I call my ISP and bitch at them. haha

[20-Oct-18 11:28 PM] gmr#4027
hello
i have cheap Electricity cost what asic miner should i use?

[21-Oct-18 04:14 AM] WeyezOD#1176
Is this correct? No miners on piratechain.org pool? Not a single one?

[21-Oct-18 06:35 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
oh nice , we hit 2 blocks tonight 😃

[21-Oct-18 06:35 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
everything working !

[21-Oct-18 06:37 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
now its fully safe to mine at http://piratetheminingpool.selfip.com/ 😃

@gmr z9 / z9mini seems like a solid choice from what I’m reading

[21-Oct-18 07:32 AM] JVA#7891
@TheMiningPool  have connected 1 miner, works  fine

[21-Oct-18 07:36 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
👌🏻👍

[21-Oct-18 07:44 AM] JVA#7891
Ping = 76ms = top

[21-Oct-18 08:22 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
Just need some more hash to find blocks faster 😉

[21-Oct-18 10:09 AM] WeyezOD#1176
@TheMiningPool Use port 4408 for Inno A9?

[21-Oct-18 10:21 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
yes @WeyezOD

[21-Oct-18 10:51 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I'm checking out your pool 😃  I connected with port 3408 and it seems to be working. Is there an advantage of one port to another with the A9?

[21-Oct-18 10:52 AM] WeyezOD#1176
In other words, for best results, which port is preferred?

[21-Oct-18 11:01 AM] marktibosch#5960
Ok, started yesterday mining on Pirate! I use the same port for a Z9 as for a A9. Is this correct?

[21-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i think all the various equihash ASIC can use the same port, especially if their hashrate is similar

[21-Oct-18 11:03 AM] marktibosch#5960
Is there allready an exchange, so i can calculate what my earnings are?

[21-Oct-18 11:03 AM] marktibosch#5960
Or what color Lambo i can choose🤣

[21-Oct-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
floor price is 0.1KMD per PIRATE

[21-Oct-18 11:10 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
@WeyezOD The difference will be on high hashrates. For a single Z9 , Z9 mini or A9 you can use 3408 perfectly. If you rent at MRR or NICEHASH use the high diff port 4408 instead

{Reactions}
👌 

[21-Oct-18 11:11 AM] marktibosch#5960
I have 6 Z9's and 2 A9's a Total of 177Ksol/s All on 1 walletadress

[21-Oct-18 11:12 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
then use 4408

[21-Oct-18 11:14 AM] marktibosch#5960
Ok, tnx!

[21-Oct-18 11:15 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
yw 😃

[21-Oct-18 11:17 AM] marktibosch#5960
What is the difference? Will it more stable now? (Asking for a friend)🙈

[21-Oct-18 11:24 AM] marktibosch#5960
With 4408 the pool is dead

[21-Oct-18 11:25 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
?? noup..

[21-Oct-18 11:26 AM] marktibosch#5960
When i change it in 4408 the pool is dead

[21-Oct-18 11:26 AM] marktibosch#5960
The miner won't start

[21-Oct-18 11:27 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
I'm trying now..

[21-Oct-18 11:27 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
working fine for me

[21-Oct-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
just use 3408?

[21-Oct-18 11:27 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
theminingpoolstratum.selfip.com:4408

[21-Oct-18 11:28 AM] marktibosch#5960
Ok, also change the name?

[21-Oct-18 11:28 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
the name is tha same for both ports

[21-Oct-18 11:28 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
Stratum Host: theminingpoolstratum.selfip.com
Low-Diff Port: 3408 - Hi-Diff Port: 4408 (NiceHash)

[21-Oct-18 11:41 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
@marktibosch  you get it working?

[21-Oct-18 11:42 AM] marktibosch#5960
Yeah, works fine by now

[21-Oct-18 11:42 AM] marktibosch#5960
Tnx

[21-Oct-18 11:42 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
kk ty 😃

[21-Oct-18 01:34 PM] hfaz63#1930
pirae.io is tealing from us....my hashrate is usually lower and every few hours it goes to zero and comes back in 10-20 minutes

[21-Oct-18 01:35 PM] hfaz63#1930
i can verify everything on my end but it is the damn pool who is stealing from US

[21-Oct-18 01:36 PM] hfaz63#1930
https://piratepool.io damn u retarded scammy pool 😡

[21-Oct-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
what are you talking about, that is the main pool

[21-Oct-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if its hashrate is lower, it isnt finding as many blocks

[21-Oct-18 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@hfaz63 that pool has seen some maintenance lately, and it's run by a trusted KMD person

[21-Oct-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are load issues, or maybe it is normal fluctutation

[21-Oct-18 01:40 PM] hfaz63#1930
it obviously can't handle the load then....if you read I am not the only person having conenction issue to the pool

[21-Oct-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe use a different pool to spread the load around

[21-Oct-18 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326

[21-Oct-18 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
small ARRR pools have the added benefit of not being DoS'ed by z_sendmany

[21-Oct-18 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
paying out to zaddrs is very CPU intensive and the largest pool can't keep up

[21-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
also the third and fourth pool has very little hashrate now

[21-Oct-18 01:44 PM] hfaz63#1930
almost everybody is on this pool an if i switch i think i will make less

[21-Oct-18 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
does not compute

[21-Oct-18 01:44 PM] hfaz63#1930
sent ya a DM

[21-Oct-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hfaz63 the size of a pool has nothing to do with your hash or how much your hash earns

[21-Oct-18 01:46 PM] hfaz63#1930
if so why everybody is sticking to the largest pool there is..

[21-Oct-18 01:47 PM] hfaz63#1930
and face conenction problems..

[21-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
laziness?

[21-Oct-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
larger pool = you get smaller payments faster
smaller pool = you get larger payments slower
1=1

[21-Oct-18 01:48 PM] hfaz63#1930
I hope many end up switching and I also do the same..

[21-Oct-18 01:54 PM] hfaz63#1930
lol new problem my balance on the pool is suddenly zero without payment..i just see my unchanged paid balance and new immature balance..

[21-Oct-18 01:54 PM] hfaz63#1930
47 ARRR in balance gone..

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hfaz63 payments take time to fully process

[21-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be that the payment is in queue, it takes a long time to process

[21-Oct-18 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
read source code of z_sendmany to reach enlightenment

[21-Oct-18 03:11 PM] hfaz63#1930
with 60 KS/S i should almost get above 200 ARR everyday but I have barely got 170....I blame this on the pool computation. it obviously can't handle the load

[21-Oct-18 03:12 PM] bishop#9773
You're free to mine anywhere but realize that diff isn't static

[21-Oct-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
10% variance can just be overall nethash variance

[21-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
BIG fluctuations in hashrate -> big fluctuations in coins miner at constant hashrate

[21-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if other coins have such a high variance in hashrate

[21-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and it could also be load issues

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`with 60 KS/S i should almost get above 200 ARR everyday but I have barely got 170`
@hfaz63 calculators are approximations, not guarantees

[21-Oct-18 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
averages don't exist

[21-Oct-18 03:29 PM] hfaz63#1930
180 comparing to 240 by the website is strange for me..

[21-Oct-18 03:29 PM] hfaz63#1930
can you please share how much you make in that pool?

[21-Oct-18 03:32 PM] hfaz63#1930
i guess maybe you guys don't face such a huge gap in your earnings..

[21-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hfaz63 You have to start by accepting that it's just an estimation based on that exact second
If nothing in the entire network changes for a year then you will get that amount, on an average day, ± a nominal difference
But that's not the world we live in
Your miner has ± luck
The pool you're on has ± luck
The other pools have ± luck
the block diff changes ± 100%
etc...

[21-Oct-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
most of all nicehash hashrate is very unstable

[21-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@hfaz63 whatever estimated coins per day you did one hour ago, is now half, as diff doubled in last hour

[21-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
https://dexstats.info/piratehash.php

[21-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
a +/- 10% over a full day is essentially spot on

[21-Oct-18 06:17 PM] gmr#4027
hey

[21-Oct-18 06:17 PM] gmr#4027
how can i calculate cryptocurrency difficulty in 6 months later on future?

[21-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant predict it 6 hours ahead of time, how would 6 months be possible?
