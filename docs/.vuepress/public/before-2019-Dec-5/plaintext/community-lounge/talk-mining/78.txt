I dont have the time nor skills to do that ...

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well add my solution as anOPTION

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD has it

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so make it compatible

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any speical coinbase is hten supported out the box

[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
UNTIL

[04-Dec-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
someone spends days making the pool take the fee from the coinbase

[04-Dec-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they so wish to do that for watever reason people are in love with that 游뱡

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine has always been an OPTION

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not changing anything

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I didn't say it couldn't "work", I just said it's stupid to keep messing with stripped out libraries rather than doing it right

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just removed the need for the entire library

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt even use it

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
there's no reason that a stratum can't create a valid tx

[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gone

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
there's no reason that a daemon can't create a valid tx

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
:trollface:

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when you reslise how much C code creates the coinbase on some of these CC chains... you will not be able to do it a diffrent way to mine ... Im sure of it

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I understand ... in the past there was no way for a stratum to make the daemon create the coinabse to the pool address

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`there's no reason that a daemon can't create a valid tx`
then put getwork back in and avoid the need for a stratum entirely :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I fixed that with `setpubkey` RPC

[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
no need for getwork

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
we have best of both worlds now

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You just use -pubkey and block template

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the same as get work

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I alrady did it

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my ZEX pool has been running for weeks.. never even loged in to it.

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] Alright#0419
if @blackjok3r adds ability to pay pool fee in cb tx, will you admit it's a good solution?

[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can probably do that

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
just do it in daemon

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but its adds a LOT of complexity

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ot impossible though

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
change blocktemplate

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`we have best of both worlds now`
You really don't
I don't understand why neither of you gets that znomp is a disaster and continuing to use it "because it's there" is silly af

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah we can add another vout to the coinbase for the pool fee

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't have to be znomp man

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make any pool

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
游땰

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
work with te RPCs in komodod

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Alright#0419
it'll work with whatever you want

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just used znomp becase it have it

[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know any other pols 游뱡

[04-Dec-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not the pool thats the issue

[04-Dec-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its komodod making crazy coinbases woth exotic chain aprams

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So make the komodod be able to creae the coinase you want ?

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then build a pool on top of that

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it has to be 100x eaier than rewritign all the C code in JS

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`I just used znomp becase it have it
I dont know any other pool`
At some point, I pray, that you'll stop and realize that is akin to saying
`We don't need Komodo because Bitcoin is already there`

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look man ...

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make any pool work with this method

[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
znomp was juts tthe fastest to get working

[04-Dec-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
genie whatever flavor of nomp you work with, we'll just add it to it

[04-Dec-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if I make it so that the pool fee cna be set in the daemon

[04-Dec-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will you use this method to sav YOURSELF TIME?

[04-Dec-18 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`it has to be 100x eaier than rewritign all the C code in JS`
You still fail to grasp the fact that it's not that feken hard
if the tx is
`bla op 1234`
then you make it say
`bla op 1`
`bla op 1233`
or vise versa
it's not like it's reinventing the wheel to make 1 vout into 2 vouts

[04-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
special vout types tho....

[04-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
cryptocondition

[04-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
P2SH

[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
literally anything

[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
all supported with disablecb method

[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
literally anything the daemon's miner can mine, joker's nomp can as well

[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
the way you're doing it, you have to code exceptions for each time a new param is made

[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
his "just works"

[04-Dec-18 01:59 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`literally anything the daemon's miner can mine,`
can be created because 1=1

[04-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I fully get that doing it this way ... can make "dust" end up in the pool address and I assume this is the only technical issue with it...

[04-Dec-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So if we move the pool fee to the daemon

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it makes the exact same tx

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as the pool does

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then there can no longer be any technical argument

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
against it

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
游뱑游낗

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the pool never needs to create a tx any more

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then why dafuq even have pools?

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BOOM ... you throw away 90% of the pool deps

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need a stratum

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
no

[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for the miners to connect to

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we should keep this simple man ...

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your amking it over complicated

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodod is already compicated as fuck ... the pool doesnt need to be aswell

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
genie, just ignore his solution and do what you're doing

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you're going to code pool tx into the daemon, it'd be simpler to code getwork back in and just mine straight from the dameon.... actual decentralized

[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
his can be added to anything you do as an option

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
this arguing is *stupid*

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
lol

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
everyone is working towards the same thing here

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We discussed that ... and the miners are not competile with getwork ... so I went this way

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I discussed at lenght what the problem was here

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and made the simplest solution i could find

[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
there is no equihash getwork miner

[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
that's why he went this route

[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
along with everything being 4-5 years old

[04-Dec-18 02:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and the miners are not competile with getwork`
because it would be too much like not being a lemming to take cgminer getwork code and add equihash to it, right?

[04-Dec-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems a lot harder than changing 20 lines of code in znomp and komodod. 游뱡

[04-Dec-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
90% of the code was alreayd in komodod

[04-Dec-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw

[04-Dec-18 02:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it ahd been disabled

[04-Dec-18 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yeah, we wouldn't want to have anything original, just use someone else's halfassed 游눨

[04-Dec-18 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_goes back to _ 游닠

[04-Dec-18 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mines blocks wihtout issue.... Not sure sapling suff tho .. I set it to activate in an hour and force in 6H so might take a while to know 100% that its working.
