"no i was told paying a pool fee is stupid so i don't want to be stupid and i'll mine myselfbut on windows" @Resistor 
I would like to explain a little concept based on who belive in a project like KMD and not only for REWARD as you said 

1% of fee on my pool is 0,03 KMD  at every block , after 100 block my earn after a year and a half is 3 KMD, about 80/90 KMD at month if pool is lucky.
i have 4 servers with dedicated infrastructure for KMD some with more than 4 cpus and 8 GB that each  that costs more than 80/90 KMD at month.
Image when kmd was at minus than 0,4$ last year with half and half of blocks found...
Without considering time to dedicate on it.

A pool fee it's just like to say "hey man thank you for your time! "
Before talk please power on brain

@$tefano. I was the one that told him that, and please don't take it personally, but I have strong viewpoints against the usage of pools in the modern era (especially as it concerns centralization and miners seeking pure profits with no specific regard to the coin in question).
Conversely, from the standpoint of a purely economic scale, I 1/2 hope that **everyone** else joins public pools and I can grow 1-2% faster than they can.

create a pool it's not a good job right now

[18-Sep-18 08:01 PM] $tefano.#3560
😄

[18-Sep-18 08:02 PM] waterpark#6318
that is a fair port. about your growing 1-2% faster though, i offer a counter point: the time you are spending trying to set up and maintain a node is a cost. it is worth exactly 1% of total earnings assuming you match a good pool's uptime. alternatively, if you put that set up time into earning money literally any other way, you could use that money to increase your hashrate far faster

[18-Sep-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@waterpark setting aside the things I do as me, setting up a private solo pool takes at max 1 hour (not counting chain download time), maintaining a viable node/wallet is something we all need to do in order to secure our personal finance anyway, and the more individual nodes that exist (miners or not) is the more decentralized the network becomes/stays

[18-Sep-18 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as my uptime, if I have no internet, I have no miners mining solo or in a pool

[18-Sep-18 08:07 PM] waterpark#6318
ah, i presumed your comment about pubkey coinbase tx was you working  a pool and it costing a fair amount of time

[18-Sep-18 08:07 PM] waterpark#6318
if you have the skills to get it up and running fast, go for it

[18-Sep-18 08:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and for the record, a solo pool is far less complex and need-intensive than that which is required to set up and maintain a public pool, so 1% is a vast over-estimate

[18-Sep-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ah, i presumed your comment about pubkey coinbase tx was you working a pool and it costing a fair amount of time`
That's where the real irony comes in about my personal views, I'm working on trying to help set up the possibility to add some of the new Komodo assetchain features into public stratums (specifically `-ac_perc`)
It's a totally new type of transaction than what pools currently have available.

hey, quick question about https://kmdexplorer.io/blocks -- where is the GitHub repo to add my pool for the "Mined by" column? I'm not seeing an official one and I'd like to put together a pull request. Thanks 😃

[19-Sep-18 07:49 PM] dyorguy#3319
My mining pool just mined one block worth 365 coins is that normal it’s been 3 coins since I started wtf is going on crazy lol

[19-Sep-18 08:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes its normal. Unclaimed rewards go to miners. Didn't see you got answered elsewhere 😃

@dyorguy yes it's normal, unclaimed rewards of 5% APR  at least once a month pool found big blocks.
Our record is this block https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/53b9f92e97cca4c4d14d74afd72011aa693d290550e24ff6fac8187db0efb44e

Anyone mining KMD currently and mind doing me a quick favor?

working on documentation, and I need a sample of what this command produces:

```
komodo-cli getlocalsolps
```

It's an rpc call to query how many solutions per second your machine is currently calculating.

[20-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is your notary node simply not mining at the moment, or are the notary node's actions not considered to be mining?

[20-Sep-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I checked the wrong VM, that is the node that is minign for my notary node.

[20-Sep-18 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont mine on notary.

[20-Sep-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Z9 MINI system version 30 Aug

There are at LEAST four (4) different firmware versions for z9 mini:
1. Sat May 26 20:42:30 CST 2018 = Antminer-Z9-Mini-201805262047-500M.tar.gz
2. Sun Aug 12 17:43:41 CST 2018 = 
3. Thu Aug 30 14:57:48 CST 2018 =
4. Fri Aug 31 17:02:59 CST 2018 = Antminer-Z9-Mini-NAND-500M-201808311812.tar.gz (the now only downloadable fw on Bitmains site for z9 mini.)

May 26 and Aug 12 firmware-versions are overclockable via chrome 30 and 31 no
If i try to OC with previous version  error tar: invalid tar magic

Damage archive?

[20-Sep-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
must be, because I used the May fw on over 3 dozen units from batch 2

just use curl to overclock your z9m, no need to mess with firmware

[20-Sep-18 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
all they did was remove the items in the select dropdown, the backend API accepts all the same OC freq's

[20-Sep-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for most people the GUI is going to be easier since the newer minis almost all are "weaker" than batch 1 and may take several tries to find "the" OC setting that works without fail

[20-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or I guess you *could*  just use some generic number and *hope*  it works 😕

[20-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i tried 600 which worked fine, 650 sounded like dead zombie horses screaming, 625 worked nice, 675 was still zombie horses, so I stayed on 625. And yes, a gui is easier, but robs you of that fun of wondering "did I just brick my z9"

[20-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol @ `robs you of that fun of wondering "did I just brick my z9"` 🤣

[20-Sep-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we're spending part of this weekend tearing every unit down and max testing each board
loads of joy fun, but in the end will stop from needing to set boards at 600 that will run fine at 675-700+ because 1 board in the unit has a "lesser" chip or 2
Hopefully, by Monday each board will be in its "optimal" range

[20-Sep-18 04:35 PM] xRobeSx#5136
that sounds like a fun project ha

[20-Sep-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ballpark guesstimate is that it'll be like adding 3-5 minis for "free"

[20-Sep-18 08:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
very interesting, never thought of that possibility. I learn a lot from this channel, just sayin'

[20-Sep-18 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The downside is that opening them is an instant warranty void, but in the grand scheme of things if they still run after a week or 2 it's fairly likely that the warranty isn't going to ever be an issue (not that they'll usually actually warranty any unit that's been running for 160 days at full overclock anyway [unless you know how to kill all of the buffer logs before you send it back])

[20-Sep-18 09:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The upside is that, at scale, it makes a value tradeoff that any 1 $850 unit that would have needed warranty is offset by higher yields

[20-Sep-18 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At scale, +10% over the life is more than worth the 2-4% loss of lifetime

[20-Sep-18 11:18 PM] bishop#9773
According to Bitmain, OCing voids the warranty anyway, not sure how they would know unless there is some sort of saved log of the frequencies

[20-Sep-18 11:24 PM] bishop#9773
...but, anyone not OCing shouldn't be mining

[21-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There are several reasons not to OC when your outfit is small enough or doing it as a hobby. I haven't looked into it with the Zs, but with the Ss one could actually underclock and get a better ROI per watt than possible with overclocking.

[21-Sep-18 02:27 AM] bishop#9773
Valid point, although I think the scaling of increased hash for additional wattage with the z9s has been pretty damn impressive. Quite surprised they didn't just factory OC them and drop one of the boards personally given that it is bitmain

[21-Sep-18 02:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seeing the first z9 get out of course mine are stuck on a plane that has mechanical failure for 2 days now 😭 .  Seen they are doing balanced and turbo,  turbo is getting like 47k at 550frequency.  Saw a video with a 650 option maybe it's part of the firmware they just released?

[21-Sep-18 07:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Youtuber said he couldn't get 650 mode to work normally ,  not sure if he's tried new firmware yet

[21-Sep-18 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can OC by using `curl` to hit the API

[21-Sep-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure there even is a "new" or "old" fw for the Z9 🤔

it's a pure marketing pyramid scheme where they call it a "FreeCO" and give out "Free money" to the first level of the pyramid so they do work to promote the coin, making the 30% the founders get valuable. They found me via LinkedIn, so they must by scammy
