and I say that as somebody that is very familiar with BTC internals

[23-Feb-19 06:35 PM] phm87#7395
I am still learning a lot

[23-Feb-19 06:37 PM] phm87#7395
In ccminer of tpruvot there is an equi folder where you can find equi-stratum.cpp in which coinb2 is filled. I think that the hashfinalsaplingroot (coming from getblocktemplate of kmd) should arrive in coinb2

[23-Feb-19 06:39 PM] phm87#7395
I used WireShark to analyse packets when mining equihash on zpool (equihash coins without sapling) and the parameter value related to coinb2 is 32 times 0. In komodo code I read sth similar: hashfinalsaplingroot wad many 0 before the sapling upgrade

[23-Feb-19 06:40 PM] phm87#7395
I should mine kmd on a kmd nomp pool and analyze packets and compare

[23-Feb-19 06:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
that fact that you need wireshark to figure out how to write the code, is telling. There is no documentation for this stuff

[23-Feb-19 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is another moat against competitors

[23-Feb-19 06:59 PM] phm87#7395
I am not a developer (professionnally) but some yiimp pool operators who are developed were able to add an algo easily by copypaste c++ of coin into stratum and ccminer. I was never able to do it (except few easy changes of existing algos such as yescrypt variants)

[23-Feb-19 06:59 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that it is sad that there is no documentation

[23-Feb-19 07:01 PM] phm87#7395
A guy made a PR into yiimp to add a poor, bad and unreliable documentation. I replied to many PR to help a bit but not this one (because there was too much to say)

[23-Feb-19 07:02 PM] phm87#7395
But to compare, I found no documentation on nomp and related miner (closed source for all kmd miners I found until now)

[23-Feb-19 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers Not sure why you'd suggest KOTO when you already have ZEC working, the ZEC bits are the exact bits that need to be duplicated/changed

[23-Feb-19 07:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might just make sense, for a few pools to come together and pay a 3rd party dev to write open source code everybody uses and maintains together. Everybody gets less technical debt, but no one mining pools pays the entire "help your competitor" fee, it's shared

[23-Feb-19 07:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
just a thought

[23-Feb-19 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I understand "this is my proprietary bits and I don't want to give it out", but not "I have the bits, but I want you to remake them on your own for me" 😕

[23-Feb-19 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
Could someone explain the benefits of yiimp over nomp

[23-Feb-19 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326

Zec mining does not work on zpool I think bc sapling is missing

[23-Feb-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
yiimp is purely C++ or?

[23-Feb-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
is that the only benefit

[23-Feb-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright aside from no npm, the code and functionality  in there is much better

[23-Feb-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
auto dump, auto payout in CoinX, etc

[23-Feb-19 07:09 PM] phm87#7395
Yiimp stratum is an old mixture of c and c++ with some memory leaks inside some algos

{Reactions}
treasure 

[23-Feb-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yiimp/yaamp has less overhead for "profit switching" than nomp as well

[23-Feb-19 07:15 PM] phm87#7395
Yiimp have many features that I did not find into nomp (coin switching, algos available and trading)

[23-Feb-19 07:16 PM] phm87#7395
It existed thansands of yiimp pools but only 30 contributors in github (whatever there are 600 forks)

[23-Feb-19 07:16 PM] phm87#7395
There is no real community to maintain yiimp. Tpruvot is nearly alone

[23-Feb-19 07:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the biggest thing being trading, the others can be ported into nomp (mostly)

[23-Feb-19 07:18 PM] phm87#7395
A guy began to adapt yiimp stratum to nomp pool to have 60 algos into nomp. But he found no help on yiimp irc. Tpruvot hate nodejs I think. I can share the repo but no idea of what work there

[23-Feb-19 07:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Zec mining does not work on zpool I think bc sapling is missing`
This is where there seems to be a communication breakdown...
When you 1st posted, I has mistakenly assumed that's the point you were at as well
If I had those bits and a working set of instructions to install yiimp **and** those bits it would take hardly any time to update it to sapling
Crackers seems to want someone to reinvent what he already has 🤷🏽

[23-Feb-19 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from something that works and can be tested, the conversion from sprout to sapling isn't that massive of a thing to do
starting from scratch is

[23-Feb-19 07:36 PM] phm87#7395
As equihash implementation on zpool is old and not maintained, maybe it can be better to run a nomp for kmd and adapt nomp to allow bitcoin addresses and make nomp fills yiimp db (for trading). Then you won t need equihash into yiimp. Honestly I think that adding nomp within yiimp is more work than adding sapling

[23-Feb-19 07:37 PM] phm87#7395
About equihash, as I suggest earlier, I think that crackers could share with you his equihash implementation to let you have rejected blocks of zec/kmd (point where I am)

[23-Feb-19 07:37 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry for the communication problems

[23-Feb-19 07:40 PM] phm87#7395
Zergpool did it: he is using nomp pool within yiimp but he share nothing as opensource. Zergpool have the other equihash variants. If you are able to do this, I am pretty sure that it is worth much more of 1000 kmd but we should ask crackers

[23-Feb-19 07:42 PM] phm87#7395
I hope that you understood that I don t want that you code the whole equihash and ZEC rpc encoding (block headers ...). And I think that koto coin is using ZEC rpc style so yiimp stock cannot mine it whatever if koto is on yescrypt (opensource algo)

[23-Feb-19 07:44 PM] phm87#7395
I will ask @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers  about sharing equihash with sapling devs and what price he would pay for the code to add nomp into yiimp. I made some small adaptations of yiimp to display nomp api data but crackers would require code for trading and graphs

[23-Feb-19 08:01 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I officially add 500 KMD to the bounty 😁

[23-Feb-19 08:06 PM] phm87#7395
I imagined that you know equihash is not opensource when you said this... I won t complain too much if bounty is increased but I want to be honest (we discussed it in private)

[23-Feb-19 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I think that crackers could share with you his equihash implementation to let you have rejected blocks of zec/kmd (point where I am)`
you have ZEC? in your pool?

[23-Feb-19 08:13 PM] phm87#7395
ZEC on testnet on a testpool

[23-Feb-19 08:14 PM] phm87#7395
2019-02-15 23:21:44: REJECTED ZEC block 417460

[23-Feb-19 08:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I imagined that you know equihash is not opensource when you said this...`
equihash is massively open sourced, the yiimp/yaamp module for inside the stratum isn't

[23-Feb-19 08:14 PM] phm87#7395
Yes

[23-Feb-19 08:14 PM] phm87#7395
It is what I meant

[23-Feb-19 08:15 PM] phm87#7395
I explained few days ago in private to @metaphilibert  that zpool equihash stratum implementation is not opemsource

[23-Feb-19 08:15 PM] phm87#7395
(Sorry a few words were missing in my sentence)

[23-Feb-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`zpool equihash stratum implementation is not opemsource`
Correct; for whatever insane reason, @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers would rather have just ZEC than share it and have a full setup

[23-Feb-19 08:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926
the Genie is very talented to spot inconsistency in communications 😁

[23-Feb-19 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with like 19 native languages around, you kinda have to be able to do that @metaphilibert (for clarity on both sides)

[23-Feb-19 08:18 PM] metaphilibert#0926
very true!

[23-Feb-19 08:19 PM] phm87#7395
As the equihash yiimp stratum code is not my property, I cannot share it nor decide anything

[23-Feb-19 08:20 PM] phm87#7395
But I will ask several times to crackers

[23-Feb-19 08:21 PM] phm87#7395
I like honest competition (and you already helped me and gave me hints. Thx)

[23-Feb-19 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd like to be of more help, but there's no upside to learning yiimp/yammp and then writing the entire module from scratch for me ☹

[23-Feb-19 08:23 PM] phm87#7395
I will share with you what I found on github (koto nomp, koto ccminer, equihash old ccminer) but I cannot decide to share with you equihash zpool stratum code (but I will ask crackers several times)

[23-Feb-19 08:25 PM] phm87#7395
(I though you were angry at me but you seems ok when I read your last msg. Thank you for your help. Sorry again for communication pbs, it is sometimes difficult to explain everything)

[23-Feb-19 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I'm not angry at anyone

[23-Feb-19 08:27 PM] phm87#7395

[23-Feb-19 10:46 PM] phm87#7395
Hey @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers  ! By community death I mean that there are less and less contributions (PR) to the main repo

[23-Feb-19 10:47 PM] phm87#7395
Compared to 2017 when AltMiner contributed, CrombieCrunch (before he changed nick to cryptopool.builder to earn money by installing yiimp) and many others

:abusedsmily:  ATTENTION KMD MINING POOL OPS: HUSH will be transitioning to a KMD asset chain, and so I want to work with any mining pool operators that are interested to add the new HUSH-as-asset-chain as a new coin to mine on their pools. This will be a Sapling-only chain, with both taddrs+zaddrs (payouts in both would be amazing!), and I suspect that it will be very simple to add HUSH to any pool that supports KMD asset chains already. DM me if you want to be kept informed. :troll_compadre:

also the A9 page now has a GRIN miner on it, amazing they make ASICs but basic website stuff confuses them: http://www.innosilicon.com/html/a9-miner/index.html

[25-Feb-19 05:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Was  this supposed to be asic resistant?

[25-Feb-19 05:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
that page is supposed to be about A9 miners, and they fucked up their webdev

[25-Feb-19 05:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
GRIN was not designed to be asic-resistant, but some stuff in grin is there to prevent GPU miners from being totally pushed out. Grin has some interesting things where you can mine it different ways

[25-Feb-19 05:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
but i am trying to buy a damn A9 miner, and the page is gone, lol

[25-Feb-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Was this supposed to be asic resistant?`
The "ASIC resistance" of equihash alone is the cost and throughput of RAM and nothing more.
The "ASIC resistance" of Komodo is 'we don't need to resist growth and technological advancements' because of intelligence, NNs, and dPoW

[25-Feb-19 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or did you mean GRIN? 😛

Blackminer F1/F1+ can support verus2.0 now. We just released the base version and the hashrate will be doubled soon. The estimated releasing time of optimized version is about in one week.

[25-Feb-19 05:04 PM] phm87#7395
Grin have 2 algos. One is asic friendly and the second asic resistant. They plan to change the asic resistant algo once per 6 months. They plan to increase the part of asic-algo blocks (around 15% now)

[25-Feb-19 05:04 PM] dukeleto#7326

@phm87 yes, it's related to the length of the Cuckoo cycle you choose in your submission, 29 or 32 iirc

[25-Feb-19 05:25 PM] phm87#7395
the algo are variants of cuckoo : cuckatoo and cuckaroo. I discussed with ppl in the Grin community who told me that cuckaroo and cuckaroo differ from cuckoo

[25-Feb-19 05:25 PM] phm87#7395
There is a yiimp fork with cuckoo27 but it is designed for a bitcoin fork (BitCash, Merit) and it cannot be used for Grin (but it can be a starting point)
