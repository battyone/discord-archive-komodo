`payFoundersReward, percentFoundersReward, maxFoundersRewardBlockHeight, foundersRewardAddressChangeInterval, vFoundersRewardAddress, percentTreasuryReward, treasuryRewardStartBlockHeight, treasuryRewardAddressChangeInterval, vTreasuryRewardAddress` and all the dumshit that goes with all of those

[25-Jul-18 03:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[25-Jul-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so how do I remove all that? or can I?

[25-Jul-18 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I disabled rewards and fees in the config

[25-Jul-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
http://rfox.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RFvopVV5Km3uiQde47vAS7yPKV4iVqARqP <-- me just now with a non-shitted stratum

[25-Jul-18 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright had it working tough.. and he said it was a straight znomp

[25-Jul-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's now just reward, it's in the template and all of the pool-stratum module

[25-Jul-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
any znomp that doesn't have all of the new shit *should* work, if new shit then likely needs edits or some random dumshit changed in config (e.g., "payFounders":"fekNo")

[25-Jul-18 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😕

[25-Jul-18 04:37 PM] jansako#3330
Looked at what you posted, this may not help but here is what I see you have different from my setup, I realize some of these are not relevant: (other assetchains)
- I do not use blocknotify
- To install Redis, I do this: sudo apt-get install redis-server (from Decker's guide) I do not run redis in a separate screen.
- Banning and website enabled
- Payment processing true (with the rest of the shebang)

[25-Jul-18 04:38 PM] jansako#3330
can't see anything obviously wrong either, except that you seem to use different packages...

[25-Jul-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so strange

[25-Jul-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The address does not need to be imported to the deamon right?

[25-Jul-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like when we mine with -pubkey?

[25-Jul-18 04:38 PM] jansako#3330
I have it in because I use the payment processing

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont care for that lol.. so I dont need it then

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] jansako#3330
like I said, I just pointed out the differences, do not know enough to say for sure that none of them a relevant

[25-Jul-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think they are, I think I have tried most of them your way also, and most changes there were suggested by @Alright

[25-Jul-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
last night.

[25-Jul-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But anything is possible.

[25-Jul-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats now 2 almost entire days down the toilet. 😦

[25-Jul-18 04:42 PM] jansako#3330
sorry about that man... I spent a couple of weeks total on this and countless VM resets until I got it just right...

[25-Jul-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah.. It seems like it should just work, but for some reason its just not...

[25-Jul-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
very strange

[25-Jul-18 04:43 PM] jansako#3330
did you test a different AC, just to make sure that s not the culprit?

[25-Jul-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did CRYPTO aswell early on.

[25-Jul-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But Decker, and Genie and Alright made a working RFOX pool

[25-Jul-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it should not be the coin

[25-Jul-18 04:44 PM] jansako#3330
I did not mean it is the coin itself, rather your particular install of the coin... but if you have already rebuilt it several times

[25-Jul-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the problem is not with the coin/daemon
the problem is that "kmd-nomp" is a fork of some random znomp and isn't actually for kmd

[25-Jul-18 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried znomp aswell and it was the exact same

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`and isn't actually for kmd`

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I rebuilt and resynced 3-4 times, on a server and once on a VPS

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright said a straight znomp would work

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if thats not the case, what oe should i be using

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[25-Jul-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's 394 flavors of znomp

[25-Jul-18 04:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jansako What exact git repo did you use?

[25-Jul-18 04:50 PM] jansako#3330

[25-Jul-18 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try it again in the morning 1am again.. Losing too much sleep over this as it is.

[25-Jul-18 04:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks for all the help btw 😄

😫 

[25-Jul-18 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK
so, specifically, the issue lies in the ported in modules and the fact that `bitcoinjs-lib-zcash` has overwinter shit in it now

[25-Jul-18 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you roll back `bitcoinjs-lib-zcash` 2 commits and take all of the ZEC shit out, kmd-nomp works as expected

@ComputerGenie that you sure do seem to be spending time maintaining znomp

[25-Jul-18 05:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for all your hard and free work

[25-Jul-18 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
heh, I've never even done 1 public fork of it yet

[25-Jul-18 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yet

[26-Jul-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With deckers post in #postest64 I might be able to do it. Now that I know what part to look for. I had a quick look last night but had no idea where to start.

[26-Jul-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Decker fixed it 😄

[26-Jul-18 02:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
decker's fix is merged into kmd-nomp. thanks guys

[26-Jul-18 03:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I setup a new Komodo Mining Pool at http://pool.komodo.services/  

It also includes all of the assetchains as well.  Mind you most assetchain block rewards are .0001 but this could still be useful for some people

{Reactions}
👍 

[26-Jul-18 03:32 PM] xRobeSx#5136
It will also be useful for PoW assetchains. If anyone creates one and would like it added, just let me know

[26-Jul-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@xRobeSx does the pool support Z9 minis? I need a failover

[26-Jul-18 03:44 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, its exactly what I'm using at home for my z9

I ain't letting you (in)to mine!  😃

[26-Jul-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
That's OK, @jansako, I didn't want to share my blocks with you anyway 😛

[26-Jul-18 06:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Someone’s actually using the site for DEX 😊

[26-Jul-18 06:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
2 blocks found 👍 the pool is working!

[26-Jul-18 06:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Whoever it is, will you dm me. I wanna restart the pool once more but don’t wanna interrupt your mining right now ha

[26-Jul-18 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's alpha, but Knomp-solo exists 🙂

[26-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
That's going to fork all of the asset chains between master and dev branch @xRobeSx

[26-Jul-18 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
having multiple vouts in the coinbase of an asset chain is possible on dev branch but not master I believe

[26-Jul-18 09:19 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Every chain is on dev

[26-Jul-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's a "master" branch? 🤔

trollface (2) 

[26-Jul-18 09:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea.. whoops. I can turn it off if need be for now. But ideally I’d like to keep it up

[26-Jul-18 09:46 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
turned of my rigs.. too damn hot!!

[26-Jul-18 09:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Pool is off for now. Lmk when I can turn it on again @Alright

[26-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
could keep running the DEX pool for now if you want

[26-Jul-18 11:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey @Alright 😘

[27-Jul-18 12:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@Alright my Notary Node is on the same block as my pool

[27-Jul-18 12:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
So if that chain is “forked” I’m sure notaries are too

[27-Jul-18 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
No, that's the real chain

[27-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
master branch is on a different chain

[27-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
master is at "longestchain": 274321,

[27-Jul-18 12:09 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Okay. So can the other assets stay on dev branch too?

[27-Jul-18 12:10 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I have to run them all on dev or master

[27-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
if you mine blocks that have multiple vouts in the coinbase on any chain right now, it will fork between nodes that are on dev and master

[27-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
I think the extra vout is coming from the pool fee

[27-Jul-18 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
if you were to turn that off for now, it'd be fine (I think)

[27-Jul-18 12:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Well what I’m saying is master going to be updated to dev rules? So that I can keep them all running on dev. I’ll just leave it off til I know I’m safe. Idk why pool fee would cause that because it’s not sending to the fee address til the payout block which is way after mining it

[27-Jul-18 12:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Strange

[27-Jul-18 12:13 AM] Alright#0419
it claims the pool fee in the coinbase tx

[27-Jul-18 12:14 AM] Alright#0419
master should be updated when someone who has access to the repo is available

[27-Jul-18 12:15 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I gottcha. Sounds good I’ll leave it off for now so no other chain ends up forked

[27-Jul-18 12:18 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Let me know when I’m good to go @Alright thanks

[27-Jul-18 12:23 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I’m too lazy to change all 28 configs to false except for KMD and DEX 😊

[27-Jul-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
could just move the pool_config files to another dir

[27-Jul-18 07:04 AM] jansako#3330
@Alright I have an asset pool/stratum (private) running for a couple of weeks (pretty sure it was from master).  I do not use pool rewards, do I need to restart & update? Would hate to fork them inadvertently...

[27-Jul-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you just use latest dev, you wont have any problems I dont think... but if not using rewards it should not matter
