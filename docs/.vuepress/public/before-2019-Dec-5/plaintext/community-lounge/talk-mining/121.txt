'specific variant for ASICs'
that's the same label I'd change my widget to if I wanted to sell the same product to a niche market üòõ

so, they are same as mineral oil?

I think I‚Äôm going to get a couple of the middle tier ones

[27-Apr-19 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
not sure there's more than a nominal difference (other than space) between the 500 and the 1800
in fact, at 1st glance, per watt the 500 looks a touch better

[27-Apr-19 02:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
3 500 cheaper than 1 1800 too

[27-Apr-19 02:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I didn‚Äôt throw in shipping

[27-Apr-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
and about 100 watts less

[27-Apr-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I didn't count shipping either, just ballpark math

[27-Apr-19 02:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The one additional thing that‚Äôs on the site and not on the flyer is a mystery ROI feature.

With the price these things will stabilize at hope they give us a two-fer üòÅ

The obelisk grin miners only will do cuck31+ this one has some future proof to it

[27-Apr-19 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
@SHossain are you setting up a rad and a pump or just dunking them in? Was considering it myself

[27-Apr-19 10:09 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes, I'll setup a radiator and pump as well to keep the liquid flowing

[27-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Alright#0419
CG convinced me not to do it. "Will you make back the money?" was his argument

[27-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
I priced it out to like $150 to do it for a mini and a z9

[27-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Alright#0419
don't think I'd make that back unless it significantly reduced power draw

[27-Apr-19 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
my main motivation was to keep CHIPS mining going on while the miners runs quiet. in a crowded neighbourhood the noise  is really loud i feel. not looking forward to get the money back.

[27-Apr-19 10:39 AM] SHossain#0007
in summer everyone will keep their windows and doors open and when they do it the noise is kinda bothering. no neighbour complained yet. but, this will help not to get complains.

[27-Apr-19 10:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How close are your houses if your neighbours can hear your miners üòõ

[27-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
When you set it up, I'd be curious to know if it reduces power draw

[27-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
and by how much

[27-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
going to remove the heat sinks as well?

[27-Apr-19 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
@NutellaLicka London is a congested area.
@Alright i dont think power draw will dramatically change as i'm not going to remove fans for now (unless i get fan spoofer). my plan is just dunk it up.

[27-Apr-19 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
that video you linked to, dude says it reduces power draw

[27-Apr-19 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
although he's a salesman so....

[27-Apr-19 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
what is fan spoofer?

[27-Apr-19 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
he may be right if you remove the fans. fan requires some power

[27-Apr-19 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
antminers wont start if the mainboard doesn't detect their high-quality(!) fans. there are some circuit boards which you can plug-in into fan slot, remore the fans and the mainboard will think fan is there and the miner will run without spitting error

[27-Apr-19 11:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
@SHossain i've seen a cool trick a dude pulled with his s9's dumped in liquid - mount the fans in reverse and put the speed to 5%-10%

[27-Apr-19 11:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
that way it pulls cool liquid through the asic as well

@CHMEX

[30-Apr-19 11:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
looks like something is not setup corretly on your local installation

[30-Apr-19 11:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
hmm

[30-Apr-19 11:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
jsut did a fresh build of komodo

[30-Apr-19 11:08 AM] That_Guy8#4893
then testing

[30-Apr-19 11:09 AM] That_Guy8#4893
did the ```./komodod -ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146```

[30-Apr-19 11:09 AM] That_Guy8#4893
and in a new window ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=RFOX getinfo```

[30-Apr-19 11:09 AM] CHMEX#0686
that looks correct yes

[30-Apr-19 11:19 AM] That_Guy8#4893
hmm maybe ill get out of WSL and only a proper linux machine xD

[30-Apr-19 11:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@That_Guy8 restart

[30-Apr-19 11:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you change config file setting, like user/pass, they don't apply until a restart

[30-Apr-19 11:48 AM] That_Guy8#4893
yeah was restarting / removing the .komodo/RFOX folder

[30-Apr-19 11:48 AM] That_Guy8#4893
was very strange

[30-Apr-19 11:48 AM] That_Guy8#4893
just finished building on a VPS and started no worries

[30-Apr-19 11:48 AM] That_Guy8#4893
assume it was WSL causing the issue

Like 12 hrs left on the Innosilicon grin miner deal, anyone else get in on it?

[01-May-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog i haven't done the hard math on why i would want a grin asic instead of an fpga

[01-May-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
but one cool thing I see is that the grin asic can do various cuckoo variants, I think, so it's a "flexible asic", not totally hardcoded to one exact pow algo

[01-May-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
the cuckoo variants may be done in firmware, not hardware, haven't looked into it much

[01-May-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog an F1+ seems like the more flexible HW, haven't looked at current breakeven numbers, as they are very fuzzy and hard to estimate

[01-May-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty happy with my F1

[01-May-19 02:21 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
can I get some feedback on real world avg power consumption of the z11 at stock speeds.
The hosting facility I'm using is saying the power consumption is around 1510-1530 on average and that just sounds awfully high at stock speeds.

[01-May-19 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@LoPhatMelk that number will depend on 110v vs 220v

[01-May-19 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
and are you talking about at the miner, or at the wall? The hosting facility is taking into account efficiency loss of the PSU, it sounds like

[01-May-19 03:25 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@dukeleto I'm assuming at the wall.

[01-May-19 03:26 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
and it would be 220v

[01-May-19 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't have the details, just pointing that out. Ain't got the funds to buy expensive Z11's üòÉ

@LoPhatMelk  that‚Äôs about right spec sheet says like 1480 with 10% variance

[01-May-19 04:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto   They had a crazy deal,  preorder price nearly half the actual price , some mystery ROI feature , PSU included , 3 more months of warranty, multi-algo like you mentioned, starts shipping 2 months before Obelisk and a refund if they don‚Äôt make their target.  Obelisk only manufactured 2500ish machines and they are only good for cuck31+ , April 2020 grin switches to cuck32+ which inno has built in already so a little bit of future proof .    I am looking at getting some FPGAs , A few Blackminers for Verus and this other one I found for Equihash(n,k) , especially since it looks like that will be an additional assetchain parameter soon.     After that should complete my downsizing build out

[01-May-19 05:09 PM] LoPhatMelk#9055
@polycryptoblog  "Reference power on wall, Watt  1418" Where are you seeing the 1480 -/+10%?

[01-May-19 05:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1418 sorry not 1480,  on the spec sheet  they posted . Typical condition: (typical power) = (min power)/90%, leave power output margin for PSU.   Wall power will always be a bit more than machine consumption

[01-May-19 05:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just saying the consumption is still in the ballpark of what it‚Äôs supposed to be

[01-May-19 07:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog ac_nk has been merged to some KMD branches, I don't think it's in dev yet

[01-May-19 07:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog may I ask which fpga for equihash(n,k) ?

[01-May-19 07:49 PM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto  I love your work ... do we have some assetchains using it yet ?

[01-May-19 07:49 PM] phm87#7395
@Ondalf  this may interest you

[01-May-19 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 still working on upgrading everything to sapling, then ARRR and any AC's with zaddrs will be able to do hushlisty things. the goal is that it's a protocol any compatible chain can use

I though it was n k parameters as ac params for future/new assetchains. I will read more about hush, it is in my todo list. I hope that every altcoin with custom n k pers will be able to become an assetchain

[01-May-19 08:15 PM] Ondalf#1318
@phm87 nope. it doesn't interest me. although it might change in future. i'm more worried about the coinbase tx entries of the new coins, which have been completely unnatural and off standards...
