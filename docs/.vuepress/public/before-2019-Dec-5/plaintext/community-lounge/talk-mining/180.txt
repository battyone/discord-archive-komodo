Ccminer or ewbf.
But only asic can make profit. All gpus will make a loss mining equihash

`All gpus will make a loss mining equihash` not if the difficutly is 1 :troll:

[01-Oct-19 11:21 AM] phm87#7395
@Oszy yes but price also matter. If price is 0 and diff 1, I am not sure you will do profit
But maybe it was a joke ^^

Has anyone had their minis can stop responding altogether after a clean? I've tried adjusting all of the connections and restarting a bunch of times with no luck

[20-Oct-19 01:55 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
I was making 1200 labs a day is there anyway I can make that again?

[20-Oct-19 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@kevinkatovic yes, you can buy more mining equipment

[20-Oct-19 08:26 AM] Oszy#5734
you may not be aware of that, if more miners are mining the SAME coin the less YOU will get. This is how it works, and when you feel you are not making enough to make profit or break even, you move on to another coin, this is called profit switching.

@Oszy oh, he's been told and should be well aware by now of the mechanics behind hashrate/nethash/diff. Was a huge wall of text from all the back and forth in the LABS channel

[20-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Oszy#5734
Been there seen that

[20-Oct-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
21.26% of the hashrate will yield you an average of 21.26% of the minable coins
because, math

[20-Oct-19 03:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
average! thats BS. what if I only get 21.25% ? math lies!

Does aPoW mining work for any smartchain (including z address capable smartchains)?

[22-Oct-19 10:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, is it production ready?

[22-Oct-19 10:10 AM] phm87#7395
CFEKAPOW on kmdlabs have apow I think.
My firsts tests on chips to add apow were successfull. I need to test several times the hard fork.

To mining kmd

[03-Nov-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you have any equihash mining experience (200,9 like zcash, ZEN, HUSH, BTCP) then it's the same, just with a different pool than CoinX

[03-Nov-19 11:47 AM] Artist#0765
No experience

[03-Nov-19 11:47 AM] Artist#0765
Unfortunately

[03-Nov-19 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To get any sort of useful profit mining KMD, you'll need an ASIC miner because of the high difficulty
You can *try* GPU mining. I'd suggest using <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1707546.0> (Version 0.3.4b) and <https://luckpool.net/komodo/connect.html>

[03-Nov-19 04:45 PM] AkiraX#8269
or just mine any coin

[03-Nov-19 04:45 PM] AkiraX#8269
sell it

[03-Nov-19 04:45 PM] AkiraX#8269

[06-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Mark81#4505
Maybe stupid question but why equihash coins need stratum pool setup when mining solo with GPU and ASICs? If i understand that bitcoin combatible coins can mine directly to Qt-client port but why this is not possible with equihash?

[06-Nov-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the political answer: because CPU mining and "external" mining are not the same thing
the apolitical answer: because Bitcoin Core and slush (the creator of "stratum") have a close relationship and getwork was removed from Core (and thus all forks of it) to benefit the existence of pools and the revenue of the original pool ops (like slush)

[06-Nov-19 05:49 PM] Mark81#4505
So it is not possible mine anymore with any modern fork of bitcoin? Thanks CG!

[06-Nov-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
correct, you could recode your daemon and miner to use getwork again, but it requires deep knowledge of both the daemon code and cgminer code

[06-Nov-19 05:51 PM] Mark81#4505
Has anyone builded yet easy to set up solo pool software?

[06-Nov-19 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I've only ever tested it on physical machines and vmware vms, but it "should" work on that

Dear miner using address ``RLfaQRv***********************GbDjf`` to mine on UniMining.net pool
You are mining equihash on port 2143 with c=COMMOD but it is the port to mine KOMODO and not COMMOD!
If you want to mine COMMOD, please use port 2146 instead
Thank you

@spotlessmind ASIC best to use to mine KMD

specifically Z11 or A9++

[19-Nov-19 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as "best" to use

[19-Nov-19 10:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Although mining ARRR is more profitable to mine with ASIC I believe

`Although mining ARRR is more profitable to mine with ASIC I believe`
I haven't done the math in a while, but that's generally true over KMD

Quick question anyone have access to the stratum changes needed in yiimp's client.cpp to enable asicboost for pools? If you have this please share, I know a few yiimp pools have this working already just no one on the internet willing to share for some reason very hush hush. I am attemping a ton of various things to code it in, hopefully will get it working and let the secret out in this lifetime yet. 😋

[20-Nov-19 03:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@phm87 is the only yiimp pool operator I know

[20-Nov-19 09:08 AM] phm87#7395

get paid double and invent asicboost for equihash

I have the needed asicboost code in PHP just need to convert to C++

[20-Nov-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm aware, was more pointing to the fact that it has nothing to do with anything and one cannot get folks around here to share code that is on-topic, much less the ask
