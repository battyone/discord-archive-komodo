Luckpool .net and .org have different ui.  .net looks like updated by messages on screen.  Was lazily looking for a hush pool.  Cool, jeezy then likes pixel art graphic style and retro-ness 😃

[30-Dec-18 12:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
.org is the older infra and .net is the new

40 m/sols

[30-Dec-18 06:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it was 27 for the longest

whelp nvm i understand

[30-Dec-18 06:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It's creeped up into profitability, because it's apparently one of the most resilient equihash coins in this bear market

less than 10Msols

[30-Dec-18 07:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
why is everywhere reading 40 😮

[30-Dec-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe diff instead of Msols?

Komodo Mining Pool
Komodo mining pool is a mining pool for mining Komodo (KMD), the first komodo pool and best on web. On komodominingpool.com you can mine with your CPUs and GPUs.

It's definitely not the difficulty

the conversion of diff to sols is different for KMD than for standard zcash coins

Btw...I mined at kmd.solopool.com and the site went down and 3 immature blocks disappeared after I mined for  day...site came back up 2 hours later...blocks show confirmed and not paid.  Miners beware

[31-Dec-18 05:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
JL, what is the diff to sol/s calc if it is different?

[31-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Portypete#5024
ive been at the top at supnova for months now... 2 others there are put up some high hash powers.

[31-Dec-18 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

```The objective is a "light-weight" pool that does what needs to be done.```😎

[01-Jan-19 05:07 PM] $tefano.#3560
with many kmd solo mining pool I think that is it is no longer necessary to maintain pool open. 
4.48 MSol/s hashrate from know pool against 33.88 MSol/s of solo hidden pools

[01-Jan-19 05:07 PM] $tefano.#3560
i want evaluate if it's better to shutdown pool

[01-Jan-19 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, both are needed
I think that anyone that can solo should, but anyone that feels they benefit from a group pool should do that too

[01-Jan-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as a side note: I'm OK with it if chickenpool becomes the only public KMD pool there is in 2019 :trollface:

[01-Jan-19 09:07 PM] $tefano.#3560
keep public pool open requires more work and more money compared to a simple localhost PC 😄

[01-Jan-19 09:08 PM] $tefano.#3560
both are needed but solo is better 😄

[01-Jan-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll always have mixed emotions/beliefs about solo vs public, but other than the pool fee they are kinda moot for KMD itself

[01-Jan-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more solo = more nodes being still true, though

[01-Jan-19 09:29 PM] $tefano.#3560
keep more solo ( or future masternodes? ) could be better for stability against public pool, global hashrate is the demonstration. 10% of hashrate of 10 know pools against 90% of hidden pools( how many?)

[01-Jan-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I'm firmly against masternodes

[01-Jan-19 09:30 PM] $tefano.#3560
me too

[01-Jan-19 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not too hard (although it is CPU intensive) to make an educated guess about how many solos there are

[02-Jan-19 06:14 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Urakawa you will have to do your own research on this. But I imagine on average, all pools will give the best rewards (not taking into account pool fees). And stability isnt something that is tracked per se.

Congratulations to all the winners on the https://minethechains.com/#CompetitionResults Christmas Mining Competition. 
Winners, please contact @NutellaLicka a on the Pirate Discord if you'd like it !arrrtip to you directly(you will need to prove it is your address by setting a miner.name to a word of my choosing), otherwise I will be sending these addresses the ARRR on the 7th of January via an !arrrtip withdrawal in the #mining channel! We appreciate your use of the pool and would love to hear your thoughts on pool improvements.

hi guys, I'm very sorry about this news but it's time to shutdown my pool.😔 
Costs to maintain pool up ( 5 dedicated servers) it's more expensive. 
I supported Komodo project since start with my pool but keep it open for 30 miners it has become unsustainable.
Shutdown planned on 4th ( tomorrow morning ) at 11:00 AM  - CET
Thanks to all those who supported the pool and komodo developers for this big project 
✌ Enjoy

@SHossain I had it running there and still using it here working on pool stuff for PIRATE; much easier to hit a GPU block than a 95M sols chain block 😛

[03-Jan-19 02:11 PM] SHossain#0007

BEAM mining started, and they integrated GPU mining directly into their full node

[03-Jan-19 07:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are using equihash (150,5) and Zcash is thinking of adopting that as their new PoW that will be phased in

what RPC calls do explorers use to get the coinbase amount generated per block?

[05-Jan-19 10:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
What they want to do just honestly seems stupid. They are trying to make some kind of hierarchy of mining like GPUs/FPGA's are pure bloods and ASIC's are lower class citizens. When they are both doing the same job just one of them is specifically designed for it.

[05-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka there is `getblocksubsidy`, but I'm not sure if that's what they use

[05-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
They are likely just using the block template?

[05-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Alright#0419
Ah read that as pools instead of explorers for some reason

[05-Jan-19 10:48 PM] Alright#0419
if you're talking about where insight says "Block Reward", I believe that's a static value set it a config file somewhere

[05-Jan-19 11:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay, I guess I am wondering about the transaction amount (cb) that is the first transaction to every block.

[05-Jan-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
it's reading the data from chain?

[05-Jan-19 11:34 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I didn't know if there was a single RPC call. But I guess it's tx 0 in the block aha
