`63A per household`
you sure that's right? If so, I'm never moving there

[09-Sep-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon fyi, 100amp and 200amp service is most common in the US

[09-Sep-19 01:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and how much volts?

[09-Sep-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
_has dual-200s_

[09-Sep-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
my place is weird in that it has 150amp. I also have metal "Bell System" signs from the 1950's 游뗵

` I also have metal "Bell System" signs from the 1950's`
fuses are soooooo fun

[09-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
more amps with lower volts can have the same outcome as higher volts lower amps no?

[09-Sep-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon voltage depends on when you go from breaker to outlet, you can use whatever, but default is 110/120v and our washer/dryer machines use 220v/240v

[09-Sep-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
most US houses have both

[09-Sep-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
but only washer/dryer use 220v

[09-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
been a while since I had electrical engineering

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
63Amps is very little

that is what CG and I are getting at

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
my steem oven uses threefase

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is what 380 volts?

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
BUT, I guess I am thinking about usage at 120v. At 220v, everything uses half the amperage

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah thats what I am getting at

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at 380v ...

[09-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you have higher volts you dont need 100 amps

[09-Sep-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
An A9 will use 6amps at 120v but only 3amps at 240v

[09-Sep-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon depends how much you want to mine 游땔

[09-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[09-Sep-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can't get enough amperage

40 minutes into the conversation he mentions that it's 3 phase 游뱑游낗

[09-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I said I have 400V

[09-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how do you think you are getting that inside the house over two fase? 游땏

[09-Sep-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I have 440 in and it's still only 2 phase
in the US, 3 phase is usually only coming in with commercial applications

[09-Sep-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`how do you think you are getting that inside the house over two fase? `
because the incoming is controlled by the transformer

[09-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm guess its a western europe <> us thing where you have a 240<>110V standard

[09-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
with the amps to match each voltage

[09-Sep-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think 3phase is only used in industrial stuff in the US

[09-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
total outcome will prob be about the same

[09-Sep-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
can get here np in house too

[09-Sep-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
the per installation amps limit in the US is mostly due to the transformer construction

[09-Sep-19 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least in built up areas... want it on a farm and you need some serious $$$

[09-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
for household stuff most people dont need three fase though, I think only when you have heavy load heat pumps or maybe like battery chargers for EV cars

initial costs don't make it profitable, for small miners

[09-Sep-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
but the bigger you get, the better idea it is, depending on cooling issues

you don't get to choose your best mining locations, you just make due. Unless you got lots a skrill

mostly former soviet cities but still :p

[09-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I need a heat pump because due to external reasons, an AC is needed in the hottest parts of summer to prevent overheating. If I could use a heat pump, my bills would be much less

[09-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
That is what I meant by a heat pump

[09-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's more expensive, but runs in both directions (AC or heater) and is much more efficient

there's no way to use what duke and I are talking about over distances without temp drop that would make it all but about useless

the drier it is .. the better they work

@dukeleto an evap basically works like an ac, but both sides of the air are in the same space

[09-Sep-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it "drains away" the condensation

[09-Sep-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
basically it's like running the air going out over both the hot and cold sides of the fins

[09-Sep-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
so the temp remains close to the same

[09-Sep-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what joker's talking about sounds more like a "swap cooler"

household heatpumps take warmer air from outside to warm floor heating or whatever at a more than 100% efficiency rate

[09-Sep-19 02:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or extract warmth from inside the house to cool it off etc

[09-Sep-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
most AC units are heat pumps nowadays I believe?

[09-Sep-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`household heatpumps take warmer air from outside to warm floor heating or whatever at a more than 100% efficiency rate`
they do exactly not that, unless they are "geothermal"/"ground-source"
a household "heat pump" is nothing more than an AC unit with a "reversing valve" that constricts the gas flow and forces it in the opposite direction

[09-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ehm you can have air -> water heat pumps?

combined with solar cells you pretty much have free heating

efficiency is much less with temps below +-5춿C
