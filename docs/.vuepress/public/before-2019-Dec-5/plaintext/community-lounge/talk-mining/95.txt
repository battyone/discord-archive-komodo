Is AMD trolling all of us by calling GPU mining "openCL content creation" :trollface:

This new gen of radeon should have an enthusiast version as flagship opposed to the last release of vega.

[09-Jan-19 11:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, but the simplicity of clicking and double clicking things really isnt there more often than not you have to command prompt to the folder and run it sudo like.

I tried both ways for gaming in linux

[10-Jan-19 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In the end I had to pass through GPU to win10... While this is 100x better than having to reboot, and also means that with a good enough computer you can run Linux VMS for other things and games at the same time, it also means u need 2 GPUs. My vega64 is not avalibe in Linux it only works when I boot the windows VM. 
Some games work natively, but I can't play them because my GPU is disabled on Linux... I guess a better way is using a Vega for Linux and a 1080ti for the windows VM, but it all gets very expensive hardware wise to set up.

PoS64 is just about perfected I think... that works at any % ... well thre are some cases it doesnt work at the right % ..... Shouldnt really happen in real world though.

[10-Jan-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not 100% sure it works with Verus Hash though.

I'll have to test it. I believe either joker or Mike told me it was dependent on equihash

This paper from 2017 seems to say that Zcash did not pick the (n,k) = (200,9) optimally, that with a new technique called "index pointers", the running-time becomes independent of k, if I understand correctly: http://sci-hub.tw/10.1145/3140649.3140652#

[11-Jan-19 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is almost 100% why BEAM chose (150,5) and why Zcash is following them, mostly because "BEAM did it"

[11-Jan-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
the paper also slaps the hand of Equihash, basically saying it assumes it's built on the strength of a well-known math problem, but because they slightly modified things, it's actually not. It could be in a much simpler "complexity class"

[11-Jan-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
now there are appliance ASIC for it along with nicehash, it seems a decent enough PoW

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c they "pay their respects" in the article, say that it is a good PoW for many applications

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
it could be that in the future, a very large speedup is found for Equihash, is what I take away from reading it

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
Equihash told everybody "we rely on the hardness of the generalized birthday problem", but that is wrong

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you can't assume all the math that studied that

[11-Jan-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
nobody knows how "easy" equihash might be found to be

[11-Jan-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless, NN will get 75% of blocks, even if hashrate goes up 100x overnight

[11-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not too worried, this is theoretical

[11-Jan-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
big O() notation doesn't take into account constants that we, in reality, care about

[11-Jan-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be that people will prove that this new stuff, that equihash is based on, is as "hard" as the generalized birthday problem. But nobody has yet. Math people care about that stuff üòÉ

[11-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
the paper is from Nov 2017, so it's not anything new. But Daira mentioned it, when deciding on new (N,K) params, and I found it interesting
