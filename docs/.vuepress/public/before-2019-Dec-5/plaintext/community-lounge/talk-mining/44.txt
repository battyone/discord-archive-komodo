If you want to make money, take a second ,read my above post, and choose an option, or give up

hoping between pools will hurt you

[18-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
patience

[18-Sep-18 07:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
any pool will find blocks fast if you have as much hash as you claim

[18-Sep-18 07:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
even if you mined on my pool, you would still get the majority of the block reward if you have more than 2 mini's

[18-Sep-18 07:08 PM] Resistor#1215
not anymore i destroyed 4 minis today.

[18-Sep-18 07:08 PM] Resistor#1215
i'm about sick of this. it's all manipulated

[18-Sep-18 07:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
literally nothing is manipulated

[18-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Resistor#1215
not how i'm seeing it. everything s linux  this or pool doesn't connect, or miner is shit and hashboards go to 0, then can't overclock, out of warranty if you do, then pools disconnect, or no blocks found.. it's highly manipulated.. nicehash is horrible

[18-Sep-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how come you can't solo mine with windows. .why doesn't developer make exe file and solo mine?`
Because devs have better shit to do than to make a secure project designed for an insecure OS

[18-Sep-18 07:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
No pools should disconnect if you connect properly

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Resistor#1215
everyone uses windows. any os is insecure.

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Resistor#1215
linux even worse.

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] xRobeSx#5136
great use windows, there's no issue there. Its just unreasonable to expect to run a pool on windows

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`can't overclock, out of warranty if you do`
Something you already knew **before** you purchased them

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] xRobeSx#5136
just don't solo mine then

[18-Sep-18 07:10 PM] Resistor#1215
so how do i use windows?

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
or use the damn solo mining pool thats been posted 3 times

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Resistor#1215
no

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Alright#0419
use a linux VM on windows or linux subsystem

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`everyone uses windows`
I can assure you, not everyone 😉

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Resistor#1215
came with the package

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
our job isn't to teach you how to use windows

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Resistor#1215
please don't talk to me.. you're so arrogant and annoying as hell.

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Resistor#1215
i know how to use windows i don'tknow how to solo mine on windows

[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Alright#0419

hah to run a stratum

[18-Sep-18 07:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
as I said before. You really shouldn't be trying to solo mine by using a stratum pool on windows. If you can't build it and maintain it, then you should probably just go to a pool anyway. Hosting a pool isn't for consumer windows users, as you've tried to say.

[18-Sep-18 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Resistor I've been told that you factually have 10x the amount of equipment that I do, so I have to ask: Why in the hell are you **giving away** $50k per year mining in public pools?

[18-Sep-18 07:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
You guys shouldn't have even told him about solo mining

[18-Sep-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[18-Sep-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
why should he have to spend $20/mo on unix VPS, just to make $50K more per year?

[18-Sep-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
everything should work on windows

[18-Sep-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810

who needs a vps? my pool runs on a 8 yr old HP Slimline that has a value of less than $100

[18-Sep-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but you have to setup a LAN

[18-Sep-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems more complex than running unix

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so another $250

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$350 < $50k

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and will the network autoconfigure itself for windows?

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it should just automatically work

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
in all cases

[18-Sep-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
on windows

[18-Sep-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Most any nodejs pool will work on Winduhs, you just have to commandline it just like in nix

[18-Sep-18 07:18 PM] xRobeSx#5136
it probably would run on windows fine if you install `npm` and all the dependencies. We just don't have instructions for it

[18-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
I regret sticking my neck out for this guy, let's not waste anymore time if he continues to refuse to learn

`a mining pool on every computer`
Jokes and sarcasm aside, I'm highly in favor of that idea

[18-Sep-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
I was asked about a blockchain that had a built in mining pool

[18-Sep-18 07:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In my delusion, everyone goes back to running their own node and aiding decentralization

[18-Sep-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for a chain with a lot of tx, it seems it can work

[18-Sep-18 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I was asked about a blockchain that had a built in mining pool`
ummm
`setgenerate true -1`?

[18-Sep-18 07:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
it would be cool to have version for window and mac for end users to run, but it seems a bit ridiculous to just expect it

[18-Sep-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
no, I mean a fully decentralized mining pool, where the chain itself ran the pool

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I guess the shares counts could be put into something like KV vs putting it into mongodb

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
there probably isnt even a windows mining pool software for bitcoin

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
my idea is that instead of shares, there are different diff you can solve for

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
easier diffs make smaller blocks

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I for one would be happy if you had nothing better to do than to recode the daemon for each new piece of equipment
or we could always just go back to `getwork` and avoid the need for stratums altogether

[18-Sep-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but this requires transactions to work, or you end up with lots of empty smallblocks

[18-Sep-18 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but this requires transactions to work, or you end up with lots of empty smallblocks`
How's that any different than what we're doing on assetchains now?

[18-Sep-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
If diff range of 100x is allowed, there can be a small block at 1% the diff

[18-Sep-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
or 100x small blocks for the normal difficulty full block

[18-Sep-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
solve 100x easier diff, you get 1% the block reward

[18-Sep-18 07:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

assuming there is a dealer that will fund the leveraged trading and a gateways operator that creates a CHIPS gateway

if you want run a pool on windows this is your code 

@echo off
shutdown.exe /s /t 00
 
put this on system startup and wait to see if stratum get new works
