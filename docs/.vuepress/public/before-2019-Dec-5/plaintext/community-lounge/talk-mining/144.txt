diff 1.7

[03-Aug-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to find a boosted block

[03-Aug-19 10:06 PM] zawy#5864
I can use the sum of last 6 values to adjust the tipdiff aggressiveness ......this way it will not shut on and off as much, and replace the sum of 3

seems to come in triplets

[03-Aug-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
still 3 minutes for 4 blocks is pretty good

[03-Aug-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is more like 2 minutes, so still double the rate

[03-Aug-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
diff only 2.11

[03-Aug-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
22 blocks in 10 minuts

[03-Aug-19 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and the diff is still only 2, so we slow it down but not enough and the diff isnt rising very fast at all

[03-Aug-19 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
ASIC wont behave this way

[03-Aug-19 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is just the 15x attack it is weak against

[03-Aug-19 10:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zawy in your equation, T is a constant, so I just defined a new variable u=t/T, with du=dt/T

[03-Aug-19 10:17 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[03-Aug-19 10:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
differentiated both sides, and then solved the simple DE that came out

[03-Aug-19 10:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
the solution has 2 constants that can be tweaked to get different behavior. Is 3^(-x) being used now?

[03-Aug-19 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i need to call it a day, but we made fantastic progress. it seems this extra emission problem is solvable if we can just make it easier for the higher hash rate to solve, or maybe just boost it a bit regardless if these triggers are happening. maybe at least a certain amount that would compound quickly should just be added to the diff and not decay totally away with tipdiff

[03-Aug-19 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and the good new is that simple 15 core CPU mining duplicates the bug

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-Aug-19 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
currently the solve times are slowed down, but that slows down the diff growth, even as the hashrate is constant and at 15x starting levels

[03-Aug-19 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be as simple as just boosting the diff 10% each time tipdiff is triggered? not sure if that is fast enough, but to compensate for the slowdown due to tipdiff

[03-Aug-19 10:23 PM] zawy#5864
hmmmm

[03-Aug-19 10:24 PM] zawy#5864
The miner's avg difficulty is higher than the DA realizes because we only store the final difficulty

[03-Aug-19 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if there was a way to store the actual difficulty

[03-Aug-19 10:25 PM] jl777c#5810
without breaking all sorts of backward compatibility

[03-Aug-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can interpret the onchain diff as lower than it is if we know it is being boosted

[03-Aug-19 10:27 PM] zawy#5864
@dukeleto  he's using 3^(t/T - 7) to lower really high difficulties that are delayed > 7T

[03-Aug-19 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but not sure how to keep it straight when it is the real diff vs inflated/deflated diff

[03-Aug-19 10:28 PM] zawy#5864
Maybe we store the actual avg difficulty on chain

[03-Aug-19 10:29 PM] zawy#5864
That brings up the harder non-linear question of what difficulty to assign the drops....and why the drops are not having a similar problem

[03-Aug-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is because tipdiff only allows a few chances to solve it before it changes

[03-Aug-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is only a CPU mining issue and ASIC will work much better

[03-Aug-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so @SHossain when he gets back should test with ASIC to see how many easy blocks it gets

[03-Aug-19 10:30 PM] zawy#5864
OK, I'm about to go exercise

[03-Aug-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will look forward to the ZAWY14 ASIC test results and some more magic math 😃

[03-Aug-19 10:31 PM] SHossain#0007
are we on ZAWY14?

[03-Aug-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[03-Aug-19 10:31 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. updating and starting

[03-Aug-19 10:32 PM] dukeleto#7326

[03-Aug-19 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
Z9 mini started. blocks should be coming in soon

[03-Aug-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
and, there it goes

[03-Aug-19 10:37 PM] jl777c#5810
what block did it start at?

[03-Aug-19 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
block 96

[03-Aug-19 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
stuck on 99

[03-Aug-19 10:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i think every third block it will get stuck, we at least are able to delay

[03-Aug-19 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry 97

[03-Aug-19 10:39 PM] SHossain#0007

blocks are very slow for an ASIC.

[03-Aug-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the tipdiffs are making the already more difficult blocks that much more difficult. maybe it is just too steep

[03-Aug-19 10:44 PM] SHossain#0007
maxdiff is 8 in the pool settings

[03-Aug-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
ASIC is fine, the issue is onchain diff is not the same as offchain diff, except when it is the same

[03-Aug-19 10:45 PM] SHossain#0007
117:1147

[03-Aug-19 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
8 minutes to get 20 blocks, diff seems to be growing decently

12 minutes to get 30 blocks, but diff is only 4000,

[03-Aug-19 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
5121 diff

[03-Aug-19 10:51 PM] SHossain#0007
127:9402

[03-Aug-19 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
actually 14 minutes to get 30 blocks , 9400 diff

[03-Aug-19 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so really it is much better than the 15x CPU attack

[03-Aug-19 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
9 extra minutes and diff of ~10k vs ~15k

[03-Aug-19 10:52 PM] SHossain#0007
132:12394

[03-Aug-19 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
a net win, but it feels as if we can really fully solve this. it was just the first attempt. seems will be 40 blocks in 20 minutes or so to get to the stable diff

[03-Aug-19 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so 20 blocks too many, we only gain 5 back on the downside, still 15 lost

[03-Aug-19 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
better than 20 to 25 lost

[03-Aug-19 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain you can turn off ASIC

[03-Aug-19 10:54 PM] SHossain#0007
done

[03-Aug-19 10:54 PM] SHossain#0007
CPU continues

[03-Aug-19 11:11 PM] SHossain#0007
took 13 mins to find a block with CPU

[03-Aug-19 11:12 PM] SHossain#0007
after the ASIC stopped mining

[04-Aug-19 07:52 AM] zawy#5864
I have a good method now.  It's simpler and faster than the SMAs

[04-Aug-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
good news! all i could come up with so far was to make the booster actually boost the diff

[04-Aug-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so far its doing a bit better on the 15x

[04-Aug-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but still allowing 2x coins for a bit

[04-Aug-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you figured out how to prevent the extra coins?

[04-Aug-19 08:06 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, I think I have a good plan.

[04-Aug-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
ready to implement!

[04-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
15x attack: 13 blocks in 9 minutes and counting, stated diff 6, actual diff higher. the 13th block is taking quite a while

[04-Aug-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so just using the same triggers to boost the diff for sure, appears to stop the 15x attack, though for the first 10 blocks it was getting them in half the time

[04-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
got the 13th block after 12 min, stated diff of 8

[04-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
20 seconds for a block, diff is 12.6 (estimated 20 worth of hashrate)

[04-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
15th block in 13 minutes, diff of 13.5!

[04-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so diff is rising, without allowing too many extra blocks

[04-Aug-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
first time i have seen a 15x converge close to actual hashrate in 15 blocks

[04-Aug-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the earlier long block is triggering the max() side now, 18 blocks in  16 minutes, diff of 12.7

[04-Aug-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is definitely possible, if my random guessing is getting this sort of result

[04-Aug-19 08:25 AM] zawy#5864
You  need a program that tests ideas before going through the whole chain process.  I need to get mine running again. You pretend you're a miner with  ``` solvetime = -ln(rand())/hashrate/target*T```  But programming it with intr-block difficulty changing is tricky

[04-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking to calculate the implied hashrate of recent solves and making an aggressive feedbackloop on that if it is significantly different than the current diff

[04-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
relying on the exponential in case it overestimates. for whatever reason the exponential decay ends up at the actual hashrate in 5 blocks

[04-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can just 100x the difficulty and let the e^x calibrate
