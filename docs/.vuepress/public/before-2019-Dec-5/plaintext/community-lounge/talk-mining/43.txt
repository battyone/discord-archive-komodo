and I **really** can't see that someone that ignorant has a several hundred thousand USD to throw into mining

@Alright I'm trying (really hard) to believe it, but do you really expect me to rationalize that this guy is just **giving away** $30-50k a year in pool fees?

[18-Sep-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the same guy that thinks "notaries" is just "mumbo jumbo"...

after reading my own text of
`the same guy that thinks "notaries" is just "mumbo jumbo"...`
I can kinda see that, yes, he likely is that stupid to give away $50k in fees rather than set up his own private stuff 🤔

how come you can't solo mine with windows. .why doesn't developer make exe file and solo mine?

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you can solo mine on windows if you build the stratum software

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
same as linux

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Resistor#1215
i don't code or build anything

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Resistor#1215
so where is the file for windows

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
then you won't run your own stratum

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] Resistor#1215
why not?

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there are miners for windows, that you can point to a pool

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but there's not a prebuilt pool stratum for windows or linux

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Resistor#1215
but i was told solo mining is more profitable

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Resistor#1215
and everyone solo mines

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
if you can't build the stratum software, you probably shouldn't be running your own

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes they do, if they can run their own stratum

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Resistor#1215
well how do i run stratum on windows

there are instructions for builidng on linux

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you'd need to do the same on windows, but there aren't instructions for it

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Resistor#1215
yeah that's linux

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i know

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Resistor#1215
so where are the devs that make things for windows.. did you know the majority of the consumer market uses windows?

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
if you can't build and run it yourself, simply use my pool and pay the 1%

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
the devs?

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
its open source software

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
the team doesn't build it

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Resistor#1215
no i was told paying a pool fee is stupid so i don't want to be stupid and i'll mine myself

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Resistor#1215
but on windows

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
the majority of consumer users aren't going to try to solo mine

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Resistor#1215
they are every day..

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Resistor#1215
now that the public knows they don't have to pay pool fees. they can solo mine

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there was literally just a pool posted above that you can solo mine on

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is worth spending $20/mo on a unix VPS to run the pool software on

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Resistor#1215
but that's not a solo pool if people are already on it

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you can get away with a 5$/month vps to do it

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
they have both versions dude....

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
or a shitty laptop

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
solo or pool

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Resistor#1215
i'm on windows and i don't know how to do all this linux stuff so..  what now

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
use the solo pool i just posted:  https://www.waterparkmining.com

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Alright#0419
learn how to use it or continue paying pool fees

👍 

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
or rent a VPS with linux to host the pool software

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Resistor#1215
i can't even do the trail version of google cloud whatever because it won't take my card

[18-Sep-18 07:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there are 3 good options:

1. simply pay the 1% fee

2. rent a VPS or old computer to run the stratum

3. use the solo pool which is here: https://www.waterparkmining.com

4. try to install the stratum on windows (not recommended)

i was mining to make money not play hop scotch to 50 pools a day with no solved blocks
