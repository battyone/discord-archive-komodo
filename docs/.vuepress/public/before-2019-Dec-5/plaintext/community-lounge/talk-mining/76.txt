for test, you only need the FSM branch of https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo to be used with SPLTEST chain

you need to get it working with a sapling activated chain, SPLTEST or RKT

is there a trick to syncing SPLTEST?

yes

[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oops

[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] SHossain#0007
same as RKT chain

[03-Dec-18 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
RKT runs on jl777 FSM 😛

[03-Dec-18 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

👌🏽 abusedsmily 💯 🚀 

[03-Dec-18 09:09 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you can use the same daemon as RKT for SPLTEST chain

[03-Dec-18 09:09 PM] SHossain#0007
one is private and another is for CC testing

[03-Dec-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I dunno what the difference is (having merege conflicts so I haven't totally looked yet), but the jl777 FSm pulled a couple hrs ago will not sync SPLTEST past 60

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 different activation time and deadline time

[03-Dec-18 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
SPLTEST and RKT already passed activation and deadline. so, sapling is default on those chains

[03-Dec-18 09:16 PM] SHossain#0007

delete the old dir and do fresh clone, that would help for sure

I'd have to wipe my whole OS to remember how I got komodo to build on my macbook, I know I did it 15 kinds of wrong the 1st time I tried

[03-Dec-18 09:34 PM] scubapanda#2485
I'll just try and delete & reinstall, komodo 😃

`fresh clone

@SHossain I'm hoping that before I'm old enough to collect SocialSecurity that I have Internet good enough that I don't dread doing that ☹

[03-Dec-18 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007
if you had a daemon for RKT, you could use the same

[03-Dec-18 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that hadn't been updated in like a week 😛

[03-Dec-18 09:51 PM] SHossain#0007
still should work

[03-Dec-18 09:51 PM] SHossain#0007
there were updates for CC. shouldna't affect normal chain operation i guess

[04-Dec-18 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can try my stratum, which just takes no fee and usues the coinbase from the daemon :trollface:

[04-Dec-18 12:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And error is not relate to s-nomp`
s-nomp is making the block that the daemon is refusing

There littarally can never be anyberror witht that no matter what

[04-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Disable the fee, it will provably work

[04-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might both either tho...

[04-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Komodo doesn't like pools messing with it's coin base

[04-Dec-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its better to just not do it
