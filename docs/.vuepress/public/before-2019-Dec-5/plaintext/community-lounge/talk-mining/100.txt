`or sent HW that has been abused`
then buy new, because almost all used are abused 😛

[23-Feb-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah

[23-Feb-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
the A9 is looking like a damn good buy compared to competitors

[23-Feb-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
A9+ is just "bigger" but doesn't have better hash/watt, at least according to my calcs

[23-Feb-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm seriously thinking of picking up an A9+ or two this week

[23-Feb-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
it makes sense, to maintain less machines, use fewer GFCI outlets, fewer ethernet cables, i can see that

[23-Feb-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
z9's have lower hash/watt than a9's, i did the math myself and now see why CG likes the a9's

[23-Feb-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`GFCI outlets` ? they make those for 220v?

[23-Feb-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
and one a9 can replace so many z9 mini's, doesn't make sense to get mini's unless you just want 1 or 2

[23-Feb-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i know, 220 is better 😃

[23-Feb-19 01:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i don't have 220 setup, but maybe it makes sense. I know it's more efficient

[23-Feb-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
i got 200amps and 5.1 cents/kwh, trying to build it out lean and not over-extend

[23-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
for my setup, i will need some low amp miners to fill in the "leftover" parts of each breaker, i can see that is not optimal

[23-Feb-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I had 5.1 cents/kwh, I'd have 10x what I have now 😛

[23-Feb-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they brought in new transformers just for us and we still pay almost 9.9 😭

[23-Feb-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 trying to scale up as reasonably as possible, without making dumb mistakes. I learn a lot from you and a few others in this channel, which is pretty much the best mining resource I know of

[23-Feb-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can always be counted on to tell you what *not* to do because I did all the dumb things already 😛

[23-Feb-19 01:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
what about stuff to do stuff like power-cycling, remotely? Do you have anything like that, for when you are on vacation and the miners overheat and need a reboot?

[23-Feb-19 01:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
a buddy of mine suggested some home automation tool, to turn appliances on/off, hooked up to the power strip/etc

[23-Feb-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
let's just say, my DC is not easy to get to, and everything possible needs to be remote.

[23-Feb-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and i don't want to use AC, but i might need a way to turn AC on and off, when it's fucking 110F outside

[23-Feb-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
43.3 C outside, for everyone else in the world

[23-Feb-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It might sound trite, but the honest answer is:
Use enough ventilation to where you never need to think about that.
As far as being OCD and micromanaging goes, I modded and updated https://github.com/cryptoGlance/cryptoGlance-web-app as my "remote control"

i don't want to depend on AC in any way, but if it's a "hack" that prevents a multi-day trip to go on-site, it's a good solution

[23-Feb-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
passive is the way to go, in farming and mining

[23-Feb-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I started with a massive AC unit and quickly abandoned the idea for dehumidifier units
I did shut down my personal sha units last summer because of heat costs, but that more due to my being too lazy to fix one of the exhaust fans than anything else
The real key is getting hot,stale air __out__, even if it's replaced with only slightly cooler fresh air, it will make a massive difference to get all the "used" air out ASAP

[23-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto would very much not recommend buying any used z9s or z9 minis

their failure rate is ridiculous

[23-Feb-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Does anyone know of an easy install script for yiimp that's **not** for ubuntu?

[23-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
you're telling me you've had no boards fail? @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Alright#0419
you have 3 boards in each of your minis that work 100%?

[23-Feb-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've had 1 batch 1 that I had to back OC down to 650 to stay running, but I have not had a single complete fail board on any minis

[23-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
I have one I need to restart over and over until it actually starts hashing

[23-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
1 with 2 failed boards that I just ripped out

[23-Feb-19 02:25 PM] phm87#7395
I always installed yiimp on ubuntu or other linux/debian variants, I heard it is possible on windows

[23-Feb-19 02:26 PM] phm87#7395
I never used any installation scripts as there are leaks into these. I prefer to manually install each component, understand it and secure it

[23-Feb-19 02:26 PM] phm87#7395
one of the installation script "expert" committed recently his own pwd into github ... what can I say ?

[23-Feb-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 the test box I have is debian and all the scripts I have seen are for ubuntu and they die when trying to mess with the ppas and bdb4

[23-Feb-19 02:27 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't use debian since a while, I saw some dockerfile for yiimp but I was never able to use them, maybe they are not correst

[23-Feb-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as manual setup, I've never managed to get that to work (that's the main reason I use NOMP)

_is buying minis (with PSUs) for 100KMD each...._

[23-Feb-19 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
people are selling them for $315-400 USD on ebay in the US, what I see

[23-Feb-19 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
paying in KMD does interest me, a lot more than fucking coinbase commerce

[23-Feb-19 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright if you take KMD, and have a good price, I may still be interested. I will do my scaling with A9's, but I don't have a problem with a few z9m's to fill in small physical spaces or use amperage that is not enough for a biggie

[23-Feb-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`people are selling them for $315-400 USD on ebay in the US`

i need to optimize my breakers, fo sho

[23-Feb-19 02:41 PM] phm87#7395
for testpools, I run a virtualBox with a VM with ubuntu where I install yiimp. You can split yiimp on several servers/VM for a production pool (more secure and best performances) but for a testpool, you can run everything on 1 VM. Yiimp is composed of several components:
- webpages that can be used for the front-end (you can use apache, nginx or whatever web server)
- the same webpages that must be used for back-end (some scripts are launched inside screens) to perform payments and trading is enabled
- a MySQL database
- coin daemons running and synced
All the above is pretty much standard and the only component that require chosen dependancies is the stratum. Yiimp stratum require a dozen of packages on ubuntu and I think that finding these things in debian can be done.

[23-Feb-19 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
_is buying z9 minis, no PSU, for 150KMD or make an offer 👼_

[23-Feb-19 02:44 PM] phm87#7395
but learning ubuntu can be easier if you know debian

[23-Feb-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 my problem isn't what to do once installed, my problem is everyone builds everything for Ubuntu (which is by its very nature less stable than Debain) so I can't ever get it to install.
I guess I can spin up a 90 gajillionth machine and put Ubuntu on it, I'd just rather that people wrote "Linux" stuff for Linux and not write Ubuntu stuff and call it "Linux"

[23-Feb-19 02:52 PM] phm87#7395
The dockerfile I sent you contains packages required for yiimp stratum for alpine linux. I know someone who is running yiimp on alpine but without docker. I didn't use debian since years so I cannot test on it nor translate package list required

[23-Feb-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't even get *docker* to install correctly 😭

[23-Feb-19 02:53 PM] phm87#7395
I think that yiimp should run on debian but I don t know how to install stratum part on debian (webserver and db is standard stuff)

[23-Feb-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you know of a step-by-step install doc for yiimp?
I'm not opposed to installing manually, it's just that the manual instructions I've seen assume you already know certain things that I do not

[23-Feb-19 02:56 PM] phm87#7395
I can share my .txt file but it is written for ubuntu. You can replace webserver, db and coin installations with debian stuff easily, only tricky part is stratum installation

[23-Feb-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only tricky part is stratum installation`
yes, that's the bit I don't know
as for wallets, I've got that bit to where I can do in my sleep 😛

[23-Feb-19 03:00 PM] phm87#7395
about wallets, I though you were already running komodo on debian (because you are on debian and we are in the komodo discord) but maybe you run it on sth else

[23-Feb-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, I have the komodo daemon running
like I said, I can do that bit in my sleep
I just can never manage to install the yiimp stratum

[23-Feb-19 03:08 PM] phm87#7395
Here is the dozen of lines of packages required to install stratum on ubuntu:
```Stratums:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
sudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
sudo apt-get install pkgconf
sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev
sudo apt-get install libidn11-dev
sudo apt-get install librtmp-dev
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev

sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev

sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

git clone https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp
cd yiimp/stratum/iniparser
make
cd ..
make```

[23-Feb-19 03:10 PM] phm87#7395
gcc and build-essential is nearly the same commands, I found this talking about these 2 packages:

[23-Feb-19 03:11 PM] phm87#7395
I can search for each package but I won't be able to test to install them and try to compile stratum because I don't have debian

[23-Feb-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is cryptoGlance so amazing i should overlook it's written in PHP? Will it save me massive amounts of time and massage my back?

@dukeleto it's nothing "amazing", it's just the 1st thing I found when I started and saw no reason to do anything other than edits to make work with new fw

RMS disapproves

[23-Feb-19 05:29 PM] phm87#7395
Sad reality about yiimp is that the main dev don't want that there is more pools so there are not enough instructions to setup yiimp in the readme

[23-Feb-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
why help your competitors?

[23-Feb-19 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 even if I got yiimp installed, the issue of completely writing the module from scratch would be no cheap task
I misinterpreted what you were after, I thought you wanted an update like crackers does

[23-Feb-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's very hard to manage the risk of maintaining internal forks versus collab'ing with open source libraries, sometimes it could go either way

[23-Feb-19 05:31 PM] phm87#7395
Maybe crackers can share with you his equihash code (and ZEC rpc stuff). You can ask him

[23-Feb-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
github was famous for saying "opensource 99% and keep the 1% secret sauce secret"

[23-Feb-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
back before fucking MSFT owned them

[23-Feb-19 05:32 PM] phm87#7395
I agree with you about that writing everything is difficult: I failed during months on adding equihash myself but tpruvot/epsylon3 developed equihash into yiimp/ccminer in 2 or 3 days (crackers told me this)

[23-Feb-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
an update would be a nominal cost because it's a relatively minor amount of changes
a full write would take much time away from existing projects and as such cost significantly more
it's not a matter of "difficult" as much as time invested (which as duke pointed out is also time invested in creating competition against myself)

[23-Feb-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
i use ccminer a lot and it always treated me well, and pretty colors

[23-Feb-19 05:35 PM] phm87#7395
I understand you ComputerGenie. I also use and like ccminer

[23-Feb-19 05:43 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  about equihash implementation that @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers  is running, I think that he could share it with you. I am not sure but we can ask him

[23-Feb-19 05:46 PM] phm87#7395
Equihash is part of the secret sauce as explained by @dukeleto  but this implementation is dying (not maintained) and I think that no coin without equihash and without ZEC rpc encoding added sapling

[23-Feb-19 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you think about the maintainers of open source software, trying to support hundreds of different coins, the sapling upgrade is a huge pain. no one is motivated to do it for free, because it just helps your competitors. It's specialty software, completely un-related to any "normal" Bitcoin fork

[23-Feb-19 06:26 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you don’t need equihash for sapling. You can try with the coin KOTO which changed the algo to yescrypt. @dukeleto I’ve offered a bounty for 1000 kmd but no takers

[23-Feb-19 06:27 PM] phm87#7395
I disagree with you @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers : koto is still using ZEC encoding stuff and I read comments on their githubs saying that the koto sapling implementation is not standard

[23-Feb-19 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers it's a reasonable bounty for somebody really knowledgeable about that stuff and C++ json parsers, and that is not me 😃

[23-Feb-19 06:33 PM] phm87#7395
But koto is a good starting point if someone can do the zec rpc stuff + koto adapted a nomp and I found a ccminer for koto with sapling. But ccminer coding is new for me and koto ccminer is different from tpruvot ccminer

[23-Feb-19 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
i did go so far as to read the source of yiimp and ccminer, both are not easy to "slip into"

[23-Feb-19 06:35 PM] phm87#7395
I agree
