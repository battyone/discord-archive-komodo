@Alecandro there are some pools in the pinned messages, I think komodominingpools also has a notary node (someone correct me if I’m wrong)

[07-Dec-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Inb4 @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 tells you to solomine`
I've, literally, searched the world over and never found a pool that paid me more than my own....

[07-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Alecandro#1179
👍🏼

[08-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you set up your own pool?  I'm thinking about that...is it worth it with 300kh/s?

[08-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
I've got a 4 core vps...going to give it a shot...sounds like a friday night project

If it’s for pirate @Captain_Jack we are releasing a new mining pool software within a week.  May want to wait for that? Yeah @blackjok3r ?

[08-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should already work for sapling

[08-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If not I have a pool that does

[08-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it foes not work with pirate

[08-Dec-18 08:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Feck me...

[08-Dec-18 08:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I know so little about this shit 😛

[08-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
this was for KMD...tried it on a 2 core VPS that is running an asset chain...but making komodo ran out of memory.  Setting this up again on a VPS running on 4 core with more mem now.  @blackjok3r  good to know there is new pool version coming soon @FishyGuts

[08-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use the komodo boot strap to use a lower mem vps

[08-Dec-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sorry don't have link on phone

[08-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
ok . I'll dig that up...i have a big boy vps for now

[08-Dec-18 08:34 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
thanks again for your quick response...you are all over this 😃

[08-Dec-18 09:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[08-Dec-18 09:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's not the actual error

[08-Dec-18 09:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
cannot allocate memory.

[08-Dec-18 09:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Server too weak?

[08-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
~/komodo/src$ ./assetchains
./assetchains: line 5: pubkey.txt: No such file or directory

[08-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
@Captain_Jack don't run `./assetchains`. It will sync all the assetchains that are dpow'd

[08-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
Which is like 35 chains at least

[08-Dec-18 03:53 PM] SHossain#0007
@Andrei [ᴬᴸᵀᴾᴼᴼᴸ.ᴾᴿᴼ] Please send me your address to receive sapling ready pool bounty that jl777 offered. 
@blackjok3r @webworker01 also please send me your address to receive bounty. jl777 was generous towards you contribution too. 
I've tested @blackjok3r's knomp on a test chain and the transition went smooth along with payment. 
Well done you all.

is it just me or does "pouting_cat" look more "angry" than "pouting"?

[08-Dec-18 04:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess, it is both

any KMD or assetchain pool-operator that didn't receive yet the `Pool-Operator` role, post here please.

[08-Dec-18 07:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:shexy: ty

[08-Dec-18 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pool-Operator Please update your pool with latest Komodo source which is sapling ready and make sure your pool software is sapling ready too. If you are running assetchain pool as well, after updating Komodo, just restart all the daemons. Remember to this before 15 Decembe. Otherwise, you are risking to go on fork. Please post here once your pool is sapling ready.
1. Navigate to your Komodo directory.
`cd ~/komodo`
2. Make sure you don't have any changes made to the source and reset it. This will ensure clean source and shouldn't create issue while pulling the latest source in the next step.
`git reset --hard`
3. Use master branch
`git checkout master`
4. Clean the source directory.
`make clean`
5. Update the source. (If you’ve made any changes to the source code, this step may not pull the latest source. Please make sure you used the step above to eliminate this issue.)
`git pull`
6. Fetch updated zcash sapling params
`./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`
7. Compile the latest binary.
`./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`
Start your daemon as usual. (If you have not stopped the Komodo daemon before compiling, please stop the daemon now and start it again.)
8. Verify the update
`./Komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN getinfo`
Please look for the KMDversion in the output of the above call, which should display:
`"KMDversion": "0.3.1",`

[08-Dec-18 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
any issues regarding update, please post here as well

[08-Dec-18 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
altpool.pro also updated

[08-Dec-18 08:55 PM] SHossain#0007
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com since you update the code of Komodo, PIRATE and ZEX daemon should be sapling ready too. all you need to do is restart those daemon to run latest.

[08-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
Different servers Going to have to do them all.

@forkwitch @dukeleto @jeezy please update your pools. check the first pinned post for update steps if needed. let's get sapling ready. any questions don't hesitate to ask

[08-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 grey best colour

[08-Dec-18 09:33 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is your chickenpool sapling ready?

[08-Dec-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright for me it wasn't a "best" or "worst" thing as much as red kinda implies "watch out this guy might be 'bad'"

[08-Dec-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
chickenpool in production?

[08-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain the parts of it work are, yes
I'm in the process of treating it like an improperly healed broken bone (needs to be rebroken in order to reset it properly)

[08-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
what's the website again?

[08-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the website for chickenpool is chickenpool.com

[08-Dec-18 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. i take it that you will be sapling ready completely before the fork happens

[08-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
What’s a sapling ready pool bounty?

[08-Dec-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, KMD and "normal" assetchains will be 100% ready before the 15th and functioning on the 15th
the private-only and other feature mods that I have in store may or may not be ready by then

[08-Dec-18 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jules - coinblockers.com there was a bounty to the 1st person that had a sapling ready test pool running

[08-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Oh wow

[08-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
How could I miss that

[08-Dec-18 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it only lasted like 50 minutes before it was claimed

[08-Dec-18 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
may have been a bit longer but definitely less than a few hrs

[08-Dec-18 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
Any pool becomes sapling ready, please let me know

[08-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Will do, if I have some minutes later when arriving at home.

[08-Dec-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks. take your time

[08-Dec-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
let us know if you need any help.

[08-Dec-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
plenty of sapling ready operators are here to help 😃

[08-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Not for node variant

[08-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
But if someone is good in C, ckpool could need some adoption of new coins 😀

[08-Dec-18 09:47 PM] SHossain#0007
who runs komodopool.com?

[08-Dec-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jules - coinblockers.com there is a version of that in the works, but mine will not be done before likely March

[08-Dec-18 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
SPLNS specifically

[08-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Rly? I just was gonna start to jump in it. Another option I was thinking about is the btc.com pool backend

[08-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
And Miningcore was not my fav of all options.

[08-Dec-18 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't put too much work into it yet because like all things ck it lacks frontend and I am soooo not a ui guy

[08-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
UI shouldn’t be a problem

[08-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
If the API works properly

[08-Dec-18 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
obviously you've not seen my attempts 😛

[08-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
What UI you prefer? I’ve seen ck uses php, I’m more thinking about something more flexible like node

[08-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
But php will do aswell if you use some more modern framework

[08-Dec-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't given it too much thought I'm still tweeking a few things in the SPLNS section and trying to figure out how to explain it to people (it tends to confuse a lot of folks almost instantly)

[08-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
Shouldn’t matter unless it pays fair 😀

[08-Dec-18 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Shouldn’t matter unless it pays fair `
imo, the rampdown is too long

[08-Dec-18 11:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Anyone know why I'd be getting `-bash: ./komodo-cli: No such file or directory` in my /komodo/src directory after updating to master branch

[08-Dec-18 11:26 PM] SHossain#0007
compile again

[08-Dec-18 11:26 PM] SHossain#0007
that means, compiling didnt' work

[08-Dec-18 11:26 PM] SHossain#0007
just run `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` again

[08-Dec-18 11:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
thanks

[08-Dec-18 11:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I am not required to stop my daemon prior to compiling, correct?

[08-Dec-18 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
not required if you have good spec

[08-Dec-18 11:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
