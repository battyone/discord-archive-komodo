In theory, there's at least 30 coins I can name off the top of my head that can dual mine with KMD (albeit most are asset chains)

[03-Jul-18 03:40 PM] wookie#7663
@ComputerGenie i have a 1080 and a 160 3gb, I dedicate both to KMD, but I read somewhere that it can be dual mined. not sure if my understanding is correct: mining kmd uses mainly memory, while the core sits unused. so the core can be used for mining something else? is that accurate?

[03-Jul-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ish, but KMD and ZEC use far less mem that the circlejerk of 144,5 coins

[03-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
What is dual mining as opposed to merge mining

[03-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
mining two algos at once?

[03-Jul-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sorta, yes

[03-Jul-18 03:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
Merged mining refers to the process of reusing (partial) PoW solutions from a parent
cryptocurrency as valid proofs-of-work for one or more child cryptocurrencies. It
was introduced as a solution to the fragmentation of mining power among competing
cryptocurrencies and as a bootstrapping mechanism for small networks. Merged
mining was first implemented in Namecoin in 2011, with Bitcoin acting as the parent
cryptocurrency. One of the earliest descriptions of the mechanism as it is used today
was presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in [33]. Apart from the source code of the respective
cryptocurrencies implementing merged mining, a detailed technical explanation is
presented in the Bitcoin Wiki [25].

[03-Jul-18 03:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
its always been there since Satoshi published the code

[03-Jul-18 03:44 PM] wookie#7663
@Alright what I understand from dr. google: dual mining redirects some power from coin A to coin B, essentially mining 2 coins on 2 algos. Merged mining has a smaller/"weaker" coin to latch/leach onto the PoW of a coin with a stronger network. that's my "ish" understanding.

[03-Jul-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"It was introduced as a solution to the fragmentation of mining power among competing cryptocurrencies and as a bootstrapping mechanism for small networks"
100% exactly what I said:
" if we do this, then we can promote "security" without having to have any miners of our own and our shitcoin will pay us free $"

[03-Jul-18 03:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
but your statement is implying it was their idea... it was not... it was always part of the codebase and idea from Satoshi

[03-Jul-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
miners need to choose to merge mine and a coin needs to add a merkle trees to the blockheader, ie big changes

[03-Jul-18 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
On block 19200 Namecoin activated the merged mining upgrade

[03-Jul-18 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
it was added 6 months after launch

[03-Jul-18 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox So, you're of the camp that believes that the bct satoshi was the same satoshi that wrote the whitepaper?

[03-Jul-18 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
why does that even matter?

[03-Jul-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because, that's where that claim comes from: bct

[03-Jul-18 03:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
what claim?

[03-Jul-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that satoshi designed mergemining

[03-Jul-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in order to assert that satoshi came up with mergemining, you also have to say that the satoshi on bitcointalk is *the* satoshi

[03-Jul-18 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
its not from bct...

[03-Jul-18 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"its not from bct..."
do yourself a favor and the next time you goggle something, look at the references so that you don't say something that wrong

[03-Jul-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[03-Jul-18 04:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok... that line is... that wasnt my point... did Satoshi go back and add that code to BTC after that comment? It was already there...

[03-Jul-18 04:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
so the CODEisnt from bct nor is the article i found that quote in... but now i have the reference ty

[03-Jul-18 04:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
z9 mini second batch sold out!

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) There's no conclusive proof presented, as of yet, the Craig is *the* satoshi
2) back then all the Core devs were on bct

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
it still doesnt matter for this scope...

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
merge mining was possible before that post

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
every BTC clone had it

[03-Jul-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
LTC cant be merge mined

[03-Jul-18 04:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
but LTC can be a PARENT

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
any coin can be a parent without changing the daemon, as long as the miners run a special merge mined version, so that isnt really saying much...

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
or couldhave idk what all they stripped out

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
all the changes are on the non-parent side

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and miners have to opt in

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is a limit to the number of coins that can be merge mined

[03-Jul-18 04:08 PM] daemonfox#6136

[03-Jul-18 04:09 PM] wookie#7663
whoa...I set off a whole can of worms here. interesting discussion. But I was just asking if anyone can help me figure how to dual mine kmd with some other coin just so I can maximize my returns. I'm not interested in merge mining.

[03-Jul-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox so, your position is that Core had code to merge mine before Core devs said that it was theoretically possible (which was a full 6 months before namecoin began)?

[03-Jul-18 04:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
no

[03-Jul-18 04:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
Core had code yes... before Core dev revealed it was theoretically possible yes...

[03-Jul-18 04:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
NMC launched and mined for 6 months

[03-Jul-18 04:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
and at that block height upgrade d to add merge mining

[03-Jul-18 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, they upgraded before they upgraded? ü§î

[03-Jul-18 04:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[03-Jul-18 04:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
no they launched as a non merge mined PoW

[03-Jul-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
methinks you need to draw yourself a timeline and look at some commits üòâ

[03-Jul-18 04:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
what am i missing... in April 2011 the launched... 19200 blocs later they activated merge mining... does it matter when the commit happened to make that 19200 block change happen?

[03-Jul-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
December 2010 -> April 2011 -> July 2018

[03-Jul-18 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
since we're not in theoretical physics channel, timelines are linear üòâ

[03-Jul-18 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"does it matter when the commit happened to make that 19200 block change happen"
Yes, it matters when your assertion is that the code existed **before** Dec 2010.

[03-Jul-18 04:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
the code in BTC existed to act as the parent... the code in NMC cloned from it existed but was not functional in April but was implemented 6 months later...

[03-Jul-18 04:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
BTC code pre 2010 > NMC clone 2011 > Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented

[03-Jul-18 04:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
my assertion is the base code existed before... and then NMC committed the change they needed to act as a child to merge mine from the BTC parent

[03-Jul-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What you've said so far:
`Core had merge code> BTC code pre 2010 > Core said merge possible in theory> NMC clone 2011 > Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented`

[03-Jul-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What happened:
` BTC code pre 2010 > Core said merge possible in theory> NMC clone 2011 > Core had merge code> Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented`

[03-Jul-18 04:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
so my timeline isnt wrong, you have one more insert where BTC core dev had to add the code...

[03-Jul-18 04:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
or activate it themselves...

[03-Jul-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the code came *after* the "in theory", not before

[03-Jul-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
only the miner needs to change for the parent (as far as I know)

[03-Jul-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and only miners that are merge mining need to run the special version

[03-Jul-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc there's a opcode change
in Core

[03-Jul-18 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
the in theory was stating it was already there... child coins just needed to make a change

[03-Jul-18 04:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
can you link i was looking for it

[03-Jul-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so BTC miners that want to merge mine would run a mergemining daemon that generates merkle proofs for the merge mining, the BTC mining is unchanged. not sure what OP_CODE would be needed for BTC, but certainly for the non-parent chain it is a lot of changes

[03-Jul-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mm is pretty much like LN, Core change isn't *needed* but made it easier

[03-Jul-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
that I can believe

[03-Jul-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
a small change on the BTC side, much more changes on the NMC side

[03-Jul-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes

[03-Jul-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and no, I dont plan to add merge mining to KMD

[03-Jul-18 04:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol

[03-Jul-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not that there is anything wrong with it

[03-Jul-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_goes back to pretending he doesn't despise the current Core team and goes back to working on his stratum_

[03-Jul-18 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
probably gavin added the needed core side changes?

[03-Jul-18 04:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
idk i asked for the link im curious what was changed

[03-Jul-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I forget who all had access back then, since it was all historical reading for me

[03-Jul-18 04:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill be back later lunch time

[03-Jul-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox as an fyi, there's no part of me that's going to pour through a random 6 month period of commits to save you the time in doing so yurself

[03-Jul-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
üòõ

[03-Jul-18 04:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
np... you made it sound like what you found was difinitively a commit for merged mining updates

[03-Jul-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure how it came across, but the intention was:
there was no code to make it possible before the discussion where it was stated that it should be possible.
You said:
code -> saying possible in theory
I say
saying possible in theory -> any code

[03-Jul-18 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and setting all that aside, I still say that I doubt the claim that Craig = *the* Satoshi (i.e., the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper); ergo, Satoshi never said fekall about mergemining üòõ

[03-Jul-18 07:32 PM] daemonfox#6136

Anyone with >~5ksol should seriously be solo mining

[03-Jul-18 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
even less would be fine

[03-Jul-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if you have the hash to hit 1 block a year you should solo

[03-Jul-18 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
Public pools are targets. If something happens to them in which their miners receive less coins, they aren't likely to mention it or reimburse for those coins. For example, 1 miner faking shares on the pool steals from every single participant

[03-Jul-18 07:54 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
