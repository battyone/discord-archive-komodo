Is renting equihash a good deal rn? Trying to pick the brain of people who maybe do this all the time.

[10-May-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on what you mine, when you mine it, and what "a good deal" means to the individual

[10-May-19 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
typically only ever a good idea if you're spec mining something expecting it to rise in price

[10-May-19 12:18 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Spec mining KMD and ARRR then.😏

[10-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
you're likely better off buying the coins, just saying

[10-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
don't take my word on it, do the math

[10-May-19 12:19 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I sold a GPU for PayPal money, so ebay rental seems like a logical way to turn that into crypto.

[10-May-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
if you do it, be aware that there are bots that watch active orders and try to push up the price

[10-May-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
just put in a low ball order and have patience

[10-May-19 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
don't try to out bid people, it's bots trying to get you to do exactly that

[10-May-19 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nh rental:
for ARRR, you could make light returns
for KMD, you'd be pissing money away

[10-May-19 12:21 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Really? EBay Bots for hash rate?

[10-May-19 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he meant bot pushing nh rental prices up

[10-May-19 12:22 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Gotcha. Thanks guys. Really I just want to buy a little bit of crypto with this PayPal money without putting it in the bank first where my wife can see what I did. LOL

Do you have an actual, specific question?

[11-May-19 04:33 AM] klein#5233
If you are finding it difficult to figure out how to find the information on how to mine, let alone mine its self its just going to be easier to buy komodo instead of mining it.

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if miners can expect relatively more big blocks when binance deposits/withdrawels open.

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should cause for more big wallet movements, no?

[12-May-19 02:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon do you mean blocks with more fees since more xtns will be trying to happen?

[12-May-19 02:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Blocks with unclaimed intrest

[12-May-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Usually days with high volatility have more blocks with unclaimed rewards in them

[12-May-19 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i would agree to that

[12-May-19 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
high volatility makes the sleepers awaken, and some of them have lots of interest that goes unclaimed

[12-May-19 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just a small tip, might be interesting to point some hash to kmd and cross fingers you get lucky...

I heard that too 🙂

[12-May-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
last I heard it was "maybe a month" from "maybe a week"

[12-May-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's all smoke + mirrors

[12-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the maybe a month was a satire article?

probably not good news for US-based miners

[13-May-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looking at that list, one thing is for sure: Chinese people will be eating a lot less American food products

[13-May-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

US-based miners are already paying 27%+, not sure it can get much worse 🤷🏽

no import fees? 👀 
i ordered 20 litres of liquid for cooling ASIC from USA. the price was $180. paid shipping + handling $217. then, in the UK customs + import fees + admin charge over $120

[13-May-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
not going to order any more liquid from USA

[13-May-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what you get for not just buying a 55 gallon drum of mineral oil for the same price 😛

[13-May-19 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i thought i dont have to use radiator to cool down and the liquid should take care of things automatically

[13-May-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that thinking stuff is dangerous 😮

[13-May-19 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
i was talking about asics, not sure about liquids

[13-May-19 01:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
on hmrc's website asics are classed as electronic components. bought 2 z9m from china, paid only for asics

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i have an AIO cooler with 360mm radiator. thinking to cut down 1 tube and somehow make that custom solution for rads 😄

[13-May-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
did i send u that video with the 36 submerged asics?

[13-May-19 03:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've done a fair bit of research on that if you want to recirculate heat and not pay heating bills anymore :abusedsmily:

[13-May-19 03:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
all i was missing at that time was the liquid as there weren't any good options at decent prices

[13-May-19 03:56 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i've seen that video

[13-May-19 03:56 PM] SHossain#0007
