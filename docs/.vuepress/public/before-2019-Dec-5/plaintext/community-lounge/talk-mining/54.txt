I haven't had much luck with large bonuses this year, I think my largest was like 27

[12-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a bunch at like 4-7 though 😀

[12-Oct-18 11:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe these real big ones are going back to the individual who would 'loose' it. Might be a risky.  statistically notary nodes should get about 75% of these big ones but they dont

[12-Oct-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did see there was a way to make a-team mine more blocks than its allowed too .. but seems a bad idea, and probably wont increse chances of getting more big blocks over external miners who can monitor mempool then switch hash for large rewards TXs

[12-Oct-18 11:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes if you have hashpower stand by maybe you can analyse the mempool and mine it just in time

[12-Oct-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`monitor mempool then switch hash for large rewards TXs`
I actually did contemplate doing that at one point, but was just to lazy to write the API codes

[12-Oct-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that and I don't like someone else holding my liquidity

[12-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
could just look for those txs, use `invalidateblock` or whatever the command is on it

then keep hashing and try to reorg it before notarization

is asic required to mine any pirate even in a pool?

[13-Oct-18 12:36 PM] E.#1770
i just have a midrange amd gpu and i5 cpu

[13-Oct-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "required", but more useful than a GPU

[13-Oct-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CPUs are basically pointless for PIRATE

[13-Oct-18 12:37 PM] E.#1770
ofcourse but i mean will it take months just to mine 1 pirate if im using regular hardware

[13-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 1080TI should get you ~ 3 per day

[13-Oct-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less for AMDs

[13-Oct-18 12:38 PM] E.#1770
i thought i was mining all night with zcash miner but either i was doing it wrong, it's going too slow or i am not checking balance properly

[13-Oct-18 12:39 PM] E.#1770
ok in that case i might get 1 per day then lol

[13-Oct-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
af far as balance in wallet, that's going to be determined by when your pool pays out and how low the payment threshold is

[13-Oct-18 12:42 PM] E.#1770
yeah

[13-Oct-18 12:42 PM] E.#1770
min is 15 lol

[13-Oct-18 12:43 PM] E.#1770
would i be better off without a pool?

[13-Oct-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you only have 1 GPU and you estimate 1 per day in pool, then without pool you are looking at 256 days between blocks

what does it mean if i have 1000 total shares?

[13-Oct-18 12:46 PM] E.#1770
i'm finding shares pretty frequently

[13-Oct-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"shares" are how pools determine who gets paid what (your fractional portion of the total amount of work attempted before a valid block is found by someone)

[13-Oct-18 12:46 PM] E.#1770
thats what i figured thanks

[13-Oct-18 12:48 PM] E.#1770
it says my total speed is 27.194 H/s, does that mean 27 H/s or 27,194 (twenty seven thousand) H/s? i know some countries mix up commas and decimals

[13-Oct-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
miners are made for/by americans so 27 and a fraction

question for the miners.........I have a few ASIC's going at home and over the last month since I had a few more up my internet usage has blown out. Is there a simple method to calculate data usage? or should I be looking elsewhere for the blow out. I didn't think mining would help me knock up 250 GB in a month

[14-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
is definitely not the asics

[16-Oct-18 11:53 AM] jansako#3330
I run a few of tests I wanted to share & maybe get a little feedback:

- I found a pool that does auto-coin switch & payout in BTC.
- I put a NH order for about 30% less than the pool's listed profitability (the lower of estimated or actual)
- Once the order run out of money (usually 2-3 days, total about 24 hours hash time) I checked the results. 
- After 4 tries in 3 different pools I found that I have mined about 50% of the hash cost (a 0.005 NH order mined ~ 0.0025 BTC) Exception - I caught that megablock in zpool yesterday so at least I got my BTC back)
- Doing the same as above in a Pirate pool returned almost exactly (within 1-2 %) the expected amount of coin (Network hash/my hash x 100 x block reward x number of blocks for the order duration)

[16-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jansako#3330
On the face of it, I would expect to turn at least a small profit when buying hash  30-50% cheaper than the stated 'profitability' of the pool...

What gives?

[16-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jansako#3330
The 2 obvious answers are:
- my not understanding math, or missing something
- the pool operators misleading the miners about 'real' profitability
- NH misleading the buyers about the hashrate they actually provide - does not seem likely considering Pirate hash was repeatedly spot on

[16-Oct-18 11:58 AM] jansako#3330
Sorry for the wall!

[16-Oct-18 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako The main thing to remember is that the hash you rented is assumed to *already be* part of the network when you run it through a calc

[16-Oct-18 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, there will always be a disparity there

[16-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jansako#3330
not sure what you mean

[16-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jansako#3330
If I am renting a 'general' Equihash hash, then directing it to a specific pool, how can that hash be in that pool before I send it there?

[16-Oct-18 12:14 PM] jansako#3330
BUT if my hash is already part of the network, then the calc based on that network hash should be more accurate, not less

[16-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jansako#3330
I was thinking of PPLNS - related losses as well cause (cheap) NH hash is unstable, so I picked pools with high hashrate that get blocks often

[16-Oct-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, lets say you want to rent 10M sols.
When you put that 10M into a calculator, the calculator does not *add* that 10M to whatever "network hashrate" and/or the resulting "difficulty" of adding that amount of hash
If you already had that 10M running and the calc *did* account for it, there are other factors (not limited to other miners joining, luck, etc) that determine actual vs theoretical results
----
Sadly, there is no calc in the world that is accurate, and even less than that are even close when it comes to KMD (which would throw off any math of using a pool like zpool)

[16-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jansako#3330
I see the issue with renting a massive hash (especially short time)

[16-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jansako#3330
What I did was specify a max 0.1 MSol, to large pools that mine multiple coins. Usually the incoming hash to my workeds was going to 3-4 coins at the same time

[16-Oct-18 12:21 PM] jansako#3330
My hash was never more than 1-2% of the pool's hash

[16-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The larger the network is will be the more any given amount is "accurate" in a calc
When swinging 100k even, coin network size can matter greatly
What all coins where these pools mining?

[16-Oct-18 12:24 PM] jansako#3330

I also user zergpool, but that one closed a few days ago 😦

[16-Oct-18 12:26 PM] jansako#3330
also 'miningpoolhub' which mostly switches between zcash, zencash or zcalssic

[16-Oct-18 12:26 PM] jansako#3330
I also tried SHA 256 which has a ton of coins & hashrate, as you can imagine

[16-Oct-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Specifically, a pool like zpool *can* have the opposite of intended results from time to time
If you hit a run of bad luck, it's entirely possible that you only hit blocks from low-diff coins and when you switch to the high-diff coin(s) you get nothing and then later switch back to a low-diff coin and have a share that would have been of block find diff on the high-diff coin (you may need to reread that, I don't know how else to phrase it)

[16-Oct-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
luck plays a huge factor in mining

[16-Oct-18 12:31 PM] jansako#3330
Understood. Need no more proof that I gotten a part of that mega block (which ended up bringing me to the expected results overall). Trouble is that  it seems to me that one was an outlier.

[16-Oct-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Also, if you did a run for a year, rather than a day, the result would likely be much closer to "expected" because of the law of averages

[16-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`(usually 2-3 days, total about 24 hours hash time)`
Another thing that I just thought of, it's possible that many block finds happened while you weren't submitting shares and thus you didn't get paid "fully" for that period (due to a lowered share %age)

[16-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jansako#3330
Yeah, I thought about the PPLNS thingie... figured 30% cost/proceed difference coupled with the high block frequency of a large pool would cover that

[16-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jansako#3330
I would almost have to run another test with a 'fixed order'

[16-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jansako#3330
those suckers are expensive though

[16-Oct-18 12:38 PM] jansako#3330
Or find a pool that only does PPS

[16-Oct-18 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As near as I can tell, NH doesn't misrepresent hash by any meaningful amount.
The share-diff that they use can screw you based on a block diff actually being lower than their min diff, though

[16-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jansako#3330
Yep, it would have shown up clearly on the Pirate test for sure

[16-Oct-18 12:40 PM] jansako#3330

Dear Miners,
I'm happy to announce that we have activated the hot suggested minimum payment feature for all our Pool coins.
This will help to alleviate the Bitcoin's inherited issue for wallet address which constantly receiving massive of flow of low-amount coins (due to mining) which in-turn affecting the wallet address'  UTXO sending out allowance.
This also can be useful if you wish to send your mine proceed directly into Exchange's wallet address, although we discourage you to do this for your own security (if don't own the private key, you are not owning the wallet).
Here's how to do it:
If you want to get paid from 20 coins, add this value into your password field of your mining software:
payfrom=20  
or any float value if you like such as:  payfrom=20.5

[16-Oct-18 08:44 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I got verus coin mining but my cpu is only doing 200h/s, is that solo mining or in a pool? From the agama wallet, tia

[16-Oct-18 08:54 PM] Hermes#6934
If you are using the miner inside Agama that's your own h/s

[16-Oct-18 09:01 PM] DR3WSKi#8767

[16-Oct-18 10:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@DR3WSKi at that hashrate, very roughly, it's going to be about a month to get a block. but nethash can change quickly

[16-Oct-18 10:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@DR3WSKi i still solo mine VRSC with around 500-600MH/s, but it's not like the old days

[16-Oct-18 10:30 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I looked on the explorer and some blocks have huge payouts is that due to having a higher hashrate

[16-Oct-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
are you talking about KMD blocks?

[16-Oct-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
some KMD blocks can give a big bonus to miners, because some exchanges do not implement interest and it goes to the miner

[16-Oct-18 10:43 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
On veruscoin.io

[16-Oct-18 10:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are just seeing large transactions, current VRSC block size is 24
