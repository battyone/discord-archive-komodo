Mmm just saw minis at a lot lower power consumption, 260 at base that would make them more efficient.  So the real difference is space taken up,  amount of power supplies .   Ports taken up at the switch etc. Still at this rate might as well go with the minis especially considering coupons.

1150+115=?

[11-Jul-18 02:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and as for "amount of PSUs", that's more of a hobby miner issue, not any actual comparative thing

[11-Jul-18 02:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, still not seeing support for the "longer"/"longevity" claim

[11-Jul-18 03:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

@polycryptoblog Something else I just thought of:
Since Bitmain has yet to release any specifics on the Z9 (to actually compare with the minis), it's key to accept the possibility that we're all merely assuming that they are 12 chips per card and thus 4x but they could actually be 10 chip cards that are already punched up to a higher frequency.

[11-Jul-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
From a manufacturing and business sense, the latter would be far more profitable for them to do.

[11-Jul-18 07:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_finally has Verus working and mining :shexy:_

[11-Jul-18 08:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Same I think the z9 minis are then better buy

[11-Jul-18 08:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Risk is spread as well.

[11-Jul-18 08:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Mini goes down your out 14-15k hashpower

[11-Jul-18 08:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Z9 full goes down your out 40-50k

[11-Jul-18 10:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Important things being equal, cost, power consumption 
One Z9 breaks, you lose 100% of your hashpower.
One Mini breaks and you lose 25% of your hashpower.

Plus, does anyone know if you can use more than one coupon per unit?   If not, then you can use 1,000 worth of coupons on 4 minis.

[11-Jul-18 11:01 PM] ! |üÜâüÖøüÖæüÖæüÖª.üÖ≤üÖ∞| ! - crackers#9719
One coupon per machine

[11-Jul-18 11:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  that would be a kick in the nuts of the full version is already maxed out on hashrate.   Will get one to test it out ,  just in case it's the opposite of the assumption and we can crank these badboys up to 70ksol+ but I'm convinced : the rest will be minis.

[12-Jul-18 02:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea I'm thinking 10 boards in a z9 full

[12-Jul-18 02:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I can't see them doing 12 :/

[12-Jul-18 02:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's for sure 3 boards, the question is how many chips per

Komodo Mining Pool
Komodo mining pool is a mining pool for mining Komodo (KMD), the first komodo pool and best on web. On komodominingpool.com you can mine with your CPUs and GPUs.

[12-Jul-18 03:30 PM] srgess#8462
Only 92 miner ..must be long for payout !

[12-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
@srgess You should solo mine

[12-Jul-18 04:29 PM] srgess#8462
@Alright not with my few gpu it will.take years to find a block !

[12-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
Rewards will even out over time

[12-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
might hit a block with some unclaimed rewards also

[12-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
I solo mine with 4ksol

who's pushing 2 kSols at MShark all day today???

[12-Jul-18 05:00 PM] jansako#3330
@srgess not so, I run my s9 mini on that pool for a week, avg payout ~7 KMD/day. Pays out every 0.5 KMD, so almost every hour...

[12-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Nabob#5004
any one interested in buying  bitmain coupons DM me?

Hi. New to kmd. Was there a fork recently?

[14-Jul-18 01:59 AM] jonske1#5173
Trying to find info.

[14-Jul-18 02:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
We forked I think in March for the elections

[14-Jul-18 02:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Notary nodes are hard coded into the chain

[14-Jul-18 02:34 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Komodo forks annually, sometimes more than once a year but atleast once per year

[14-Jul-18 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is another hard fork at block 1 million

[14-Jul-18 03:01 AM] BlackJesus#6161
That's all the interest changes right an do are they activating bigchaindb at 1 million?

[14-Jul-18 03:01 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Nixing the free for all period and making the chain more miner friendly although notaries will still rule.

[14-Jul-18 03:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@blackjok3r

[14-Jul-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes free for all is removed and *rewards* is changed to monthly instead of yearly

[14-Jul-18 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Free for all is no longer required as notaries wont mine if GPU percentage is uner 25%

[14-Jul-18 03:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Is the smart contract code being merged as well?

[14-Jul-18 03:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I know that's going to require a hard fork.

[14-Jul-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Those are already in komodod, if you use the ac_cc=x parameter.

[14-Jul-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But if you start it with that, it will hard fork into another chain

[14-Jul-18 03:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Ok

[14-Jul-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we wont activate CC in KMD until it is very well tested in the other chains, likely next year's new notary hardfork

I'm having dramas setting up my Z-nomp. whenever I `npm start` I get this error `
2018-07-15 11:20:25 [Master]    [komodo] Cannot run a pool for unsupported algorithm "equihash"`.

[15-Jul-18 01:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have setup the conf file and json files accordingly, but I can't find any info on this specific error. Have anyone seen it before?

[15-Jul-18 01:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm also getting this below that line `[Master]    [PoolSpawner] No pool configs exists or are enabled in pool_configs folder. No pools spawned.` So i'm guessing there may be a problem with my komodo.json file somewhere, or it is just because it doesn't recognise the equihash json.

[15-Jul-18 02:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@xRobeSx I know you made a kmd-nomp, but currently i'm trying to use z-nomp. Any chance you have come across this error?

ALso maybe look at this.... for some clues.. https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/scaletest/tree/4096/znomp
There is some info in the README.md we made that to auto generate ZNOMP configs for assetchains.

Didnt end up using it, but it might give you some clues on how to config znomp

[15-Jul-18 02:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`No pool configs exists or are enabled in pool_configs folder.` is pretty self-explanatory

I heard somehting a while ago, that they were working on a new type of Pool Software, where the actual miner, builds the blocktemplate, rather than the pool.... Heard anything about that?

[15-Jul-18 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of fixes mining centralization totally if it works.

[15-Jul-18 02:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't see how that would work or why you'd want to

I think they already made it work...  When I get home later I will try and find some info about it. I thought the same thing, although if it works, theres not really any drawbacks to it.

[15-Jul-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Less power to massive pools can only be a good thing

Don't know why it isn't finding it

[15-Jul-18 02:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the drawback is that if I have to build from the template instead of a stratum subdividing work, then there's no sense in not just feken solo mining (aside from variance and donating to someone else's retirement fund)

[15-Jul-18 02:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and

[15-Jul-18 02:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you can't have a feken pool mining setup that promotes "decentralization"

[15-Jul-18 02:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
pool mining is the antithesis of decentralized

[15-Jul-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok so it was BTC core bullshit then really. lol

[15-Jul-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although I think the idea came from BCH camp first. Need to find some more info in it

@NutellaLicka can you post your coins and pool_configs files

[15-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
or pm

[16-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Trystaero#7522
Bitpoolmining.com is still donating all mining fees to the Komodo dev fund. The pool operators have also released their bitpool miner (BPM) that is completely free and open source. BPM allows remote monitoring as well as profitablity estimates from whattomine. Help the community grow by mining on bitpoolmining.com

If you get an asic, I think the first batch is most profitable and all subsequent batches are less profitable usually

If you believe the price will never increase you are correct.

[17-Jul-18 05:20 PM] Trystaero#7522
If you can speculate coins that have some actual development then you can mine them for future profit.

[17-Jul-18 05:20 PM] Trystaero#7522
Then again if you can't afford to mine or lose money then you shouldn't be in this market.

If you are a dedicated miner to KMD... then sell the GPUs and buy an asic to get better efficiency

[18-Jul-18 07:03 AM] jansako#3330
Anything going on with the KMD network? I see the nethash dropped to 2.8 Msols, yet I have not hit a block in over 36 hours (usually I get 3-4 a day)

[18-Jul-18 07:26 AM] Alright#0419
I see plenty of blocks being mined by stratums
