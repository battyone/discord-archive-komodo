I will keep that in mind,  pa is one giant natural gas pocket would love to have a box powered offgrid

[30-May-19 08:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's nice

[30-May-19 09:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
very nice. I think this is something I could invest some time in. would be cool to set up one or two and start an asset chain to distribute revenues.

[30-May-19 09:23 PM] actionslacks#4072

just a head's up, LABS's slow start phase is over. It's now emitting it's full block reward each block

[31-May-19 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
genie has a pool up at http://mininglabs.rocks/ web said he can have one up next week

Agama integration is about a day or two out. There is a test release with it included at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/ but I can't recommend using it until qa team does their final checks

who's in charge of labs? i'd like to them about listing on Chameleon

[31-May-19 06:38 PM] Alright#0419
Joker or I guess, quite a few people "in charge" though

[31-May-19 11:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
What ever happened to the idea of porting CHIPS to Verushash?

[31-May-19 11:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
CHIPS needs LN

[31-May-19 11:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@daemonfox

[31-May-19 11:30 PM] bishop#9773
LN is dependent on SHA256? Doesn't sound right

[31-May-19 11:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sounds like a solution to be had... a KMD coin with LN integration running the CPU, GPU and ASIC equalizing Verushash

[01-Jun-19 12:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Verushash is already in chips, but its not activated and is the old version. So its no longer CPU only.

[01-Jun-19 12:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can easily finish that off and go to 1.1, which is the version labs fungible chains use. No GPU miner for it, bit can easily be made.

[01-Jun-19 12:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
FPGA I think could also, but as chips br is so small I don't see that happening.

[01-Jun-19 12:07 AM] phm87#7395
algo change won't fix the small reward problem

[01-Jun-19 12:08 AM] phm87#7395
but I agree that another algo can attract other miners

[01-Jun-19 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It stops needing asic

[01-Jun-19 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sonits cheaper to mine

[01-Jun-19 12:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
James always said it should revert to CPU mining as block reward gets smller

[01-Jun-19 12:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But asic and stop chain dead if sha256 CPU mined chain.

[01-Jun-19 12:22 AM] phm87#7395
I put few cpu threads on Chips and my gpu when the chain stalled but my hashrate was not enough to make the chain move again

[01-Jun-19 12:22 AM] phm87#7395
Right now, only CG is mining Chips I think

[01-Jun-19 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly. Verushash was half done, I know have the skills to finish it now, if that's something ppl still want.

[01-Jun-19 12:23 AM] phm87#7395
I added Chips on my pool in a hurry (while I was at work :abusedsmily: ) but it was necessary

[01-Jun-19 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hold quite a few chips so can do that, most of my chips are owned by a group of ppl who told me to invest in the bubble, chips was the safest thing to not lose 90% lol

[01-Jun-19 12:24 AM] phm87#7395
if you do the PR, I can help you to test but I'd suggest you to read jl777 idea about algo change (he wrote it on chips discord). Thank you for your help and support blackjok3r

[01-Jun-19 12:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Np will do. After kmd hard fork I'll have a bit of time, hopefully I'll have that all finished by end of next week. And back to normal stuff the week after.

`Right now, only CG is mining Chips I think`
And that's joker's fault too :troll_lol:

[01-Jun-19 12:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m getting a miner on chips soon for shossain  as well

[01-Jun-19 12:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ideally if sha256 is to stay,  getting  merge mining going would help a lot

[01-Jun-19 12:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Algo change is trivial, verushash 1 is there already, but not being used. I can use that as an example to change it to whatever.

[01-Jun-19 12:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If want to leave sha256 go for it. Less work for me.

[01-Jun-19 12:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m not for or against any method at this point

[01-Jun-19 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With no block reward its pretty hard to fix, I think a 30s block time with some CPU alto would be OK, then some notaries can just mine if no miners are interested.

[01-Jun-19 12:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Merged mining solves the low reward problem however will require some coding and dedicated  pool operator to add chips, and then getting enough hashrate on the main coin to make it attractive .

[01-Jun-19 01:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Could even make it so that payouts of auxpow coins is all done in chips.  Just swapping on Dex .  Kill a couple birds there

[01-Jun-19 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Don't over complicate it, make it impossible for rogue miner to stall the chain and be done with it. Who cares if block reward is small. It has dpow for security, although slowing block time and reducing dpow to every 10 blocks is likely a good idea too.

[01-Jun-19 01:52 AM] dukeleto#7326

@klein i didn't rent hashpower, i put a z9m on it

[01-Jun-19 02:34 PM] klein#5233
30 mins @ 300w?

[01-Jun-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein not sure what you are asking. z9m's are 300w at stock hashrate, overclocked they are more like 450w I think

[01-Jun-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 z9m's can be OC'ed by 50% (500 Mhz to 750 Mhz)

[01-Jun-19 03:00 PM] klein#5233
Ok

[01-Jun-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein very roughly, a z9m will probably mine you about 20 LABS/day, with current hashrate. Obviously hashrate can change drastically at any moment, but that is a data point

[01-Jun-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326

`i did math on the back of a napkin, and there was actually no napkin`
doing that gets me into trouble at least once a week 😛

[01-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
my napkin math says about 16-17 LABS for a mini per day

So... if you like regular rig maintenance and have a lot of rigs... may I suggest the Ryobi 40V electric blower.  Mere seconds on turbo mode handles an asic cleaning with ease.

[10-Jun-19 10:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The miner on <https://minethechains.com> with the address `RA2tsiBC4HGoXNPGpoAFoTUcSMjYWNvxCo` your miner setup for miner `.RFOX1` has the incorrect configuration setup. 
It looks like you have no address worker, and have put your wallet address into the password section. If you'd like to continue to mine, you will have to rectify this. PM me if you need help.

[10-Jun-19 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326

@polycryptoblog interesting, i am buying some used A9's and some people never OC'ed theirs, so I am trying to figure out if they can be OC'ed or not, like batch 1 vs batch 2 z9m's. I hear reports that some A9's won't OC, but I don't see talk about "batches"
