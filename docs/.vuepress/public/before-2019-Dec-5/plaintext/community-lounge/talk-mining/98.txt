lol I've been running ~450k of my own hash on there for weeks now 😛

[11-Feb-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
nice

[11-Feb-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I keep hoping some folks will use it and then I can go back to soloing 😁

[11-Feb-19 06:53 PM] jansako#3330
you are kinda soloing if it is just your hash... I would point my rentals there if you were to get the profit switching set up & include Pirate & the other traded ecosystem coins. I am sure there would be others as well.
I understand you are already being pulled in many directions & at some point the time & infrastructure investment may be out of proportion to the results.

[11-Feb-19 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The substantive difference between between soloing and mining alone in the public pool is a question of latency and how many of those 5 orphans may have been recognized. Obviously a small percentage, but still a measurable difference.

[11-Feb-19 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
profit switcher being functional is 2-3 weeks out depending on a couple current involvements.
That being said, it will not ever include pirate because that would involve accounts and I have objections to using logins/accounts

[11-Feb-19 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` & at some point the time & infrastructure investment may be out of proportion to the results.`
It has been since day 1 and I imaging that I might hit a break-even point somewhere around 2037 😛

[11-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jansako#3330
Right, Pirate has it's own addresses. The more (somewhat) liquid ones of the other coins in the ecosystem you can include... then connect that 'transaction watcher' that some people are running on the asset chains.... hmmm now I am dreaming, I know but... how else would you know that someone appreciates your work if you never get an attaboy for it?

[11-Feb-19 07:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` Pirate has it's own addresses.`
It's not about the address, itself; it has a different key structure so you can't use a shared key address to mine across other coins and it at the same time

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as the mechanics of the switcher, it's a combination of current block diff and current market price

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] jansako#3330
that was a user friendly way of saying why it does not work

[11-Feb-19 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't "user-friendly"_

[11-Feb-19 07:14 PM] jansako#3330

You can always use https://minethechains.com we offer both KMD and Pirate mining :)

[12-Feb-19 01:02 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's not profit switching. But all you have to do is change the port number. It's super simple

[12-Feb-19 01:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you could just code for it's different key structure. Make your username an integer that defaults to the string of your shared key wallet if nothing is entered otherwise specify it.

[12-Feb-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@BlackJesus I've given it thought and imo, it would be too confusing for users to have a username that is 2 pubkeys or even using 1 of them as pw

[12-Feb-19 01:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Your the only person using the code right? I mean worse comes to worse someone doesn't change your default public key and they mine to you lol.

[12-Feb-19 01:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Just store a default string pub key and call it when the field is empty

[12-Feb-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
each miner has their own pubkey

[12-Feb-19 01:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You're mining to multiple pub keys?

[12-Feb-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1

[12-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with profit-switch, instead of address, you use a pubkey that works across multiple different coins
z addys and transparent addys don't even share the same *type* of keying, so it will not work the same way

[12-Feb-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the user would have to supply *both* z and t

[12-Feb-19 01:27 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Oh ok

Someones knows when these Trex? Wallets are moved

[13-Feb-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
knowing is only 1/4 of it, you still gotta be the 1st to block it too ☹

[13-Feb-19 01:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes I did not look at the diff but I can imagine it goes up a few blocks before so he makes sure we has like 90% of the hashrate

[13-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Alright#0419
it's the same person or entity doing it over and over

[13-Feb-19 08:31 PM] jorian#4555
the weird thing is that a notary node mined a block just 3 seconds before a big block reward was mined. i really wonder how that happens

[13-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jorian#4555
it's almost impossible to catch an incoming big block reward, crank up your miners and mine the block all within 3 seconds

[13-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jorian#4555
or i just don't understand the way transactions work in KMD

[13-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are the one not claiming the interest

[13-Feb-19 08:33 PM] jorian#4555
are you saying an exchange deliberately makes those block rewards to mine them shortly after?

[13-Feb-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you know it is an exchange?

[13-Feb-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
I do believe whoever it is has prior knowledge that it will be happening

[13-Feb-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
and the only reasonable guess I can come up with as to why they would be doing that is to skirt around some kind of regulation

[13-Feb-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
And they're watching these channels 😂

[13-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
last time it happened I pointed out that is was the same address over and over

[13-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
they changed it, but the new addresses are still linked to the previous address

[13-Feb-19 11:37 PM] Alright#0419

need to get more miners already

@Alright unless its an exchange employee or someone managing cold wallets that does it without the clients/boss’ knowledge

@SHossain what freq were you running them at?

[14-Feb-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
just normal. no overclocking at all

[14-Feb-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
about 44k i guess

[14-Feb-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ouch

[14-Feb-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain did you force the fans to run at a lower RPM ? i vaguely remember you saying something about that

[14-Feb-19 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
I kept everything running normal and default.

[14-Feb-19 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
No change at all

[14-Feb-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain depending on your batch, they have diff shelf-lives. You should be able to either 1) underclock all hashboards so that they all run OR 2) remove one hash board and then run the others at normal/OC/etc speeds

[14-Feb-19 06:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
they will run with either 1, 2 or 3 hashboards inside. CG probably knows much more

[14-Feb-19 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes people burn a hashboard and still run it with 2. And somepeople re-organize the hashboards in many miners, so that they can OC some miners more, and concentrate hashboards that will only run slower into a few miners. that shit is beyond what i do, but i know people do it

[14-Feb-19 06:12 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @dukeleto. i pulled out the plug yesterday. will test the boards in few days when i get some free time

[14-Feb-19 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`they will run with either 1, 2 or 3 hashboards inside. CG probably knows much more`
At one point I had like a dozen S9s running like that
Until we had enough bad boards to justify the down time, we just unplugged and depowered the bad boards and went on

_looks, doesn't see equihash or verushash, and goes back about things that matter_ :troll:

[15-Feb-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've thought about getting some FPGAs, but really haven't had time to look into them well enough recently

[15-Feb-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that fpga was the one with secret verushash algo, and their are private bitstreams for various equihash (N,K) variants, but if ASICs exist, doesn't make sense to make bitstreams

🤔 

[15-Feb-19 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326

some of those algos are no doubt in dev or currently private bitstreams from HAC

[15-Feb-19 04:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
they actually list "verus 100 GH/s" but i think that is the old v1 algo

[15-Feb-19 04:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is why the blackminers are way easier/simpler to setup/maintain, cheaper, but less potential profit

[15-Feb-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
and how you value your time really matters. I value things that can run with very low maintenance, a lot
