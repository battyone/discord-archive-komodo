0.0001 block rewards.

[26-Feb-19 10:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
yeah buddy.

[26-Feb-19 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_made a good bit of $ mining SUPERNET at 0.0001 :P_

[26-Feb-19 10:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
all ACs can have their tiny BR + txfees mined, that makes the chain go

[26-Feb-19 10:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 good point

[26-Feb-19 10:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can mine DEX, various other "funds"

[26-Feb-19 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at the time I didn't mine DEX because a poor friend asked me to stay away 😛

[26-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
*ROI'd a 1080 ti in ~5 days mining DEX this time last year*

[26-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
🤣

[26-Feb-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
speaking of the poor friend 😛

[26-Feb-19 10:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
I CPU mined a bunch of ARRR blocks before CG put the asics on it

[26-Feb-19 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL you can't blame me for PIRATE, I mined 5 blocks with GPU and then when I came back people were already using NH

[26-Feb-19 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given my current position, I was actually late to the party

[26-Feb-19 10:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
🖤

[26-Feb-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
speaking of my current position, another 22 cents on KMD and I can buy more miners 😄

[26-Feb-19 10:13 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
So, based on the suggestion, ( not financial advise ) if I am mining ETC at 1,003 Mh/s pulling down 77.33953 ETC / 0.086233 BTC = estimated $337.973 a month; it would be better just to flip that into KMD then to dip my big toe in with a Z9 mini .. trying to run the numbers and get a little smarter.

[26-Feb-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd advise selling all your AMD stuff and buying A9+s

[26-Feb-19 10:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
ETH mining HW is very geared to mining eth

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, AMD rawks at that

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can probably mine VRSC on those GPUs, but you want asics for equihash

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
and new vrsc v2 algo is not kind to GPUs

[26-Feb-19 10:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, there are FPGAs on VRSC now, at least 2 kinds

[26-Feb-19 10:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WoundedxWarr1or and yes, you could buy $337 in KMD per month, and start getting 5% kmd apr on that, and mine KMD and/or ARRR/HUSH/ZEC/etc...

[26-Feb-19 10:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
but you want to mine on asics

[26-Feb-19 10:17 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Thanks, I have been looking at the FPGA Blackminer F1 which has currently about 10 bitstreams; it just came down $500 bucks for the double hashing board model.

[26-Feb-19 10:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i will probably be getting some soon

[26-Feb-19 10:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is the single, double and 3 board options now

[26-Feb-19 10:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
F1 is great for VRSC

[26-Feb-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and new vrsc v2 algo is not kind to GPUs`
Neither was v1 for the longest time

[26-Feb-19 10:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't know a lot about the other bitstreams

[26-Feb-19 10:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
you could also diversify, and mine XMR/CN coins with your GPUs

[26-Feb-19 10:18 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
My rigs are paid for as of August 2017 .. I had 12 rigs then and sold 8 rigs to finance equipment upgrades / asic / fpga ..

[26-Feb-19 10:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are something like over 50 cryptonote forks, but which ones have secret fpgas changes by the minute

[26-Feb-19 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the 1st GPU miner for v1, a 1080TI had less hash than a i7-6700k

[26-Feb-19 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Meanwhile in useless news:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX z_gettotalbalance
{
  "transparent": "996387.33122225",```
Sometime in the next 2 days I'll hit 1M MGNX 😛

I appreciate the insight; I have tried to do a lot of reading as I am not smart on using ASIC / FPGA's.

[26-Feb-19 10:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has too many GPUs collecting dust to invest in FPGAs right now ☹_

[26-Feb-19 10:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
ASICS  are pretty much plug and play, some tuning and tweaks but pretty easy.  FPGAs except for blackminer require a bit more technical expertise

[26-Feb-19 10:27 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Do you know anyone who tried the Blackminer F1; and or if they like it?

[26-Feb-19 10:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A couple of the youtube miners I’ve watch like it, read good things but not personally .  Looks like it runs pretty much like an asic

[26-Feb-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
Blackminer company/community did some really shady shit to VRSC. Would not recommend supporting them

[26-Feb-19 10:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"shady shit"?

[26-Feb-19 10:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
With Verus new FPGA that’s dirt cheap  they may have competitors

[26-Feb-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 tried to keep it secret for as long as possible

[26-Feb-19 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I spent that much to dev an FPGA, you'd still not know it existed

[26-Feb-19 10:32 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
I was also looking into a low voltage FPGA called an atom miner; but I cannot find any feedback on it; so I am not sure if it is a scam, and have not been able to get a reply from the website but if it is true; it wouldn't take a large solar setup to run.  About a six AGM battery bank to run 64 FPGA atom miner cards.

[26-Feb-19 10:33 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
Well, got to run, thanks again for the info; Noice Community.

[26-Feb-19 10:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[26-Feb-19 10:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Nice chatting with you

[26-Feb-19 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
genie I can understand why they do such things, but their entire business model is based around secretly mining with FPGAs. They just chew up and spit out low mcap coins as they go

[26-Feb-19 10:35 PM] WoundedxWarr1or#7746
likewise .. ciao.

[26-Feb-19 10:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WoundedxWarr1or i also wasnt' sure if atomminer was a scam. i talked to one of the dudes. i have never seen a YT review of it

Wht is ARRR? new coin ?

[28-Feb-19 05:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Newish yeah. It started in August last year

[28-Feb-19 05:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a forced z transaction privacy coin (no blockchain data) that is secured by dpow

This is a really nice profit calc for Blackminer F1's: https://www.hashaltcoin.com/en/calculation

[28-Feb-19 07:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC is still the most profitable coin to mine on their FPGAs

[01-Mar-19 01:32 PM] figgy132#7531
Hiya, when setting up znomp/kmdnomp, does it need to be installed on a different pc from the pc you are mining on or can you just run ccminer/whatever on the same instance? At the moment im trying to mine from the same pc that ive installed it on, but it doesnt seem to connect properly :)

[01-Mar-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
firewall would be the only thing stopping it on same or different PC

[01-Mar-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as you don't have port errors

[01-Mar-19 02:04 PM] figgy132#7531
No port errors, tried firewall both enabled & disabled - enabled the ports too - scratching head :)

[01-Mar-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is the exact error message you're getting?

[01-Mar-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and is the version of ccminer you're using one that includes equihash?

[01-Mar-19 02:15 PM] figgy132#7531
...retry after 30 seconds - can't remember ccminer version, just built it from source from github

[01-Mar-19 02:15 PM] figgy132#7531
2.3.1
