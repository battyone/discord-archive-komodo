so if <T, it halves the target

[06-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if 1T to 2T, it divides target by 3

[06-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if more than 3T, it divides the target by 4

[06-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
just my seeing the targets for the 3 minutes, being on average much much harder than what is eventually solved

[06-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is what allowed it to gain in difficulty, even while the blocks are slow

[06-Aug-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and very roughly correlates to the average target for that block

[06-Aug-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
probably you can make a much more precise set of linear approximations. i found the elapsed time worked the best

[06-Aug-19 12:37 PM] zawy#5864
I am not following.  These devisions are the adjustment to ct[]?

[06-Aug-19 12:38 PM] zawy#5864
before RST? and digi, i guess, but only if they were RST blocks?

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you said to put into digishield and the loop as close to the actual difficulty

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so they would retarget based on the most accurate dta

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] zawy#5864
which is strictly 2x what was solved

[06-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it takes 3 minutes the average is a lot harder than double

[06-Aug-19 12:40 PM] zawy#5864
The average over the 3 minutes was 2x what was solved at 3 minutes

[06-Aug-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i have it printing out and it might start at 50x harder rapidly reduce to 10x harder, but then slowly get easier

[06-Aug-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe i misunderstood

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but we needed to feed into the digishield and the RST, harder targets than was actually solved

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise the diff never really went up

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] zawy#5864
Right, if they were RST targets

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, only if RST

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] zawy#5864
and we feed 1/2 the target

[06-Aug-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
a 10 second RST solve would be very close to the average target during the entire 10 seconds

[06-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
a 600 second RST solve would be very far away, maybe 300 seconds away

[06-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so as a rough estimation, i increased the divisor based on solvetime

[06-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and magically the diff is going up now even as blocks are coming in slower

[06-Aug-19 12:43 PM] zawy#5864
ok, right, yes your intiution correctly refused to go along with my logic.  I need to figure out what we need to have exactly

[06-Aug-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
I am always making errors going the opposite way, especially with diff and targets, so i usually try both and see which works better

[06-Aug-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
probably there is a way to calculate the exact divisor needed, but i only have 3 values inside nBits now. probably can get a few more if needed

[06-Aug-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking of doing (1 << bits), to get up to 8x, but i noticed that the 100x period is very short, and it rapidly gets to 20x and below

[06-Aug-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so i stuck with 2x, 3x, 4x. of course the 2x, 3x, 4x can be any divisor and the solvetime threshold can be at any fractional T

[06-Aug-19 12:52 PM] zawy#5864
actual target = solved target/(t/T) \* 0.693

[06-Aug-19 12:52 PM] zawy#5864
I thnik

[06-Aug-19 12:53 PM] zawy#5864
oh wait

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
chain stabilized at diff of 35

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
RST not triggering

[06-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
can do a 2x or 1000x test from here

[06-Aug-19 01:00 PM] zawy#5864
1000x

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] zawy#5864
no, have you done 3x?

[06-Aug-19 01:02 PM] zawy#5864
my estimate is that it will resolve in 8 to 11 blocks

[06-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i can do a 3x

[06-Aug-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
3x started for ht.150

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
leading into the diff is quite stable

[06-Aug-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
strange, RST not activating

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
probably another implementation error

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] zawy#5864
10 blocks after RST stops, send me all the blocks

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it hasnt started

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
shouldnt the above blocks have triggered it?

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] zawy#5864
no

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] zawy#5864
sum last 3  STs  < T/2

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] zawy#5864
50% chance of activating in 6 blocks

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is why we need the 6x and 12x!

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] zawy#5864
yes

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess that was demonstrated

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] zawy#5864
really, even W=6 only has 50% chance in 6 blocks

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what about W=12?

[06-Aug-19 01:18 PM] zawy#5864
~ 75% chance in 12

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
SMA wont work better for these smaller increases?

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it seemed to adjust diff pretty fast. maybe we use the SMA to catch the smaller ones?

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] zawy#5864
SMA N=7 triggers if last 7 <  T\*7/3

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess i was thinking more the 15x attacks...

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
26 blocks in 16 minutes

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
its the same as boiling a frog. you get much better results with a gradual increase, than all of a sudden

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] zawy#5864
SMA triggers a lot easier, but it only increases a little

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
a little is better than nothing (digishield)

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] zawy#5864
what's D now?

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
44

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ht 180

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
I definitely expected 3x to be detected in 12 blocks

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
with W=3

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a bug

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
we had 5, 18, 8 -> 31 seconds

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
It may be fixed with W=6 and 12.  Let me do a test.....make digishield stable as fast as you can...drop hashrate to about 1.5x

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] zawy#5864
maybe 2

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] zawy#5864
2x

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
reduced to 12 cores at ht 188

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] zawy#5864
once digishield is stable and average past 17 blocks is 60 seconds, do 6x attack.....if W=3 detects it in 3 to 5 blocks, all is well.

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
6x attack.. i need to reduce to 2 cores then

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] zawy#5864
That means W=6 would see 3x in 6 to 10

[06-Aug-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
actual target = solved target/(t/T) * 0.693
that seems to mean my 2x, 3x, 4x at T, 2T, 3T is not so far off. probably makes it a bit more difficult for the smaller t, but much less so the larger t gets

[06-Aug-19 01:46 PM] zawy#5864
that eq doesn't work at t=1, but being like your method except linear with what I was trying to do

[06-Aug-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so i should set the thresholds at multiples of 1.44T?

[06-Aug-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
or 0.693T

[06-Aug-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is taking forever for diff to come down. even if i mine with 1 core, it is finding blocks at diff of 30, sometimes in less than a minute

[06-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i have to turn off the mining for 7 minutes and let the exp() kick in. repeat, then i think in 5 blocks it will be at low diff

[06-Aug-19 02:15 PM] zawy#5864
I just want to see iteerspond to 3x        after        targets are stable for 17 blocks and timespan between them is about 17xT

[06-Aug-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
3x test or 6x test next?

[06-Aug-19 02:16 PM] zawy#5864
6x

[06-Aug-19 02:16 PM] zawy#5864
right

[06-Aug-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i think i got the diff down. now needs 17 stable blocks

[06-Aug-19 02:44 PM] zawy#5864
From what I can determine, the proper target is something I can't even plot in excel because it involves the  imaginary error function. ```adjTar = Tar*(ln(t) - sqrt(pi/2)*erfi(sqrt(ln(t)) / t )^2 / t```

[06-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe i just stay with 2x, 3x and 4x. imaginary numbers give me headache

[06-Aug-19 02:46 PM] zawy#5864
it's only called that because it can handle imagniary numbers.

[06-Aug-19 02:46 PM] zawy#5864
we do not input them

[06-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
good, i will only get an imaginary headache 😃

[06-Aug-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we just need some rough approximation, as the feedback process will correct things if it overshoots

[06-Aug-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe it behaves totally differently at 10000x

[06-Aug-19 03:01 PM] zawy#5864
I need to redo the gernal loop idea of looking at past blocks and checking emission rate and adjusting based on CST  with an EMA difficulty algorithm

[06-Aug-19 03:03 PM] zawy#5864
so it would be 1 equation that would be more aggressive in proportion to number of blocks behind and faster recent solve speeds
