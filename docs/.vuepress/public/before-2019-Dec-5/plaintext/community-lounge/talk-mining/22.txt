either bad luck or your stratum is messed up somehow

[18-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Alright#0419
when was the last time you updated komodod?

[18-Jul-18 07:34 AM] jansako#3330
last week

[18-Jul-18 07:34 AM] jansako#3330
yeah, I see blocks going too...

[18-Jul-18 07:35 AM] jansako#3330
just thought the network hash is unusually low, at least since I started keeping an eye on it

[18-Jul-18 07:43 AM] jansako#3330
not low any more

[18-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Alright#0419
One way to know if it's working would be to point a good amount of hash from nicehash at it

[18-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
I typically do that after setting up a stratum as I'm paranoid as to whether or not it's working

[18-Jul-18 07:46 AM] jansako#3330
It was finding blocks just fine, last tone on Monday night, so I know it was working. No errors or anything on the z-nomp side, wallet seems in sync. Guess I will wait another 12 hours or so to see if it was just bad luck.

[18-Jul-18 07:47 AM] jansako#3330
thanks man!

[18-Jul-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I didnâ€™t get a block yesterday either after at least 3 a day the days before. Strange but probably just my luck with low hash

[18-Jul-18 01:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Although the network hash did seem a bit less

[18-Jul-18 03:50 PM] jansako#3330
both of us no luck at the same time with about the same hash... helluva coincidence. Would you ping me when you do get one? I suspect you are on a z9 mini too? Don't see what I can do about it, just want to know.

[18-Jul-18 06:15 PM] jansako#3330
I just got a block, looks like it is working after all... that was along streak of bad luck though...

[18-Jul-18 09:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Iâ€™ve gotten a lot today hah my luck changed right after I said that @jansako

[18-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You guys using z9 minis?

[18-Jul-18 10:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[18-Jul-18 11:44 PM] marv101#8481
What mining pool are you using with your z9mini?

[18-Jul-18 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think k most are solo mining here

[18-Jul-18 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just a single z9 will find blocks solo

[18-Jul-18 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For now

[19-Jul-18 12:53 AM] marktyler#0324
If you put a z9 on a pool you will make ~12kmd a day

[19-Jul-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Solo your getting more than that, although likely not a lot more.

[19-Jul-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Makes me sad, my rig was getting almost a block per day, doubtful it would fine one in a week now. Sits retired on a bench, all its good for is generating vanity address's lol

[19-Jul-18 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess I should order a bunch of motherboards and CPU's and turn all those 280X into cheap gaming computers to sell on facebook lol.

[19-Jul-18 04:10 AM] BlackJesus#6161
yea

[19-Jul-18 04:10 AM] BlackJesus#6161
the same to dismantle rigs was awhile ago

I'm still looking for pool. Can anyone help?

[19-Jul-18 10:20 AM] Trystaero#7522
Bitpoolmining.com is an up and coming pool. Lots of great things happening with the pool operators @marv101

Why dismantle the rigs

[19-Jul-18 03:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Arenâ€™t there profitable GPU coins still around?

[19-Jul-18 03:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mine monero

[19-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nevermind looks like monero isnâ€™t profitable

[19-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Eth?

[19-Jul-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Arenâ€™t there profitable GPU coins still around?`
only about a thousand of them :trollface:

@marv101 what kind of equipment do you have?

[19-Jul-18 06:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Off set  your gpu rigs/less profitable asics loss with other miners profit when looking to build up bags.  Ex. 1 mini is making like 25ish a day profit. Off that one mini you could cover the electric cost of 7-8 L3++.  Reduces taxable gain too

Hi. I'm running a z9 mini

[19-Jul-18 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@marv101 if you're running a mini, then your best bet is looking into running your own pool (like znomp) and not giving away your hard earned KMD

[19-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Bla5t_Tyrant#0494
When kmd does the notary fork once per year, will that make the Z9 useless for kmd mining?  I'm looking into mining kmd.  Right now i have a gpu rig mining eth.

[19-Jul-18 09:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
all the notary fork means is that new notaries replace the old ones

[19-Jul-18 09:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
just like voting new board members into office doesn't change your shares or ability to trade shares

Any idea how much kmd I can mine with a 2700x? LMAO doubt itd be anything worthwhile, but in case it is ðŸ˜›

[20-Jul-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not likley, although I saw a node or 2 CPU mine a block a few times during f4a so its possible if you left it on 24/7 for long enough or got crazy lucky.

[20-Jul-18 08:25 AM] marv101#8481
@ComputerGenie I guess this is more complicated, right? Am I or supposed to run a server or something? In fact me an my friend together have and will have more z9 minis... so will be even more worth to do that.

You can run Agama or the swing wallet instead of compiling Komodo manually, if you have GUI access to the computer.

[20-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
You'll likely hit some snags if you follow that guide or the z-nomp README

how to setup masternode for komodo?

[22-Jul-18 06:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
check #talk-general

[22-Jul-18 09:06 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
@frkrngl  .. there is no masternode to be set up.
There are notary nodes (64) but for this you need to be elected.. happens once a year.

[22-Jul-18 09:08 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Im not sure about the z9 .. new batches coming in and not many equihash coins open for Asic.. meaning that those algo's will see explosion of difficulty. meaning plummiting rewards for miners... but for 850$ for a mini.. it is not a big investment and might be an entree level into asics to experience first hand.

[22-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
a mini will basically be the equivalent to a 1080 ti now by september

[22-Jul-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
or well a 1080 ti a couple months ago

[22-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Alright#0419
rewards stay the same ðŸ˜‰

i guess some people are GPU mining Verus already, eh?

[23-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
^ Heard it wasnt worth it compared to cpu. I hope not, got a looooot of miners sitting back ready to have a go next week ðŸ˜›

[23-Jul-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The biggest current issue with GPU mining VRSC is PCIe bandwidth. Depending on setup, the hashrate of a 1080Ti ranges anywhere from 2-145 MH/s. GPU slotted direct to 16x in board is best (and even an unpowered 16x riser will drop rate some) and 1x-16x riser slotted in 1x gen2 port is the worst.

[23-Jul-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
board, slot, power, CPU, and w/out riser(s) all play a big role in what a card does with Verus

[23-Jul-18 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
best results I had on my z170-pro was with only 1 1080Ti and it was direct in slot

[23-Jul-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because of how the board is laned, just the act of having 2 cards on that board drops card0 by 31% (from 145 to 101) ðŸ˜¦

[23-Jul-18 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is good news for CPU miners

[23-Jul-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also it benefits small time GPU miners with just a few cards in a normal setup, instead of crazy riser monstrosity setups. Those big GPU farms won't switch to Verus

[23-Jul-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
but a few smalltime GPU people with cards that are almost worthless, sounds like we get a few of them

[23-Jul-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya, my i7 6700k is ~ on par with a 1080Ti on this board if I have 2 Tis on it

[23-Jul-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
People might not build new GPU rigs just for Verus, but they will repurpose old ones

[23-Jul-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
my local craiglists is about 40% people selling old GPU mining rigs, it's crazy

[23-Jul-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't think anybody around here knew what mining was

[23-Jul-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
CPU has a big impact on how well the GPU does, too
i7 + 1080TI kicks ass of i5 + 1080Ti

[23-Jul-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
most "re-purposed" GPU rigs will likely need a CPU upgrade because of the transfer demands of Verus

[23-Jul-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That seems like the limitation in the software that Decker was talking about... GPU mining should not rely on CPU.

[23-Jul-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and how else do you propose to get the info **to** the GPU?

[23-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's very interesting to see a coin that has CPUs with higher hashrate than GPUs. Has a coin like that ever existed?

[23-Jul-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not afaik

[23-Jul-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are CPU only coins.... that need like 8GB of ram n some crazy dumb shit... pretty much just cannot mine on GPU.

[23-Jul-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if the miner is better GPU could be better... A far as I know the Verus miner still needs AVX CPU, so thats likely what is using the CPU, but I havent tried to read the code or anything.

[23-Jul-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
most "CPU only coins" are "CPU only coins" because no one has been assed to create a way to send the instruction set to a GPU

[23-Jul-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@blackjok3r I've been ass-deep in the GPU miner code all morning ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Jul-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
decker piped a version that works with no AES, but since I have a real CPU, I dunno how well it works with one without AES

[23-Jul-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am runnig VRSC on my notary node using the non-AES verison....

[23-Jul-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems its terrible even at staking and creating transactions

[23-Jul-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
which is weird, because the only time I could find those calls in the code was in the miner part. ðŸ˜•

[23-Jul-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, pretty much all it does is dump the instruction set to the GPU, beyond that, it's RPC miner like most any other

[23-Jul-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have a question about z9 minis and running znomp. Does it really make sense to run a znomp instance for just one z9 mini? Is it just to save the pool fee, or are their more reasons relating to vardiff not being set correctly for ASICs?

the znomp docs itself say "setting this up is more than a full time job", so does it really make sense to run for one or a few z9s? I can see if you have a big farm like @ComputerGenie then it makes sense

[23-Jul-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
lern me good, genie of the computer

[23-Jul-18 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@dukeleto 
1) The main thing is how much you support decentralization; pools = centralized
2) The "full time" thing came from NOMP and the ability to set it up and run a public pool; not anything to do with solo
3) Do you enjoy donating 1-3% of your currency to some random stranger so that you don't have to spend an hr or 2 setting up your own stuff?

[23-Jul-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie it all comes down to the real estimate of time for 3, and ongoing maintenance

[23-Jul-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
luckpool's fee is 0.5%, too ðŸ˜ƒ

[23-Jul-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If I ever experience my first bout of "ongoing maintenance", then I might be able to address that part

[23-Jul-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
I like the idea of solo mining, if znomp was trivial, i wouldn't even ask. But I have heard many people complain about it being fragile and needing constant babysitting. Maybe that is not the case
