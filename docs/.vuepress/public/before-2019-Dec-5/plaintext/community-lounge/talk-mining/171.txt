why cant it be >= solvetime more than past block

[10-Aug-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if only the hash is made a bit smaller based on tipdiff, it doesnt allow grinding

[10-Aug-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
as solvetime is not affected

[10-Aug-19 04:46 PM] zawy#5864
Hash affects ST which affects VDFout

[10-Aug-19 04:46 PM] zawy#5864
```hash = RandValue / (UTXO qty)```

[10-Aug-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[10-Aug-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the next solvetime

[10-Aug-19 04:47 PM] zawy#5864
Yes, that's the grinding attack...increases chances for next block

[10-Aug-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
```hash = RandValue /( (UTXO qty)*f(tipdiff))```

[10-Aug-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
how can changing tipdiff allow grinding, the hash just gets smaller and smaller. it either wins or doesnt

[10-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if it wins, getting smaller wont make it win anymore. and you would submit the first timestamp that wins

[10-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
within FTL

[10-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
Randvalue = function(UTXO, pubkey, previous VDFout)

[10-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
entropy source is not affected by the timestamp directly

[10-Aug-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
VDFout is unchanged

[10-Aug-19 04:50 PM] zawy#5864
It seems if he wins by 10 seconds, then he can choose 10 different solvetimes

[10-Aug-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but the timestamp goes into the block and doesnt change the txid

[10-Aug-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
using the utxo txid allows grinding

[10-Aug-19 04:50 PM] zawy#5864
Changes VDFout

[10-Aug-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i am saying that the calculated solvetime is not changed

[10-Aug-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
just the hash calculation of whether it is lower than bnTarget

[10-Aug-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing else changes

[10-Aug-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
indirectly if the DAA is using timestamps, maybe you can affect things, but make the DAA use the solvetime that is calculated

[10-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that avoids the grinding via indirect timestamp changing to change the next solvetime

[10-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is risk to delaying the timestamp

[10-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
as you need to wait longer due to small FTL and can easily lose the block

[10-Aug-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this does also spread out the timing of submissions

[10-Aug-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it also allows nodes that cant calculate VDF within solvetime to still have a chance

[10-Aug-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe its not a big deal

[10-Aug-19 04:54 PM] zawy#5864
if he gets an improbaby fast solve with tipdiff then he can run 10 different VDFs for 10 different tipdiffs going into future by 1 second each, risking no one else with a solve in next 10 seconds.  He gets 10x more opportunity in next block

[10-Aug-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but i am saying that there is only a SINGLE valid VDF solvetime

[10-Aug-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
only a single valid VDF that is not based on tipdiff

[10-Aug-19 04:55 PM] zawy#5864
OK, then what is the tipdiff-affected hash being used for if not to reduce the solvetime?

[10-Aug-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
changes an otherwise losing hash to a winning one

[10-Aug-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
this also allows to adapt to large changes in amount staking

[10-Aug-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
at least large drops

[10-Aug-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the VDF Solvetime is not changed

[10-Aug-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
only whether a hash wins or not is changed by tipdiff

[10-Aug-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess this will affect the next solvetime if you use timestamps to calculate that, but i am saying ignore the timestamp, only use the "VDF Solvetime" for the DAA

[10-Aug-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
make the tipdiff not affect the next Solvetime, nor the current VDF

[10-Aug-19 05:03 PM] zawy#5864
```solvetime = 2*RandValue * T / avg(N prev STs) / avg(N prev Targets)  / QTY   /   f(tipdiff) ```  What is the f() ?

[10-Aug-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
no, dont change the solvetime

[10-Aug-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just the hash evaluation

[10-Aug-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
f() is a "soft" function, maybe a very weak exp()

[10-Aug-19 05:05 PM] zawy#5864
Make the hash harder than ST requires?  Validator is checking both VDF and tipdiff?

[10-Aug-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
make the hash solve gradually harder and harder bnTarget, so over time the hash used becomes smaller and smaller

[10-Aug-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes all nodes would need to verify the VDF has the right solvetime and that the modified hash did indeed solve the bnTarget

[10-Aug-19 05:07 PM] zawy#5864
There would be a DA for the VDF and a DA for the tipdiff hash?

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
no, just DA for VDF

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
well maybe that wont work quite right

[10-Aug-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess torn between preventing grinding and precise DA

[10-Aug-19 05:10 PM] zawy#5864
I thought my idea here to let block-winner set a conversion between VDF and realtime is probably ideal...we sort of need to know that value directly and it prevents the grinding.

[10-Aug-19 05:10 PM] zawy#5864
slowly set with 0.01% change per block

[10-Aug-19 05:11 PM] zawy#5864
More generally, I want the stakers to have more control of coin parameters than devs

[10-Aug-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that gets into powers not available for using VDF-PoS in an existing blockchain

[10-Aug-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
which is the first step that makes sense to do

[10-Aug-19 05:11 PM] zawy#5864
they can react to market and real world conditions

[10-Aug-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with tipdiff making otherwise losing hashes win, pretty sure we can get pretty immediate very close to realtime timestamps

[10-Aug-19 05:12 PM] zawy#5864
I don't understand this ```not available for using VDF-PoS in an existing blockchain```

[10-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
existing chains are not setup to change chainparams with every block

[10-Aug-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can add that as anything can eventually be done, but it would be more work to do just that, than everything else combined

[10-Aug-19 05:17 PM] zawy#5864
To get the all-important constant value without fiat, stakers need to set difficulty for the POW to mine coins in self-hashing txns.  Being able to surive 51% without BTC like my scheme is supposed to do is good, but the real power is if it can be made stable value without fiat.....a big experiment to see if stakers will act to get constant value as I hope.    Speculation greatly reduced, merchants not needing to worry about price fluctuations.

[10-Aug-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i solved stable coins using a different method

[10-Aug-19 05:18 PM] zawy#5864
Everyone can join now, or later, and rent mining equipement to get any amount of coin.

[10-Aug-19 05:19 PM] zawy#5864
Ok, tell me your method

[10-Aug-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralized so users decide when to issue more coins, or when to take coins out of circulation

[10-Aug-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in #cc-pegs channel, a page up from current is a decent description of it

[10-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the VDF-PoS needs to be conflated with stable coin, that seems an independent thing that can be done regardless of mining algo

[10-Aug-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, even if they are independent, they can always be combined

[10-Aug-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i also have a way to get DTO (decentralized trustless oracle) so we can force the chain to adjust to actual fiat values

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

[10-Aug-19 05:26 PM] zawy#5864
a  peg.....I'm talking about not having a peg to anything other than constant real-world cost to mine... not in dollars but in whatever buyers and sellers think constant value means, assuming stakers act in the best interest of stable value.    If moore's law were constant or predictable, I would not need the stakers to act as an oracle of current mining costs.

[10-Aug-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure, interesting idea, but it seems small holders would vote to increase, but large ones to decrease to protect their existing stake

[10-Aug-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
VEO is a coin that had the miners vote on blockreward

[10-Aug-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it rapidly went to the smallest amount and it only has 60,000 supply

[10-Aug-19 05:31 PM] zawy#5864
Does its price on an exchange keep a more stable value?

[10-Aug-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
no, as volatile as any other crypto

[10-Aug-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but they werent instructed to peg to a fiat, their self interest made them shrink the reward

[10-Aug-19 05:38 PM] zawy#5864
There can be many coins using this  scheme, but only ones with constant value should gain in popularity.   So current miners in VEO must also be large stakers.  I need to take a good look at VEO.  Even if it is not a perdictor of how my scheme would go, it's a valuable data point in understanding feedback

[10-Aug-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a PoW coin, but has the concept of miners voting on rewards

[10-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is why i think it makes sense to separate out the various parts of your proposed DAG

[10-Aug-19 05:39 PM] zawy#5864
Yes but it's not clear to me that my idea would work out any different.

[10-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
each can be tested and tuned in isolation

[10-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i suggested using DTO to force it to match some sort of fiat value

[10-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
Yeah, for sure, if it's hard (or pointless as in the VEO case) to do staker-directed emission, then I can have a normal emission schedule and two difficulties...1 for VDF-POS and 1 for POW.  Can you do self-hashing transactions?

[10-Aug-19 05:41 PM] zawy#5864
Self-hashing txns and a simple DAG seem like thay would have enormous interest.

[10-Aug-19 05:42 PM] zawy#5864
Automatically no pool

[10-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i already have a -ac_txpow mode where each tx needs to have a txid that starts and ends with 0x00

[10-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so that needs average of 65536 signatures

[10-Aug-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
takes about 20 seconds to a minute depending on system

[10-Aug-19 05:46 PM] zawy#5864
I think self-hashing txn is the best idea even if it's not as important.  It just seems way cool that anyone could turn on a machine, any machine , and have a  little coin they can trade. in a ittle while......except there needs to be a min limit the due to too many txns..... that would be automatic if there is a  fee per byte in txns that exponentially increases as blocks get near a limit.

[10-Aug-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what i have is just an additional constraint on spending, you still need to get the coins in the first place

[10-Aug-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are talking about each selfhashed tx getting some new coins issued, that would be new code.

[10-Aug-19 05:49 PM] zawy#5864
The difficulty for POW in the header would be in units of  "coin  per hash" instead of  1/hashes required.

[10-Aug-19 05:51 PM] zawy#5864
The miner needs to know about what block he'll be finished in and he sets a target and then finds the nonce.  The actual hash isn't needed as there's no chain for coin distribution.

[10-Aug-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto signatures are a good CPU algo as i am not aware of any ASIC for it, actually not even sure if GPU can speed it up that much, but not sure

[10-Aug-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this can be simulated in an existing coin with a special CC that awards coins from the premine to each tx

[10-Aug-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be the only way the premine could be spent

[10-Aug-19 05:52 PM] zawy#5864
The POW for coin creation should be the opposite of POW for consensus:  it must waste electricity as much as possible.  Consensus nedes all the expense in the value of the equipment.

[10-Aug-19 05:53 PM] zawy#5864
Ideally it will be rentable in an open market.....available to everyone at the same rate.....all the better if this also happens to be what a CPU can do
