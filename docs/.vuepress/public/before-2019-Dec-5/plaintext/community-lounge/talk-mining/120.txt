LMFAO, no
I meant that when I started it all, everything/everyone was here, but now there are multiple projects that have their own discords and own communities that never even come here

the chart just goes straight up, and only some of the batch 1 Z11's have been delivered

[22-Apr-19 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use Z9 mini for VRSC?

[22-Apr-19 05:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Think he means sell them in exchange for vrsc

[22-Apr-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
ok...understood differently

[22-Apr-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
😂

[22-Apr-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain I mean that I will buy z9m's and other ASICs for VRSC

[22-Apr-19 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I mine VRSC with an FPGA, so I have lots to sell 😃

[22-Apr-19 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, got that later

[22-Apr-19 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I also still have timelocked old big vrsc blocks, plenty of vrsc

[22-Apr-19 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not excited to buy lots of z9m's, but a few at the right price makes sense, maybe. But this ZEC difficulty chart is crazy

[22-Apr-19 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i got 5.11 cent/kwh, so i can run z9m's when most people can't

[22-Apr-19 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
about $0.22/kwh for me 😄

[22-Apr-19 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
z9m's are still great for spec mining new asset chains, but i think today's nethash increase made z9m's unprofitable for many people

[22-Apr-19 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
people that mine ZEC+ZEN

[22-Apr-19 06:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Selling Z9 full size  : 500 KMD each PSU included ,  buyer pays shipping.

[22-Apr-19 07:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can consider other coins besides kmd

[22-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Hi all

[22-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Rafalloc#5543
How much it cost a profitable mining set up for komodo?

[22-Apr-19 07:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$800k USD
or
whatever vague thing you mean by "profitable"

[22-Apr-19 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can use 1 $300 Z9 mini or 1 $700 GPU and it will be profitable

[22-Apr-19 07:41 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Cost < benefit

[22-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Do you know any manual for set up a good mining pc

[22-Apr-19 07:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How proficient are you with command line

[22-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Thank in advance

[22-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Can you use command line @Rafalloc ?

[22-Apr-19 07:45 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Don’t know how to use it

[22-Apr-19 07:45 PM] Rafalloc#5543
Sorry

[22-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Do you have an asic miner? I think for those setup is quite straightforward, you just need to chose a pool, maybe @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ‘s chickenpool 😃

[23-Apr-19 08:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am only interested in z9m's or maybe A9's, willing to pay KMD or VRSC

[23-Apr-19 08:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
10cent/kwh gets you 35 cents a day profit on a z9m according to this: https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-z9-mini

If there are any Aussie in the house wanting to sell miners too, let me know. The shipping will be much cheaper!

[23-Apr-19 08:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto  z9 is just 3 batch 1 minis in one machine .   And can run one still on a 120v 15A circuit ( wouldn’t run much else on it though ) ,  willing to consider Verus 😃

[23-Apr-19 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog the amount of amps a Z9 uses is too much for me, I would rather put a diff miner there with larger hashrate and less power use. z9m's are just so damn cheap and amps are my most precious resource right now

[23-Apr-19 08:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
paying in VRSC is tempting, tho!

@dukeleto I invite anyone to use math and not emotion and convince me why their worth more than that 😛

[23-Apr-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`10cent/kwh gets you 35 cents a day profit `
vs $1.69 per day, prorated from an A9++ (using the math of that same site and assuming it's an early batch pushing 14k -- $1.21 @ 10k)

[23-Apr-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not a fan of buying new, re: surprise tariffs

**and** per hash, gen1 costs nearly 3x more to operate than gen2

[23-Apr-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"the right price" takes that into account 😉

[23-Apr-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i would only buy a few, i have a few PSU's that could put another z9m and I would have no PSU cost

[23-Apr-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
CPU mining rigs are looking way better right now

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
What I predict, and please let me be wrong: This massive Z11 hashrate increase is going to lead to a massive ZEC dump

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Because people have been watching ZEC go down for over a year, just straight down

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
and now some miners have an advantage of getting Z11's

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
if I were them, i would very aggressively lock in my profits

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
because maybe ZEC is $20 in a few months

[23-Apr-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
nobody knows

[23-Apr-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was almost excited at buying 2 dozen z9s, but seller wants $85 each more than I'm willing 😦

[23-Apr-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
A9+'s are probably nicely priced right now

[23-Apr-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Z9's use too many amps for me, not a good investment in the future

[23-Apr-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
people get too emotionally invested in "but but but I paid....for them", imo

[23-Apr-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are a tool whose value is extremely time-dependent

[23-Apr-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
my first z9m was $1000 + $300 tariff, now they are not even worth $300

[23-Apr-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
their value is less than the tariff i paid on my first one, that is crazy

[23-Apr-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_paid $2200+ shipping for his 1st mini_

[23-Apr-19 01:06 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't those minis pay back even more? 😉

[23-Apr-19 01:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can mine the 100k before the halving and eBay rates are over double .   Already ROI’d. So can mine them to brickdom if necessary , still are profitable

[23-Apr-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`didn't those minis pay back even more?`
Of course, otherwise I wouldn't be willing to buy more 😛

Hi Everyone,
I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.
I could really use your support and votes.
Usually I'm hanging out in #kmdlabs, #cc-rogue and a few other channels.
You can ask around about me and also find my proposal (node-9) here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`
I'd be grateful for any VOTE2019 you send. `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`
Figure I can do a good job as a Notary Node op.
🙇
