`I need help understanding what the sapling upgrade is? will the upgrade be easy to do on the 4 coins I run on my pool ZEC ZCL ZEN and KMD? Do you have to do it?`
Zcash planned "growth stages" along the lines of a tree's growth (sprout, overwinter, sapling), sapling is the current growth stage and encompasses many changes
if you keep your coins in transparent addresses, updates for all coins should be almost seamless; if you keep them in private/z addresses, you'll need to migrate from stage to stage however each coin decides

[19-Dec-18 10:47 PM] skyguynca#0562
when you tell me you helped write the sapling upgrade, then you should know how it works, if you tell me it will work when I tell you what coins I am using, then I believe you

[19-Dec-18 10:48 PM] skyguynca#0562
I just stated KMD 2 weeks ago and stayed iwth it because I like it

[19-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when you tell me you helped write the sapling upgrade` <- who is the "you" that you are referring to?

[19-Dec-18 10:48 PM] skyguynca#0562
I chose the pool software to support KMD, so when you tell me it will then it should

[19-Dec-18 10:49 PM] skyguynca#0562
Potato the DEV from S-NOMP, the topic we, or I referring to

[19-Dec-18 10:51 PM] skyguynca#0562
I guess I am different than most, when I choose to support a project, I  do.......not ignore the problems or the peole or the questions they have.

[19-Dec-18 10:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can tell you this much...
99% of everyone that has ever altered a NOMP fork (and much of NOMP itself) has little clue how NOMP actually works

[19-Dec-18 10:51 PM] skyguynca#0562
That comes from good honest responsible parent and a full military carret

[19-Dec-18 11:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Compared to the spaghetti state of the latest stratum-mining python server...`
when you find a NOMP fork that isn't exactly that, let me know :trollface:

this address seems to mine less than 3KMD

[20-Dec-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
interesting. maybe they are subtracting txfees instead of setting it to 0

[20-Dec-18 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
the lowest seems to be 2.994 which is missing 0.2% of 3KMD

[20-Dec-18 05:46 PM] jorian#4555
where does that go though?

[20-Dec-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
go?

[20-Dec-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it was never created

[20-Dec-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so it never existed for it to go anywhere

@Dre join my pool 😎

[22-Dec-18 12:01 AM] skyguynca#0562
on pirate, when I add it to my pool do I still modify the  PIRATE.conf  file with the rpc port of the pool and rpc username and password of the pool like I did with KMD or do I leave it alone. It does not say on the pirate git

[22-Dec-18 02:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You'll need to change the username/pass to whatever you have set in your .komodo/PIRATE conf file

[22-Dec-18 02:48 AM] skyguynca#0562
but i leave the rpc port allong? ex for KMD i put rpcport=15993 for ARRR I want rpcport=15994

[22-Dec-18 02:49 AM] skyguynca#0562
so it will match the pool config file

[22-Dec-18 02:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
check the daemon for the rpc port. `getinfo` will tell you what it is

[22-Dec-18 03:02 AM] skyguynca#0562
oh, I had been specifying the RPC port for all the coins in the ./ *.conf files. I did not think you were supposed to use the default port

Pirate mining question - Does anyone know if the pending sprout balances on PiratePool will be paid out if we switched over to sapling pool? Or I should re-connect to that port and mine it until I get paid out. I have a couple hundred pending and just wanted to get the migration out of the way

[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] Cryptotaxsteemit#2552
Sorry I didn't realize Pirate had its own discord, I will ask there

[27-Dec-18 05:15 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They sure will be. Once all of the sprout miners have changed to sapling webworker will payout the sprout funds. I believe it is written on the front page of the website

any recommendations for kmd solo mining pool?  going to try the kmd.solopool.org

[28-Dec-18 01:15 PM] $tefano.#3560
Hard maintenance done on komodomininpool ( miningpools.cloud )  after 150K kmd paid.
Many tasks done and others features added during this night to keep pool updated, fast, secure and  first of all scalable  
- added mysql support to store all datas with redis db sync and nodejs, in this way if redis will be huge and huge like now, it's possible to flush it without lost datas 
- separate stratum from frontend on another independent server and speed up realtime datas 
- sync redis across other 2  servers to save data using sentinel ( master, slave x3  ad db replication) 
- pool run with minimal requirements but now it's more power with half of resources 
Sorry for some downtime during this night but it was necessary to keep pool up and fast 
Enjoy

[28-Dec-18 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
he asks for something, Daira says "nope" politely

[28-Dec-18 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
but that recent comment above, he asserts that "this is what electric coin company will do"

[28-Dec-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, in fairness, he is the CEO

[28-Dec-18 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
he is breaking their own rules and timelines asking for this stuff, and I doubt Daira, who writes the zcash protocol, likes taking direction from Zooko, who often has no clue what is going on

[28-Dec-18 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure, he has the right to do that, as CEO

[28-Dec-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
CEO if an open source crypto 😕

[28-Dec-18 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326

there has been talk of multiple implementations of ZEC, this could be the beginning of that

the zec foundation evidently wants multiple implementations

equihash was assumed to be resistant to ASICs/FPGAs, just like verushash v1 was assumed to be safe against them

[28-Dec-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, what I mean is that since equihash's only "resistance" is the cost factor of RAM; how does anyone with even a modicum of foresight not say "you know, I bet RAM will be cheaper in the future 🤔 "?
