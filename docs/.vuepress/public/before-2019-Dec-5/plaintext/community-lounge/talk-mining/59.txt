harder than predicting the future price

[21-Oct-18 06:28 PM] gmr#4027
yes you can't find the exact amount of difficulty in future But you can get the approximate amount of difficulty in future

[21-Oct-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what will BTC price be in 6 months?

@jl777c stay burning people with the truth.

[21-Oct-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i am told that a mining calculator can predict 6 month future prices. i learn something new every day

That is amazing

@gmr  `Today at 1:28 PM
yes you can't find the exact amount of difficulty in future But you can get the approximate amount of difficulty in future`
Except for coins like BTC that only change diff every 2 week,s you can't get the approximate amount of difficulty 6 **hours** in future, much less 6 months

[21-Oct-18 10:06 PM] gmr#4027
.@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  you can guess and this is important for choosing asic or algorithms

affected not only by combined coin prices that use a specific algo, but also the general crypto marketcap

[21-Oct-18 10:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@gmr   A lot of coins have dynamic difficulty adjustment ,  not possible to make a prediction

[21-Oct-18 10:39 PM] gmr#4027
@jl777c if you wanna predict the future you need crystal ball you don't to mine

@gmr You really should stop spamming that site, it's not helpful to you understanding the basics of how difficulty **actually** works

And, btw, they literally tell you:
`The diff change value is calculated by looking at the current difficulty and comparing it to the 12 hour moving average of the difficulty one month ago. For smaller coins the diff change can sometimes be inaccurate due to a wildly fluctuating difficulty.`

hour to hour diff is changing by 50%+/-

[21-Oct-18 10:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are **guessing** future by looking at past

[21-Oct-18 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i have many years of time series analysis experience and believe me when i tell you hashrate is not predicatable 6 months ahead of time for any specific coin

[21-Oct-18 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe for BTC you can make a +/-50% guesstimate

Hi all, I'm new here. Amateur question: is it possible to mine KMDs using GPU rigs? And, is it still remotely somewhat profitable assuming ive got 5k hashing power and electricity at 250USD/month? Tqvm in advance for all useful feedback and tips

[22-Oct-18 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You spend $250 a month to power 5ksols?

[22-Oct-18 05:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@JaseOfAllTrades  veruscoin probably better

[22-Oct-18 05:27 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i hope im getting it right. 

I have two rigs of 5 x 1070ti . 10 in total. 

And per rig it costs 120-125usd a month to run. 

So, as you can tell, im struggling to find something that is worthwhile to mine (if there's any)

[22-Oct-18 05:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, if you're paying 14-15 cents p/kWh, I'm not sure there's anything you're going to make money at with those

[22-Oct-18 05:37 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
☹

[22-Oct-18 05:37 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Any idea what do other home based GPU miners do....?

[22-Oct-18 05:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I still add them to my total hash, but I know they aren't making me much. I also point them at smaller (more sceptical coins). There are a number of uses for them

[22-Oct-18 05:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dump them and buy 2080s?

[22-Oct-18 06:47 AM] jansako#3330
I turned off my 1070 rig, trying to sell it on eBay for months, literally. During that time I only got one offer, for 50% of asking price. I can 'probably' sell the cards out of it at ~$200 per (suucks, but my own fault)

[22-Oct-18 06:49 AM] hfaz63#1930
what is minimum payout on piratepool.io???

[22-Oct-18 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
why isnt there more outrage about the 1070 being obsoleted? should coins hardfork to prevent faster GPU from outdoing the 1070?

humm, is it ok to do a "WANT TO SELL" here for my mining rigs with gpus? I have three for sale, hesitant to put them on craigslist/ebay.  if interested, just DM me - they are all AMD, and very healthy

for what random trust is worth, in-community trading could be a good thing, imo

[22-Oct-18 01:48 PM] higgy#2168
I agree.

[22-Oct-18 01:56 PM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
@jansako thanks for sharing your personal experience with the 1070s. I thought i was doing something wrong or not managing my rigs/settings well enough. 
Anyone here has experience mining coins like siacoin? And is it worthwhile? 
Or should i just keep my rigs off for now?

[22-Oct-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@JaseOfAllTrades imo, anything "weaker" than a 1080TI should be sold off and upgraded; 2016 is over

[22-Oct-18 02:22 PM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Got my 1070s in 2017 though. Havent got near to ROI. Oh wells......taking it as a lesson and a learning curve.

[22-Oct-18 02:23 PM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
1070s can still be valuable to gamers right....? Problem is having to find 10 gamers to offload them to. Haha

[22-Oct-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That you got it in x, doesn't change that it was released in y

[22-Oct-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@JaseOfAllTrades you can mine VRSC with those gpu rigs

[22-Oct-18 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It is sad to the point of hilarity the number of people selling i9-9900k Pre-Orders on ebay and the complete lack of shame they are doing it with
ffs, there's some people selling for $1k+, they don't have it yet, and their "ad" is a ss of their Amazon order page

[22-Oct-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's no part of me that can understand the desperation of wanting a CPU to the point where you're willing to give $1k in advance to someone that doesn't even know when/if they can get it

[22-Oct-18 04:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@higgy  when you say amd,  what cards are you running,  vega or 580s

[22-Oct-18 04:53 PM] gmr#4027
who have antminer dr3 here? is it profitable? how much  is your incomes?how much is your electricity cost?

[22-Oct-18 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/bitmain/antminer-dr3` <looking at that, I'd say "don't get one"

[22-Oct-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
AMD Ryzen 7 seems to be where it's at for CPU mining, unless you have too much money weighing down your pockets

[22-Oct-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto For me the i9 was a dual-purpose thing (I needed to upgrade this thing anyway)

[22-Oct-18 04:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are many reasons to do things that don't make sense to people without all the info 😃

[22-Oct-18 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am pricing out potential VerusHash mining rigs, and my variable of interest is Cost Per MH/s

[22-Oct-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figured since I had to wait on the GPUs that waiting on the CPU was just as well

[22-Oct-18 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's interesting to use that metric, interesting possibilties arise. It's not perfect, and does not take into account watt/ hash

[22-Oct-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think since black friday is about a month away, buying any high end CPUs right now is not a good idea, all prices will change in a month

[22-Oct-18 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for pure mining, there's no part of me that would have went with the i9

[22-Oct-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ryzen 7's are fucking cheap, because threadrippers are the new hotness

[22-Oct-18 05:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
threadrippers are crazy expensive, but will give you higher hashrate and 20% less cost per hash, but double-ish the price, for cheapest threadripper

[22-Oct-18 05:04 PM] higgy#2168
@polycryptoblog i have 3 units, 6 cards each,  1 with 4x  rx570's, and 2 x  rx580's,  and two units each with 6 x rx580's only.   I do have a couple of vega64's but I'm keeping those in a different unit.

[22-Oct-18 05:05 PM] gmr#4027
actually i have cheap electricity cost is it late for buying antmminer dr3?

[22-Oct-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Will leech out the btc from shitcoins with them,  eventually the markets will close and it won't be there so might as well squeeze it out while still possible

[22-Oct-18 07:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 are you willing to minimize cost per hash, no matter the price, or is there some reasonable trade-off ? I am trying to decide on a reasonable cost for each rig in a small CPU farm

Saw this thought it would be good for CPU mining

[22-Oct-18 07:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto yes, usually I'll buy at a larger lot cost if it means more overall profit

[22-Oct-18 07:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i haven't seen any data about VRSC mining on threadripper 2950's or higher

[22-Oct-18 07:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
so i don't have the data I would like

[22-Oct-18 07:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 my choice is complicated by the risk that higher end CPUs will have a big price decrease when new stuff comes out in a month or so, but I do use your advice as a guide. Go bigger or go home

[22-Oct-18 07:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog very interesting, not sure if I have seen ccminer data for Xeon E5-2600 and E5-2600

@polyb1123 what would you estimate as the hashrate of one of those rigs?

[22-Oct-18 07:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
this report does not give me hope: ```

best reports I have seen are from threadrippers, and nobody has even tried the really beefy ones

[22-Oct-18 07:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
these crazy high core count threadrippers get expensive *real* fast
