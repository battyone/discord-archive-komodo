@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 many people have been waiting months, only some have the HW, and full software for various algos isn't there yet

[28-Dec-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just keep tabs on it, as it's a cheap entry

[28-Dec-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
otherwise, $4-10K per PCIe card

bitmain died

[28-Dec-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, bitmean is deded

[28-Dec-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326

what the hell do we wint from that  ...... BTC cant scale so KMD has to make it do so

@dukeleto do you do any nodejs coding?

[28-Dec-18 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 when i have no other choice, yes 😃

any idea how to get a sub-function callback within a function to set an upperlevel variable?

[28-Dec-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott  always talked about that languange

[28-Dec-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like u dont have to compile it to trial and error

[28-Dec-18 03:16 PM] radix42#3743
I wrote the first formally verified SHA2 in it!

[28-Dec-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `this.foo` perhaps, if you can refer to the var via `this`

[28-Dec-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
or pass in that variable so it can be assigned to

[28-Dec-18 03:17 PM] radix42#3743
*shudder*

[28-Dec-18 03:17 PM] radix42#3743
Yeah that might do it

Fucken global

this.myownface.is.shit

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
`this` changes meaning depending on where you are, it means the current object basically

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] radix42#3743
Sounds like is too many scopes deep to do otherwise

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] libscott#8867
Radix42 do you work on komodo?

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] radix42#3743

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the most non sensical thing I came across so far in any coding I tried to do

[28-Dec-18 03:18 PM] libscott#8867
We should talk maybe

[28-Dec-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@libscott yeah i would say that 😿

[28-Dec-18 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tried that and no go
I'm trying to add a function to pool that uses the stratum module's daemon.cmd, but I can't get it to set any variable outside of the 'daemon.cmd' call itself

[28-Dec-18 03:19 PM] libscott#8867
Didnt know there was another haskeller around

[28-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the drunk Australian getsn them all in one place

[28-Dec-18 03:19 PM] radix42#3743
Lol yeah, I’m out of practice for years tho rn

[28-Dec-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it somewhat depends on which node frameworks are in use

[28-Dec-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, hush-ng uses Vue, and Vue has a specific way of setting global state

[28-Dec-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
11.5

[28-Dec-18 03:21 PM] radix42#3743
The old saw about “if it compiles, it’s correct” abt Haskell is only half way a joke

[28-Dec-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
your node framework might have special setters/getters for global state

[28-Dec-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
allowing the setting of global variables can cause race conditions

[28-Dec-18 03:21 PM] radix42#3743
Yeah rtfm and pray

[28-Dec-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
so with hush-ng, i had to read all about global state in Vue

[28-Dec-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 i knew people that maintained a real live working dynamic web app, all written directly in Haskell. Blew my mind

[28-Dec-18 03:22 PM] libscott#8867
Radix if you want to work on the haskell notariser let me know

[28-Dec-18 03:22 PM] radix42#3743
Cool

[28-Dec-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
haskell or rust notarizer would be legit

[28-Dec-18 03:22 PM] radix42#3743
Send me the repo address

[28-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haskell notarise is already made

[28-Dec-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`allowing the setting of global variables can cause race conditions`
I think that might be the issue I'm having because any print finishes before the inner function print

[28-Dec-18 03:23 PM] libscott#8867
Dukeleto it exists and we’ve tested it

[28-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana works because of my horredous and continious investgatation

@libscott that is super cool!

[28-Dec-18 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 maybe search your codebase for `mutate` or `state` and see if there is something special, usually you must define some methods as wrappers for the global state

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[28-Dec-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think if you ignore that, you end up modifying a local copy of the global thing you want to change, so it seems like nothing is happening

[28-Dec-18 03:25 PM] libscott#8867

💯 (2) 1M 👌 

[28-Dec-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I had no idea about any of this when i inherited hush-ng, just had to reverse engineer it when things didn't work as I expected them to

[28-Dec-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@libscott i approve of your emoji in error messages 😃

[28-Dec-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just had to reverse engineer it when things didn't work as I expected them to`
Yeah, that's pretty much where I'm at trying to both bring pools out of 2014 and de-tangle the last 5 years of spaghetti

[28-Dec-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i don't envy you

[28-Dec-18 03:27 PM] libscott#8867
I personally would love to but i cant be singularly responsible for the notariser... however, if theres more haskellers around it might be worth it 😃

[28-Dec-18 03:27 PM] libscott#8867
Dukeleto hehe. Bit of fun

[28-Dec-18 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
as somebody who doesn't know how to code Haskell, the code is very readable. Very little extraneous punctuation/etc

[28-Dec-18 03:30 PM] radix42#3743
catMaybes, lol @libscott

[28-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figure that out?

gosh interesting chat about haskell, yes need more haskellers.   got an enquiry about a project from eth->kmd on the grapevine.  2nd one in a month.

but to the channel topic, over xmas i dabbled with a bit of miningrigrentals to see the state of mining other coins, and tried out zpool (i like it!) after getting sick of blackjoker's zex  pool not accepting an inno 50k overclocked thing and leto's polly having very low ARRR hashrate.

what i discovered was the way pool operators in this ecosystem allow the links from the worker tabs to see what a miner has earned is handy.   the digihash.io pool of digibyte disable this, presumably to protect miners.

also, 1 minute blocktimes are pretty good for miners.   the 2-10minute blocktimes is not cool for 3 hour mining contract experiments 😃

[29-Dec-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo FYI it's jeezy that runs the polly pool

[29-Dec-18 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo i haven't used many different pools, but LuckPool has one of the most polished UI's with really nice earning stats, that I have seen

[29-Dec-18 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as the Earnings tab here (which is not my miner): https://luckpool.net/verus/miner.html?REhbQPJJdpAW1MZyKZ4BzYkNZPPJ7vvhj5
