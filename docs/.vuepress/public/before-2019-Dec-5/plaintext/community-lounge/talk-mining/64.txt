But for best results just go balanced

[29-Oct-18 11:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Won't have to mess with it

`I OCed my miner and now it doesn't work, what do I do?`
Remove the overclock...

[30-Oct-18 08:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Lox3ur running a batch3 like it's a batch1 doesn't sound prudent. My batch3 needs constant babysitting, even without overclocking. It sits next to a batch1 OC'ed to 625 that has no issues so far

[30-Oct-18 08:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
it literally just woke me up with it's fan and I had to reboot it to make it happy, which is why I am awake üòπ

[30-Oct-18 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Why are later batches so much worse quality wise!

[30-Oct-18 08:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Different boards

[30-Oct-18 08:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Batch 1 has one more voltage regulator

[30-Oct-18 08:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 are the highest QA boards, batch 2 and 3 are lesser quality. which is why they took away GUI way to OC in batch2 + batch3

[30-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Lox3ur#6920
Ok I will put the batch 3 firmware again

[30-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Lox3ur#6920
Tu for your help

[30-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Lox3ur#6920

[30-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But price is the same? That seems f‚Äôed up

[30-Oct-18 08:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Batch 1 was 2000

[30-Oct-18 09:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon batch 3 was much cheaper

[30-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Lox3ur#6920
780$ for batch3 if my memory is good

[30-Oct-18 09:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@polycryptoblog batch 1 was 2k, but you got coupons later if you had batch one after they cut the price to 800$ or whatever it was

[30-Oct-18 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
batch 1 was well worth the xtra cost

[30-Oct-18 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I wish we had gotten more than 3

[30-Oct-18 05:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yep - 4x the revenues for a month mean they essentially paid for them selves in about 6 weeks.
Im not sad I made my large order in batch 2, because I haven't done the math on what my positive would have been by paying 2x the price for them earlier.

Hi guys! http://piratetheminingpool.selfip.com/ back again

[30-Oct-18 10:35 PM] TheMiningPool#9076
Sry about the down time. Our datacenter had been down for 48h due to a tornado. It destroyed 4 hi voltage towers including backup lines and internet lines and we all where without electricity and internet for more than 48h. All fixed now.

[31-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Hermes#6934
getting like 20 ryzen 7 processors for 1650 usd is a good deal?

[31-Oct-18 01:08 AM] Hermes#6934
anyone here?

[31-Oct-18 01:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Any more stats on the processor

[31-Oct-18 01:30 AM] Hermes#6934
8 Cores & 16 Threads
3.4 GHz Clock Speed
3.8 GHz Maximum Turbo Frequency
AM4 Socket

[31-Oct-18 01:31 AM] Hermes#6934
it just went up to 2000 usd

[31-Oct-18 01:31 AM] Hermes#6934
not sure now

[31-Oct-18 01:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Looks like similar is going for 180-200usd each new

[31-Oct-18 01:32 AM] Hermes#6934
Yeah it looks like some good deal...for verus hash

[31-Oct-18 01:32 AM] Hermes#6934
the thing is that I will need to get some computers built from scratch

[31-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a 2700X is that the same ? Mine can do 900Mh/s on Verus using ccminer and linux in a windows VM with a small OC.

[31-Oct-18 01:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
1700x i think

[31-Oct-18 01:33 AM] Hermes#6934
yes is 1700x

[31-Oct-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
due to VM its not perfectly satble, need to install linux natively again and try that, hmm I htink the last gen would be 30% slower ?

[31-Oct-18 01:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case both CPUs are amazinlly powerful

[31-Oct-18 01:34 AM] Hermes#6934

[31-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Hermes#6934
yeah I will keep an eye on other processors auctions as well

[31-Oct-18 01:36 AM] Hermes#6934

even 900MH/s which seems like a lot, and is one pof the most power cpus you can get, is less than 1 VRSC a day üò¶

[31-Oct-18 01:40 AM] Hermes#6934
wow haven't mined verus in a while

[31-Oct-18 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I have 13,000 time locked and very very happy I bothered to mined those.... getting any coins down the road without a large stake will be extremly hard.

[31-Oct-18 01:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

Its helping a lot with dev stuff in any case, gald I picked it up, got it off someone here who purcheased it to miner verus then realised he was too late , only came with 4GB of ram, so it was stuck doing the same until pirate made me a bit of free money and I got 32Gb or DDR4 ($500 AUD here fucking joke)

[31-Oct-18 01:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my notary node has 128G of DDR3 and 4 CPUS and cost only $1300 üòÆ

[31-Oct-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
couldnt beleive the cost of ram these days

[31-Oct-18 01:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
32gb at 500 seems expensive

[31-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cheapest i the entire country, but it is 3600mhz stuff ... top end.

[31-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Australian  dollar has been tanking hard lately .. likely the reason

[01-Nov-18 06:20 PM] ideamachines#8156
hi everyone

[01-Nov-18 06:20 PM] ideamachines#8156
how's your thursday?

[01-Nov-18 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
OC'ing Ryzen 7's like a boss

[01-Nov-18 06:22 PM] ideamachines#8156

[01-Nov-18 06:22 PM] ideamachines#8156
nice.

[01-Nov-18 06:23 PM] ideamachines#8156
so, total n00b question here - been involved and buying/holding KMD since last year , obviously love the project.

[01-Nov-18 06:23 PM] ideamachines#8156
Ive mined another coin before, last year. was fun - any way I could get involved mining KMD?

[01-Nov-18 06:23 PM] ideamachines#8156
or if there's a FAQ

[01-Nov-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ideamachines it's exactly the same as mining ZEC, just find a KMD pool to point your miner at

[01-Nov-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't suggest solo mining

[01-Nov-18 06:24 PM] ideamachines#8156
ok good to know.

[01-Nov-18 06:24 PM] ideamachines#8156
what mining rigs are suggester? for various budgets.

[01-Nov-18 06:25 PM] ideamachines#8156
and current ROI / # of coins one can expect from doing the work

thank you.

[01-Nov-18 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can also mine various KMD asset chains too

[01-Nov-18 06:30 PM] ideamachines#8156
ah nice.

[01-Nov-18 06:30 PM] ideamachines#8156
any idea on a min. hash rate I should go for?

[01-Nov-18 06:30 PM] ideamachines#8156
and various KMD asset chains means other coins that are linked to KMD?

[01-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I suggest mining Pirate (ARRR)

[01-Nov-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has "asset chains" which are run-time forks of KMD

[01-Nov-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are independent coins, with their own blockchain

[01-Nov-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
that use the same source code as KMD, basically

[01-Nov-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
asset chains are cryptocoins based on KMD
