nope

[08-Aug-19 03:12 PM] SHossain#0007
just a single Z9 Mini

[08-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so just randomness

[08-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why whenever there is some streak of good results (or bad), people want to find some reason for it, when usually it is just how the statistics works

[08-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
100k diff is too hard to solve consistently for Z9 mini

[08-Aug-19 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. and the pool can't set more diff for the miner as maxdiff is set to 8

[08-Aug-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this time the time deficit is 100, 200, 350 seconds

[08-Aug-19 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
just found a block and diff down to 53k

[08-Aug-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
already 1 of the 3 extra blocks is gained back due to slowing down blocks after the third one

[08-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and now over 2 minute block, so the second extra block is being recouped

[08-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and after this block W.3 made up its time deficit

[08-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty amazing after just 7 blocks from the first fast block

[08-Aug-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
W.6 made up its deficit

[08-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
5 minute block and now the "attacker" is behind 1 block per minute

[08-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
only 98 seconds to make up for W.12 and this round of RST will stop

[08-Aug-19 03:21 PM] SHossain#0007
over 3 mins since last block

[08-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will be the shortest RST activation i have seen, just 6 blocks to fully recoup all time from the fast blocks in a 12 block window

[08-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and digishield starts with 22.5k diff... i guess having 3 of 4 blocks take 2 to 5 minutes adjusted it down

[08-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but exp() is kicking in compensate for the slow blocks that resulted from the good luck, so it all seems to fix itself pretty fast

[08-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
a few more exp() assisted blocks and diff at 28k

[08-Aug-19 03:26 PM] SHossain#0007
exp() to the rescue ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems maybe exp() kicked in a few too many times. i think i will reduce its activation window from 12 to 6

[08-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, it got too fast again, due to exp() invoking too many times. i updated it for ZAWY20, for now stop the ASIC

[08-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
lets see what happens if the hashrate goes away in the middle of an RST

[08-Aug-19 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
shall i stop ASIC?

[08-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Aug-19 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
done

[08-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i predict the exp() will need to kick in and immediately the RST phase is over, then the CPU will mine a few blocks and diff is down to 10 or less

[08-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming that works, then plz make a copy of the .csv and post it here

[08-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then update to the bugfixed code and make a ZAWY20

[08-Aug-19 03:32 PM] SHossain#0007
my CPU miner is off until you say to turn it on

[08-Aug-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
first CPU mine with max cores you have available until it gets to a stable diff. RST should start at 65, then go for 30 to 40 blocks, then it will stop and the second hash in the mining printout will go to 0

[08-Aug-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i am talking about ZAWY20, the plan for testing so you can do it on your own

[08-Aug-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
you see in the .csv, there are two hashes, the one on the right means RST is active and things go in slow motion. after the deficits are caught up (or 40 blocks), it will stop and the second hash will go to 0. at that point it is just the normal digishield on its own. after 17 blocks of 0s, we hope nothing triggers and the hash rate is reasonably stable. assuming it is, then reduce to 1 core mining

[08-Aug-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for diff to stabilize.

[08-Aug-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
from this point, we can do ASIC test, 5x test, 10x test, etc. basically a variety of increase in hashrate from a controlled baseline

[08-Aug-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[08-Aug-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
does this make sense?

[08-Aug-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ask if any questions. when we are changing the hashrate, the moment it is active, needs to be marked in the spreadsheet as there is no way to know otherwise

[08-Aug-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can do a 2x test, a 4x test, 10x test, 1000x test and get a clear record of it in the .csv

[08-Aug-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure the exact tests @zawy needs, he says there is some way to attack this with an on/off pattern.

[08-Aug-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe CPU 10x attack for 3 blocks and off, wait till diff comes down and 10x again for 3 blocks. this might be the attack that is possible

[08-Aug-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the high hashrate attack and diff stranding are fully solved. you just cant turn on and off ASIC (or nicehash) quickly enough for it to make sense

[08-Aug-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so after the controlled tests, the area to focus on is the on/off attacks, specifically 3 blocks and off, wait, repeat

[08-Aug-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
3 blocks is not a lot, especially if you need to wait 20+ blocks to do it again, but this is getting so close to perfect, we might as well duplicate this coin emission attack and fix it (without breaking any of the existing amazingness)

[08-Aug-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
- start the chain #20
- mine with 50 threads till height 65, after that RST will kick in
- continue mining about 40 blocks until the second hash is 0
- mine more 17 blocks with second hash 0
- then, start single thread to stabilize diff

[08-Aug-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
its not so exact.

[08-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
first of all, nothing happens until height 65

[08-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
with 50 threads, you will get there in less than a minute

[08-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
then RST kicks in and things will slow down. keep things until the second hash goes to 0 AND hashrate stabilizes, making sure after it goes to 0s, that exp() or RST doesnt kick in again. it isnt a fatal thing, but nice if RST kicks in and fixes things and there arent any echoes, ie, other triggers after it goes to the 0s

[08-Aug-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
what shall i look out in stdout for the second hash 0?

[08-Aug-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
stdout will be making all the RST prints, during that time the CSV file will have non-zero hashes for the second one

[08-Aug-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
when the RST prints stop, then there will be 0s

[08-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is either flooding the screen or quiet

[08-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if quiet it should be 0s and that means nothing is being adjusted

[08-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and the normal digishield should get the diff stable, the big question is will it do it in 17 to 20 blocks, or will it take 100+

[08-Aug-19 03:48 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me update to your latest fixes

[08-Aug-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
now once things stabilize, then you can do a controlled hashrate increase test

[08-Aug-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
wait. found another bug

[08-Aug-19 03:48 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[08-Aug-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, its updated.

[08-Aug-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and just post the CSV with the comments about when hashrate was changed in a column

[08-Aug-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the standard launch goes from genesis to RST triggered, to off and 0s and a stable hashrate. then you can test an increase from there via ASIC, but other than that test of 50x to ASIC, really you need to downshift to much less cores

[08-Aug-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
with 50, i guess downshifting to 3 cores is a good number to reduce variance a bit

[08-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
then with 3, you can do 2x, 3x, 5x controlled tests with 6, 9, 15 cores

[08-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
each time going back down to 3

[08-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or wait! you have 50 cores!

[08-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can go from 3 -> 6 -> 18 and get a 2x and 3x test without reducing

[08-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
see how it works, at any given hashrate what matters is how much more hashrate you add, not what the exact number of cores is

[08-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont foresee any issues with the 2x, 3x, 5x, tests but post the CSV so i can review it for any funny effects

[08-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming nothing needs fixing, then the 3 on and stop attack is the one which it seems is the only bug left, but first we need to make sure all the normal cases are ok

[08-Aug-19 03:56 PM] SHossain#0007
updating 2nd node now

[08-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i want you to understand the reasons behind the procedures

[08-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and not just follow them blindly.

[08-Aug-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
exact results will likely vary, especially due to the built in randomness to all this

[08-Aug-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
just always think about what the current hashrate is and what the diff should be and how far away is it, and whether the DAA is confused about what it should be doing

[08-Aug-19 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
still trying to understand fully tbh

[08-Aug-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i know, not any questions. you must ask to clarify

[08-Aug-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you watch the printouts and the gradually increasing targets, update the csv with each block, i do a tail -17 to see the most recent 17 blocks (input for digishield), you should get a good feel for how it all works

[08-Aug-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
please ask if any questions. i dont think there has ever been a DAA like this other than in zawys imagination! so having a live chain doing what seems like magic is a bit strange at first, but soon you get used to it

[08-Aug-19 04:07 PM] SHossain#0007
preparing the steps again for you to review

[08-Aug-19 04:07 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it is bit difficult :abused_smiley:

[08-Aug-19 04:09 PM] zawy#5864
the only reason it takes two blocks instead of one block after the initial 3 block trigger to respond to a 1 million times attack is because there's not enough precision in a 60 second block

[08-Aug-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
still it is working so much better than anything else i know of, the 3 on/off attack seems like a minor issue

[08-Aug-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a surgical way to detect just that without affecting the rest that is working so well, that would be great

[08-Aug-19 04:10 PM] zawy#5864
I am going to have to work on it. It's not supposed to trigger the exponential

[08-Aug-19 04:10 PM] zawy#5864
Unless the attack stops

[08-Aug-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so a tipdiff > T*2 sort of trigger might work

[08-Aug-19 04:11 PM] zawy#5864
I mean it is supposed to be the stopping of a very large attack that should trigger the exponential.

[08-Aug-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought the 3 block attack was only practical via CPU

[08-Aug-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
where you can precisely control when to start and stop mining

[08-Aug-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so more in the 5x attack realm?

[08-Aug-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
any large attack will be stopped by RST after 3 blocks

[08-Aug-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and just the cost of renting nicehash is getting very expensive and impossible to control any precise timing

[08-Aug-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
even with your own ASIC, you would need a custom pool that can redirect hash on a moments notice. just using the normal interface to change the pool is too slow for 3 block attack

[08-Aug-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so it could be the 3 block attack is only an issue for chains with < ASIC of hashrate

[08-Aug-19 04:17 PM] zawy#5864
I have been told by someone who does attacks that you can do on and off for three blocks all the time. A pool or miner can withhold 3 blocks then release them.

[08-Aug-19 04:18 PM] zawy#5864
But I don't know any details on what it takes to switch from one point to another within one block, which is what you really need to do to be able to profit without enough money when there's only three blocks like this

[08-Aug-19 04:18 PM] SHossain#0007
- start the chain #20
- mine with 50 threads till height 65, after that RST will kick in
- continue mining about 30-40 blocks until the second hash on mining printout is 0
- mine more 17 blocks with second hash 0
- then try to stablilize the diff by starting 1 thread
- once the diff is stable start 2x, 3x, 5x test
- keep a record of hash increase and decrease with block number
does these steps looks ok?

[08-Aug-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
you missed one step
