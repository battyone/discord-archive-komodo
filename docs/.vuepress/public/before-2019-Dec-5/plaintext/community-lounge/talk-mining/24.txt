clever

[24-Jul-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
still haven't sorted which idea I like better or how to perfect either

[24-Jul-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
but I have decided that if I still haven't hit a VRSC block by the time I get up in the am, I'm done trying to mine it

[24-Jul-18 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
bill collectors don't seem to like hearing "but I should hit a block any day now" üò¶

[24-Jul-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah put my PC back on mining it... seems pointless at 150MH

[24-Jul-18 04:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
seems pointless @ 350 üòõ

[24-Jul-18 04:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
besides, I need that setup as part of my winning 40% of all blocks in the 50/50 test

[24-Jul-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made some great progress on that, but likely all you need is 90% of the hash for the first 1000 blocks and you wont be able to lose.

[24-Jul-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have data pushed live to a CSV being served to the net, I use that to count segids to decide where to send mined funds

[24-Jul-18 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it'll cost someone 0.125 BTC to rent what I already have for the PoW part

[24-Jul-18 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
plus whatever I opt to rent üòà

[24-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
100% of the PoW for the 1st 1000 blocks is still only 500 blocks

[24-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it'll take more than that to win

[24-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
much more

[24-Jul-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
hell, I lost the last one by a ton and I think I had like 1100 when we finished

[24-Jul-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My setup is destroying whoever is left on that test now

[24-Jul-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Works perfectly for the PoS side

[24-Jul-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
highly randomised distribution üòÑ

[24-Jul-18 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, james took out the "if"s that made the C chain work and I couldn't do anymore after I updated for the 50/50

[24-Jul-18 04:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it appears to select small UTXOs at the start leaving larger ones until later, at which time they have plenty of age....

[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the the small ones just sont get selected for a long time.

[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still waiting to see if they ever get a turn, if not a redistribution with larger UTXO will be needed after some time.

[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lol I had big ones that never got selected

[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
were you using lots of deamons?

[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
2

[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found with all address imported into 2 deamon the wallet is usless... calling a listunspent takes forever.

[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sodivided 8 address to each deamon

[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and have anohter 2 deamons to control everything and count stats and send coins

[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its fucking complicated to use lol

[24-Jul-18 04:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I figure on running tuesday like "normal" and then adding vmware to server on wednesday and splitting off a few vms

[24-Jul-18 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
50/50 makes it a lot easier for me to stay in top 3

[24-Jul-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Already have 2 VM's of 8 cores each going... but he newset jl777 branch is not working on Debian9 (or GCC 6 ) so I need to compile komodo on ubuntu then copy it over scp to the public facing VM. PITA hopefullly they find a fix before the test.

[24-Jul-18 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
piss, vinegar, and a 7800 BTC just about assures me 30% of blocks üòõ

[24-Jul-18 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and that's if I don't stake anything

[24-Jul-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[24-Jul-18 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@bishop why would you even mention a pool that doesn't even have KMD? üò£

[24-Jul-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek me, I can't find 1 damn failover KMD pool to use üò°

[24-Jul-18 05:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
even hellcatz's pool comes up as "Dead" üòï

[24-Jul-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that solomining pool doesn't work for me üò¶

[24-Jul-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could not locate bindings file üòï

[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
bindings file?

[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nfi

[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
did you `npm install`?

[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just copied the install steps one by one and it complains of a mising bindings file somewhere in the node_moduels directory

[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
what version of node are you using?

[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I remeber on my chips pool, I needed some exact node version maybe its that.. debian didnt have node in apt-get so I just used 8

[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think.. but it may have upodated itself to 10

[24-Jul-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
npm 6.1.0

[24-Jul-18 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nodejs 8.11.3

[24-Jul-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
any 8+ should be good

[24-Jul-18 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm...

[24-Jul-18 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no clue about npm version, I don't think I've ever known what version of npm I was using

[24-Jul-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its looking for a file called `bignum.node` but there is no file ending with .node

[24-Jul-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
bignum.cc  binding.gyp  index.js  package.json  README.markdown
only these

[24-Jul-18 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`$ nvm use 8
Now using node v8.11.1 (npm v6.1.0)`
So, it's not a node/npm issue

[24-Jul-18 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you can pastebin (or the like) the actual error output, I might could see it

[24-Jul-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

https://pastebin.com/i/facebook.png

[24-Jul-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
use
`npm start`
and not
`node init.js`

[24-Jul-18 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did that

[24-Jul-18 05:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
odd, it works for me with the former and I get that same error with the latter

[24-Jul-18 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
try `npm update` then `npm start` maybe?

[24-Jul-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yea just deleted it and going to start again ...

[24-Jul-18 05:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm it started with the zcash config... but obviously failed.. trying my POS testchain now ü§û

üëçüèø

[24-Jul-18 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for anything PoS (or even part PoS), it may need editing in order to work without a shit ton of errors for PoW not being PoS

[24-Jul-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it complained for a while of RPC errors but then they stopped... will see. I dont really need it for that, but its good test on to see if I can get it at least close to working.

[24-Jul-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is 0 point pointing 1.5ksol at the test chain...

[24-Jul-18 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, you got it workingish?

[24-Jul-18 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[24-Jul-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the RPC user and Pass are copy psted direct from conf.... and it just floods incorrect rpc user/pass

[24-Jul-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
port is right aswell

[24-Jul-18 06:00 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
did you allow the IP of the stratum host in the coin config?

[24-Jul-18 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dunno why it didnt work with POSTEST64D but its working with RFOX... just need to point some hash at it now.

[24-Jul-18 06:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks for the help

[24-Jul-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I gave up with that pool... managed to get it submitting shares... but it didnt find any blocks even with 270H/s. üòï

[24-Jul-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it kept polling the deamon too much on RPC... flooding errors.

[24-Jul-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying Z-NOMP

[24-Jul-18 07:20 AM] jansako#3330
@blackjok3r the node issue on z-nomp, I find I need it direct from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions

hte 8.x

[24-Jul-18 07:21 AM] jansako#3330
and do not update it

[24-Jul-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its on nodejs 8. somethiing

[24-Jul-18 07:21 AM] jansako#3330
this worked the lat 3-4 times I set  up z-nomp

[24-Jul-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ytrying kmd-nomp not sure it working though I am getting a LOT of errors on npm update

[24-Jul-18 07:22 AM] jansako#3330
üòÉ one sec

[24-Jul-18 07:22 AM] jansako#3330
definitive guide:

[24-Jul-18 07:22 AM] jansako#3330
just installed the KMD dependencies
just do 
`sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqt4-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate vim software-properties-common curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake clang` 

right away on the fresh install (sudo apt-get update first)
then nodejs 8.xx (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
then redis
then libsodium
then z-nomp

[24-Jul-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks will try it... I better not need ANOTHER VM just to run it... starting to get a bit overloaded on the server lol

[24-Jul-18 07:24 AM] jansako#3330
üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 07:25 AM] jansako#3330
I got a refurb Dell Optiplex for $100 to run my local one

[24-Jul-18 07:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hgmmmm I think those are the steps I followed exactly... maybe I can remove node.js and install it again. This is on a VM on my notary node... I cant really afford to wipe the VM and start again.... :S

[24-Jul-18 07:26 AM] jansako#3330
yes, once you put a later node version, it is F-d... at least for me, I always blow the VM and start over

[24-Jul-18 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can downgrade it... but its still on 8 so that should be ok

[24-Jul-18 07:26 AM] jansako#3330
there is a step to update node in the z-nomp instructions, if you do that it no longer works

[24-Jul-18 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh maybe thats it

[24-Jul-18 07:27 AM] jansako#3330
I know you can, it just never worked for me. get stuck on the 'bignum' modules at that point

[24-Jul-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yep thats what its doing here... so it must have somehow updated

[24-Jul-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks... i was able to remove the package so ü§û
