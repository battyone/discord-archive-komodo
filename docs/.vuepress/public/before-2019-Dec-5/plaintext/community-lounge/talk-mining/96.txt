Im interested in learn  fpga too ,where to start?

`At one point FPGA's were making 300-500 bucks a day on monero laast year.` with no context as to how much was spent initially 😛

the best way to make a small fortune in the mining business is to start with a large one

[12-Jan-19 05:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
FPGAs are older than most people that are now interested in cryptocoins, and people have been using them on Bitcoin since 2010/2011

[12-Jan-19 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
ArtForz, a name you should really know, wrote one of the first GPU miners for BTC

[12-Jan-19 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
`On December 15, 2010 ArtForz noted on IRC that he had 15.75 Ghash/s which at the current difficulty of 12252 would generate 1,292 bitcoins per day and this farm still used Radeon 5770s.`

[12-Jan-19 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
let that sink in. No, really.

[12-Jan-19 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
As soon as he was bored with GPUs, he switches to FPGAs+ASICs, and nobody every heard from him again.

[12-Jan-19 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
1300 BTC per *day* from GPUs

[12-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
in early 2018 it was possible to make roughly $100/day with a single 1080ti

[12-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 milked the ever living hell out of it 😄

[12-Jan-19 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
at least half of it is when you *sell* what you mined. Most beginner miners don't get that

[12-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
I bought a 1080ti and it paid itself off in less than a week with some help from him

[12-Jan-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
was always confused why he let me cut into his profits

[12-Jan-19 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
they value everything *now* and sell for current worth, counting pennies

[12-Jan-19 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright he must like you

[12-Jan-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
There will always be little niches like that in crypto. Everyone who is paying attention is making money regardless of bull/bear

[12-Jan-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`milked` is past tense, I still have them all and will be firing GPUs back up this week 😛

[12-Jan-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
small mining niches always exist

[12-Jan-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
large miners have so much overhead, many opportunities are not available to them

[12-Jan-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, many do. Very smart miners always minimize overhead and grow smart + slowly

[12-Jan-19 05:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
otherwise you become a story on the news, like all those WA mining colo startups that failed

[12-Jan-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still just a baby miner, all mu stuff still fits in a 20'x20' barn 😛

[13-Jan-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to make $50 a day from a HD7950 at the end of 2017 for a good week maybe 2.... That card cost me $100 2 years prior 😮

[13-Jan-19 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wasnt so easy... rented it out, then used profits to mine chips on MRR to a private pool while all public ones were under some kind of DDOS...  Hash rate was very low, but price didnt change much.

We seem to be getting a different version then 0.3.3b 
After doing fit checkout for 0.3.3b and compiling it. We end up with 2001526

These pools needs updating their daemon and may have to resync. They are stuck on an old block height

[14-Jan-19 12:47 PM] jorian#4555
do you have a script running for that?

[14-Jan-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
nice

[14-Jan-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
his solo pool software shows how much next block will be

[14-Jan-19 12:49 PM] jorian#4555
ahh. and when a wild fat block appears, he cranks up his 30 1080s? 😛

[14-Jan-19 12:49 PM] jorian#4555
or points a lot of NH

[14-Jan-19 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
i wonder how effective that will be. because blocks are 1 minute interval. you need to be super fast for that

[14-Jan-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```   if ((((blockReward + feeReward) / Math.pow(10, 8)) > 10) && (coin.symbol.toUpperCase() == 'KMD')) {
        console.log(colors.red(entryDesc + 'The current block is worth: ' + ((blockReward + feeReward) / Math.pow(10, 8)) + ' ' +coin.symbol.toUpperCase()));
    } else {
        console.log(colors.green(entryDesc + 'The current block is worth: ' + ((blockReward + feeReward) / Math.pow(10, 8)) + ' ' +coin.symbol.toUpperCase()));
    }```

[14-Jan-19 12:52 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, i wondered the same

[14-Jan-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
uses colors module

[14-Jan-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I added it because I integrated it into my profit switcher

[14-Jan-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
it's cool

[14-Jan-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if block reward is over 25 I switch to KMD no matter what I'm mining

[14-Jan-19 12:54 PM] jorian#4555
yeah exactly

[14-Jan-19 12:54 PM] jorian#4555
does it work though? :p

[14-Jan-19 12:54 PM] jorian#4555
seeing libscott mining a fat reward a week ago

[14-Jan-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's only really effective with existing hash

[14-Jan-19 12:55 PM] jorian#4555
can you use NH's API? i wonder how fast NH starts mining for you, once you submit an order

[14-Jan-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It will "work", but not very well with 1 minute block times and new orders, the longest I've seen is 2 mins 19 secs from seeing tx to a block with it and NH spin times usually take much longer than that for any significant hash to spin up on a new order

[14-Jan-19 12:57 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, that was what i was thinking

[14-Jan-19 12:58 PM] jorian#4555
the best would be having a shitload of hash power sitting 'idle'

[14-Jan-19 12:58 PM] jorian#4555
and have it ready whenever it's needed

[14-Jan-19 12:58 PM] jorian#4555
aka profit switcher

[14-Jan-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or just mine whatever you mine and have your proxy switch over when over x reward

which pool si good for mining kmd ?

[15-Jan-19 08:32 AM] $tefano.#3560
@akaneo make your own pool

[15-Jan-19 08:32 AM] $tefano.#3560
it's simple

[15-Jan-19 08:33 AM] $tefano.#3560
in this way you can contribute to support chain with your node

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is it up and stable now? I thought you were still in testing & taking it down fairly often... Very interested in the coinswitch feature, (I understand it's limitations, can't wait for you to implement auto-trade & payouts in selected tokens - hint hint) 😃

[16-Jan-19 09:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no auto-trade, ever

[16-Jan-19 09:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👏 nice to see your pool online mate 👍 
tried that domain earlier, wasn't showing any website, like few months ago I guess...

[16-Jan-19 09:40 AM] jansako#3330
How about 'internal' auto-trade? (Checks prices & allocates mined currency to user per their preference). With the understanding that it can only pay out what is mined... then maybe every 24 hours it pays out the rest in whatever was mined... and takes a reasonable fee in the process. Avoids all the hassle with sending to exch etc

[16-Jan-19 09:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, @grewalsatinder it was down for a while, since no one was mining there anyway, I used it for sapling tests and then kept it down while working on the backend some

[16-Jan-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙂 👍

[16-Jan-19 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako switching targets is the best one can hope for from my site
If I get what you mean, @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers pool is about what you're looking for

[16-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jansako#3330
Somehow with that one I more often end up net negative... tried but too much of a hit & miss.

[16-Jan-19 09:46 AM] jansako#3330
mostly because he can push hash to coins that have huge nethash so it can take longer than my order length to find a block...

[16-Jan-19 09:47 AM] jansako#3330
I like yours cause niche is more my thing...

[16-Jan-19 09:47 AM] jansako#3330

Thats not bad. Verus Hash that KMD has in it is one super crazy powerful algo on CPU. My test chain here 51% PoS64 with verushash is over 2 billion diffuculty with just 3 CPU cores of a RYZEN 2700X.

[17-Jan-19 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
about 120s block times though. But I kind of calibrated it to that.

[17-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Lumbi#8378
@blackjok3r quite a chainsaw for fpga

[17-Jan-19 03:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figure that our chains have 0 block reward so no FPGA miner will mine them. VerusHash solved a huge issue with PoS64 chains, took 4 days to get it working.. but it works mint.

[17-Jan-19 06:14 PM] Lumbi#8378
"field programmable" allows for quite a bit of flexibility, no?

no block rewards for 49% of the PoW chain?

"field programmable" is a relatively vague term; as it's intended to apply, yes, it offers a fair amount of flexibility
`no block rewards for 49% of the PoW chain?`
huh?

Yes @Lumbi  0 BR but tx fees
