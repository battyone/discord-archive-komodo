i went to check the CHIPS miner and found them in the status page. was wondering what those are.

[27-Oct-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the higher you push the freq is the higher that will climb, it's safe to ignore unless it climbs to a point where you're producing measurably  significant number of errors

[27-Oct-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for an s9, meaningful is in the 10s of thousands and up (more if it's been running for any length of time)

[27-Oct-18 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
this is a T9+

[27-Oct-18 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
no change in settings, apart from the pool settings.

[27-Oct-18 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
only mining CHIPS

[27-Oct-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
t9/s9/s7 are all the same as far as that part goes

@hypocalese the latest VRSC changes things, you need to start daemon with `-mint` to stake, staking is off by default as of 0.4.0

[27-Oct-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 one of my z9's got "stuck" in a weird place, blinking red lights and 1 of 2 fans at 100% (the other at 0), I had to reboot and then it was happy. Does this kind of thing happen to you? It happened only on my batch 3 running stock, so far, and haven't seen it on my batch 2 with is OC'ed

[27-Oct-18 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
the admin panel showed 0 KSol/s, no hashing, in that state

[27-Oct-18 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
correction, the above are z9m's

[27-Oct-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
seems each generation is degrading quickly

[27-Oct-18 03:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
indeed 👆🏼

[27-Oct-18 03:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have seen things cycle fans when a pool goes down for a second, but this was stuck for 2hrs

[27-Oct-18 03:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
doing a lot of fan, no hashing

[27-Oct-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I've only had that happen with OC and overheating

[27-Oct-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, stock, I'm not much help 😦

[27-Oct-18 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, good to know. i have been dealing with some heat issues, even tho it's below freezing outside

[27-Oct-18 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
i need to push heat out with a fan, gotta start cutting holes in walls

[27-Oct-18 04:14 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yup looks that way silicone is getting sloppier

[27-Oct-18 04:15 PM] BlackJesus#6161
my  8 batch 2's are doing wonderful

[27-Oct-18 04:15 PM] BlackJesus#6161
My batch 1 completely failed and got warrantied

[27-Oct-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_had just the exact opposite B1 were rockstars and B2 were "hit and miss"_

[27-Oct-18 04:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yea

[27-Oct-18 04:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
i missed an entire month of batch 1 mining

[27-Oct-18 04:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
-_-

[27-Oct-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems it's just "luck of the draw" as to what is "decent" results
I got 1x from batch 1 and 2x from batch 1.5 and they've been hitting full stride OCed @ 750 the whole time

[27-Oct-18 04:18 PM] BlackJesus#6161
what pool do you use computergenie didnt yo usetup your own pool?

[27-Oct-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[28-Oct-18 09:47 AM] WeyezOD#1176
Thx. I have to check that pool out. I'm still making the rounds and trying to figure out which one suits me best. I'm on Polly Pool right now checking it out for the first time. Your pool is next on my list 😃

[28-Oct-18 09:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Awesome 😃 We are a bit lower on the hash rate than the others unfortunately. Hopefully we can recruit some more miners to bump those numbers up

[28-Oct-18 09:52 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I don't mind lower hash rate. In fact, I like it.

[28-Oct-18 09:52 AM] WeyezOD#1176
9-12 Msols/s isn't bad

[28-Oct-18 09:53 AM] WeyezOD#1176
3 workers ... all pretty high hash rates on each

[28-Oct-18 09:53 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I'm a row boat in comparison to those ships of war!

[28-Oct-18 10:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Either way, we would love to see you join the fleet! That goes for any other miners with a bit of hash under their belt. Please consider our pool :)

@NutellaLicka Your server is based in the US? West Coast?

[28-Oct-18 11:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sure is

[28-Oct-18 11:23 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I saw the time stamp on the blocks you've found.

[28-Oct-18 11:23 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I hope you're not in CA. If you are you're maybe paying triple electric rates

For those of you who wanted to run the z9 mini slightly cooler, take off the backplate **(WARNING!!! Warranty VOID!!!)**

[28-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or just provide adequate airflow to/from the room they are in...

[28-Oct-18 02:31 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you are right 👍🏽

[28-Oct-18 02:31 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm doing both 😛

[28-Oct-18 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
what is fan speed?

[28-Oct-18 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i have them at 2400

[28-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have 2 that are still set at 90% because of 1 hot day before we finished installing vent fans, other than that, they are on auto

[28-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 3 won't handle that kind of heat

[28-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dunno, I switched to A9s :abusedsmily:

[28-Oct-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
my batch 3 z9m overheats when ambient room temp is 70F/21C, running stock, this is pretty bad

[28-Oct-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's sitting directly next to a batch 2, on the same PSU, so it's interesting to see how different they are. Batch 3 seem to be the bottom of the QA bin

[28-Oct-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Batch 3 seem to be the bottom of the QA bin`
heh, I thought that about b2 😛

[28-Oct-18 09:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it will support, the question is if you can get full OC

[28-Oct-18 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that gigabyte mb sux, no PS/2 (so win 7 is no-go), I can't find any flavor of linux install that supports the intel integrated NIC, a complete waste of time and effort

[29-Oct-18 12:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I finally got xubuntu-18.10 to install; not ideal, but a fek sight better than win 10 🙂

[29-Oct-18 12:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Stuck on win 10 on a gigabyte board here too, I think Linux installed but didn't work properly, its shit but u can delete most of the crap from it at leeast

Future of Zcash mining (circa 2019 and 2020)
Folks: after extensive study, consultation with other people in the industry, and public discussion on this forum and many other places, the Zcash Company has decided we’ll support a new version of our zcashd software which implements changes to mining.  When?  Nothing will...

```I just wanted to get this heads-up out there so that everyone knows we are not committing to “status quo” on mining throughout 2019 and in fact we’re committing to making changes to mining, which changes will start kicking in before the end of 2019. - zooko```

[29-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jansako#3330
Morning folks! Anyone knows what happened in the Equihash world? Price of hash on NH jumped like 20-25%, bunch of large orders stacked to costs I have not seen at lest for a month...

[29-Oct-18 09:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
so wtf? is all new hardware nerfed with win 10 now?

[29-Oct-18 09:18 AM] $tefano.#3560
@dukeleto " I think it would be really great if Zcash could be more accessible to more 14yo gamer"
I read Asic Resistant in this words with GPUs rigs

[29-Oct-18 09:20 AM] $tefano.#3560
now the question is buy gpus now at lower price or increase ASICs power now ?
what will be the coins that will remain with 200/9 after "possible" switch ? komodo, hush, btch ?😄

[29-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
ZEC to switch to verushash

[29-Oct-18 09:49 AM] $tefano.#3560
maybe 😀

[29-Oct-18 11:18 AM] jansako#3330
Not sure what happened, maybe someone trying to drive price up or something. Most of those 30 Msol orders disappeared within an hour, now even my sub- 0.05 orders are getting some love...

[29-Oct-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@actionslacks It might could work with a PS/2 addon card and/or automated install of win7, but even with a USB3 thumbdrive and USB3 drivers the older win7 install just doesn't want to recognize USB mouse/keyboard

[29-Oct-18 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326

Hey guys I have an Antminer Z9Mini batch3 and I flashed batch1 firmware. He  work 1 month with one crash last week at 650M frequency. Today he crash and reboot after 1 hour. After 3 hours without problem he switch into green light and red light. I can't connect on web page and ssh too. Someone with the same issue ? What can I do ?

[29-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Hermes#6934
You will need to generate a Z address with your Pirate wallet and use this configuration as showed

[29-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Hermes#6934
I haven't used Nicehash but I am guessing that if you are not using it you should choose the Low Diff port

[29-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Hermes#6934
the password can be anything

@Lox3ur  I tried doing some overclocking but I avoided this because it's a bit risky...haven't heard of it...
