if you really want to break it down

[20-Mar-19 01:01 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
right! very similar to what i did, apart from my stuff being written in that javascript "programming language" =)

[20-Mar-19 01:01 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, yeah, i was using difficulty all the time, that's why all my calculations were off

[20-Mar-19 01:02 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
such calculations work for cryptonote coins, so i just tried to apply something similar here, but obviously it doesn't work that way...

[20-Mar-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`being written in that javascript "programming language" ` Oh that causes so much pain to my brain

[20-Mar-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the calc is the same for all coins (the only exception is ones that have designated block producers)
your block count will always be what your hash can get out of the total

[20-Mar-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
BTC, PIRATE, CoinX
will all use the same formula

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ lol sorry for brain pain, i totally feel you there =)) but when you say that "calc is the same for all coins", you refer to equihash coins, right?

[20-Mar-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
no, all coimns

[20-Mar-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
there it total hashrate

[20-Mar-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
X

[20-Mar-19 01:52 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i mean, for cryptonote coins for example, i am using difficulty for calculations... and net hash rate is nothing but difficulty divided by block time...

[20-Mar-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you have some percentage of the total hashrate

[20-Mar-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you will get that exact percentage of coins mined on a statistical basisi

[20-Mar-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
using diff makes things totally different

[20-Mar-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
use your hashrate and nethash

[20-Mar-19 01:53 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c yeah i realized that "using diff makes things totally different" just recently, but still trying to explain to myself why is that so

[20-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
because the diff cal from nethash is nonlinear

[20-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
diff calc

[20-Mar-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`i am using difficulty for calculations`
it's literally the same calculation
the only difference is the coin name, nothing else

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
for example, my calc for cryptonote coins is simple as `(hr * 86400seconds / difficulty) * block_reward / coins_sig_divisor`

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and all you want to know is what percentage of coins you will get, then just calculate what percentage of hashrate you have

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
which is pretty different from equihash

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
what is `coins_sig_divisor` in "layman's terms"?

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use cryptonote nethash to calculate your percentage

[20-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
you are really overcomplicating this

[20-Mar-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
each hash has the same chance as another

[20-Mar-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a total of T hashes in the network. you are doing X % of it -> you get X% of coins

[20-Mar-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basic algrebra

[20-Mar-19 01:57 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ it's a definition of the smallest coin denomination... e.g. daemon always treats values without decimals - 1 monero is actually 1000000000000 in daemon's terms... so you just use "sig divisor" to divide that raw value and you get amount in coins...

[20-Mar-19 01:58 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c well, that's what i thought too in the beginning :)) but using equihash numbers in same formula didn't actually produce desired result... but since i imagine that it should work the same, let me try it now again a bit just out of curiosity

[20-Mar-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`it's a definition of the smallest coin denomination.`
then the only difference between what you "normally" use and what I gave you is how many decimal places the result is
if that works for cryptonote, then it will work for sha255, eqiuhash, and/or newAlgoX

[20-Mar-19 02:03 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ yeah, of course, i was trying to ignore that part of equation or "fake" it in some way to get proper result back.. but let me check a bit again now...

[20-Mar-19 02:03 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but speaking of that "sig divisor" value...

[20-Mar-19 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there's nothing to "fake"
if there are 1440 blocks per day and you have 10% of the hashrate, then you will get 144 blocks (on average)

[20-Mar-19 02:04 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i see that ARRR `getinfo` response has `"reward"` value in it, which shows `"reward": "25600000000"`

[20-Mar-19 02:04 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i wonder how can one tell which value should be used here for division?

[20-Mar-19 02:04 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
is that defined somewhere in source code?

[20-Mar-19 02:05 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
because for cryptonote coins it is... https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_config.h#L67

it's in satoshis, so you move the decimal 8 places to get 256

[20-Mar-19 02:05 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah, so in equihash it's always 8?

[20-Mar-19 02:05 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
cn can have different values there really, which renders out coin's value with more or less decimal places...

[20-Mar-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`is that defined somewhere in source code?`
it's defined in the params of PIRATE `-ac_reward=25600000000`

[20-Mar-19 02:06 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
alright, i understand it now

[20-Mar-19 02:06 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
thanks a bunch, let me try to play around with this calculator now a bit more

[20-Mar-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it has nothing to do with the hashing algo, the number of decimals

[20-Mar-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some coins that have 7 or even just 6 decimals and they could be using whatever hashing algo

[20-Mar-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
getblocksubsidy is what you can use to find the blocksubsidy for a height

[20-Mar-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
unless you mess it up like webby did :troll:

[20-Mar-19 02:09 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c i know it has nothing to do with algo, i was just curious if thing like this exists in equihash coins or not... i like the fact that it doesn't, it really just complicates things for no reason...

[20-Mar-19 02:10 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
`getblocksubsidy` you say? let me check what's that and where to get it

[20-Mar-19 02:11 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah right, it's a command, not part of the answer...

[20-Mar-19 02:12 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, so this should give me the exact block reward value for given block, right? no need to deduct anything from that value?

[20-Mar-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be txfees added to that amount

[20-Mar-19 02:14 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, and ofc, if some asset defined some custom rewards too, as per explanation in docs

[20-Mar-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some chains where it wont be easy to calculate the blocksubsidy

[20-Mar-19 02:15 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i see, yeah, might get a bit more complicated...

[20-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
just let the daemon create the coinbase

[20-Mar-19 02:16 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, i hope this will be enough for the beginning until i learn a bit more about the philosophy of KMD platform

[20-Mar-19 02:18 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c does that mean that all assets on KMD platform have to be run with custom value in `-ac_reward` flag? otherwise it will inherit block reward amount from KMD itself?

[20-Mar-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Mar-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the default is 0.0001 per block if not specified

[20-Mar-19 02:19 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah ok! but how does komodo then has 3 as reward while i didn't use that flag at all?

[20-Mar-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Mar-19 02:22 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
those params are set when i use `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`, right?

[20-Mar-19 02:23 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i keep forgetting about those, as i said i'm fairly new in equihash world, and for cryptonote coins this thing simply doesn't exist... all is defined in a single file in source code and when you build your daemon, those parameters are applied...

[20-Mar-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
this has nothing to do with equihash

[20-Mar-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD just happens to use equihash and KMD has added a lot of things to the baseline

[20-Mar-19 02:29 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah right, equihash is just an algorithm, ofc

[20-Mar-19 02:30 PM] gcharang#6833
and ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh is about Zcash parameters related to zk-snarks
the params I posted are used to customise an asset chain created with KMD and are used along with the daemon at launch

[20-Mar-19 02:32 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@gcharang ok i understand now about shell script... but still, i didn't run my kmd daemon with any flag at all.... does that mean that i'm using it wrong in the first place?

[20-Mar-19 02:32 PM] gcharang#6833
komodo daemon with out any flag runs the komodo main chain that has the coin Komodo

[20-Mar-19 02:33 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok i understand

[20-Mar-19 02:34 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but sorry for dumb question again, can you explain where is for example KMD block reward defined then?

[20-Mar-19 02:35 PM] gcharang#6833
It is like a special case and is hard coded
For any other chain created using Komodo daemon, it will follow the flags

[20-Mar-19 02:37 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
understood!

[20-Mar-19 02:37 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902

[20-Mar-19 05:42 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c i was playing around with this basic algebra stuff but i still think that i cannot apply my CN formula for the same calculation in KMD (or any other equihash i suppose)... this is not extremely important tbh, i'm just trying to clarify things to myself, but allow me to explain... in CN coins, daemon never reports "network hash rate" in any response whatsoever... if one wants to calculate network hash rate, it's a simple division of difficulty by block time (e.g. current Monero diff is 36.5b, block time is 120sec, therefore net hash rate is ~300MH/s). so to calculate profit based on hash rate, it's simple as `(hr/diff)*reward`...

[20-Mar-19 05:42 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
however, the relation between difficulty and net hash rate for KMD simply doesn't add up in any way :/

[20-Mar-19 05:43 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
for example... current KMD diff is `212764720`, block time is `62`... that should give us that net hash rate is `3431689` Sol/s i suppose

[20-Mar-19 05:44 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
or `3.4MSol/s`.... but that's not the case... it looks like current net hash rate is `56` MSol/s

[20-Mar-19 05:44 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and that's a huge difference there...

[20-Mar-19 05:45 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i know i am averaging some things here, but even with that the difference is way to big to be affected by my averaging...

[20-Mar-19 05:45 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i am missing some piece of the puzzle for sure

[20-Mar-19 05:49 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
before asking here, i tried to figure out why my calculations for KMD don't fit into CN formula and at one point i came across this forum thread (https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/help-calculating-profit-per-day-making-my-own-profitability-calculator/20151/9) where people are usually using this `sol/block modifier` or `work size` as they refer to it, with this magical number of `8192`... but to be honest, even with that, my calculation was never right... that's why after a while i came here to ask what am i doing wrong here...

[20-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
didn't quite do the math, but I think you can use 56msol in the calculation. This should include notary "hashrate"

[20-Mar-19 05:55 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@Alright yeah, that was apparently my main problem in my calculation, because i tried to use difficulty, not net hash rate... the moment i replaced difficulty with net hash rate, everything seems fine (comparing to other calculators around)

[20-Mar-19 05:55 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but that doesn't somehow make sense in my mind... all this is based on same technology and after all it's not rocket science, just a simple math

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
`networksols` is exactly what you described, a function of time and diff

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
it's not exact at all

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, but it should give you some "approx" number...

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
however, with KMD, this doesn't work like that

[20-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
it *kind of* does

[20-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
that number includes the notary "hashrate"

[20-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
as if notaries were hashing normally if that makes sense
