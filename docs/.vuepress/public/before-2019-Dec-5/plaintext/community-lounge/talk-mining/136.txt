check the data i've been posting

[01-Aug-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
man I've been moaning about this for like a year now üò´

[01-Aug-19 12:23 AM] SHossain#0007
blocks, time and diff

[01-Aug-19 12:23 AM] SHossain#0007
it got lowered over the time. and hopefully by next 18-20 hours the diff will be under 100

[01-Aug-19 12:24 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm mining only with 1 CPU thread

[01-Aug-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
any implications of using this on a chain that does expect a high amount of hashrate?

[01-Aug-19 12:24 AM] SHossain#0007
now block 2484 and diff is 38535

[01-Aug-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
basically is there any reason this shouldn't be default?

[01-Aug-19 12:25 AM] SHossain#0007
it's going down with every block

[01-Aug-19 12:26 AM] SHossain#0007
it automatically activating for 100% PoW chains that are started on october 31st or later

[01-Aug-19 12:26 AM] SHossain#0007
by that time it should be merged into beta even master branch

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
good shit

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
am very tired of unstalling chains

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
and what of existing ones?

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] Alright#0419
staying the same?

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] SHossain#0007
it's a hardforking change.

[01-Aug-19 12:27 AM] SHossain#0007
for new chains it wouldn't matter

[01-Aug-19 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
`Even if there are miners that are willing to rescue a stranded chain once, what if it happens again, and again` <- me for the last year

[01-Aug-19 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
by that time James might figure out something for existing chains hopefully

[01-Aug-19 12:30 AM] SHossain#0007
this would fix all your issue with unstalling a stranded chain just using 1 CPU thread only

[01-Aug-19 12:30 AM] SHossain#0007
i would be happy to see this working by default for all existing 100% PoW chain from next hardfork

[01-Aug-19 12:31 AM] SHossain#0007
from over a million diff to under 50,000 diff in less than 5 hours is pretty cool

[01-Aug-19 12:32 AM] Alright#0419
you chain params for this?

[01-Aug-19 12:32 AM] Alright#0419
I think I can lower diff faster than normal based on what I just read in medium article

[01-Aug-19 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
did jl go into technical details of this anywhere?

[01-Aug-19 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
time warps

[01-Aug-19 12:34 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll post the param after about 18 hours later. until then, i want to have controlled mining to bring the diff down with single thread. but, you can start a new 100% PoW chain with `-ac_adaptivepow=1` using `nSPV` branch to test

[01-Aug-19 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
did he make it intentionally time warp similar to pos64?

[01-Aug-19 12:35 AM] SHossain#0007
what is time wrap?

[01-Aug-19 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
push timestamps into the past or future to mess with the diff

[01-Aug-19 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
take a look at a pos64 chain, you'll see what I mean

[01-Aug-19 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
look for a POW block followed by a POS block and you'll see that the POS block will be submitted with a timestamp in the future

[01-Aug-19 12:37 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't have any explorer to check the timestamp and i am monitoring only debug.log

[01-Aug-19 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
it shows you timestamp in debug.log

[01-Aug-19 12:37 AM] Alright#0419

not doing it

[01-Aug-19 12:38 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't notice any time wrap

[01-Aug-19 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
ok I'll play around with it on my own chain

[01-Aug-19 12:39 AM] SHossain#0007
we just wanted to have a controlled test, so no params at the moment

[01-Aug-19 12:39 AM] SHossain#0007
only 2 nodes running for this chain

[01-Aug-19 12:39 AM] SHossain#0007
james stopped his nodes

[01-Aug-19 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
testing that it works as intended in normal conditions is not the same as testing whether it's resistant to attacks üòõ

[01-Aug-19 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
>my job 
I guess

[01-Aug-19 12:41 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can test different attack vectors on a new chain now or wait until 18 hours for this test to finish

[01-Aug-19 12:42 AM] SHossain#0007
the basic idea of adaptivepow is working.

[01-Aug-19 12:43 AM] Alright#0419
have a feeling it won't be when I'm done with it :troll:

[01-Aug-19 12:43 AM] SHossain#0007
then, start a new chain. we need to keep this chain running for historic purposes

[01-Aug-19 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
yes, thanks for saying that for the 12th time

I‚Äôm writing a proposal this month supporting an 80-10-10 split in mining rewards between miners, the foundation, and ECC. I think that‚Äôs the winning combo, and I‚Äôm personally betting on it. 

Good luck, @zooko! https://t.co/7l3G2pKxI6

wait what... how much do miners get now? Isnt 80% a big cut from the point they are at now?

[01-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
they promised the 20% was just till first halving then stop so it would be 10%. they had some elaborate excuse why it wasnt a flat 10% for all time

[01-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now we know the real reason

[01-Aug-19 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
They are trying to renege on that?

[01-Aug-19 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
the initial emissions schedule?

[01-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, they now propose to keep the miners at 80% (since they are used to it) and 10% to them and 10% for the foundation

[01-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
gee, that seems like not changing anything and doubling their rewards

[01-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm thought miners already got only 90%

[01-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess the foundation is even greedyer than i thought

[01-Aug-19 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
after 456 blocks diff is down to only 9 from 1.2 million

[01-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but how long did those 456 blocks take? what would have been the normal speed of blocks?

[01-Aug-19 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
about 16.5 hours

[01-Aug-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
thats only 46% of the normal rate, and it was only a stranding of 1.3 million times

nice! new changes does smooth things out

[01-Aug-19 09:26 PM] zawy#5864
I've been discussing with @jl777c how to do this.  Quick drops like this after hash attacks without symmetrical ability to increase causes too many coins to be issued, if the large miner wants to come back as soon as it is low again. BCH's asymmetrical EDA was a famously bad example and we're trying to do something 10,000x more extreme.   If you try to make it symmetrical with fast rises when the attacks begin, you end up in persistant wild oscillations as as the big miner comes and goes.   However this is an extreme situation where coins get stuck, so it's hard to imagine it being worse.   To test the theory this will issue too many coins, model for a 1000x miner to start mining if difficulty drops < 5x the  basiline miners' hashrate, and then stops when difficulty reaches 100x

@radix42

[01-Aug-19 09:29 PM] zawy#5864
I guess the primary risk is causing problems for coins that were not at risk of getting stuck, opening a door for more profit, pulling an attacker into existence.

[01-Aug-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
in theory, the CPU additive would reduce the large miner's ability to do "as much" damage (in what you're saying) because the chain keeps moving, which in turn stops the diff from reaching the mega-drop levels

[01-Aug-19 09:31 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
It's not a "fix all", but it seems to me like a great additive for chains that have prolonged times of non-movement

[01-Aug-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
@zawy, currently debugging your latest suggestion

[01-Aug-19 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
having to dig into the onchain DAA

[01-Aug-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
about to start a small stranding test

[01-Aug-19 09:41 PM] zawy#5864
The problem is not that the difficulty drops too low, but that a big miner oscillates on and off without letting it drop back down to baseline..  A symmetrical DA will keep the correct average solvetime.  This kind of design is not supposed to.   I'm curious how bad it can get.   I'm posting to share a note of caution.   I'll probably be in private conversation with @jl777c for a few days.

[01-Aug-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i think i am to where i can tweak whatever part of the DAA now

[01-Aug-19 09:46 PM] zawy#5864
I have not changed my mind on anything since our last conversation.  If you can send it through rigorous testing and it works OK, then great.  It will be nice if you can simply change the MTP =11 to MTP = 1  and everything works as I hope, fixing at least 2 things at once by changing only 1 byte

[01-Aug-19 09:48 PM] zawy#5864
Once out of sequence timestamps are prevented, the main dangers are oscillation and too many blocks issued per day.

[01-Aug-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what we are testing. along with putting the actual diff onchain and removing the stepping, also FTL 4
