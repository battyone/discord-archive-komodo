just iterate first part to match base58 checksum ü§∑

[16-Feb-19 04:25 PM] LeFevre#5755
prolly could partially decode the qr as well üòõ

[16-Feb-19 04:26 PM] ponkypink#7913
too much work lol

[16-Feb-19 04:26 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I think he wants other way .logical thinking for puzzle solving :))

[16-Feb-19 04:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
think the puzzle solving part is what ponky did

[16-Feb-19 04:27 PM] LeFevre#5755
you know how many letters are missing, and you match to checksum

[16-Feb-19 04:28 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I know it is hard but just saying :))

[16-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Decker#3767
@ponkypink ok, DM me your address for additional 11.1 KMD prize.

@ponkypink how you iterate it, manual or using some software / scripting?

[16-Feb-19 06:00 PM] ponkypink#7913
script for the checksum validation but you only need to iterate 1 character position so could have been done manually

"just iterate first part to match base58 checksum " tutorial please!

[16-Feb-19 07:53 PM] LeFevre#5755
its just gonna be a py script

[16-Feb-19 07:58 PM] Strob#3417
I could kind of understand the theory about that thanks to this: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32353/how-do-i-check-the-checksum-of-a-bitcoin-address

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32353/how-do-i-check-the-checksum-of-a-bitcoin-address
How do I check the checksum of a Bitcoin address?
I'm working on a Bitcoin ATM. We want to detect addresses that are entered incorrectly.

There's a checksum on Bitcoin addresses - but how can we check it?
https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b

[16-Feb-19 07:58 PM] Strob#3417
But how do you do it in practice?

[16-Feb-19 07:59 PM] LeFevre#5755
I dont personally have a script that does this atm, but Im sure there are py libraries that will do the checksum for you.  So you just provide it a "pk" and it will say if its valid

[16-Feb-19 07:59 PM] LeFevre#5755
just iterate through all legal characters and checksum it

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] Strob#3417
Ok so it's using brute force for the missing part.

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
yep

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
migght be a few valid ones

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
but you can just check them all easily enough

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
similar to seed phrases

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
for like eth

[16-Feb-19 08:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
only certain combos are "real"

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] LeFevre#5755
cause they need to checksum properly

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] Strob#3417
And will have have computers powerful enough to bruteforce any crypto address in one night?

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
base58 checksum is just a checksum

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] LeFevre#5755
nah

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] LeFevre#5755
no way computers will be able to brute pks

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] Strob#3417
Quantum computer?

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
there is a good article about trying to brute a pk

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] Strob#3417
oh yes? link?

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
lets just say someone gives you 12 seed words

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
if you dont know the order

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
WITHOUT checksumming

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
its 12!

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
checksumming helps this significantly

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] LeFevre#5755
like someone could give you all 24 of their seed words

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] LeFevre#5755
and you still might not be able to get into it

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] LeFevre#5755
without order

[16-Feb-19 08:06 PM] Strob#3417
I found this interesting article: http://diyhpl.us/~bryan/papers2/bitcoin/On%20Bitcoin%20security%20in%20the%20presence%20of%20broken%20crypto%20primitives%20-%202016.pdf

[16-Feb-19 08:17 PM] Strob#3417
Thanks to this puzzle I just understood a few concepts: checksums, hash, base58 and that a bitcoin address is not really a public key but it's hash!

[16-Feb-19 08:37 PM] ponkypink#7913
So for this particular case, we have a 52 character private key in WIF format with the first part missing. But we know that for this coin a private key always starts with a U and the second character can only be from p to x. If you then look closely at the picture you can see the bottom part of the 3rd and it can only be a d or u, the 4th is also partially visible and is either an N or W

Time for another #Komodo #Cryptopuzzle. This puzzle has 3 levels and 3 x 3.33 and 1x 77.7 KMD loaded! Level 1 has two solutions and will help you figure the rest of the #puzzle. It is not as hard as it seems which is also the first hint. Good luck! #KMD #DEX #BTC #crackme ...

Komodo block time brain wallet key

[17-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Decker#3767
First tx have 333 (bytes) inside )) It's not solution related but just a nice coincidence )

[17-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Decker#3767
tx nlocktime is 1550360324, blocktime is 1550360491 ...

[17-Feb-19 12:25 AM] Decker#3767
both are invalid as passphrase itself ...

[17-Feb-19 05:28 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
First part related to the technical of blockchain?

[17-Feb-19 05:33 AM] Decker#3767

[17-Feb-19 06:56 AM] LeFevre#5755

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
Another hint will empty everything :)) 
Do not hint

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] Decker#3767
As first hint said - it should be easier that it seems ...

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] Decker#3767
I bet it's time related ...

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] LeFevre#5755
looks like once you figure otu teh format

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] LeFevre#5755
the 2nd wallet should be EZ enough

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] Decker#3767
But what with time? We have nLockTime from tx and BlockTime timestamps ...

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] LeFevre#5755
wallets were emptied 1 minute apart

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
Maybe komodo block time

[17-Feb-19 06:57 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya, i still unsure what the picture is telling us to do

[17-Feb-19 06:58 AM] Decker#3767
May be we should write it somehow special?

[17-Feb-19 06:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
komodo thinks outside the box

[17-Feb-19 06:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
it's not the solution but maybe it fits

[17-Feb-19 06:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
somehow

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] Decker#3767
I'm tried:

```2019-02-16T23:41:31+00:00 in ISO 8601
Sat, 16 Feb 2019 23:41:31 +0000 in RFC 822, 1036, 1123, 2822
Saturday, 16-Feb-19 23:41:31 UTC in RFC 2822
2019-02-16T23:41:31+00:00 in RFC 3339
```

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
well to me I see the picture as the levels

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
so the first level is jsut the komodo logo

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
2nd is just the block

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
3rd the time

[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
4th is the super wallet stuff

[17-Feb-19 07:00 AM] Decker#3767
Hit the block ... get the coin ))

[17-Feb-19 07:10 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya, not sure...my best guesses for the first level would be ```
Komodo
Komodo Platform
komodoplatform.com
#KMD 
```

[17-Feb-19 07:17 AM] Decker#3767
@LeFevre my idea was in other direction ... "It is not as hard as it seems" may be related to block difficulty ... but i'm tried few variants without success.

[17-Feb-19 07:19 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya, i do think block/height/time works into the puzzle

[17-Feb-19 07:19 AM] LeFevre#5755
just not sure if its step 1

[17-Feb-19 07:41 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
Puzzle solver reveal yourself :))

[17-Feb-19 08:26 AM] Decker#3767
may be first level should use something simple, like "key jl777 lock time block" ... i mean, words represented by things on picture.

[17-Feb-19 08:34 AM] cryptocat#9465
block = block
key = seed?
clock = epoch or timestamp?
brain = jl777?
lock = answer/solution?

[17-Feb-19 08:42 AM] Decker#3767
i mean, may be level 1 includes only 3 "words" / symbols from picture: key, brain, lock ... i'm already tried:
```key jl777 lock
jl777 key lock
key lock jl777
lock key jl777
jl777 lock key
lock jl777 key
key brain lock
brain key lock
key lock brain
lock key brain
brain lock key
lock brain key
key mind lock
mind key lock
key lock mind
lock key mind
mind lock key
lock mind key
```

[17-Feb-19 08:42 AM] Decker#3767
all failed )

[17-Feb-19 09:05 AM] cryptocat#9465
`It is not as hard as it seems` maybe something "soft"?

[17-Feb-19 09:14 AM] cryptocat#9465
I have no idea what order to read the symbols in. Also the Komodo logo may be there to distract us, same as the wavelength puzzle.
