i mean if you take my literally you d have two choices. if you thought beyond the scope of your own imagination then just 1.

[10-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Decker#3767
sha256 of course ...

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[10-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Decker#3767
But as i'm noticed above it can be:

1. sha256(level1+soul)
2. sha256(soul+level1)
3. sha256(level1)+soul
4. level1+sha256(soul)
5. soul+sha256(level1)
6. sha256(soul)+level1
...
and many different ways )

[10-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Decker#3767
and we should be clever and fast to correctly guess what is `level1` )

[10-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Strob#3417
I think I pretty much tried all those combionations...

[10-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Decker#3767
also don't forget that we can reverse hashes and ... may be it's double sha256 as in bitcoin )

[10-Feb-19 09:13 PM] Decker#3767
Literally it should be something like:

SHA256("Komodo is ahead of Decred") + "jl777" = `143b4cb0a5eb1650c24dde5a58fa1e85b842ef18ed4c5b4409733a2d6707fa70jl777` .., but it's not correct )

[10-Feb-19 09:18 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Yeah i tried them too

[10-Feb-19 09:18 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
The combination because of amount of prize is the key factor

[10-Feb-19 09:19 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Otherwise it would be easy

[10-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Decker#3767
I am tested 1000 of variants (without any jokes) ... sha256 as string, sha256d (double hashing), sha256 as binary ...

[10-Feb-19 09:20 PM] Decker#3767
adding soul at end ... added soul before hashing ...

[10-Feb-19 09:20 PM] Decker#3767
still no luck )

[10-Feb-19 09:21 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I have tried too. These puzzles are good but these random things are frustrating

[10-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Decker#3767
777 KMD is a good prize anyway to play "guess the random" )

[10-Feb-19 09:24 PM] Decker#3767
btw ... nobody said us "combine with the soul" ... it's more like "don't forget about soul" ... and this makes thing different.

[10-Feb-19 09:24 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Yeah i thought about that too

[10-Feb-19 09:25 PM] Decker#3767
the length of passphrase will be a good hint )

[10-Feb-19 09:26 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
You know what too much hints make the puzzle bad . I think this much hint is good enough

[10-Feb-19 09:29 PM] Decker#3767
I'm always knew that is SHA256 ) even without last hint )

[10-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Decker#3767
will be very strange to use some other as hash func )

[10-Feb-19 09:31 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
it is only reasonable hash i think .or it is bitcoin hash

[10-Feb-19 09:31 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
People insanely trying while we are talking :))

[10-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Decker#3767
Mee too )) I'm talking, script is trying ))

[10-Feb-19 09:33 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
This is not fair i am proggramer

[10-Feb-19 09:33 PM] Decker#3767
Interesting thing ... 

```             Passphrase: 'DAB7A03917D1C87206A57CF4C6EDD25DE67FA923D95C85454B0C241D7CCA5242 
jl777'                                                                                     ```
gives us `RE777t7Yume3TxFWYuEfMk6j49Rc2zx6fQ` address ))

1. sha256("Komodo is ahead of Decred") = "143B4CB0A5EB1650C24DDE5A58FA1E85B842EF18ED4C5B4409733A2D6707FA70"
2. sha256("143B4CB0A5EB1650C24DDE5A58FA1E85B842EF18ED4C5B4409733A2D6707FA70") = DAB7A03917D1C87206A57CF4C6EDD25DE67FA923D95C85454B0C241D7CCA5242
3. DAB7A03917D1C87206A57CF4C6EDD25DE67FA923D95C85454B0C241D7CCA5242 + "\n" + jl777 = `RE777t7Yume3TxFWYuEfMk6j49Rc2zx6fQ` ) Secret 777 address ))))) (of course it's not related to prize, just a nice coincidence)

[10-Feb-19 09:41 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
\n this is multiline??

[10-Feb-19 09:41 PM] Decker#3767
Yeah.

[10-Feb-19 09:41 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I am away of my pc. With mobile can we use multiline?

[10-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Decker#3767
But who knows is any multilines used in this puzzle or not.

[10-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Decker#3767
I guess it shoudn't be multilined, but nobody can be sure.

[10-Feb-19 09:43 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
I am just asking

[10-Feb-19 09:43 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Can we use multiline in android agama

[10-Feb-19 09:44 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
?

[10-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Decker#3767
Didn't ever tried ...

[10-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Decker#3767
"143b4cb0a5eb1650c24dde5a58fa1e85b842ef18ed4c5b4409733a2d6707fa70" in binary + "jl777c" gives us address `RPWCWAR4bdtkniGto69TmK9ZyuxYym5UXy` ... nice too ))

[10-Feb-19 10:43 PM] Decker#3767
Aaaaah ...

[10-Feb-19 10:43 PM] Decker#3767

@Decker and cryptocal you have basically solved this in previous posts. i really was sure someone is going to crack it without any further hints like yesterday or the day before.

[10-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Decker#3767
1. wif from level1 is UpZ6Wtg5w2maMH7vkYz5rt2rmjfvxpJmEQhd1FXmeifwqyYtiQyn
2. sha256(UpZ6Wtg5w2maMH7vkYz5rt2rmjfvxpJmEQhd1FXmeifwqyYtiQyn)=1760ba1c297fe418b863f3d5875858f37c3dccc06b23c4a9d2b38bb3c590b150
3. 1760ba1c297fe418b863f3d5875858f37c3dccc06b23c4a9d2b38bb3c590b150jl777 as passphrase gives us `RUjLGY6xWAUizMtsS4CERwYU1YVEkcFnRU` ...

[10-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Decker#3767
where i'm wrong?

[10-Feb-19 10:56 PM] LeFevre#5755
caps

[10-Feb-19 10:57 PM] ca333#0118
actually good idea @LeFevre and @Decker - i might mix future HEX strings letter caps

[10-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Decker#3767

oh you have been damn close @Decker - good job!!

[10-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Decker#3767
I'm tried everything ... even privkey + 1 , privkey - 1 ... xoring with jl777 )) And many other things ))))

[10-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Decker#3767
of course i'm tried things like strtoupper ))

[10-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Decker#3767
But i did it from level 1 privkey hex )) not from WIF )

[10-Feb-19 11:01 PM] Decker#3767
and i'm also tried to encode sha256 hashes in base58 and add jl777 to it ))))
