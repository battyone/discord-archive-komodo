nice! Hope you liked it might do another one in a few days

[21-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Strob#3417
Oh yes I like those kind of puzzle!  Maybe some questions could be a bit more difficult like there could still be some math but not necessarily very specialized knowledge. I hope I could do one too some day if I have time.

[21-Feb-19 06:32 PM] ponkypink#7913

Do we have an address to see if solved yet

[02-Mar-19 11:17 PM] LeFevre#5755
Also why not `The ¬¢oin Chat` üòõ

[03-Mar-19 09:54 AM] cryptocat#9465
@ca333 Loved your surprise guest appearance on the show! When you were explaining that you have "hacked" their logo the guy was like üòï ... I was that guy 1 month ago ... now I'm like üòè

[03-Mar-19 09:54 AM] cryptocat#9465
Have any clues been released yet? I cannot see any on the Tweets from The Coin Chat crew.

[03-Mar-19 09:56 AM] cryptocat#9465
I'm thinking it's maybe related to SHA256 again, as the previous show was about ASIC Bitcoin mining?

[03-Mar-19 10:13 PM] cryptocat#9465
Letter to number ciphering?

[06-Mar-19 12:10 PM] cryptocat#9465
@ca333 Was the puzzle solved? The YouTube video said to post the answer in the comments? So not finding it using Agama?

[06-Mar-19 12:19 PM] ca333#0118

hmm ok I was just confused because we were told to put our solution in the comments, not use Agama. Oh well.

[06-Mar-19 12:21 PM] ca333#0118
weird - not sure why that was requested. TheCoinChat crew must have misunderstood the cryptopuzzle concept.

[06-Mar-19 03:21 PM] LeFevre#5755
Yes that was the correct solve, you had to replace the letters with numbers to their Roman  numeral equivalent

[06-Mar-19 03:25 PM] LeFevre#5755
However he was not the one who solved it first :9003_PepeAsh:

[07-Mar-19 12:03 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
I don't understand. You have to replace C and i character by 100 and 1 ? And after ?

[07-Mar-19 12:37 PM] cryptocat#9465
@Gam_B1t Roman numerals for the I and Cs

[07-Mar-19 12:45 PM] iazid#3291
How were u supposed to know, tho ?

[07-Mar-19 02:51 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
My question was more about how you deduce the private key from "The 100o1n 100hat" ?

[07-Mar-19 03:09 PM] ponkypink#7913
You can just enter `The 100o1n 100hat` as the "key" in the Agama wallet, for a previous puzzle the key was `16`

[07-Mar-19 03:10 PM] ponkypink#7913
it's not really the private key, the final private key is derived from that but the wallet does that for you

[07-Mar-19 03:36 PM] cryptocat#9465
No idea, but it was solved by the same person who solved the big prize puzzle last month: https://twitter.com/0xca333/status/1093218694514307073

@Gam_B1t you had to know it was roman numerals, but y roman is my/the question

[07-Mar-19 03:44 PM] cryptocat#9465
Why not?? It's a cryptic puzzle üòè

[07-Mar-19 03:46 PM] iazid#3291
@cryptocat maybe there as a clue ..

[07-Mar-19 04:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
The Coin Chat guys replied with a clue in the YouTube comments, but the puzzle was solved 2 or 3 days before it was posted.

[07-Mar-19 04:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
So I'm guessing someone just manually brute forced their way to the solution.

[07-Mar-19 04:08 PM] cryptocat#9465
Or in other words...they were smart enough to work it out without a clue.

[07-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
Doh I was overthinking it ...

[07-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Gam_B1t#6991
