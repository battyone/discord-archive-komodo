Could be related to Siberia??

[07-Feb-19 02:17 PM] cryptocat#9465
Or Komodo

[07-Feb-19 02:17 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
I tried epoch time the article was written. failed

[07-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Strob#3417
We have to reach out to this person using satellite in Siberia, he alone knows the answer to level 2 lol!

epoch for sure...

[07-Feb-19 02:20 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
but maybe the epoch time the article was written. but in siberia.

It's still there!

[07-Feb-19 04:07 PM] cryptocat#9465
I doubt it would be an epoch time for Siberia. How would we know the time zone for where the article was published?

[07-Feb-19 04:21 PM] Decker#3767
May be it's something related to level 1 tx:

`103b4cb0a5eb1650c24dde5a58fa1e85b842ef18ed4c5b4409733a2d6707fa70` - private key of address of level 1 tx in hex.
`befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2` - level 1 txid ...

[07-Feb-19 04:30 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
@cryptocat  the author s twitter says new york. I tried siberia time based on that but failed...

[07-Feb-19 04:31 PM] cryptocat#9465
@linuxcaptain cool, good research and worth a try.

[07-Feb-19 04:44 PM] Strob#3417
@Decker yes I thought about using the private key and even public key of the first level and concatenate it with level one phrase in many ways. It didn't work. didn't try the tix though.

[07-Feb-19 04:44 PM] Decker#3767
Also, article date in unixtimestamp is `1549278000` ...

[07-Feb-19 04:48 PM] cryptocat#9465
@Decker I've tried that epoch timestamp - on it's own, with the text, hashed by SHA256 in every combination. Nothing so far.

[07-Feb-19 04:49 PM] Decker#3767
I think it should be more obvious / clear than just random combining something with something and SHA256 of it ...

[07-Feb-19 04:50 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
I think we need a hint.. When hint sir?üòõ

[07-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Decker#3767
I'm also tried various things ... even XORing level 1 txid with decred proposal in hex ))

[07-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Decker#3767
befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2 is ahead of 5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a ))

[07-Feb-19 04:57 PM] cryptocat#9465
Or it could be something more simple like converting the phrase into some format, or getting another string of text from the second paragraph.

[07-Feb-19 04:58 PM] cryptocat#9465
Anything you can think of doing with "By doing pseudorandom order matching in epochs ‚Äî say every 10-60 seconds"?

[07-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Decker#3767
level 1 - can mean article itself
level 2 - other document, followed by link in article ...

[07-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Decker#3767
just an other idea.

[07-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Strob#3417
I thought about the link as a second level too üòâ went there and found nothing

[07-Feb-19 05:22 PM] Strob#3417
Or select the text in the article, right-click: inspect source...

[07-Feb-19 05:24 PM] cryptocat#9465
I don't think they would have access to edit the HTML directly on Forbes. I'd say the CMS is locked down pretty tight to prevent any custom markup.

[07-Feb-19 05:31 PM] Strob#3417
I think it's really a passphrase derivation method. We need to pass "Komodo is ahead of Decred" through all derivation, translation, conversion we can think of.

[07-Feb-19 06:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
I think @Decker may be right...level 1 transaction was created before level 2 transaction, which suggests something in level 1 transaction is required to access level 2.

[07-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Strob#3417
But I don't think so cause when he gave the hint for level 1 he gave the address. So that would have allow anyone to go to level 2 without solving level 1 which no master of puzzles would do!

[07-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Strob#3417
unless it's related to the private key

[07-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Strob#3417
I wonder why the amount in level 1 was 3.33 and not 7.77....

awthanks 

[07-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Decker#3767
I improoved my article "analysis script" ) Now i can state that any sequential group of words from the article != passphrase for level 2 ) On test with level 1 - script successfully found "Komodo is ahead of Decred" passphrase. But for level 2 seems it's not there )

[07-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Decker#3767
How it works? For example we have sentense "Traders always have custody of their funds. " ... It tries:
```
1. Traders always have custody of their funds. 
2.Traders always
3. Traders always have
4.  Traders always have custody
5. Traders always have custody of
...
n: always
n+1: always have
n+2: always have custody
...```

[07-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Decker#3767
btw ... we have 2 txes on puzzle address:

1. 3f3b7b2ae829275ae2650e4bb829e3ab43359a57e1df999a6ed64c8bf00e9e7b - 777 KMD
2. 062030a17e04f87513fba4a86a1e84942e137133e8e0e0a1e827264ec29846dc - 0.77777777 KMD

interesting ... second tx is just for beauty number, or it also makes sense?

[07-Feb-19 08:52 PM] cryptocat#9465
That's some Level: Decker stuff right there üî•

[07-Feb-19 08:53 PM] cryptocat#9465
The second tx was added after by someone in here

[07-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Decker#3767
correct question - is someone able to find level 2 passphrase without any knowledge of level 1 ...

[07-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Decker#3767
i mean level2 passphrase is depends somehow on level1 solution or not ...

[07-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Decker#3767
that's the question.

[07-Feb-19 08:56 PM] cryptocat#9465
I think it would have to, or else what's the point of having 2 levels?

[07-Feb-19 09:08 PM] Strob#3417
@Decker Wow I would like to know how to do that! what scripting or programming language do you use for these kind of things and how do you call the Komodo wallet-cli to try all of these?

[07-Feb-19 09:08 PM] Strob#3417
I'm an CG artist so I know how to use some scripting languages or cli but I don't  know much about programming.

[07-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Decker#3767

adding various variants ... like txid as passphrase ) with adding mutations ... +1 ... -1 ... xor with something ... etc )

[07-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Decker#3767
I think that possible ways for level 2 :

1. something with timestamps
2. something with hashes (proposal hash, txid hash, hash of "Komodo is ahead of Decred", etc.)

[07-Feb-19 10:22 PM] cryptocat#9465
We can get an epoch from the decred proposal article (hover over the publish date)

I'm tested many timestamps itself as passphrases.

[07-Feb-19 10:24 PM] Decker#3767
But may be we should combine timestamp with something else.
