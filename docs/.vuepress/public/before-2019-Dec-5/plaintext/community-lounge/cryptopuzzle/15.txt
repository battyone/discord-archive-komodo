@PHBA2061 hi! I claimed the puzzle to my KMDLabs notary address, even after the solution has been given by you, to actually construct the redeemscript and then use it in a transaction paying to my address, it was complicated üòÖ 
finally was able to do it after looking at https://learnmeabitcoin.com/glossary/transaction-data
and using createrawtransaction in komodo-cli

@gcharang well done friend ! Yeah when I solved Decker's puzzle, I spent like 5 hours on it just to understand the serialized data of the raw transaction and build a new one , that site taught me a lot too üòÉ

if I could come up with something more difficult  & interesting, I'll set up another puzzle

[11-May-19 03:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Here's another p2sh with 10.777 kmd inside, this one is a bit more difficult than the last one but still fairly easy (I'll increase the difficulty gradually) üòÉ 
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/bX2r7KGy1QPcVZ3RB28FWKv8w21KSNrrSv
What you need to decipher in order to obtain the secret text: 
cipertext: '`PBRRVCMCZNGVSYW`, ' key: '`NNELECTION`' (the secret text is an english word so you will know right away if your solution is right)
spending condition is still ```... OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUAL```
Good luck with building the script.
And speaking of the election, let me remind everyone that please vote for your favourite candidate before May 13th 23:59:59, and if that happens to be me, here is my voting address : `RFcGrDLnWh1cMiQqMKncFJ6b9cnt8fwKCM` , thanks for the support üòÉ

[11-May-19 03:31 PM] LeFevre#5755
well I got the secret text

[11-May-19 03:31 PM] LeFevre#5755
but still dont know how to build a script üò≠

[11-May-19 03:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
which one ? the one I just posted ?

[11-May-19 03:33 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that was quick, do you have komodo-cli ?

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] LeFevre#5755
i do

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] LeFevre#5755
but createrawtransaction doesnt like to do anything lol

[11-May-19 03:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok first you need to do sha256(sha256(`secrettext`)), if you do correctly it would give `7723...` (if you got it correctly don't post it here though  üòÉ )

[11-May-19 03:37 PM] LeFevre#5755
got it üòÉ

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you got the hash already ?

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
cool, wait a bit

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya, im re-looking at deckers puzzle

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] LeFevre#5755
the last one you posted I tried

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] LeFevre#5755
but got lost in the tx making

[11-May-19 03:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
now if you use Decker's script, it should give you the equivalent hex value of the secret text too

[11-May-19 03:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
which starts with a 4 and ends with a 3

[12-May-19 06:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just noticed that the p2sh was redeemed yesterday https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/bX2r7KGy1QPcVZ3RB28FWKv8w21KSNrrSv
`CONGRATULATIONS`  (this is called "Vigen√®re cipher" and `CONGRATULATIONS` is the secret message you need for the input).
Next puzzle will be more difficult, also I will find a way so people without komodo-cli could also participate, https://komodostats.com/api/explorer/#!/tx seems like a nice place to start with to get familiar with komodo-cli üòÉ

[13-May-19 09:52 AM] Malti#3948
you can only participate with pretty deep technical knowledge I guess? :p

[13-May-19 10:23 AM] PHBA2061#2530
depends on what is your definition of *deep technical knowledge* ,  to solve my last 2 puzzles you have to know how to build bitcoin script and raw transactions in general üòõ

[13-May-19 10:24 AM] PHBA2061#2530
ofc it doesn't have to be always like that.
I'll try to make my puzzles as much "accessible" as possible, without making them too easy.

[12-Oct-19 09:04 PM] Oszy#5734
oh nice  one

[12-Oct-19 09:39 PM] Oszy#5734
but it's too late and the multisig in confusing me üòÑ

[12-Oct-19 10:02 PM] Decker#3767
Main purpose of this cryptopuzzle is to force people to learn some additional info about multisigs / P2SH.

[12-Oct-19 10:03 PM] Decker#3767
Far time ago i spent a lot of time too to understand the basics. But this knowledge is useful.

[12-Oct-19 10:04 PM] Decker#3767
So, good luck for everyone )

[12-Oct-19 10:04 PM] Oszy#5734
oh yeah it definitely is. I am sure someone will make it üôÇ

[12-Oct-19 10:45 PM] Oszy#5734
your tool is very handy for this

[12-Oct-19 10:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I just added some more kmd to the p2sh, the kmdbot charged me 0.02 kmd so I messed up the decimal part of the current balance, it's no longer `77777777`üòÖ , anyways good luck to those who seek for the solution !

[13-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Oszy#5734
Ok, I am at it again, let's see.

[15-Oct-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
Let me add some KMD as well

[15-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Oszy#5734
So if I understand this correctly now, I need to find the P2SH Segwit Redeem Script belonging to the `bY` address and create a tx with the unspent outputs on the multisig address to myself to solve the puzzle?

[15-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Oszy#5734
And in order to do that i'd have to come up with a "seed" that reveals an "R" address, which has a pubkey that is s going to give me the related `b` address, and with deckers tool i could see the redeem script for that `b` addy?

[15-Oct-19 02:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
this is a discussion about the last puzzle Decker created, may be this could help <https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455755767132454913/572699099086716948>
the secret word was "vote4decker"

[15-Oct-19 02:35 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I assume for this one he also use the ... `OP_HASH256` ... `OP_EQUAL` pattern

[15-Oct-19 02:56 PM] gcharang#6833
this one is 
```
OP_HASH160 da1745e9b549bd0bfa1a569971c77eba30cd5a4b OP_EQUAL
```

[15-Oct-19 09:16 PM] Oszy#5734
good job whoever solved it, i'd appreciate the solution to learn üòÑ

[15-Oct-19 11:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it seems I was wrong, it is a `OP_1`/` OP_TRUE`

[16-Oct-19 12:02 PM] PHBA2061#2530
may I know who claimed the puzzle please ?
