IN this respect: Let's take a look at how kids were raised in more primitive (some historic) civilizations: Small children were tended by the people that weren't responsible for keeping the civilization going: elderly man/women, pregnant women etcetera.... Kids would spend their early childhood in company of other children of varying ages and got 'socialized' that way.
Children picked necesary skills at that point and strong points and weaknesses were recognized early.
Professions weren't choses: you grew into them as a result of your forte and the skills were cultivated.

Nowadays we insist every kid gets the same basic education, with little room for variation. Strong points and weaknesses are missed because the teacher has to many children to teach.
We need to drastically change the worlds educational system

dont force a kid with an IQ of 80 to follow higher maths, but if you have an IQ of 130 and are lazy as fuck, force him to do that has the kid will excel be better for it later on

[11-Sep-19 02:20 PM] denio#8067
@Deleted User when you talk about "kids", which age has they? Should kids decide if they want to learn to read? to write? to calculate? and so on? or are you talking about 10+,14+,16+? i dont get your point

[11-Sep-19 02:21 PM] denio#8067
dont you think all kids needs basic skills?

[11-Sep-19 02:22 PM] denio#8067
how they know how to learn if they need it?

[11-Sep-19 02:22 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Kids need basic skills, but we keep expanding those basic skills over time. I'm not surprised some children cannot keep up

[11-Sep-19 02:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you are only stimulated by competition when you enter the job market at 18 years old or whatever, dont you think that is too late?

[11-Sep-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[11-Sep-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362

its kind of strange convo...

[11-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you really seem to have an attitude that you yourself are not the problem but everybody else is the reason why you are not succeeding

[11-Sep-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
schooling bad, jobmarket bad, companies bad, social skills bad

[11-Sep-19 02:28 PM] denio#8067
so everyone should have their own business?

[11-Sep-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a small business, 40 people working for me, but once I build it to be a big company nobody should work for me anymore? üòÑ

[11-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But not everyone wants that

[11-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the laborers much rather have 100‚Ç¨ more each month rather than have stock options

[11-Sep-19 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[11-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362

then it switches

[11-Sep-19 02:51 PM] willofleo#7505
@Cryptoon  I do agree with the model of rewarding those who create value over the longterm and not everyone have the same work ethics or level of contribution, those who offer more value and have more responsibility should be rewarded , also parenting play a huge part on the development of individuals,  so short term gratification over long term progress maybe be why some workers like their extra 100 now , it called high time preference , teaching a child to postpone reward now for big stake in future is important , @jl777c  parent did something right , lol I watched him in the early days work like a mad man for an unknown future pre KMD , joined mainly for dex at that time

totally agree @willofleo

[11-Sep-19 02:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
It's been a long road to get here and certainly one of the longest development cycles in crypto from concept to product. A really inspirational achievement. I'm just glad to have been a very small part of it.

[11-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That's why only a few key positions have a stake, and they really understand the value of it. if they work more hours etc, they will not always demand extra compensation, because they are in the mindset that their extra hours also contribute (far more) to the value of their stake.

[11-Sep-19 03:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
others dont appreciate it, and it wouldnt make a difference in work ethic whether they have a stake or not

[11-Sep-19 03:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
even if they have 1%, if we sell for 10M tomorrow, it will be worth 100k tax free bonus that cost them nothing, that's a lot of years working for a normal pay
