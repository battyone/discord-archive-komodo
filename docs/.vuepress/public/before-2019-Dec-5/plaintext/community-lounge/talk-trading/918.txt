Oh i see what you mean Hollowman

[14-Jul-19 02:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am going to pull a trump, but if the hacker is listening, if he wants to dump his 700k, i am sure jl777 would buy it at 6k sats.

[14-Jul-19 02:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also looks like only 170k KMD was sold

[14-Jul-19 02:15 AM] blubbi#0643
i'll give him 350k clean kmd for 700k tainted ones aswell üòÑ

Dump arrr on different CEX‚Äôs bit by bit and wait for recovery

[14-Jul-19 03:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe that‚Äôs adding to arrr downwards pressure

well there u go ppl didnt think it would go to 11k when i yesterday told its possible

[14-Jul-19 06:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we didnt think it would happen, not that it was impossible.  also it only happened because some noob dumped all at once

how long are you gonna be watching the meaningless chart?
If the price moves according to the chart, everyone will be rich.

[14-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464
thats why 90% lose

[14-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464
cause they dont understand it

[14-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464
most of ppl fomo when price already went up

[14-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Markus#5464
I often see ppl here writing that they hodl since they bought in at 30k or whatever, thats bad risk management, why hodl and lose when u can trade trends and grow ur bag

[14-Jul-19 09:13 AM] Markus#5464
its like buying in at 10k, price pumps to 20k in 2 days, are u gonna hodl? such move is not sustainable so obviously if u care about ur investment u would take profits and buy back in after a pullback

When btc peaked to 13.9k a while ago why do u think it crashed afterwards? whales were long, closed their position. Opened huge shorts and dumped large amounts of bitcoin. Whats result? Dumb money panic and sell in fear while whales are happy over free bitcoin.

[14-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Markus#5464
Cause they afterwards buy back their dumped bitcoins 2000-3000$ cheaper a piece

Been traveling the last week.  The rebrand is now the 15th too?  What kind of buzz have they been stirring up to let this be known?  I found out about it on here but have they made a push for the public to know?

[14-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I mean

[14-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

It is literally the point of it

Antara is a marketing push

KMD needs big shills

[14-Jul-19 01:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
like Barry Shillbert  or Roger V

[14-Jul-19 01:33 PM] yorklab#7270
What's needed are several large whales, who have a longer time frame than the traders, to take a lot of KMD off the market for a while.

[14-Jul-19 01:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are big kmd whales

[14-Jul-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they just dont shill in public

[14-Jul-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
most are actually silent holders

[14-Jul-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but there needs to be a public shiller

[14-Jul-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
someone who is followed

the only reason why something like ETC is around still is because of shillers

[14-Jul-19 01:35 PM] sœÜldat#8733
but in the long term what's the point siu?

[14-Jul-19 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the point is that these people are the actual free marketing. They have followers that do as they say

[14-Jul-19 01:36 PM] sœÜldat#8733
Shiller men do not survive in the face of real technology.
which is why most of them are maximalist Bitcoin.

[14-Jul-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need people with influence to put kmd in the public discussion

[14-Jul-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this doesnt have to do with tech

[14-Jul-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is about influence

[14-Jul-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not the same that someone like me or any on this chat go to twitter and shill kmd

[14-Jul-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
than someone like roger V, barry shillbert or some other type of influencer

[14-Jul-19 01:37 PM] blubbi#0643
true

[14-Jul-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need people with influence to go and put kmd in the public discussion

[14-Jul-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that when someone tweets about some tech, that this influencer reply saying what kmd can already achieve.

[14-Jul-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is the big problem kmd has.

[14-Jul-19 01:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if its not in the public discussion, it is not going to be discussed and for that it wont make noise.

[14-Jul-19 01:41 PM] Andersen#8337

lol

[14-Jul-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not about some random mention

[14-Jul-19 01:42 PM] yorklab#7270
@siu - Chainmakers Agree. By bringing more buyers to KMD, you bring more attention to Komodo the platform, which will ultimately bring in more DEVS.

[14-Jul-19 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
CZ did that already and it brought some attention.

[14-Jul-19 01:42 PM] Andersen#8337
Not  random  ?  @siu - Chainmakers

[14-Jul-19 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but you need a more constant stream of shill from people with lots of followers

[14-Jul-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, not random like CZ did...he briefly mentioned kmd in a fortune interview, that is a random mention

[14-Jul-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you need someone with more consistency

[14-Jul-19 01:44 PM] sœÜldat#8733
Most influencers are paid to mention a project

[14-Jul-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you are assuming that i guess.

[14-Jul-19 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they can just buy at a good otc market price

[14-Jul-19 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and shill their bags

[14-Jul-19 01:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
so joe sixpack and avocado toast andy are gonna buy kmd, dl wallets, update wallets at least monthly, collect interest, figure out mobiledex, use it for something, and then spend hours explaining it all to all their friends so usage can grow?

[14-Jul-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the andreas mention doesnt have anything to do with kmd

[14-Jul-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`oh, i mean the CZ interview`
ahh, I was meaning the AA talk/lecture

[14-Jul-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@actionslacks its not that.

[14-Jul-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its shilling the tech talking points

[14-Jul-19 01:51 PM] blubbi#0643
every little news, got to be shilled like u proved existance of god

[14-Jul-19 01:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
but who are these shills talking to besides people already deep inside the crypto borg. everyone knows about kmd. the problem is they don't know wtf they're talking about anyway. kmd is centralized, kmd is a privacy coin, etc. we cant shill anything without changing the way kmd is framed. hopefully antara release will clear things up

[14-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
`the andreas mention doesnt have anything to do with kmd` he must be aware of how that comes off
