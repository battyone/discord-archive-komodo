I tried to put all of it into Evolution Mining but the place the money is doesnt let you do that....

[11-Jan-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
question is... now its up 130% and says buy .... I think it means I should sell it right?

[11-Jan-19 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most of them said to sell when I bought them 😄

[11-Jan-19 03:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Got some tip about a gold mine near here.... Tried to put all the super into that... thats up ~77% but that other one I was force top diversify into is up 130% 😮

[11-Jan-19 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure... havent checked it in a while... was very surprised... Its mooned

[11-Jan-19 03:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Just wait, knowing WA, that'll reverse in a couple of months ;)

[11-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I think I shgould pull it all to cash

[11-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either way, its not like I can get it

[11-Jan-19 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like making money for the government... Super is the fiurst thing they will seize

[11-Jan-19 03:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
WA can be awesome if you get the right mining company. But most of the smaller ones tank when they don't find anything aha.
Yeah exactly, I cbf self managing. The effort it would require wouldn't pay off for me. Ill worry about it in years to come maybe

[11-Jan-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah... these miners both had established mines... all Gold... despite gold going down last year these miners mooned like crazy.

[11-Jan-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If gold is going to moon .... might be worth holding on to... there is a reason they mooned I;'m sure.... stocks are not liek crypto where it just moons because of one person all the time 😉

[11-Jan-19 03:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I thought gold was going toward the end of the year? I'll have to have a look

[11-Jan-19 03:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

WTS GXE or the new OUR for KMD   8 GXE for 1 KMD   PM ME

[11-Jan-19 11:37 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
I am new to the server are we allowed to trade coins from one coin to KMD here? Thinking of doing that instead of a typical exchange due to asking full coins instead of partial coins on the exchange sites

[11-Jan-19 11:48 PM] ghisote#2507
You can post your offers in #deleted-channel

[12-Jan-19 12:46 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
@ghisote that channel is closed so what channel is for trading I feel that this channel is for trading a external coin for KMD

[12-Jan-19 12:58 AM] ghisote#2507
Yes ,sorry ,that was for pirate but it is in the Pirate discord now

[12-Jan-19 01:00 AM] ghisote#2507
I think people post in this channel for kmd too

[12-Jan-19 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can use here

[12-Jan-19 01:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You

[12-Jan-19 01:09 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Ok I thought so what altcoin do you guys accept here I am currently mining BRO and Gridcoin at the moment

[12-Jan-19 01:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bro?

[12-Jan-19 01:32 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Bitradio coin

[12-Jan-19 01:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah,  looking at it now, I like the model

[12-Jan-19 01:34 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
It’s a really easy coin to mine just your web browser and active internet connection no CPU needed

[12-Jan-19 01:35 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Also it’s a iOS app too no android just iOS and pc @polycryptoblog

[12-Jan-19 01:37 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
I can exchange them with you if you want even though I only have like 2-4 full BRO but I am looking to exchange them

[12-Jan-19 01:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No thanks I'm good.  I'm just looking out for interesting projects to integrate into Komodo ecosystem .  Seems like a pretty practical project

[12-Jan-19 01:55 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
What about Gridcoin are you interested in buying them from me for KMD? It’s a POR (proof of research) and a POS coin @polycryptoblog

[12-Jan-19 02:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No thank you,  I like gridcoin , I BOINC a long time ago

[12-Jan-19 02:24 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
What coin are you looking to exchange the most I might be able to mine it the only exception is that it has to be a CPU coin no GPU coin @polycryptoblog

[12-Jan-19 02:25 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I'm fine just was wondering what bro was not looking to trade right now

[12-Jan-19 02:26 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Oh ok do you have friends that are looking to trade and have KMD? @polycryptoblog

[12-Jan-19 02:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is many central exchanges thats trade kmd also BarterDEX has some LPs

[12-Jan-19 02:30 AM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Ok the only reason that I thought of trading here is because most exchanges are little buggy like I select a 1 amount from the sell listings but changes to more than that amount like selecting 5.000 but changes to like 11.000 for example @polycryptoblog

[12-Jan-19 09:13 AM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd is dead...under 200.000 $ volume...no chance to come back

"kmd is dead "no chance to come back" - Why are you writing such nonsense ? @coingirl87

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] Acura#2748
Apparently you haven't watched the last 13 months of the Bitcoin course ...🙄

[12-Jan-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
totally dead. must sell. oh wait, almost nobody is -> that is why volume is low

[12-Jan-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and what does it mean when volume dries up as the price falls?

[12-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U already brought it all :trollface:

[12-Jan-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
I do like to buy when it is low and not high,but the market seems to do the opposite

Its gambling pure and simple, and most people are bad at it.

[12-Jan-19 10:38 AM] coingirl87#6489
I talk about the volume...the volume of kmd is all the time very low compare to all other active coins of top 50, 60 or 100

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
So the question for me is...why that? The tech can't be the problem...tech and progress is great

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
ues about 1% per day average

[12-Jan-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it means the KMD volume is mostly organic and not fake

[12-Jan-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just how much % of marketcap per day do you think is "normal"?

[12-Jan-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
to me 10% indicates some artificial thing

[12-Jan-19 10:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
1% is not correct

[12-Jan-19 10:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
Most time uts between 0,2 and 0,5%

[12-Jan-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont count the low price point that has the lowest volume, in that case it is 0.3%

[12-Jan-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it does go up to 2% or so at the high points, or even higher

[12-Jan-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to average through an entire cycle

[12-Jan-19 10:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
I think 2- 4 is a normal ?🤔

[12-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
4% is almost a pump level volume

[12-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
anything over 10% marketcap is fomo

[12-Jan-19 10:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
So how i can see when volume is not organic?

[12-Jan-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
look at coins that are doing consistently above 10% per day

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
think about what that means, the entire coin supply traded in less than 10 days, continuously??

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how is that anything normal

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] coingirl87#6489
I dont talk about 10% thats not normal...i agree with you

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that KMD is much lower as compared to abnormally high trading volumes for most crypto is because most crypto has inflated trading volumes

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
an average of 1% is just fine as far as I am concerned
