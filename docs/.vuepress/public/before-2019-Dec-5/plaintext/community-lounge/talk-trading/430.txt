$KMD is about to rebrand I think, and no one will be ready for it.   Komodo themselves fucked up.... saying they're a platform, but they are SO MUCH MORE!  Here is how enterprise adoption begins.   Here is why Amazon may be in talks with them after all. @KomodoPlatform #Ba...

To the outside world it is new.

[20-Feb-19 09:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That tweet was from May of last year.

[20-Feb-19 09:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's about damn time to feel it come true üòÉ

[20-Feb-19 09:26 PM] yorklab#7270
Plus a lot more people are paying attention.

[20-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Alecandro#1179
I would love to see people's KMD price predictions for the high we hit this year. What do you guys think??

[20-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Markus#5464
looking hella bullish on daily chart, big up spikes then a nice 1 day pullback and here we go again

[20-Feb-19 09:29 PM] Alecandro#1179
I'm feeling like $4-5?

[20-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Markus#5464
but not sure if we will have enough juice to push 30k this time, might have to pullback around 28-29 and then next move we can test 30k+

[20-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Markus#5464
i quess time will tell üòÑ

[20-Feb-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253
theres some big fish lurking to eat up big sell orders, that's for sure

[20-Feb-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253
been watchingthe order book for an hour now

[20-Feb-19 09:31 PM] Markus#5464
ye well ofc those big whales holding few mil kmd want to have their piece of cake also, they want to see their stacks shine

[20-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Markus#5464
but cant push price too hard or it will just reverse massively, thats why its needed in steps

[20-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Tek#5253
im buying below 30k sats

[20-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Tek#5253
anything below 30k seems cheapo

[20-Feb-19 09:32 PM] Alecandro#1179
agreed

[20-Feb-19 09:33 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
i ll hodl my komodo shares....üí∞

[20-Feb-19 09:33 PM] Tek#5253
not sure if I should send over my entire savings account right now

[20-Feb-19 09:33 PM] Tek#5253

[20-Feb-19 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
