ahh cool, I was pretty impressed by the KMD whitepaper when I sat down and read it a couple months ago

[17-Sep-19 12:53 AM] JimD#9272
even if just for general crypto knowledge

[17-Sep-19 12:53 AM] JimD#9272
Great read TBH

[17-Sep-19 01:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Hey traders, what are your favorite trading indicators for TA? I'm messing around with some python and using a years worth of BTC price data to build a dataframe.
I already have the following for the past year. Just wondering what others are cool to have and that traders like to use.
```python
'close',  'high',  'low',  'market_cap',  'open',  'time_close',  'time_open',  'volume',  'fiveSMA', 'twentySMA', 'fiftySMA', 'onehundredSMA', 'twohundredSMA', 'stdDev', 'bollinger_high', 'bollinger_low', 'twenty_below_fifty',  'price_below_twohundred'```

[17-Sep-19 01:25 AM] Regnar#6164
the SMAs are in days, stdDev is rolling 20 day, bollinger bands are two standard deviations from 20 SMA (?), and `True` and `False` for if 20 SMA is below 50 SMA, as well as if the price is below the 200 SMA

[17-Sep-19 04:28 AM] scytale#8488
hi ragnar, when supersecret indicator for TA? :abusedsmily:

[17-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
>> trading

[17-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
I stopped trading

[17-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
I buy, wait, and sell later

[17-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
no taxes that way too.

[17-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Tek#5253
must suck being an american into crypto right now

[17-Sep-19 08:45 AM] Tek#5253
merica clearly trying to keep you poor

[17-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Tek#5253
tfw my ETH bags are doing great

[17-Sep-19 09:12 AM] Mark81#4505
Yeah, i thought KMD was  future.

[17-Sep-19 09:14 AM] Markus#5464
Not trading make u lose so many opportunities

[17-Sep-19 09:17 AM] Markus#5464
just imagine if u had 1-3 btc and bought kmd on daily basis everytime u have a red candle (not for all ur btc ofc) u keep repeating this step over and over which means u have a significantly lower average price then if u bought at lets say 30k sats, u do sell a small portion that will grant u profit whenever there is a green day for kmd.

[17-Sep-19 09:18 AM] Markus#5464
this means u will keep getting more btc to buy even more kmd the lower price go

[17-Sep-19 09:19 AM] Markus#5464
u will find some buys to never get sold tho for quite sometime but thats fine cause ur average is getting lower and lower

[17-Sep-19 10:10 AM] Regnar#6164
@scytale haha I don't trade at all but I know people love TA stuff. My thoughts are if I can get all the most popular TA indicators in a format that is super easy for machines, itll be easier to build bots for Atomicdex market maker bots to act on these indicators

[17-Sep-19 10:39 AM] Tek#5253
@Regnar yeah probably

[17-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Regnar#6164
So question is, what indicators do traders like?

[17-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Off topic but if anyone has tezos, they forked recently to dune

[17-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Feel free to delegate to me dunebread.com, or sell me your dune for tezos 😬✌️

dash bags r gaining traction

[17-Sep-19 11:33 AM] Tek#5253
bch bags too

[17-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Lanii#8302
Many coins gaining traction, kmd however still lazy

[17-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Tek#5253
hmm problem with kmd is market reach

[17-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
no one realy knows kmd except the more knowledgeable

[17-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
general population of cryptoers doesn't know kmd

[17-Sep-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
*the massses*

[17-Sep-19 11:38 AM] Tek#5253
the average crypto holder / invester / trader also isn't going to switch to a dex any time soon

🤔 

[17-Sep-19 11:40 AM] Lanii#8302
Depending on if we get a higher timeframe reversal you are better off dumping your kmd and longing the other shitcoins at 2-3x

[17-Sep-19 11:48 AM] Regnar#6164
I think you should look at the growing number users of Shapeshift, Changelly, Coinswitch, and the like and see AtomicDEX as a decentralized alternative

[17-Sep-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
ETH 6%

[17-Sep-19 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
KMD 3%, but low volume

[17-Sep-19 05:30 PM] tolken#2655
No reason for Alt season to begin, so maybe it will.

```I think Bitcoin will bottom on the current correction $7 to $9k within this month or next. Then start moving up again. Possibly might not exceed $13k again until start of 2020. I am expecting a rocket shot to $50k starting roughly February```

[17-Sep-19 05:49 PM] PTYX#6840

@Tek do you have a similar website but with Bitcoin btc ?

[17-Sep-19 07:14 PM] Tek#5253
@phm87 no one wants to pay a dollar transaction fee to post, this kind of development is not possible on BTC

[17-Sep-19 07:15 PM] Tek#5253
you pay like $0.0005 to make a post on memo.cash.

[17-Sep-19 07:15 PM] Tek#5253
( just the standard bch transaction fee )

[17-Sep-19 07:16 PM] Tek#5253
also theres a free faucet if you want to test it out for free

[17-Sep-19 07:16 PM] Tek#5253

[17-Sep-19 07:20 PM] Tek#5253
mffw

[17-Sep-19 07:20 PM] Tek#5253
better have a alternative ready

[17-Sep-19 07:21 PM] Neko#5830
let me guess dash

[17-Sep-19 07:23 PM] Tek#5253
dash is more secure than bitcoin, so yeah dash would be a great choice

[17-Sep-19 07:23 PM] Tek#5253
and also has low fee

[17-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
obviously you cant securely noterize to BCH since there is a lot of sha256 hash available

[17-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
so theres a risk

[17-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
dash is on X11 algo , has a big hashrate that has been growing and growing

[17-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
and has anti 51% tech anyway
