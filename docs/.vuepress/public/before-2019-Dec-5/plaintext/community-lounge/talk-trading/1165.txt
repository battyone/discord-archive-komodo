@Mark81 I think it was something along the lines of digiprice owners were hardly making any money as they had to pay external devs to do all the work, so they decided to sell the platform

[02-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and thus it got rebranded to altsbit or whatever

[02-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
by the new owners

[02-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362

works fine, volume is low, taking a wild bet on some K64 and a more solid bet on ARRR

I don‚Äôt think alts can pump without a true DEX

And I have no idea who‚Äôs willing to build that considering every law enforcement agency on the planet is coming for you / any of the main contributors if it‚Äôs open source

yes its all game just load the previous save

[02-Oct-19 10:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
judging by the amount govt intimidation it is a game that I think we are winning. however gloomy it may seem at the moment.

[02-Oct-19 11:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ethots and other microtransactors just use cashapp or Venmo or whatever

[02-Oct-19 11:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Easy, and you aren‚Äôt grilled for being a potential international terrorist

‚ÄúOnly terrorists use crypto‚Äù

[03-Oct-19 02:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
my gf uses venmo and showed me how she could see all of the transactions that her venmo contacts make. It's like social conditioning for everyone knowing what everyone else is spending money on. weird stuff.

Anyone claiming rewards from madmax? Please take care as you might be needing to transfer fund from your compromised wallet...

[03-Oct-19 05:02 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Happened to me and @Gordon Komodo

[03-Oct-19 05:47 AM] tolken#2655
Madmax?

[03-Oct-19 05:56 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the old compromised addresses are now scripted to auto transfer to hacker address.

[03-Oct-19 05:57 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so using dust tx to id owner is now futile.

[03-Oct-19 07:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
lol

[03-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Best bet is to make a trash chain and dust verify that way

ac_name=madmaxswap

[03-Oct-19 08:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD is trash at this point, I doubt hacker wastes his time monitoring for new ac‚Äôs

[03-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hacker is prob smart enough to make it automated, no?

[03-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Check daily for balances and swipe automatically?

[03-Oct-19 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
if he's smart, he'll have coded something that checks incoming txns in the mempool

[03-Oct-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
if address is in set of hacked addresses, send to another address

[03-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs the point of making another throwaway asset chain

[03-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Share the specs with your voters via dm

[03-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Launch the ac

[03-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verify

[03-Oct-19 08:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
All done

[03-Oct-19 08:29 AM] jorian#4555
yes, that would work, but would me more work for madmax

[03-Oct-19 08:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hard that way, hard to verify the other
