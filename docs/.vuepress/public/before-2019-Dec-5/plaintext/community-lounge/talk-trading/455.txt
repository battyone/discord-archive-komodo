It seems easiest to me to trade into tether

[05-Mar-19 01:46 PM] Caglio#3337
than buy again with tether

[05-Mar-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tether is the 1 coin that I despise more than BTC 🤢

[05-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Why, BTC is life

[05-Mar-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽 🛀🏽

[05-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh I see

[05-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
U love BCH right

[05-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337

[05-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought u are Elon Musk

[05-Mar-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326

btc pumping like it doesnt give a fuck

[05-Mar-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
nice support retest there.

[05-Mar-19 01:56 PM] Caglio#3337
@siu - Chainmakers son do you think I should invest more money into KMD, or to buy some Verus Coin ?

[05-Mar-19 01:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont give investment advice

[05-Mar-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
:troll_compadre:

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio kmd gives you 5% apr for  clicking one button per month, not quite the same with vrsc, you have to have a "staking wallet" and hope for staking rewards based on your % ownership of total supply

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is also not investment advice, just the facts ma'am

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
That is true, I already earned over 10 coins

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
neither of those apply if you keep it on an exchange, like a total newb

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Which is almost 10$ and I appreciate that

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
But I heard Verus Coin is gonna have a big pump soon, I joined some groups

[05-Mar-19 01:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats why I am asking

[05-Mar-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
pump groups, oh my

[05-Mar-19 01:59 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought about pawning my fiancees rings, and investing in that, so I can take her out for a cruise

[05-Mar-19 01:59 PM] dokrates#8987
btc pumping

[05-Mar-19 01:59 PM] dokrates#8987
any news? bakkt or any

[05-Mar-19 01:59 PM] Caglio#3337
But its kinda fishy right

[05-Mar-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am amazed that people still spend money on paid pump+dump groups

[05-Mar-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
this channel will tell you about your favorite shitcoin for free

[05-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Caglio#3337
You think its a pump and dump scheme ?

[05-Mar-19 02:03 PM] Caglio#3337
@dukeleto i guess ur right tho

[05-Mar-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think pump+dump groups are a scheme

[05-Mar-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
I never tried it, but I kinda understand how it works

[05-Mar-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have been mining VRSC since almost it's genblock, it's a legit project if that is what you are asking. No idea what the pump+dump groups are trying to say about it, tho.

[05-Mar-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
I havent heard of it till yesterday tbh

[05-Mar-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[05-Mar-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
I never understood those charts

[05-Mar-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
Ppl drawing lines and what ?

[05-Mar-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's called "math"

[05-Mar-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also "lying with statistics"

[05-Mar-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
and "smoking hopium with numbers"

[05-Mar-19 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In this specific chart we only work with moving averages

[05-Mar-19 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are price averages forming all the time

[05-Mar-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio vrsc genblock is almost 1 year old: https://explorer.veruscoin.io/block/000007b2d09d316ca1763b8922c769aabc898043274849ce64e147fa91d023cb

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the longer term the average the more significant it is.

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers when ichimoku clouds?

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dontuse ichimoku clouds

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
😃

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh I really had no idea about that

[05-Mar-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
as a mathematician, i find those actually the most useful

crypto wake up

[05-Mar-19 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
really? i dont like them, or at least i dont know how to better use them

[05-Mar-19 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so when someone tells you we are above the daily 200sma

[05-Mar-19 02:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they are saying that price moved above the last 200 days average

[05-Mar-19 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
sure. Also, "averages don't exist"

[05-Mar-19 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
:troll_thuglife:

[05-Mar-19 02:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how come?

[05-Mar-19 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
Of 1 man and 1 woman, the average person has 1 breast and 1 testicle and 1/2 penis and 1/2 vagina. Averages don't actually exist.

[05-Mar-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I say this partially to troll, but always keep it in mind. It's why the concept of "median" exists

[05-Mar-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
Medians actually exist

[05-Mar-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I also think 200SMA and 50SMA are decent stats to keep track of, but not to bow down to like numerical gods

[05-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337
I like duke

[05-Mar-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
"average home value" and "median home value" are drastically different

[05-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337
he gives informations, and not act like he knows it all

[05-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337

I am a dev + miner pretending to know enough about trading to not get eaten up in this game. I mostly learn in this room, but sometimes teach

[05-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
btw that 5.1% komodo thing is a pretty cool thing

[05-Mar-19 02:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
MA's are not gods, they need more indicators to have validity

40minutes of technical analysis on all major altcoins, stuff like that. And he manages funds for people, so he is getting paid to do this research, regardless. He doesn't shill anything in particular

Haha yes

[05-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Josh also said 33k btc by july 2018 tho :p

[05-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, I also like his analysis nonetheless

`kmd gives you 5% apr for clicking one button per month`
_goes looking for the button to click in komodod that @dukeleto is talking about_

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ur such a comedian

[05-Mar-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 collecting interest is pretty annoying via the cli, especially if you have bajillions of utxos, the button you need to hit is slamming your head repeatedly into the closest wooden furniture

😂 

[05-Mar-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I only consolidate 30-60 UTXOs a day, because I'm too poor to have bajillions
