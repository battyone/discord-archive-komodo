An interesting data analysis project for anyone interested would be to check the movement of KMD in the top VOTE2019 addresses after the airdrop. Isn't conclusive, but could indicate potential sell off contributing to red candle by those more interested in extra VOTE2019 than hodling KMD.
Not saying there's anything wrong with that...

[16-Apr-19 11:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, can be plausible.

It's far from conclusive though, people could be transfering off a ledger, paper wallet or CEX. Or just using a different address for privacy, or simply being sent to a change address after a subsequent transaction.

Notify the click-monkey farm

[16-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but writing the same data 500x makes it more secure, since just 1 BTC tx per block, maybe the bits will just randomly change on you

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and it needs to change in a way that still keeps the signature valid

[16-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if a single BTC tx couldnt be trusted to be immutable, there are some big problems going on and VBK found this!

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Markus#5464
VBK hype is over, ppl got over it that it was a massive failure. Now let it die in peace üòÑ

[16-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If 1 tx = bitcoin security, then 500 tx = 500x bitcoin security

[16-Apr-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but its 500 decentralized tx, that must be better than just one? how can just one be good enough. you dont eat just one hotdog do you?

it wasnt me that claimed that having the data 500x was better than 1x

[16-Apr-19 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Here we have a daily chart of KMDBTC who has broken resistance above 200sma and now seems to be retesting and making a support out of it on a correction from the top of what resembles a leading diagonal wave 1 with rising volume.

You cant say you notice the lack of something when you not even been here a whole day

[16-Apr-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTW, price in the dialy chart is resting right above 200sma with a oversold formation on daily RSI.

[16-Apr-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, that picture proves it, eating 500 hotdogs is indeed better than just one

[16-Apr-19 01:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
daily RSI has been forming what is known as hidden bull divergences during this correction

[16-Apr-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i can now recommend that people issue the same transaction 500x, but probably best to send just 0.2% each time. that way you get the redundancy of 500x

[16-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Malti#3948
@siu - Chainmakers oversold indicators you say? I just bought extra üò©

[16-Apr-19 01:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is what you do when things are over sold

[16-Apr-19 01:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you buy

[16-Apr-19 01:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when things are overbought you should sell

[16-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the historical return if you only buy when oversold and sell when overbought?

[16-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Malti#3948
yes sorry you're right..  i'm not here with my head today

[16-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
too many hotdogs?

[16-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Malti#3948
@jl777c selling x amount of hotdogs and buying back x+x amount of hot dogs

[16-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Malti#3948
which implies more hotdogs

[16-Apr-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
from this daily chart most oversold RSI where good entrances even during the bear market

[16-Apr-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
only one that could be called "failed" is during the actual bottom where even though RSI was going up creating bull divs, the price kept going down.

[16-Apr-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but isnt it too easy if all you have to do is wait for oversold/overbought?

[16-Apr-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not so easy, right now its oversold and people are not too eager to buy

you could always buy too early too if you are not patient

[16-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Malti#3948
what should you do in a situation like this, when RSI says oversold but buy sentiment isn't here?

[16-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Markus#5464
its easier to buy then sell in right moment

[16-Apr-19 01:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when you see there is this sentiment, you can wait for bull divergences too form.

[16-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Markus#5464
or u see it being down around 27%, rsi being oversold and look at what the ecosystem is building
