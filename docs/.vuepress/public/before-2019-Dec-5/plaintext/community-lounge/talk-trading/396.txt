looks like the Whale is getting impatient.  Wonder if the bid will be bumped up another 50 satoshis ?

KMDBTC gave a green 2 on the daily chart and broke the daily MA20. This a clear buy signal according to Tom Demark Count. Stoch RSI is oversold on the daily. 
Also there is a bull flag formation on the 1H chart.

Coal in China
China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world and is the largest user of coal-derived electricity. The consumption of coal has declined during the 2010s with its percentage in the energy mix falling from 80% in 2010 to 60% in 2017. Domestic coal production h...

Spending exorbitant amounts of funds to produce less efficient forms of energy generation that are actually *worse* for the environment than those that they seek to demonize, sure, they are "legitimate" (just not factual/honest in their claims)

Yes, because if you can find one, then you have done something that *no one* in the history of cancer research has done, and that is "understand the factual causality of 'cancer' (even in the over-used broad sense of the term)".

given the current benchmark

[02-Feb-19 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the current "benchmark" is that people use what they use
The only way "green" energy works is if the entire populous changes everything they do and makes the "green" product producers rich by buying new garbage and putting everything they currently own in landfills (which is also great for the environment, right?)

`He suggest moving back to medieval age tech`
That's the only way "green" works; we destroy everything we currently do/use in favor of doing/having nothing

[02-Feb-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or

[02-Feb-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can alter the laws of physics and find a way to invalidate `energy can neither be created or destroyed`, in which case "green" is golden

Well uranium breaking somehow "creates" energy one could argue

[02-Feb-19 05:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as long as you have energy definition as pure energy = light

[02-Feb-19 05:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the cost is a bit of mass transformed

[02-Feb-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`uranium breaking somehow "creates" energy one could argue`
actually it doesn't, it transfers all of the energy that the atoms would otherwise have throughout their "lifetime"

[02-Feb-19 05:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
E=mc2 is not E=m

[02-Feb-19 05:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so by physics definition energy is not same as mass

I still find it pretty amazing how Komodo does what other blockchains want to do or charge to do, but for free and better LMAO.

You have other projects doing what CC-Heir is and wanting a whole ico and development when ours is a simple cc that any chain can use.
You have people fundraising for DEX which arent even true dex.
You have multi-coin wallets charging their native token to use
"interop" layer blockchains
privacy based coins that only do anonymity etc etc
