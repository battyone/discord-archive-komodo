importance of price is always relative to other price

you'd think we'd learn so many lessons about being grateful and expectations and so on from the market, but as soon as it gives us something to be grateful about, we want more. Then if we don't get to have the all time high price as ours, such as when we were sitting there with all our assets and they were "worth" the all time high, almost like we actually owned that amount of value for sure, we feel resentful... After that, all price relative to all time high is not good enough... such madness

it's like this stock market bubble, all these passive indexers who are up 100% or whatever, then they lose 15% in value in latest sell off and that's all they can think about, not the fact that they are up 85%

[28-Dec-18 10:24 PM] ver_User#6608
BTC, I was expecting this run up today and that we migh continue and break the highs (and wouldn't be surprised if we do), but decided to re-evaluate plan and believe the correction downward may have another leg to 3500 zone before a good run to 5200 or so as first target. In terms of correction it's just not had enough time yet, and ranging with bulls and bears taking positions either side makes more sense. I still have in mind medium term ranging, upwards first, then down to make the lows more solid long term. 

KMD then, let's hope we keep chopping upwards 😉 "raising that awareness" with the top 5 gainers each day. Otherwise just expecting more sideways/upwards consolidation before a real good run in the coming weeks once we really get out the zone and the major accumulation is done.

[28-Dec-18 10:29 PM] Vertigo#0439
I'm just grateful is worth something lol

[28-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Jonathan#3687
Up 100% then down 15% and upset sounds like a gambling problem for the trader

[28-Dec-18 11:21 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
a golden cross is about to form on the KMD weekly EMA [50, 200]

[28-Dec-18 11:47 PM] yorklab#7270
I normally don't get to stay home and watch the price, and know very little about TA and trading, but to me it appears the action we've seen lately is mostly from the whale who initiated some buy pressure and caused mostly the same people to buy in. To get to some of the price points a few have stated here (30K), I would think we would need to see an announcement of some kind so new people take notice.

[28-Dec-18 11:48 PM] yorklab#7270
But I do hope those who are calling out for 30K are correct. 🙂

[28-Dec-18 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`know very little about TA and trading`
all you need to know is: 'buy when it drops and sell when it's up'

[28-Dec-18 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everthing else is just guessing (educated guessing sometimes, but guessing nonetheless)

[28-Dec-18 11:50 PM] yorklab#7270
Almost simple enough for me to understand....but sometimes I still get it backwards.

[28-Dec-18 11:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but sometimes I still get it backwards`
As long as you get it the right way round more often than backwards, you're doing as good as anyone else

[28-Dec-18 11:51 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, I have heard many times that most traders generally loose.

[28-Dec-18 11:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Always remember that Warren Buffett has made enough bad choices to have lost more than you'll ever make, but made enough right choices to come out ahead of those losses 😉

If it takes one whale to get a whole community crazy, then you know KMD still has a long way to go

[29-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Jonathan#3687
The big picture I think of is a filter. Filter the hype and filter the social media. What is left is substance, why IBM and Facebook are getting in. Problem for them is, when the smoke settles, KMD is better 😉

[29-Dec-18 12:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
I just saw a tv commercial for IBM's blockchain during a football game. It's getting big guys. hold your bags tight.

[29-Dec-18 12:39 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah it's probably just a market maker bot, honestly

[29-Dec-18 12:40 AM] ver_User#6608
just watch bitmex in real time, when trading is fast

[29-Dec-18 12:41 AM] ver_User#6608
the walls are can often do opposite of what price might be doing. Over time, if you fill enough orders in both directions, the spread will keep you in profit...

[29-Dec-18 12:41 AM] ver_User#6608
slower moving market like KMD probably has it's own quirks for a market maker

[29-Dec-18 12:42 AM] ver_User#6608
sometimes walls are put up to test if there is any pressure

[29-Dec-18 12:42 AM] ver_User#6608
also walls often are owned by whales that know quite well that their wall will not get bought or sold into completely, and have algos to stop that happening anyways (such as smaller order in front as scouts)

[29-Dec-18 12:43 AM] ver_User#6608
... all that said, it could be a slow pump wall

That's what it looks like to me. Not that it matters really, 20K is better than 16K. I hope he keeps it up.

[29-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Markus#5464
wouldnt mind it going to 16k to stack up some more 😄

on the weekly chart KMD/BTC is above the long term moving average, one of the few alts. it seems to be leading the altcoin recovery and thus is out of phase with most of the other altcoins

KMD above 21 ma on weekly chart

[29-Dec-18 04:30 PM] yorklab#7270
Since seeing the whale it looked to me like he was walking up the price while accumulating because he knows/assumes that certain events will take place to attract a lot of new people to Komodo. I figured that when he THINKS that time is near then he will not remove his bid and let the sellers dump into it. If he doesn't get his fill then eventually he'll just buy up the rest at the ask. When Bitcoin dropped a little bit ago kmd did the same, only the whale didn't budge. In fact it looks like he is now trying to get people to sell into his bid. I take this as good news. But since I'm the worst trader on the planet and know nothing of these things then the opposite is probably true lol. Just fun to speculate while on vacation before I go back to my real job again. It's been interesting watching this stuff.

we will see how this turns out but last time when this happened we went to around 22k then whale got his orders filled  and we dropped to 14k

let's see when the buy wall will be consumed (already 50BTC+ bought, remaining 20BTC)

There may be a lot more on the horizon this time around. I guess we'll soon see.

don't really want that, but 19.8 would be nice so I'm not stuck with this damn'd BTC 😭

can't btfd when there's no fd

[29-Dec-18 06:04 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, momentum is building, to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if we just keep moving on up and it turns into a parabola at some point, resistance is probably at 25-28k, but even then I would expect it just to be a retrace... got to wait for crypto as a whole to make it's decision. I'm expecting a bit of sideways ranging for now, KMD though, looks pretty good, each level is stronger support and less retrace for the time being. That said, volume has been dying off as we go, which can be the sign of a reversal. But the greater volume further down is good evidence of accumulation and support. I expect volume to pick up again once we start breaking levels and crypto as a whole makes another bull move. 

you have to ask yourself @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , if someone said they would sell you something you want now at a 6% price increase, or you could wait and you might get a 6% discount, but might not, which would you choose? 😉

[29-Dec-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on what the "something" is

[29-Dec-18 06:14 PM] ver_User#6608
"something you want"

[29-Dec-18 06:19 PM] ver_User#6608
don't take this as trading advice, but you may well get your 19.8 IMO, crypto may be in a "complex corrective" which would take some more days to resolve. KMD might not care though 😉

[29-Dec-18 08:15 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Why everyone sinking except kmd?? Is it because of rebranding? And by they way when it will be happen?

[29-Dec-18 08:18 PM] yorklab#7270
There's a whale who has been buying. The rebranding encompasses many things which will happen over time. There is no hard date set for the rebrand.

[29-Dec-18 08:46 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Suggesting selling and rebuy later?

[29-Dec-18 09:31 PM] ver_User#6608
do not sell in this market atm, is my suggestion

[29-Dec-18 09:31 PM] ver_User#6608
*if you hope to rebuy cheaper

[29-Dec-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
look at the weekly chart, almost all the altcoins have a very similar pattern, but 90%+ of them are still below the long term average, while KMD has broken above the line in recent weeks

I saw the other day about KMD having some dramatically higher accumulation over this year, which would explain how it is ahead of the other coins

I believe CrytpoBridge will be supporting KMD soon.  No KYC or AML.  Stablecoin support is also being worked on.

[29-Dec-18 10:58 PM] tolken#2655
Wasn’t there an announcement that was to take place with some top 10 exchange that would be adopting KMD’s dPoW tool to confirm transactions nearly immediately? Did I miss it, or did it not happen?
