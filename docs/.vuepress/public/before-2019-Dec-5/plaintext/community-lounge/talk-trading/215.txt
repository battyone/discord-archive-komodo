Gotta love the guy that is a large enough stakeholder that he can personally vote anyone in and still campaigns. ❤

USDT collapsing ?

[15-Oct-18 12:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
might be the reason of BTC growth today

[15-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blubbi#0643

Someone explain markets to me...
yesterday @ 15.6-16k, I couldn't give KMD away and at now at 17.5 there's a 2M buy wall? dafuq?

[15-Oct-18 01:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah

[15-Oct-18 01:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Whale saw that you were lowball selling

[15-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Decided to punish your selling by trolling you

[15-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and buying higher later

[15-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because that is how it works

[15-Oct-18 09:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wtf, almost 500btc volume in binance but only 48btc traded in bittrex

[15-Oct-18 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, after all of the failed USD promises, trex is circling the drain towards a slow, painful death

[15-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah and the crappy website overhaul

[15-Oct-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's only so many times your CTO can write the words
`Soon ™`
Before it stops being a joke and people start looking elsewhere

[15-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also arent they promising leveraged trading since forever?

[15-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That might bring back some volume

[15-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
All the degenerates over at finex will need to get their fix elsewhere

[15-Oct-18 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Over a year since USD was supposed to be `Soon ™` and leverage was supposed to come `Soon ™` after that

[15-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But usd markets are available on bittrex, no?

[15-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just no volume

[15-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I see them at the top of the markets

[15-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
US residents only

[15-Oct-18 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
markets are there, but no volume because it's manual for corporate US accounts only (last I looked)

[15-Oct-18 09:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How do you mean?

[15-Oct-18 09:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362

All transfers are manually done, no automation --- meaning you send bank tx and wait for them to manually process (like as if it was still 1990)

`eligible personal ...` aka "we add that and tell everyone 'soon' for their local area"

[15-Oct-18 09:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitpanda is ok, but expensive

[15-Oct-18 09:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptoon you are right. probably that's the reason i like them 😛

[15-Oct-18 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think if kraken had their shit together technology-wise during the bullrun late last year they might have been one of the bigger exhanges

[15-Oct-18 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
