now as the hype train slowly cranks back up i fear that KMD will be left behind

[07-Nov-18 04:12 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Sdunbar seems to be for these forks that are coming. Btc to bgash etc. Hopefully when the blood comes after kmd will rise.

[07-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm not gonna hold out hope for that lol

[07-Nov-18 04:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Spread some kmd to pirate verus ?

[07-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Been the same story for a long time off and on, but KMD did fairly well not dropping too far in its position relative to other coins

[07-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
during the bear market

[07-Nov-18 04:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Pirate will give good returns from these prices

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
i dont really buy anymore i just hold everything

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
been burned before

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
HUSH comes to mind

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
lol

[07-Nov-18 04:15 PM] Sdunbar#5064
oh man HUSH, what a mess that was

[07-Nov-18 04:16 PM] Sdunbar#5064
$10 each to untradeable

[07-Nov-18 04:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Ok. Then hodl lol but if you want a fairly safe return in a short term period pirate is a solid pick imo

[07-Nov-18 04:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Just like verus was back in july to end of last month. Good roi for a short period

[07-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah im not really a trader

[07-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Sdunbar#5064
just holding KMD and hoping one day maybe it can get to a coupule bucks again

[07-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Sdunbar#5064
not too sure that will happen but can always hope

[07-Nov-18 04:17 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Patience is the key for sure.

[07-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Sdunbar#5064
To me if this coin can't become known then it's never going to be worth too much

[07-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Sdunbar#5064
It's nice to have community members tweeting about it but people with <1k followers can only do so much

[07-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Sdunbar#5064
if big names in the crypto world dont talk about it then it never really gains ground imo

[07-Nov-18 04:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
In 2014 i would have told you btc to 1 mill eventually. 2015-2016 looked un likley. Then boom 2017 bull run.

[07-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Sdunbar#5064
It had a relatively large community though and of course was very well known in the crypto-sphere (obviously)

[07-Nov-18 04:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Big twitter accounts are fun but most are just hype train gamblers.

[07-Nov-18 04:20 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Sure but it gets the word out

[07-Nov-18 04:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
No one really knows

[07-Nov-18 04:20 PM] Sdunbar#5064
not sure how much more this coin is known than it was a year ago

[07-Nov-18 04:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Pff alot

[07-Nov-18 04:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Last year kmd was realatively unknown. Now people are coming to build things using this tech. Ppl will catch up for sure

[07-Nov-18 04:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You are here before all the big name hype followers

[07-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah ive been here a while now, not that long though compared to some

[07-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
actually its about a year right now since I first bought KMD

[07-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I like what the marketing team is doing but it seems so hard to get traction

[07-Nov-18 04:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Im in for kmd about july 2017

[07-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I really do wish some big names would start talking about it even if they are "hype train gamblers"

[07-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
It would still help imo

[07-Nov-18 04:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Slightly

[07-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Sdunbar#5064
TRON is still holding way up the list for over a year now thanks to constant hype and being extremely well known

[07-Nov-18 04:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Projects do just fine with out twitter opinions. I just had an ann page back in day lol

[07-Nov-18 04:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
All the talk and no product eventually wheres off tho

[07-Nov-18 04:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Maybe they will have a product at some point

[07-Nov-18 04:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
haha

[07-Nov-18 04:25 PM] Sdunbar#5064
They sold the dream at least

[07-Nov-18 04:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Aha yeah most likley wash trading aswell

[07-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah

[07-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Sdunbar#5064
probably

[07-Nov-18 04:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Look at most projects macafee shilled wherr are they now?

[07-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
verge is the main one i can think of

[07-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Sdunbar#5064
still well ahead of KMD is where it is

[07-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Sdunbar#5064
lol

[07-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Sdunbar#5064
it's still a cent each from tiny fractions of a cent that it was a few years ago

[07-Nov-18 04:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Verge is ahead in terms of being snake oil for sure. But when it boils down to what can you do with it theres no contest.

[07-Nov-18 04:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
And verge few years... kmd 1 year

[07-Nov-18 04:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
X patience and products

[07-Nov-18 04:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
And i will add to this. Kmd is surrounded by brilliant minds. You could say the best around. So in terms of project success and longevity kmd and the ecosystem ranks alot higher than verge....

[07-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah for sure I'm well aware of how amazing the devs are

[07-Nov-18 04:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Or many other projects for that matter

[07-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Sdunbar#5064
thats why it's so hard to watch sometimes

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
especially almost a year later after buying its still the same story now as then

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
hype train trumps all

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
easily

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i agree. With the hard work that goes on these people are well due that break upwards

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
have to head off to work though have a good day guys

[07-Nov-18 04:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[07-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[07-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cheers @Sdunbar have a great working day 😃

“This wallet is not user friendly”

“Where do I save private keys”

[07-Nov-18 05:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s right in front of you

[07-Nov-18 05:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do these people actually speak words, or is it a high pressure spray of diarrhea the moment their lips part?

Things to look out for that I think will lead to massive traction in the next quarter: Mm2.0*HyperDex combo, CC with some very useful dAPPs, rebranding of Komodo. Will be very hard to ignore at that point.

[07-Nov-18 05:29 PM] ryman112#0068
Dude hits some nails on the head in that reddit post

[07-Nov-18 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
he expects too much

[07-Nov-18 05:33 PM] jorian#4555
the 'Until' points will happen eventually. building trust for the current system took a long time

[07-Nov-18 05:33 PM] jorian#4555
can't just replace that

[07-Nov-18 05:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
I dont think he is expecting anything. I think he is just saying widespread adoption won’t happen until those issues are addressed.  Shit needs to get a lot simpler for the average NPC to get on board. Since we all want our lambos, we should realize we probably arent getting those lambos until some of these things happen.

[07-Nov-18 05:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
Downloading version after version of buggy wallets, keeping an ear to the ground constantly for every coin/project to protect oneself from delisting/forking issues, using disciplined op-sec protocols... its just too much for your average Starbucks-drinking NPC.

[07-Nov-18 05:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ugh, and tax compliance. Hopefully the thieves at the IRS will make things a little more straightforward.

Thanks for starting that conversation on Twitter.

[07-Nov-18 07:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I need to step away but if anyone has help for answers, I would appreciate it.

[08-Nov-18 12:57 AM] meatspoon#7860

[08-Nov-18 05:38 AM] grumpygoron#4320
I love how easy KMD is to predict and trade.  BTC down, KMD down.  BTC sideways, KMD down.  BTC up, KMD down.  Easy money
