Wallstreet  sharks  always  back  to  that  price  after  weekends  to  fill  bids

[17-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Andersen#8337
Friday  last  price  8450

[17-Jun-19 11:50 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah at some point the gaps always get filled. Happens in lots of markets. its just a matter of when

[17-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Andersen#8337
Yea  -  some weeks  it's  few  day later  after  weekend

[17-Jun-19 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it can be a flash crash to that price and inmediate recovery too

[17-Jun-19 11:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
gaps mean that markets moved while exchange was closed

[17-Jun-19 11:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that means that the people who where long will take profit and the ones who were short will be liquidated, but institutional traders and retail traders identify these gaps and look to fill them, in other words, many shorts will be opened today

9388ish is 0.786 fib target and we hit it....if we reverse where pullback target for 0.786 would be its 8080ish, considering the gap and that they almost always get filled its possible

[17-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Markus#5464
that would create a higher low once again

[17-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Malti#3948
thanks for the explanation Siu

[17-Jun-19 12:17 PM] bishop#9773
There are plenty of gaps in securities that are never filled... just because there IS a gap doesn't mean it HAS to fill, but I'll admit, it does have a high degree of success

[17-Jun-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
why does it need to fill?

[17-Jun-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
sorry no idea what that is üòõ

[17-Jun-19 12:29 PM] cascrypto#8206

it's all in the hands of exchanges now. the hardupdate is done

[17-Jun-19 12:34 PM] crumb#2550
they open, when they get around to it, as always :abusedsmily:

at least you have a good excuse üòÑ

[17-Jun-19 12:51 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Haha yeah thats true

[17-Jun-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```why does it need to fill?```
It means there is a price no one bought or sold for. Means absolutely no support at that level.  Price will have a natural magnetism to that price to be filled.

[17-Jun-19 01:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I still think we have to go down to 1.5-2k before it can even possibly break new highs

[17-Jun-19 01:21 PM] crumb#2550
odds of that happening are not great. they still exist of course, but no very likely to happen.

[17-Jun-19 01:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, I remembered you saying that you thought BTC would bottom out down there... seems very unlikely at this point.

[17-Jun-19 01:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
that would mean an 80% haircut from where we are now... for no particular reason

[17-Jun-19 01:29 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It did touch 3k like i called I just thought it happened much too fast.

[17-Jun-19 01:30 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Or perhaps all my work is making time pass faster than I can perceieve ü§∑

[17-Jun-19 01:31 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Plus the chinese housing market is in the biggest bubble of all. I wouldn't want to play anything too hard until that burst.

[17-Jun-19 01:31 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The communist government can only prop that thing up so long.

[17-Jun-19 01:32 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it'll be the same calamity like when the us housing market bust in 08' except worse.

[17-Jun-19 01:32 PM] BlackJesus#6161
china is definitely the global leader now when it comes productive power.

[17-Jun-19 01:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If they go into a hard recession and draw inward all other economies should be forced to as well. Australia's energy market is innately tied to china. As is America's consumerism

Maybe I'm overthinking it and we are in a bull. I just think the physical commodities market is going to have a definite impact on crypto and not in a good way when global wealth readjust for the looming market crash.

Australian economy would get a massive hit for sure. so much demand for natural resources comes from China

[17-Jun-19 01:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Exactly the globalist economy is here. The United Nations just doesnt weild any power.

[17-Jun-19 01:35 PM] crumb#2550
but China will inflate it away like us, europe and every central bank on the planet

[17-Jun-19 01:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161
china going into a recession is going to demolish economies. I fear Australia could be setting up to be Greece of 08'.

[17-Jun-19 01:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Even as they keep printing money its going to find its way back into the economy one way or another. Or atleast the producers will account for the inflation as always.

[17-Jun-19 01:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
lol

[17-Jun-19 01:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
13th per wikipedia page.

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are definitely "1st world"

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
this fear of economic collapses is a tiny bit irrational. will it make trouble? yes

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
but the solution is already known to everybody

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
more money

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
negative interest rates

[17-Jun-19 01:39 PM] crumb#2550
force people to spend their fiat

[17-Jun-19 01:40 PM] crumb#2550
exactly!

[17-Jun-19 01:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
We've been doing negative intereste rates for years.

[17-Jun-19 01:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Have we not?

[17-Jun-19 01:40 PM] crumb#2550
doesn't mean we could go even more negative :abusedsmily:

[17-Jun-19 01:40 PM] crumb#2550
up the printing tempo

[17-Jun-19 01:41 PM] crumb#2550
there is no other solution

[17-Jun-19 01:41 PM] crumb#2550
do you think people agree with cutbacks? hell no

[17-Jun-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i looked into what i meant to be in first world, second world, third world

[17-Jun-19 01:41 PM] crumb#2550
but if you inflate it away then everybody is happy

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it comes from the cold war and countries aligned with USSA vs USSR

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
1st vs 2nd, all others were third world

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] crumb#2550
well, not happy, but not really paying attention cause there is some drama with Kardashians

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
nowadays we probably need a 3rd meaning china affiliated and 4th being not affiliated with the first 3

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I can tell you central banking was the dumbest thing to ever exist. How exactly did society accept that a small group of people are allowed to "attempt balancing the economy" through manual standardization control of the inflation rates and interest rates.

[17-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
third/fourth world seems to actually be a good thing

[17-Jun-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just that a lot of countries that werent worth the trouble for the big ones to colonize ended up there too

[17-Jun-19 01:43 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yeah, I've heard that terminology for 1st 2nd and 3rd. I use it more or less to explain if a country as has old world infrastructure.

[17-Jun-19 01:43 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Australia has landlines for days as does most of the 1st world countries.

[17-Jun-19 01:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
Central banking isnt dumb, it is evil genius stuff

[17-Jun-19 01:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Like if you dont have the infrastructure built by now. They are going to skip over it and immediately go for more localized sources for power and connectivity.

[17-Jun-19 01:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
wireless/solar

[17-Jun-19 01:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
Whatever, man.  I just remember how sure you were that BTC would DEFINITELY go well below 2K.  Other people had other thoughts but they were definitely wrong according to your, uh, bold prediction.  And since you were calling a 1700 bottom, of course it touched 3k.  You cant call a 1700 bottom and have the price not touch 3k, so that isnt much of a success in forecasting

[17-Jun-19 01:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I had originally called 3k then readjusted to to 1500-1700 bottom üòÆ

[17-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the other day it went to $110 CAD!

[17-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that was it

[17-Jun-19 01:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
my readjustment never happenned

[17-Jun-19 01:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
you were quite loud about your 1500-1700 bottom

[17-Jun-19 01:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Which I had just said was because I thought it hit 3k way too soon.

[17-Jun-19 01:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
others who disagreed just didnt understand or didnt have your breadth of knowledge

[17-Jun-19 01:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Then made a conjecture that maybe time as passing faster for me because I've been going back and forth to mexico for the past 2 months for my job.

[17-Jun-19 01:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
its easier to just type, "yeah, i was wrong"

[17-Jun-19 01:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
but i do enjoy busting your chops about it a bit, since you were so cocksure

[17-Jun-19 01:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That was me admitting I was wrong and still holding a bear stance due to the chinas economic position with their concrete boxes in the sky.

[17-Jun-19 01:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
cryptos are basically uncorrelated assets.  so claiming that the price of BTC is influenced by Chinese real estate..... thats a stretch

[17-Jun-19 01:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They have sky rises that look like unfinished basements selling for big money. Because they brainwashed their populace into having to own multiples houses to grow wealth. Almost the same as the college wave that came through america in the 70-80's

[17-Jun-19 01:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are uncorrelated to everything but global wealth.

[17-Jun-19 01:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm pretty sure global assets as a whole taking a dip will certainly cause crypto to take a dip.

[17-Jun-19 01:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The inflation is shared amongst all assets within global wealth. I'm just not sure how proportionately its distributed.

[17-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
unless all the regulations and confiscatory policies counteract this effect and a disproportionate share moves into crypto

@jl777c I don't think there are any dark sources with enough crypto to attempt that kind of offset. Because they would have to own alot of crypto to funnel that kind of loss into it.

[17-Jun-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean fiat being converted to crypto

[17-Jun-19 01:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
oh ok

when people realize all the fiat is just belong to the govt
