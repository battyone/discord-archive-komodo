[04-Jun-19 10:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
all of your charts are upside down.  KMD is actually falling hard üòÑ

[04-Jun-19 10:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
yeeeeee KMD letss goooo

[04-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Alecandro#1179
did whale bro show up again or is this people buying without whalebro influence?

[04-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Markus#5464
still need to break 20k

[04-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Markus#5464
this is 5th attempt

[04-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
whalebro is probably a number of people anyway, its not like only one person in the world is capable of makign a buywall

[04-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
well this was unexpected

[04-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
why would he pump it during theBTC drop

[04-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
makes no sense

[04-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
is it? shouldve already happened yesterday with that announcement imo

[04-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Tek#5253
Yes I know but BTC is tanking hard

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Tek#5253
usually the play is to wait out the btc dump

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
btc tanking SHOULD make alts rise in satoshis

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it doesnt because people are retards

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Tek#5253
it doesn't because bots.

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and sell them down harder

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Oszy#5734
froze at 20k üòÑ

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Tek#5253
he draws pretty dildos

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
back in 2015-2016 btc and alts often moved inverse.  btc drop would make alts rise

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Tek#5253
I can give hi m that

[04-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Tek#5253
cool

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Tek#5253
that will probably start to happen more as we progress

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Tek#5253
and BTC loses more and more dominance

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Tek#5253
I really didn't see this one coming

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Tek#5253
well played whalebro

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Tek#5253
well played

[04-Jun-19 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
20k sats still = -4.67% in the real world

[04-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Tek#5253
theres still huge buy support at 20k

[04-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Tek#5253
no actual walls

[04-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Tek#5253
but when it goes below big buys happen

[04-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Alecandro#1179
bye bye walls

[04-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Tek#5253
well played whaleburuh

[04-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Tek#5253
you were predictable until you weren't. this last move wasn't.

[04-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Tek#5253
first time he pumps during a btc dump

[04-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Tek#5253
he/they/it

[04-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
was super predictable, it was an ascending triangle.  my TA saw this coming a mile away üòâ

[04-Jun-19 10:08 PM] BanHammer#8115
interesting battle

[04-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 10:10 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 10:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338

After the announcement yesterday and also the one from ca333, there may be a lot more interested parties.

[04-Jun-19 10:13 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 10:13 PM] Tek#5253
is gonna draw some srs attention

[04-Jun-19 10:14 PM] yorklab#7270
I always think of Whalebro as an insider, but this could be external buying this time.

[04-Jun-19 10:14 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I think of whalebro/sis as insiders as well

[04-Jun-19 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
he must atleast be here

[04-Jun-19 10:15 PM] Alecandro#1179

[04-Jun-19 10:15 PM] Markus#5464
