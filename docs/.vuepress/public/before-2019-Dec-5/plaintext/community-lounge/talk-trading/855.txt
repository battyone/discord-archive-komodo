I didnt know you have whales that can ride bikes

[26-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sure whalebro is completely fine....if he can afford that amount of kmd its safe to say his btc stack is quite fine aswell

[26-Jun-19 01:58 PM] joe2x4#5987
With talk of no marketing, does this include the realization that pirate and k64, rfox,  amongst others are constantly giving shout outs to kmd?

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Malti#3948
when you decided to buy, on what was it based?

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Malti#3948
have these beliefs to the project changed?

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
I was bullish

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Not to a project

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
But beliefs that money will be made did

[26-Jun-19 02:04 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes...thats the problem...when we rise its ok but when we dump and we have critic its not ok

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948
and why did you choose KMD instead of anything else?

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
I didnt choose only kmd

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] coingirl87#6489

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948
"hey guys marketing sucks, you should do more"

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] joe2x4#5987
Rise dump rinse repeat, like washing hair

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Malti#3948
"but i'm not willing to pay a dime or write an article"

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 02:05 PM] coingirl87#6489

[26-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Mark81#4505
Marketing has nothing to do with this price action. It's irrelevant.

[26-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Malti#3948

@Tek I sold mine to buy kmd when it dropped to 18 500

[26-Jun-19 02:07 PM] coingirl87#6489
Why i should pay for a write article? I am only an investor

[26-Jun-19 02:07 PM] Malti#3948

[26-Jun-19 02:07 PM] Malti#3948

Hey, i dont think that critizicing @coingirl87 for her views is good.

[26-Jun-19 02:07 PM] joe2x4#5987
Jl777 should be ashamed at conning pirate and k64 and rfoxto market kmd for free. Sham

[26-Jun-19 02:08 PM] coingirl87#6489
When you give me funds of kmd marketing i can pay a write article

[26-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It will affect price directly

[26-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Ofc

[26-Jun-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
