The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission charged CEO of online adult entertainment marketplace, with running a fraudulent initial offering scheme.

```In fact, according to the SEC‚Äôs charges, no token was ever issued and his ethereum application never existed. The money raised went to marketing rather than building the product.```

[24-Sep-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
seems the "only marketing matters" argument isnt working with the SEC

[24-Sep-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
turns out if you raise money you actually need to deliver the tech that was promised

[24-Sep-19 07:11 AM] house#8741

In Drunken Text, Kik CEO Threatens to Quit: 'I'm Not Going to Jail...
In a message sent to CoinDesk apparently by accident, Kik CEO Ted Livingstone claimed to be quitting the company.
https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ted-Livington-Kik.png

[24-Sep-19 11:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So they have 19 developers working on "development of Kik" token with $100million raised from ICO and still they have no product and $5million of regulatory spenses are making them shutdown?

[24-Sep-19 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

We are at the end of a wedge and it appears we fell out

[24-Sep-19 01:52 PM] altcoinist#1501
Price has recovered 2 or 3 times l wonder if it's worth the risk to buy and hope it will recover again

[24-Sep-19 01:53 PM] JimD#9272

[24-Sep-19 01:57 PM] JimD#9272
My gut is telling me down

[24-Sep-19 01:58 PM] JimD#9272
9200 is a pretty significant resistance though

definitively not in tone with all the hype behind it

[24-Sep-19 03:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i am not surprised by a exchange opening to be a dissapointment

[24-Sep-19 03:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the norm since ever has been that new exchange openings are sell the news events

[24-Sep-19 03:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ever since the times of bitstamp... coinbase, gemini, kraken, coinbase pro, etc...

And for some reason I decided to visit my chameleon wallet where I keep my KMD and the best of them all K64 coin

[24-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Caglio#3337
So in one point of my life, I traded 250KMD for 750K64, which was valued 2 euros yesterday

[24-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Caglio#3337
Meaning I succeeded in getting full 2 euros for 250 Komodo coins
