people are selling alts for BTC, and then selling BTC for fiat, but not all of it.

[12-Sep-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
across the board

[12-Sep-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as BTC dominance is rising, alts are going down across the board

[12-Sep-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this is in addition to whatever downward moving BTC is doing

[12-Sep-18 06:55 AM] jansako#3330
😃 One would almost think you are being serious...

[12-Sep-18 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
overall cryptomarket cap is i think lowest level of bear market. as long as it keeps falling, people will trade out to BTC, thus increasing the BTC dominance.

[12-Sep-18 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
likely it wont get back to 90%

[12-Sep-18 07:13 AM] mosu#5812
trading bots will accelerate....everyone give up

[12-Sep-18 07:18 AM] mosu#5812
BTC dominance meaningless, now price is  important

[12-Sep-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC dominance is quite important

[12-Sep-18 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
unless price doesnt matter to you

[12-Sep-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if BTC dominance is going up and overall cryptomarketcap is going down, that means all alts combined have to share a smaller percentage of a smaller amount. How you can say that is not important?

[12-Sep-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
smaller of smaller is the worst possible as the other options are smaller of bigger, bigger of smaller, and bigger of bigger

[12-Sep-18 07:21 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder what's the cause today, it seems that overall market is red

[12-Sep-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
ETH meltdown -> shakes confidence of all alts, the logic being if ETH can meltdown, no alt is safe from meltdown

[12-Sep-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
panic sell into BTC

[12-Sep-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also the realization that the statement "all altcoins have nothing original" is 80%+ true, the 20% get thrown out with the 80%

[12-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
eth is now only 16% of btc cap . It was 20% a few days ago

[12-Sep-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and the big ETH sells by all the ICO projects hasnt even started

[12-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
KMD has enough funds for 14 years at least , correct?

[12-Sep-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
for notarizations, yes

[12-Sep-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
for mining and rewards it stops after block 7777777

[12-Sep-18 07:28 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder if notary operators can survive if the price drops below a certain level

[12-Sep-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
below 25 cents, subsidies will kick in

[12-Sep-18 07:29 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
like the early days then 😄

[12-Sep-18 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. the good news is at these prices it is like doing a second ICO for everybody that missed out on the first one

[12-Sep-18 07:30 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Maybe most of the projects out there will be gone by then and KMD will be few of the projects that left

[12-Sep-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i do hear many of the centralized projects are really hurting and will have struggles

[12-Sep-18 07:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So it is a battle of survival of the longest and fittest

Do you guys think, i can have a return on investement in the next 3 years ? (got in at 7$ =/)

[12-Sep-18 07:33 AM] gt#2812
what was the ico price

[12-Sep-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont cost average, it will require 7x current prices

[12-Sep-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if you cost average down to $2, then just a doubling

[12-Sep-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
ico price was about 15 cents

[12-Sep-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but there was a lot less achieved at the time of ICO

[12-Sep-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming we get into another bull market, then there will be a lot fewer projects with a long history for people to be investing in. but then again BTCD is still traded actively, so the crypto market prices are still far from rational. 3 years is a long time, anything can happen in that timeframe
