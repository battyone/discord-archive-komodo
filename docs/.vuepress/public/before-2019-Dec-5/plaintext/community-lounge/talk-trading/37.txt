so its worth discussion imo when it comes to ASIC for the algo

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> and about 2-3 equihash coins aligned their forking with zcash

[01-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you dont wanna talk about it then stay quiet

[01-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I sincerely hope everyone takes your position though @Dr.Terminus

[01-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Has zcash stated an intention to fork?

[01-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I've heard both ways for them now

[01-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
first that they would not fork

[01-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
then that they actually would

[01-Jul-18 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Fun fact: in 3 months there will be a **large** increase in KMD hash due to ASICs and anyone clinging to the "ASICs are bad" mantra will be left behind trying to turn a large profit with GPU mining KMD

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Zcash is not forking proof is here. https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/8ujy6u/zcash_community_governance_panel_votes_to_shoot/

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck it

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if KMD doesn't fork then you are likely spot on correct. only ASICS will mine profitably. GPU's will have to swap mine for it at best I suppose

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the commuinity voted 66%+ to reject forking

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sending in my order tomorrow morning after I receive my tax id number

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
KMD is not forking proof is here. *scroll back*

[01-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I believe you

[01-Jul-18 10:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
saw jl777 statements

[01-Jul-18 10:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We wuz KMD kangZ asic crew

[01-Jul-18 10:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
kinda a shame IMO but nature of the beast I suppose.. if you are hardcore KMD and ZEC then ASIC is king

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie how loud are these fucking things anyway

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Asic is a natural evolution of mining IMO.

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
its a shame because nobody is getting as rich in both KMD and $$$ as BITMAIN

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Should I build a sound-proofed enclosure?

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Why would it be a "shame" to not change the algo in order to pander to a minority that is comprised of Joe Burgerflippers?

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
we at least need more ASIC manufacturers

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
samsung is making headway into asics

[01-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
now BITMAIN controls damn near every algo!

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they can 51% almost anything

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they don't have any on the market right now but it's well documented.

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Hollowman9000 3-4k rpm fans

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
_is a joe burgerflipper who is crypto hoodrich_

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they can not ship miners in order to run them themselves until profitablity falls to their  liking and then ship

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'nobody will sell you a money making machine for more than they stand to make with it themselves'

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, since @Dr.Terminus is on about anti-Bitmain nonsense, I'm going back to TV

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs a risk

[01-Jul-18 10:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
whatever the z9 mini sells for, rest assued BITMAIN is crushing it on returns!

[01-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sales of equipment is a concrete figure you can build plans on

[01-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@ComputerGenie is a blow hard. anyone really give a shit what he says lol ? üòÉ

[01-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I do

[01-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
then buy all the Z9's you can afford mate !

[01-Jul-18 10:04 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I do

[01-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I will

[01-Jul-18 10:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I definitely bought my share.

[01-Jul-18 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"they can 51% almost anything"
No, they can, literally 90% **everything**
It's only ingnorance that can't see fact and doesn't get that they don't have to **ever** release fekall

[01-Jul-18 10:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
In the future you will look back on this moment and we will probably be mid size equihash miners as are the bitcoin miners of today.

[01-Jul-18 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Bitmain doesn't control crypto because Bitmain has no want or need to control crypto

[01-Jul-18 10:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If bitcoins track record is anything to base the superior zk-snarks equihash coins to.

[01-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can we refer to ourselves as ‚Äúthe syndicate‚Äù or the ‚ÄúKMD cartel‚Äù?

anyone who got heavy into bitcoin mining circa 2015 is a millionaire today

[01-Jul-18 10:58 PM] dudezmobi#1945
mining became commercialized and a lot of us became greedy

[01-Jul-18 10:58 PM] dudezmobi#1945
2015 the idea is to mine with your own computers at home

[01-Jul-18 11:00 PM] dudezmobi#1945
now it evolved to something else

[01-Jul-18 11:02 PM] dudezmobi#1945
imho its better to have small decentralized hash power, than big asic farms. one emp attack can paralyze the whole system

[01-Jul-18 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
News Flash:
2015 is over

[01-Jul-18 11:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
P.S. - nodes control the system, not miners, ASICs, GPUs, and/or "farms"

[01-Jul-18 11:07 PM] dudezmobi#1945
with much hash power concentrated it would be easy to cause havoc. we tested an emp bomb with 500$ worth of over-the counter materials. rendered the whol 80 qf ft pcs useless.

[01-Jul-18 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If anything, the singular fail-point is the trend for everyont to want to connect to a singular SPV server, whereby only a handful of nodes decide everything

[01-Jul-18 11:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if 1 person had 99% of hash rate and 99% of nodes ignored that 1 person, then their hash is moot

[01-Jul-18 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
despite the FUD that comes out, miners don't matter, nodes do - period

[01-Jul-18 11:10 PM] dudezmobi#1945
yeah not anyone can afford an fpga or asic. if you use fpga use emp protection too.

[01-Jul-18 11:10 PM] dudezmobi#1945
nodes doesnt matter in emp attack

[01-Jul-18 11:10 PM] dudezmobi#1945
hehe it still electronics

[01-Jul-18 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"yeah not anyone can afford an fpga or asic. "
If you can afford a $890 GPU, you can afford a $850 ASIC
Because, feken math

[01-Jul-18 11:11 PM] dudezmobi#1945
we just assessed the risk with blockchain, and this one is on top of list

[01-Jul-18 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is bored of the regurgitated rhetoric and goes back to TV_

[01-Jul-18 11:12 PM] dudezmobi#1945
emp attack on centralized hashing centers

[01-Jul-18 11:18 PM] BlackJesus#6161
lmao @dudezmobi you must have a bomb shelter for the nukes too huh

[01-Jul-18 11:19 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Jesus you guys and your far fetched antics; when is the zombie apocalypse

[01-Jul-18 11:19 PM] dudezmobi#1945
we are evaluating blockchain adaptation

[01-Jul-18 11:19 PM] dudezmobi#1945
current risks changed

[01-Jul-18 11:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
there are more than enough big asic farms to resist; better yet I'm not even going to indulge your fantasies

[01-Jul-18 11:20 PM] dudezmobi#1945
lol

[01-Jul-18 11:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
ignored

[01-Jul-18 11:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
talking about emp's lol

[01-Jul-18 11:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
üòÉ

[01-Jul-18 11:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
just 1 risk

[01-Jul-18 11:21 PM] dudezmobi#1945
another would be hic

[01-Jul-18 11:22 PM] dudezmobi#1945
hijacking hashing centers

[01-Jul-18 11:22 PM] dudezmobi#1945
lol

[01-Jul-18 11:22 PM] dudezmobi#1945
if youd seen the list you would be surprised

[01-Jul-18 11:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, you're not going to convince anybody here. Just stop

[01-Jul-18 11:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Last commen t from me on this subject to you.

[01-Jul-18 11:23 PM] dudezmobi#1945
lol im not convincing im saying data hehe

[01-Jul-18 11:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Somalians giving up the open seas for data center operations?

[01-Jul-18 11:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
EMP attacks?  What superpowers will be detonating nukes anytime soon?

[01-Jul-18 11:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ridiculous considerations imo

[01-Jul-18 11:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
B..but the university magnet thing from o.. oceans eleven

[01-Jul-18 11:42 PM] dudezmobi#1945
nope a simple lightning strike on a power substation can trigger it. small area only

[01-Jul-18 11:42 PM] dudezmobi#1945
its ridiculous yeah hehe

[01-Jul-18 11:42 PM] dudezmobi#1945
but thats what you do in risk assesment hehe

[01-Jul-18 11:43 PM] dudezmobi#1945
it might happen is far fetched from it will happen

[01-Jul-18 11:53 PM] NNoperator#3835
will the sun rise again ?

[01-Jul-18 11:54 PM] NNoperator#3835
then my node will be hashing

{Reactions}
ü¶é 

[01-Jul-18 11:55 PM] dudezmobi#1945
hehe of course it will

[01-Jul-18 11:55 PM] dudezmobi#1945
now for the countermeasures its on a different pay grade

[01-Jul-18 11:55 PM] dudezmobi#1945
lol

[01-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Run lightning protection on your building and faraday cage your equipment if you‚Äôre that paranoid

[02-Jul-18 02:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why does zec not forking mean z9 mining will be profitable for us to mine kmd? üòÆ

[02-Jul-18 03:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because less will come to kmd than if kmd is the only coin left to use it on

[02-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will high profitability on zec mean people will be changing over to kmd either way? Or not really LMAO
