[20-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Tek#5253
kmd needs to step up the marketing game

[20-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Tek#5253
but ive heard thats coming

[20-Jun-19 10:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
“Linux needs to step up the marketing game” said no one ever.

[20-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Tek#5253
this is crypto, not operating systems. and linux was the  second, komodo is crypto nr 100

[20-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Markus#5464
To me it feels like KMD trying to rely on the ecosystem to market itself, dont know if that is the best way to do it....feels way too slow

[20-Jun-19 10:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[20-Jun-19 10:33 PM] Markus#5464

[20-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Tek#5253
shit

[20-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Tek#5253
is kmd affected?

[20-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Tek#5253
might be fake

[20-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Tek#5253
nvm above postings

[20-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Tek#5253
The increased regulation of coins deemed securities (which essentially leads to a ban) may increase demand for coins that are epitomes of *non*-securities such as XMR, LTC, BCH, and DOGE. These coins were (i) fairly started, (ii) fairly mined, (iii) did not perform an ICO/IEO, and (iv) are not backed by a company and are therefore not at risk of being classified as a security. These coins will also remain available to U.S. based investors and are therefore arguably more attractive. For example, Monero is listed on the following U.S. based exchanges:

- Poloniex 
- Kraken
- Bittrex
- Beaxy 
- Huobi US 

And the following U.S. based OTC firms:

- DVchain 
- Cumberland Mining
- Kraken's OTC desk
- Circle's OTC desk
- Galaxy Digital's OTC desk

As well as the following crypto asset brokers: 

- Abra (according to their CEO, Monero will soon be added as a native asset)
- Circle Invest
- Voyager Invest

I think it is fair to say Monero is well positioned to attract U.S. based investors, especially given that they cannot access a lot of other altcoins anymore.

Lastly, it is naive to expect that only the U.S. will increase regulation on coins deemed securities. Each country effectively has security laws that are fairly similar.

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
@Tek cant find anything about that SEC thing on their twitter

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
so probably fake

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
yeah it was fake

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
though

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
and it would be strange

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
how is the KMD status for americans

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
DASH would be fucked big time

[20-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
howso, they dont have an ico

[20-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Markus#5464
still staking reward

[20-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Markus#5464
from master node

[20-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
oh rite

[20-Jun-19 10:57 PM] yorklab#7270
Didn't ETH have an ICO? If ETH is deemed OK to trade, then other ICOs will have good reason to be in the mix also.

[20-Jun-19 11:13 PM] blubbi#0643
no ARRR in Arrrmerica

[20-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Tek#5253
@yorklab ETH got a special status from the SEC

[20-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Tek#5253
it is one of the few ICOs that will not be threated as ICO coins

[20-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Tek#5253
cause its so big already n shit

[20-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Tek#5253
ETH was pardonned by the sec

[20-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Tek#5253
all the shitcoins that ETH birthed tho, or projects that did ICOS on ETH are in trouble

[20-Jun-19 11:27 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Stomping around in the IOTA markets discord? I mostly read it but never say anything in it.

[20-Jun-19 11:28 PM] Tek#5253
oh yeah

[20-Jun-19 11:28 PM] Tek#5253
know much bout iota?

[20-Jun-19 11:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Three months ago you world of have sworn that IOTA was dead if you was in that discord. Now they actually believe it has a chance.

[20-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
to be fair. they still have nothing.

[20-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
or am i wrong?

[20-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
it can go down another 90%

[20-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
but im interested in it bc its not real chain tech

[20-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
I want to be diverse in my assets

[20-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Tek#5253
i mean its uh something different than the standard blockchain

[20-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Other than it sometimes works or not? Most of their stuff is "in development" so for now it's just a coin with no transaction fee that might or might not work, depends on if it is sunny outside.

[20-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Tek#5253
yeah so it still doesn't work

[20-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Tek#5253
i heard the new wallet is awesum tho

[20-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That all depends on when you are trying to use the coin. It might go in 1 second or it might take 3 months. That is right, 3 months. I had a transaction take that long to go through one time.

[20-Jun-19 11:32 PM] Tek#5253
thats absurd... not reliable at all then

[20-Jun-19 11:32 PM] Tek#5253
i don't really understand y it has such a high Mcap if its not a working product

[20-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Tek#5253
same for ADA

[20-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was freaking out trying to figure out why Binance was sending me emails about a deposit and found out it was coins I sent 3 months ago.

[20-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[20-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Tek#5253
think they will make it work ?

[20-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Tek#5253
dunno I was browsing on my favorite shit board and someone said iota solved the oracle problem and it was posted in their new whitepaper

[20-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Tek#5253
but yeah, whitepapers are just that

[20-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Tek#5253
i want to see mainnet and proof

[20-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Tek#5253
before i'll believe it
