Suppose all exchange opperators are terrible, just a matter of picking the least worse option

[19-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@klein  They changed their IEO to Coineal

[19-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380

I‚Äôve held that info to myself long enough.

[19-Apr-19 05:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Made me think there‚Äôs some truth to the hack claim.

[19-Apr-19 05:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How else to recover losses due to poor security than at the sacrifice of those generations to come.  

Hmmm is Coinbene run by the government? ü§®
