so worst case 75 cents or so, unless they get all their funds confiscated

where do you see where it says the funds were seized

[26-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
skimmed through a couple different sources, my understanding is that, that a company from Panama ended up with $850M of their money and refused to return it. The NY AG says they then tried to cover up this loss of $850M with tether reserves

[26-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
lol can you imagine? "Can we have our $850M back please?"

[26-Apr-19 11:13 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Absurd

[26-Apr-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
Representatives for Bitfinex and Tether told the AG‚Äôs office that a Bitfinex official was told the reason the $851 million couldn‚Äôt be access was because Portuguese, Polish and American government officials had ‚Äúseized‚Äù the funds.

CryptoCapital Co is insolvent, which means that the exchanges in this picture are (have been) insolvent. 

You figure out what that means.

But why would cryptocapital being insolvent mean that these exchanges are insolvent as well?

[26-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean even if they are shareholder in those exchanges that doesnt mean they share liquidity etc per se

[26-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not defending them or whatever, just meaning to say that it is a BIG leap to claim such things with limited knowledge available.

@klein the crypto capital thing is pretty old

[26-Apr-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
@Cryptoon those exchanges on that list had no fiat gateways. They all used crypto capital as an intermediary

[26-Apr-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Without the fiat deposits, the exchanges have very little liquidity

[26-Apr-19 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
It all points to them using the same firm for fiat liquidity which proves to be their Achilles heel
