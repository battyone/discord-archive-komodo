at least on coingecko for example, I think they average weight price with volume, so Paragon doesn't make it to the top 20 there

how ever long it takes to find the bottom, the same amount of time it will take to find a new high

everything looks like it's on the verge of breaking up... problem with KMDBTC is it's now 20% away from the major breakout level - can we pump straight up there if the space starts moving up?? üòÉ

[01-Jan-19 11:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
@bpkdasbaum thanks for sharing your chart

[01-Jan-19 11:53 PM] Likewise#6767
volume drying up again, it's being sold off as usual after a pump.

[02-Jan-19 12:55 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah still a lot of fear in the market, sellers taking whatever opportunities they can just in case, but if BTC follows through here I expect alts to start showing themselves - many are on the edge of breakouts/trendlines/levels etc

IMO this may be a fair dip to buy for KMD, or anywhere in the consolidation we might see in the coming days.... annoying to see ethbtc basically about to break out and KMD with this lame spike to get past, but it is still a probable event.

[02-Jan-19 12:58 AM] ver_User#6608
also volume always dries up in a consolidation, look at 9-18th Dec, volume still very good compared to then or earlier on binance

[02-Jan-19 01:00 AM] Likewise#6767
0.0001950 shouhd hold to keep current trend intact

[02-Jan-19 01:03 AM] ver_User#6608
agree, good volume around that zone

[02-Jan-19 01:07 AM] Likewise#6767
Thanks. cryptoBirb on twitter put up a chart indicating levels.  He sees a deeper pullback, I tend to stick to my 1900-1950 support where I will buy back .

Seems like a new start up project. Even better if we can convince them to join up into a Komodo side chain

[02-Jan-19 11:44 AM] ver_User#6608
@ResoluteCrypto @Likewise 

it makes a lot of sense, however the problem with basing trading decisions on candlesticks in a choppy market like KMD is you have pinbars everywhere and more often than not they do not signify reversals on the time frame that they should in theory... that daily does look epic, but a retracement that low seems less likely if we are in a BTC bull run for the time being, which he also claims 5-6k being higher probability. 

I'm not gonna lie though, KMDETH is disappointing me, I don't see it going much lower, as in breaking key levels, but chart looks ugly... anyways, in markets "anything can happen", so let's see

who is dumping vrsc tho

[02-Jan-19 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gonna have to buy more now

[02-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But the same amount of vrsc is mined each day

[02-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so that wouldnt explain the dumping

[02-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
unless they dont care about price as they are mining more efficiently

PoW, i.e. mostly dumpers

[02-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Lumbi#8378
even at 50/50 PoS/PoW their price-performance ratio is dubious

[02-Jan-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
only problem with your theory is that it has no math basis

[02-Jan-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
daily KMD PoW 4,000 coins

[02-Jan-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
today's trading volume 1 million KMD

[02-Jan-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and 75% of the 4000 by notaries

[02-Jan-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so about 1000 KMD per day via PoW vs 1 million, 0.1% does not make price change much at all

[02-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Lumbi#8378
KMD is in a league of it's own compared to low volume alts... üòâ but I see a correlation between PoW, the "halving effect" and the financial pressures put on miners vs. stakers.

[02-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Torankoku#4818
looking at Emmanuel's list of projects in kmd's ecosystem, most either do not have volume or  not listed on exchanges

[02-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Torankoku#4818
most must be young but i don't really follow projects in ecosystem lol

[02-Jan-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
seems its a list of unlisted projects

[02-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Torankoku#4818
ah i see

[02-Jan-19 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC, PIRATE, KMDICE even ZEX are listed

[02-Jan-19 06:54 PM] Torankoku#4818
but vrsc is not on market list

[02-Jan-19 06:54 PM] Torankoku#4818

[02-Jan-19 06:56 PM] Torankoku#4818
these two are the major ones that people hear about first, most definitely cmc

[02-Jan-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810

[02-Jan-19 06:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Might be worth considering a bundle listing at CryptoBridge.

[02-Jan-19 07:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
Many coins start off there before graduating to larger exchanges. And they have been adding lots of more mainstream pairs recently. Zec, xmr, xrp, etc. they will be growing a lot this year.

[02-Jan-19 07:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
You can run bitshares trading bots too, keep liquidity high and earn btc from the market maker program.

I would just like to drop by and tell everyone to check out one of komodos recent third party projects with a fundraiser in KMD

https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

Funds are unlocked as they reach their milestones/prove they have completed set tasks. A crypto bank, a lending platform, a stable coin based on Komodo debt collateral, a venture capital, the ability to use kmd in their project as a native token,  and more. 

Haven‚Äôt been this excited for a project related to Komodo for quite a while or any other coin I‚Äôm in. There are a few (very very low liquidity) coins on the exchange mercatox under GXE. I think it‚Äôs good to do a bit of both, buy a stake of this security token on the exchange at whatever price you can grab as well as contributing to the project by sending funds into their escrowed fundraising/ico wallet. 

I wish them the very best of success. With 100m tokens in circulation, at the ico price of 7 OUR/GXE per KMD, that puts its marketcap at 1,000,000

I‚Äôm sure their kmd based stable coin could be of a lot of use to many of our projects as well
