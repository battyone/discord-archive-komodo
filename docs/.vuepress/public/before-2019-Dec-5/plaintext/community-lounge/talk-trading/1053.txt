i accidentally used a newly created wallet address. I guess I should fill out the govt forms and report it now before it gets flagged as a terrorist wallet.

The market finally hates alts

[08-Aug-19 10:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There will be room for 2 or 3 alts

[08-Aug-19 10:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The rest disappear

[08-Aug-19 10:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Choose wisely

[08-Aug-19 11:49 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
alts gotta be either superdynamic or superspecific to survive

[08-Aug-19 11:50 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
it has to do so much that it can be massively adopted, or fix a super specialized issue to have a core support base

[08-Aug-19 11:50 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
kmd for the former, arrr for the latter

[08-Aug-19 11:50 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[09-Aug-19 12:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
the kmd ecosystem is catching flak because it's over the target and about to drop the bombs.

[09-Aug-19 12:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
imagine the damage you could do to a coin if you had access to hundeds of btc and the trading api keys for hundreds if not thousands of binance exchange accounts. The binance kyc hack is another blockbuster marketing push for atomic dex.

[09-Aug-19 12:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I believe exchanges will love Atomicdex more than they realize

[09-Aug-19 12:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
I do hope they see the benefits of the tech and will not view it as a competitor.

[09-Aug-19 12:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How can they compete when they need the tech to survive

[09-Aug-19 12:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The future is DEXs basically, CEX will get regulated to death

[09-Aug-19 12:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
yes, but they would definitely still have a role to play as a gateway to extra liquidity for institutions whose kyc is already baked in the cake.

[09-Aug-19 12:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
whether or not that's a good business remains to be seen.

[09-Aug-19 01:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep üòÉ We will see more of this CEX to "community" DEX migration

Number of currently listed coins that can hit their ATH again v USD: maybe 25

Number of currently listed coins that can hit their ATH again in BTC: maybe 5

Thoughts on these estimates?

[09-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Markus#5464

@Markus you can just confirm the pattern , I believe after it reached the last point

[09-Aug-19 11:17 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Which then makes it highly accurate bearish

[09-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Markus#5464
yes

[09-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Markus#5464
indeed

[09-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[09-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
how do u even buy kmd with fiat

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kraken - trex

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or bitpanda is you like high fees and ease of use

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Markus#5464
u buy btc first?

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bch yesterday

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but that took me more than an hour to transfer to trex

[09-Aug-19 11:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so not falling for that shit again

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
i would be all over kmd if it was listed on coinbase

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
would be easy buy

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bitpanda is at least as easy as coinbase

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
idk if i trust it

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe easier because very cheap SEPA wire transfers

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as in

[09-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Free

[09-Aug-19 11:52 AM] Markus#5464
any withdraw fees?

[09-Aug-19 11:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
