5G is in the range where you can really fry people, imagine some dude hacking the 5G network, turning up the HZ and microwaving everybody near the 5G antenna

[17-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it tho

[17-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
effects of man made RMF aren't clear. I doubt they do our bodies good. cellphones have warnings in the manual not to call holding the thing to your ear

[17-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
if you want to call safely you have to use the speaker

[17-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
cause it fries your brain when you put it near your ear. theres a few cases of people that used the cellphone a lot ( for work etc ) thtat got brain cancer because of it

[17-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How the f*ck do they determine that cellphone use was the cause of cancer without a double blind study

[17-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Tek#5253
this is all new technology, effects will be shown in a few more decenia down the line

[17-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Tek#5253
like, how they used to say smoking was good

[17-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Tek#5253
and nothing wrong with smoking

[17-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Tek#5253
doctors even promoting it on telly

[17-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Correllation doesnt necessarily mean causation

[17-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Tek#5253
well yeah

[17-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although I agree it’s probably best to avoid it when not needed, i doubt its as bad as the tinfoil hat people say it is

[17-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Tek#5253
thing is, all this adjustments of environment take toll. its too much change at once, thats why westerers are degenerating so hard

[17-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Tek#5253

It has one?

[17-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
it does? 🤔

[17-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
At least on desktop

[17-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In transactions tab

[17-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On mobile atm but 99% sure it does :p

[17-Apr-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
k i found it but its really really small circle 😄

The problem with studies looking at health effects of x is that it isn't always clear what is causing the problem, if there is one

[17-Apr-19 08:59 PM] west775#4114
So many factors go into why a person gets an illness

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] west775#4114
Nutritional studies are notorious for this

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
modern disease, because of modern environment

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] west775#4114
Yes

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
if you want to speed up your degeneration 10 to 100 fold, go vegan

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] west775#4114
But easy for companies to say that it isn't their product

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] west775#4114
It is someone else's

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
science sux now

[17-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253

[17-Apr-19 09:01 PM] west775#4114

Lol their last one was such a success they found something new to dump on the plebs

[17-Apr-19 09:29 PM] west775#4114
Wasn't the one before vbk also a flop?

[17-Apr-19 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Was there one before vbk? Thought vbk was the first one 😮

[17-Apr-19 09:30 PM] west775#4114
Maybe I'm thinking of a different exchange

[17-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362

IEO fad will pass

[17-Apr-19 09:37 PM] PTYX#6840
But it's a new gold rush for those who launch one while the craze is still underway.

[17-Apr-19 09:40 PM] crumb#2550
a lot of fancy buzzwords in the OCEAN IEO announcement tho. good copywriters can make anything sound good. even if it doesn't really make sense at all

[17-Apr-19 09:40 PM] crumb#2550
this is going to be painful for newbs

[17-Apr-19 09:42 PM] crumb#2550
when reputable exchanges do IEO-s then many people thing that this is also a "proof" that this is a good and thought-through project

[17-Apr-19 09:43 PM] crumb#2550
if one can't evaluate stuff, then they'll look for "authority" to tell them. like youtube influencers and twitter gurus :troll_hardcore:

[18-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Let’s go for another Green Day

[18-Apr-19 08:13 AM] hastrup#8742
Would zack approve this oracle's?

[18-Apr-19 08:13 AM] hastrup#8742
Is it the right definition?

[18-Apr-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i think zack can always find something wrong with everything, the question is if is at an acceptable risk level. the biggest exposure that is see is that if notary nodes are evil, then they could mislead newly connecting nodes onto a false chain. however as long as users run make sure their node is in sync with the mainchain, then any false chain is meaningless, especially if bets are not made until after in sync.

[18-Apr-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the other issues is that if the source of data is hacked, then the data will be controllable. but my point is that these oracles are about what the online pricefeeds are returning, not their abstract price independent of a price source, so in a way if a price source is hacked, as long as the oracles are mining what the price source had, it is correct

[18-Apr-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
from a practical point, having the chain not go off on forks due to data that is different on each node, this seems the most real issue. For over a week all 10 of the test nodes are in lock step. We havent pen tested it yet and likely there will be some issues found and fixed during that process, but as near as I can tell we are very close to having a trustless pricefeed that can be used to settle bets: http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[18-Apr-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i think zack position is that anything that relies on elections is not secure as bribes can put attacker nodes as notaries. but this seems quite a theoretical thing and also the annual cycle makes it hard to bribe the elections to get your notaries in place so that they can cheat one time for the big bet that you will make later in the year

[18-Apr-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe some billionaire is secretly bribing all the KMD hodlers to elect his sleeper notary nodes so that when the world cup betting happens next, he can trick nodes that are not online into a betting frenzy before they make sure they are in sync with the real chain. This would of course mean that all the notary candidates must already be sleeper agents

[18-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
OR... maybe that is just silly and not in any reality so we dont have to worry about the notarizations being for a fake chain. in any case that is a onetime attack as once it is found out, all the notaries that signed the fake chain are outed

[18-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
In my opinion, the design is secure enough. zack would say that elections are involved so it cant be secure

[18-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but ask him, dont rely on my interpretation

[18-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i think to be safe, just dont bet more than a million dollars at a time

[18-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Malti#3948
we went from 19k to 22k yesterday, a correction to 21, even 20 levels seems reasonable and would not classify under a dump
