it went up 10% over about 5 hours (after a steady low volume decay) and then corrected 3% from the 2877 local top, but the pattern is still being formed

[18-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the meaning of "sell off" is not a 3% correction right after a 10% gain. I think "consolidation" might be a better word

[18-Mar-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
Right

[18-Mar-19 05:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, consolidation is the right word

[18-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
usually it will bounce around mostly sideways for a bit and then decide to go up or down. if down >10%, then "sell off" would be appropriate. to sell something off, you would be at a lower level than 7% above where things were

Is the XRP army made up of bots and fake accounts?

[18-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
could it be that nobody actually cares about XRP

[18-Mar-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
other than ripple hired sock puppeteers?

[18-Mar-19 05:24 PM] Markus#5464
I think they start to realise XRP got no use case and will be out performed by other project that actually develop something useful

[18-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
4 years ago having fiat gateways was pretty useful, but nowadays there are so many fiat <-> crypto gateways, the only real advantage XRP has is that it is very fast and editable database

[18-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I tried once to find the genesis block for XRP and sync to the latest blockchain. turns out it was "lost", at least some of the early blocks are no longer. doesnt really matter as it was edited to fix whatever blockchain issues they had in the early days

[18-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess I use "blockchain" very loosely

[18-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Markus#5464
Think i read somewhere something of XRP making smart contracts, is that not abit odd change from banking to smart contracts?

[18-Mar-19 05:29 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm not surprised about XRP I wouldn't be surprised if Nano has a shill bot army as well.

[18-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder if there are any liabilities for running such things. it will cost a lot of people a lot of money when the reality sets in

[18-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Markus#5464
Too much shilling when it comes to Tron aswell, all i see is gambling dapps that die 1 by 1 few weeks later with similar concepts

Small amount, 40k zex or something

[19-Mar-19 11:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Zex had a terrible launch imo. Some unknown members joined the discord and started a coin for a dex that was possibly coming soon(yet to use a working product) that has a massive founders reward %. Along with that they refused to release any information on the team that was running it. It came off very scamish, and still does. Although i enjoy bitcoin bennys videos, i dont know if i can support rfox either. Theyre launching a coin, effectively having investors invest in their business, which by the look of their whitepaper, theyre valuing their business at a max of $5.6 (edit: million) dollars. This is a ludicrous amount of money. Not only that, theyre taking 20% of the initial funds for Team and Advisors, in addition to 25% for the rfox enterprise solutions; effectively giving themselves 45% of the TOTAL coin supply. Maybe im missing something here, but it doesnt seem very legitimate to me. Happy to take constructive feedback on my look at it.

[19-Mar-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
$5.6 dollars seems a pretty low valuation

[19-Mar-19 11:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
True that ü§£

[19-Mar-19 11:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
A business the price of a big mac, what a steal

[19-Mar-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
even $5 mil is pretty low end for a business

[19-Mar-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and the percentages for coins that are coins are different from coins that are companies

[19-Mar-19 11:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Granted, depends what business specifically, but i would aruge a $5million business is  not particularly small.

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If they only sold $1million of the coin and it was actually selling 0.05c/RFOX after that, they would actually have $23.5million in value. The initial $1mill from crowd funding, and 450million RFOX then valued at $22.5million.

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c do you know if they're using the existing RFOX chain?

[19-Mar-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, existing RFOX chain

[19-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
how does this compare to comparable offerings? the numbers dont seem anything particularly gigantic

[19-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
raising 22 mil vs having a value of 22 million are two totally different things

[19-Mar-19 11:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Which comparable offerings are you referring to? 
Just a cheeky 22 mill they've generated out of thin air, nothing special aha.

[19-Mar-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
for offerings, you have to compare it to comparables

[19-Mar-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
like real estate

[19-Mar-19 11:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How would you compare real estate to this coin offering?

[19-Mar-19 11:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Genuine question

[19-Mar-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
I mean, in real estate, the way to get a value is by comparing it to other comparable real estates

[19-Mar-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
similarily

[19-Mar-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
for offerings, the way to compare is by comparing to other comparable offerings

[19-Mar-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if it seems too expensive compared to other offerings, dont invest. if it seems good value and promising, invest
