On coinexchange

[05-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Alright#0419
that is the current chain

[05-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
👍

[05-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Should be the KMD one. I didn't even know coinexchange was trading it.

[05-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What’s the supply

[05-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
100MM

[05-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
2018-12-01 19:15:34 last order on there

[05-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Alright#0419

James is the big bag hodler

[05-Jun-19 12:33 AM] richardt#2807
Used to be over 800,000, but I think jl777 burned a bunch his own assets or something along those lines

[05-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Yeah, there are not many since most holder just forgot about it and didn't do the swap.

[05-Jun-19 12:34 AM] 차미숙#8912
James got some drastic measures to reduce supply

[05-Jun-19 12:34 AM] richardt#2807
I think the unswapped just got added to SuperNET holdings

[05-Jun-19 12:34 AM] allbits#5898
Adjusted outstanding assets is about 650,000

[05-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
That makes since. James created a 1:1 KMD chain and figured that was the ones he burned.

[05-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[05-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
147 for sale on coinexchange

[05-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'll be damn. It still uses the Unity name on coinexchange.

[05-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Now that is a throw back

[05-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s some K-T boundary depth hodling

[05-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Zero sellers

[05-Jun-19 12:37 AM] 차미숙#8912
Well no need to sell really if you are not stripped in cash

[05-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Used to be a very liquid market on Nxt

[05-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Tek#5253
@actionslacks facebook crypto groups are great for market analysis

[05-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Tek#5253
the noobs usually reside there

[05-Jun-19 12:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah it's also great for causing depression

[05-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Tek#5253
howso?

[05-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 12:39 AM] 차미숙#8912
What about tron fanboys

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Retail tumbleweeds, fuck em

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Tek#5253
A fren of mine that finished college level IT ( systems and networks ) bought XRP

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
We need corporate fanbois

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Tek#5253
so even decently smart people fall for the ripple scam

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] 차미숙#8912
They buy it cuz buying 0.01btc makes them depressing

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Tek#5253
i wanted to trade with him once and asked what his biggest holding is

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
How the hell does a coin a pump with an announcement of a announcement about eat at some posh dinner and leaving the biggest tip the place has ever rolled their eyes at.

[05-Jun-19 12:40 AM] 차미숙#8912
Y'all no what I'm sayin

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Tek#5253
he said xrp, we never spoke again after

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lawl

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Tek#5253
: D

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
That and the admin for the group i was in was a bitfinex insider who tried to reassure everyone that tether wasn't utter bs. surreal

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Tek#5253
I was in the OMG holders club for a while

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] 차미숙#8912
Having 1,000,000 dogecoin on the other hand makes them feel good than 0.1btc

[05-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Tek#5253
on facebook

[05-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Tek#5253
they keep buying

[05-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
There were a few guys on Supernet slack that swore by ripple some years back. They are doing good enough now to not be discord coin channels.

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Tek#5253
don't even check any progress of the team whatsover

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
yea the ethereum group was kind of entertaining...

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Tek#5253
I think ETH has one pump left to 0.056

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Tek#5253
if it doesn't fix scaling by some time after the pump to 0.056

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Tek#5253
its over for ETH

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] 차미숙#8912
I have some eth

[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Tek#5253
same I bought some today

[05-Jun-19 12:44 AM] Tek#5253
for the pump to 0.056

[05-Jun-19 12:44 AM] Tek#5253
> btc at 7777 when I looked

[05-Jun-19 12:44 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 12:44 AM] 차미숙#8912
There is this thing in crypto investing

[05-Jun-19 12:44 AM] 차미숙#8912
If the founder has a really big head, you should probably go all in

[05-Jun-19 12:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
Like Jack ma

[05-Jun-19 12:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
Nam sayin

[05-Jun-19 12:45 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[05-Jun-19 12:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
I have some eth too. just cause I'm lazy.

[05-Jun-19 12:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
I bet James has really big head

[05-Jun-19 12:46 AM] 차미숙#8912
Roger ver created his own Bch shitcoins but the two crypto that is actually used for transfer of value so far is eth and btc

[05-Jun-19 12:46 AM] Tek#5253
I disagree

[05-Jun-19 12:46 AM] Tek#5253
I use BCH to transfer value

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] Tek#5253
ETH and BTC fees are way higher than BCH

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] 차미숙#8912
That's just for showing off

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
does anyone have MGW?

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] Tek#5253
no its bc BCH is advantagious in transfer fees and exchange withdraw fees are also usually very low for BCH

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] 차미숙#8912
Fees are higher because people actually USE them

[05-Jun-19 12:47 AM] Tek#5253
BCH is being used

[05-Jun-19 12:48 AM] Tek#5253
the fees wont increase until 32x the amount of BTC users

[05-Jun-19 12:48 AM] Tek#5253
since its 32mb blocks

[05-Jun-19 12:49 AM] Tek#5253
check bitinfocharts

[05-Jun-19 12:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
To be used as a liquid shitcoin, you need 1) a crazy ICO hype all over again 2) all exchanges just die to add to their pair

[05-Jun-19 12:49 AM] Tek#5253
or blochiar

[05-Jun-19 12:49 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think I still have a handful of MGW. They have never paid out anything.

[05-Jun-19 12:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
Eth and btc is the only coin that achieved that

[05-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Tek#5253
ETH should not have been this big honestly. skelly premined many millions

[05-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Tek#5253
I think the first 70 million are all premined

[05-Jun-19 12:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
MGW is in the asset flow chart though so I'm thinking it will pay something out at some point

[05-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Tek#5253
then he did the ICO

[05-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Tek#5253
and giving away of ETH to friends

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
MGW should pay out a portion of DEX shares since it owns a large amount of the DEX asset.

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] 차미숙#8912
I mined like 100eth during some time in genesis

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] 차미숙#8912
I can't find it

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] 차미숙#8912
It's lost in the cryptoland

[05-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Tek#5253
i cant remember howmany millions it were
