some bot went a bit haywire?

[04-Sep-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is filling the recent history with positive (or negative) trades. some bots are confused by this, so it seems an anti-bot bot

I've been giving a lot of thought to the recent 50% rise in Bitfinex shorts, large cash buying and the recent OkEX massive margin call.

Is that an exchange or jl? Or is the top spot some anonymous whale

All I want for Christmas is to be a whale..

[04-Sep-18 11:46 PM] shnu#0359
imagine after the current whale buy...some darkweb market start to list KMD. That should connect all the dots. #speculating

[05-Sep-18 12:12 AM] jspook16#3059
The RD7..Pi whale is king

[05-Sep-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The why that whale is going, maybe he thinks KMD will be the new BTC .... or he found a way to print as much BTC as he likes :trollface:

[05-Sep-18 01:36 AM] bishop#9773
Well, when you have KMD that is cheap relative to it's history priced in BTC (and priced in fiat because of "cheap" BTC), coupled with 5% rewards and actual tech backing things, seems lower risk than other crap to put coins in.

[05-Sep-18 01:36 AM] FundazuSafu#1169
I heard it was satoshi himself @blackjok3r

[05-Sep-18 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah agreed its probably the lowest risk in almost of all of crypto, and a whale that big can also keep the price as low as he likes to buy as much as he can at this price too 5 million sell wall would do the trick üòõ

[05-Sep-18 01:39 AM] bishop#9773
I remember user OTOH coming into Darkcoin in the early days and buying up like 700k coins.

Komodo would be the best choice even better than zcash or xmr because of the barterdex

[05-Sep-18 01:57 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Get Komodo wash it then atomic swap it "you've got fresh coins."
