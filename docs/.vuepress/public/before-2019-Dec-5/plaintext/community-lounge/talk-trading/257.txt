exit scam from lead developer. 300k USD

[29-Oct-18 11:26 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
```Despite Oyster passing three separate smart contract audits, we were told by Bruno Block, the original founder and chief architect of the project, that the directorship of the token contract had to remain open so that the peg could be adjusted over time. This ultimately turned out to be a trapdoor mechanism in the contract that was eventually exploited. This contract was written by Bruno Block prior to the ICO, at which point Bruno was the only member of the team. ```

The contract was not the issue, it was the contract address that got compromised.
