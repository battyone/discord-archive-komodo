Alts will die

[23-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Markus#5464
die is used so wrong when it comes to this market

[23-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Alexfrog#1338
indeed, a shitcoin which reaches fees of $100 per transaction in really busy times is awesome, and all other alternatives to it which were invented later with a goal of improving it will definitely die

[23-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
why ppl dont get it

[23-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
ur not suppose to use bitcoin to transact and buy things

[23-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
its a store of value

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Everybody expert here with their 1000 k portefolios lmao

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
indeed, this is why its whitepaper called it 'Bitcoin: a peer to peer store of value'

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
what does 1000k even mean

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Markus stupidest thing I ever heared

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
What is btc a collectors item?

[23-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but i agree, btc is gold 2.0 and is useless for transacting

[23-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
it was designed to be a peer to peer transaction system

[23-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
but is and wont be

[23-Jul-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
but then again if u have millions in btc and u pay 100$ to send it i dont think u give a shit

[23-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
pretty sure you still do

[23-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
you definitely cant do it often

[23-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
ur gonna lose the 100$ in seconds when the market swings anyway

[23-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
so it make no difference

[23-Jul-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
if u got 1 million dollar in bitcoin...that means if price is 10k exactly u would have 100 bitcoins, price moves 1$ either up or down and u gained/lost 100$

[23-Jul-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
so i dont think its a big deal

[23-Jul-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464
bitcoin is down 20$ last hour, well u lost 2000$

[23-Jul-19 10:58 AM] Markus#5464
so to me arguing about transaction fees is silly

That initial 250,000 KMD payout makes this interesting. That seems like a really big incentive for the first payout at least.
