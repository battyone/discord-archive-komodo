all alt communities screaming for more marketing, since we all know all you need is a bit of magical marketing to counteract BTC dominance rising to peak levels

everyone is just in pain because their bags are going down in btc

[24-Jun-19 06:31 PM] p.#1126
it would take the entire crypto mc worth of marketing and then 10x that amount into the actual project to overtake btc

[24-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Alexfrog#1338
they beg for a pump to get back to even so they can abandon the projects and get their btc back

[24-Jun-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if they care so much about the day to day BTC price, maybe they should just stay in BTC?

[24-Jun-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I sometimes go months without even looking at the price

problem with btc is that it sucks and is insanely expensive to use

btc dominance has been rising for like 17 months now

[24-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im sick of it

[24-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Since Binance "adoption " KMD has been descending againt BTC - yes, there were a few outliners. When I look at the charts, it's hard to find any optimism.  One day.

disheartening at best

[24-Jun-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be a much better scenario than BTC at $1500

[24-Jun-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just the compression phase for altprices

I dont get all the btc hate. Why cant we like btc and kmd or any other project.
I dont see btc as a payment method anymore, but as a store of value....an investment for years to come. I dont buy gold as an investment..cant carry that shit around as you want..
If i want to move somwhere, i just needmy phone..thats it.
We just need some payment crypto cards that can handle btc, and other cryptos..and you exchange btc(within app) for other currencies and pay for your purchase. Thats the future.

There is so much compression for Komodo. Like, how many Komodo lizards fit in one Bitcoin green candle?

until the decompression phase, it isnt a full cycle. i think you can only really compare prices when the dominance is in similar levels

[24-Jun-19 07:10 PM] dan.#2473
people hate btc cause it doesn't fit in with their cryptlosophy

[24-Jun-19 07:13 PM] dan.#2473
the haters are outnumbered. people in alts are in the minority

[24-Jun-19 07:14 PM] cascrypto#8206
Yes dominance is key

if you actually test crypto currencies

[24-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Tek#5253

very nice

[24-Jun-19 07:15 PM] dan.#2473
thats a good analysis tbh @Tek

[24-Jun-19 07:16 PM] alen#3721
I understand its slow and fees are high..as someone whos doenst know technical working behind it...what else is wrong

[24-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Although I am not always positive about Komodo, I haven't sold one Komodo.  Internal fighting is necessary sometimes.

if you dig further you can see 0 development around BTC

[24-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Tek#5253
since fees are high

[24-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Tek#5253
meanwhile BCH has a social network twitter build on it

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Tek#5253
only thing btc is developing is lightning network

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] alen#3721
I dont like roger hahaha

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Tek#5253
and has been so for the past 5 years

i like roger

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] dan.#2473
@alen also it will probably be taken over if govs and banks have their way. so expensive that only lightning is used, and those channels controlled by kyc

[24-Jun-19 07:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
so what is closest to original BTC ? Roger Ver and BCASH? certainly not Faketosjhi

[24-Jun-19 07:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
I sympathized mostly with BCASH .. but onboarding that viper üêç CSW put a real damper on it- hopefully, it can recover

oth, Bitcoin simply does not scale, big blocks or small

[24-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Tek#5253
and people have bought from me

[24-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Tek#5253
Bitcoin can scale.

[24-Jun-19 07:19 PM] alen#3721
But how can they take it over...i neee this explanation.
Its decentralised with massibe hashpower. Sure banks and institutions can shitloads of btc and manipulate price with it..but how can they take it over.

[24-Jun-19 07:19 PM] dan.#2473
What @Tek  said is key though. Just cause something has awesome prospects or tech doesnt mean it should be expensive or bad, although it can help if real life economics is an indicator. 1/tech. We can't deny Bitcoin has security and network effect

[24-Jun-19 07:19 PM] alen#3721
Buy*

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] LocoMB#8593
I think I'll have a closer look at BCASH, esp. the block and scaling issues- because what BSV is doing with their GB blocks is simply hilarious lunacy

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] joe2x4#5987

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] dan.#2473
@alen maybe the government whont accept bitcoin unless it goes through a lightning channel thats kyced

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] LocoMB#8593
ah ok- _goes to look_

[24-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Tek#5253

lets all be honest here, theres literally hundreds of active cryptos and shillers in every project. they all cant be winners

[24-Jun-19 07:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah I saw that- looks promising

[24-Jun-19 07:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
@joe2x4  there is a problem there- I don't understand that site .. üòï and I am far from being a crypto nnob

[24-Jun-19 07:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
never heard of

[24-Jun-19 07:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
a channel on on freenode.net ?! obvsly

[24-Jun-19 07:24 PM] alen#3721
Well we all kind of saw that coming...nobody actually believed that they are gonna let this pass...if btc gets mass.adoption..they are gonna want to know who is paying to who and how much. I know its bad..but if they let this slide it would be a disaster, a tax apocalypse for governments

[24-Jun-19 07:24 PM] LocoMB#8593
so I can explore there I guess - ok irc is from the early days, I used that way back then too
