kmd should never have gotten back down this low, its disgusting

[03-May-19 11:47 AM] Tek#5253
i agree

[03-May-19 11:47 AM] Tek#5253
I was thinking a pull back to like 22k

[03-May-19 11:47 AM] Tek#5253
sure

[03-May-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253
but it went way lower

[03-May-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253
in crypto shit always go much lower and much higher than I expect

[03-May-19 11:48 AM] Markus#5464
easy abused when volume is low

[03-May-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253
yeah its about that too mostly

[03-May-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253
the bots / market makers on the exchanges just try to push the prices down / up depending on the setup

[03-May-19 11:49 AM] Tek#5253
if the volume is low

[03-May-19 11:49 AM] Tek#5253
it works

[03-May-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
enough if one exchange like bittrex or huobi decide to push down kmd price (even lower volume exchanges) and then binance will follow sooner or later

[03-May-19 11:50 AM] Markus#5464
just look at the mega pump to 38k by huobi, close to no volume

[03-May-19 11:50 AM] Markus#5464
arbitrage bots went crazy

[03-May-19 11:51 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[03-May-19 11:52 AM] Markus#5464
but overall volume is rly much smaller in crypto then ppl think, most exchanges have fake volume

[03-May-19 11:52 AM] Markus#5464
alot of ppl would be shocked by seeing the real numbers

[03-May-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253

[03-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
the rumour is that cosmos investors will pump the price until ICO tokens get unlocked

[03-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
ico buyers bought at 10 cents

[03-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
iits trading at 4 dollars

[03-May-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
got it;

[03-May-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
stay away from cosmos

[03-May-19 12:31 PM] Malti#3948
i'm really wondering what BNB will do in the future. If it's 'just a stock' then i'll hold on to my bag

[03-May-19 12:34 PM] Tek#5253
cosmos is a agood project

[03-May-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
but ico investors can't even sell

[03-May-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
they have it "locked" for the first 3 weeks

[03-May-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
so I'm waiting for 3 weeks then i'll maybe buy the cosmos dump

[03-May-19 12:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[03-May-19 01:40 PM] Markus#5464

[03-May-19 01:40 PM] Tek#5253

The Ten of Pentacles and Finances
In your financial forecast, the Ten of Pentacles is one of the best cards you could ask for. This means that money is coming in, and that you‚Äôll have enough of it to be able to ensure that your future is secure.

Investing is a good idea at this time.

[03-May-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
LETS GOOOO

[03-May-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
I'm not good at divination yet so it might be that, just because I was thinking about KMD and crypto that I drew the 10 of pentacles bc it has to do with uhm

[03-May-19 01:45 PM] Tek#5253
pentacles are coins and they have to do with financess / material wealth
