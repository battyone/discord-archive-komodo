KMD in the weekly chart is finally looking great. I think it has never had such a good setup at a weekly scale

Gd it. Was gonna buy before i left for work.

[29-Nov-18 02:41 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
hold your horses, btc is still under, dead cat/bulltrap, btc going lower and it will drag down kmd again

[29-Nov-18 02:42 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
btc held in the middle of nowhere, daily rsi is still at 30, volume still low.

still good time to accumulate in general, just be careful

[29-Nov-18 02:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
But them gains... damn I feel like being a degenerate gambler again.

[29-Nov-18 02:45 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
and the kmd pump today was even less volume, but I'd reckon that's because the whale has dried out most of the sellers beforehand

If anything this shows what can happen when volume comes back for good when btc and the markets start to behave again

[29-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it is a chinese exchange üòÑ

[29-Nov-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They can only buy what is for sale ... and ther eis none for sale right ? üòÇ

[29-Nov-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only a fool or a giant giant whale be selling any meaningful amount of verus at this point in time.

[29-Nov-18 09:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, the trading is not available yet , tomorrow is the date üòÑ

[29-Nov-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you got verus you stake it lol... why sell it...

[29-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that's what i said, but 2 chinese miners approached me trying to sell

[29-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
at a higher rate of course

[29-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
almost at devpro rate üòÑ

[29-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there were some HUGE miners early on.... that probably have a fair bit to sell, with the unlcoked coins coming out now.

[29-Nov-18 09:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, 300k and 100k  for sale respectively

[29-Nov-18 09:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
probably bought by mshark funds already , i saw a recent purchased üòÑ

[29-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
anyway, we will see tomorrow , if it is dumping, will buy some more üòâ

[29-Nov-18 10:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, time for CMC to start looking more like the Chinese rankings...

[29-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Jetter73#2234
@Cryptoon Did someone go crazy for Verus? Went up to 6k sats

[29-Nov-18 10:42 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I think some people was buying it because of the AACOIN  listing news, could probably get dumped tomorrow, just my 2 cents

[29-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, I'm waiting a bit to see what happens

[29-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I suggest everyone does the same and/or dumps into my buys

[29-Nov-18 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362

500k tx/sec is 100MB of data every second. only a network with 1gbps connections can keep up with that, and no node will be able to catch up if they ever go offline. of course faketoshi will upgrade the global internet so everyone has 10gbps connections

no facts can help changing his mind

he must be one of those guys that at the Nxt/Supernet divorce, went all-in with Nxt
