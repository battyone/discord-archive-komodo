4800 was my buy target

[19-Nov-18 09:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
this is it. there's nothing to stop it from hitting 3k now

[19-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why

[19-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
4600-4800 should be first resistance?

[19-Nov-18 09:54 PM] dokrates#8987
yes

[19-Nov-18 09:55 PM] dokrates#8987
im very happy how kmd is hodling price

[19-Nov-18 09:55 PM] dokrates#8987

[19-Nov-18 09:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
no one is gonna buy in until the dust settles. wall st dumped, now asia is gonna dump after they wake up.

[19-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or gonna start buying

[19-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A lot of people eyeing these levels

[19-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Once the buying starts I can see fomo happening

[19-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Reminds me of the post china ban rally early october 2017

[19-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
China bans bitcoin

[19-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Everything is superbad etc

[19-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then btc fell back to the 2k levels

[19-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then bounced hard

[19-Nov-18 10:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Like 50% in an hour or so

[19-Nov-18 10:01 PM] JimD#9272
Just before the bull run

[19-Nov-18 10:02 PM] JimD#9272
we are all about to be rich

[19-Nov-18 10:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, alts hit the breaks
good sign if it holds

[19-Nov-18 10:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
global markets in general are in a tenuous position right now. a breakout would be extremely surprising to me.

[19-Nov-18 10:10 PM] dokrates#8987
i see many people buying alts with their new fresh cheap bitcoins

[19-Nov-18 10:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
but honestly i dont know shit. i bought a bunch of bch a month ago

[19-Nov-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Nov-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810

The Fed stopped printing money on August ... and the 10 year US bond  yield went up.... and it can keep going up ...many companies stopped receiving investments because of this same as many cryptos.

[19-Nov-18 10:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
now we need shitcoins to never recover, so that Top 25 is no joke

[19-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Mische#6695
aye

[19-Nov-18 10:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I guess we are entering the purification stage,  a lot of sh**coin will get purged

[19-Nov-18 10:20 PM] Mische#6695
finally, hope the rebound of the good projects comes fast

[19-Nov-18 10:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah if there is an upside, it will be the flush of the shitcoins

Turning $300,000 into 5 Cents
Chuck and Hector invest all of their money into bitcoin! Unfortunately, the inevitable market crash happens and bitcoin drops to a new all time low. Selling ...

rocket seems to have run out of fuel and crashed into the earth killing everyone onboard

[20-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Are not all markets collapsing ?

[20-Nov-18 05:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This was to be toally expected

[20-Nov-18 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught it was the general sentiment, that as everything in the fiat system started to implode... crypto would also dump .. but crypto and metals would recover the fastest.

[20-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i dunno DJIA  is still 25k

[20-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
hardly a crash

[20-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
compared to crypto its nothing

[20-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
dont think people lost 95% there

[20-Nov-18 05:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
peak was 26.7k

[20-Nov-18 05:36 AM] Sdunbar#5064
25k is no big

[20-Nov-18 05:37 AM] DynamicPimp#0206
How much deeper do u guys think this is going to go??   I have some fiat burning a hole in my wallet...

[20-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[20-Nov-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry to say ... I kept selling all the way down

[20-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hold KMD and PIRATE and CHIPS but got enough fiat out to not ahve to worry about money for a while.

[20-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
last ot was lukily days before this implosion of everything.

[20-Nov-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Every market was clearly over brought, everything ... qay too much cheap money out there last 10 -15 years

[20-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I didnt lose 95% just saying a lot of coins are down that much or worse from ATH

[20-Nov-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats honeslty no surprise either ... as most alts were pump and dump scams tbh.

[20-Nov-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The stock market doesnt really suffer from that problem üòÇ

[20-Nov-18 05:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
did bitcoin just took another dive?? ü§î

[20-Nov-18 05:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I checked my portfolio an hour or so ago and now it's showing big difference

[20-Nov-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am glad I sold a fair bit, but kicking my self a bit that I didnt sell a bit more üò¶

[20-Nov-18 05:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yeah, I also think I should have sold back in Jan a bit more

[20-Nov-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt want to sell everything as I need crypto for my projects and paying/tipping ppl etc... having none is terrible... but ned fiat to live sadly.

[20-Nov-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had nothing left when the crash in jan happened.

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
apart form a bunch of CHIPS in a paperwallet ... which have lost liek 90% üò¶

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Lucky for me, I never had enough gains to sell... it's been losses all the way.  
I don't think there's anything worse than third degree burns so I just keep holding the flamethrower.

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yeah I saw chips at just 5 cents value now

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Mining for losses....

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Buying for losses....

[20-Nov-18 05:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
At least I am learning and gaining experience and meeting great people.
With 40 years under my belt, I know that is the real value gained.

[20-Nov-18 05:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this is the first time in many months my portfolio hit that too much low

[20-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lucky I got into BTC last year with my position at the very bottom of the China FUD, and got BTC and BCH... did quite well considering how bad at trading I am

[20-Nov-18 05:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be I just checking irregularly didn't notice... üòÖ

[20-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I worked out later, had I hel my position in BCH intil the very top of the bubble... I would have made like 100k off $1000... instead makde about 10k off $1000.

[20-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this year made like 30k I think ... off $0 üòÑ

[20-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just my time and effort

[20-Nov-18 05:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trading is ot where the money is I dont think...

[20-Nov-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
skills and work are

[20-Nov-18 05:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hodling best project, moving value by time to cover risk, working and earning in crypto only, is the best way to go
