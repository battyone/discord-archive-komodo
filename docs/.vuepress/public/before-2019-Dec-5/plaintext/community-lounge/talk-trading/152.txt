You sound frustrated

[12-Sep-18 03:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We‚Äôre due for a multi-year flat line

[12-Sep-18 03:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get used to it

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So boring

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'd rather see another drop to 5.5k

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I need my fix

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll pick some more kmd up around fiat ICO price

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is fiat ico price? 0.12c?

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or btc price?

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
12-15 cents

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Something like that

[12-Sep-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's hope we wont see those levels

[12-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It would require 1k btc or so?

[12-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm down

[12-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm a BTC buyer at that level

[12-Sep-18 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Noted

[12-Sep-18 03:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$6k BTC is too much

[12-Sep-18 03:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I need to be in the KMD top 100

[12-Sep-18 03:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can‚Äôt do it at this price

[12-Sep-18 03:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Moar pain and suffering please

[12-Sep-18 03:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@Hollowman9000  I think you wont see those levels but jut my 2 cents

[12-Sep-18 03:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just*

[12-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
If we saw those levels I would gamble a lot of  fiat thats for sure

[12-Sep-18 04:17 PM] ryman112#0068
Kmd 93 cents.  Damn.  Im not supposed to but I have to buy more lol

[12-Sep-18 04:22 PM] ryman112#0068
If it went to 10 cents I would sell my vette and buy a shit ton

[12-Sep-18 04:33 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
@jl777c can komodo ever reach the top 10 and be ranked in the multibillion dollar category of crypto?

[12-Sep-18 04:34 PM] coinr#7073
Is that a real question?

[12-Sep-18 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
only time will tell

[12-Sep-18 04:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, $5B easy

[12-Sep-18 04:52 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i just cant tell if thats even important for KMD to reach goal

[12-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Marketcap in se cant be a goal. The goal should be tech/features/adoption. Price will follow.

[12-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(In rational markets)

[12-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD has never gotten respect tbh

[12-Sep-18 05:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Litterboxeum was treated like it was pure gold

[12-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everyone packed the ICOs

[12-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúGround floor baby!  Fuckin lamboz here we come!‚Äù

[12-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúKmd, fuck that it‚Äôs already pumped‚Äù

[12-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
.. but you bought an impossible promise

[12-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúBlah blah bro, you‚Äôre just jelly, get onboard while you still can, we x10 already, we going x1000‚Äù

[12-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Someone tell me some positive news

[12-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs impossible to go to zero

[12-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We can approach it, but never actually hit it

but I guess 1/tech... so its bad news?

[12-Sep-18 05:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yes

[12-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Thanks for trying though @jl777c üòÇ

[12-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Will CC‚Äôs be a part of bdex 2.0 engine?

[12-Sep-18 05:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
who cares about mgwCC? it just solves a major issue, so that CC can be used for more things :trollface:

[12-Sep-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
assets CC already allows for an onchain DEX

[12-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
with gatewaysCC we can tokenize KMD and other bitcoin protocol coins onchain (any assetchain)

[12-Sep-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
with pegsCC we can create a KMD sidechain

[12-Sep-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
even without pegsCC, it will be possible to create a pricesCC that allows for leveraged long/short betting on BTC prices settled in KMD, since we have oraclesCC

[12-Sep-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
all this mostly done and almost in testing in the last few weeks. also training several potential CC devs as I can only do about 1 CC per week

It is written

[12-Sep-18 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
that returns the rekt bets

[12-Sep-18 05:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It will be done

[12-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so there has been quite a lot of significant progress at the fundamental capabilities level

[12-Sep-18 05:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
KMD is one step from being able to support a FOREX DEX (in its traditional state)

[12-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the market is just doing what markets do, best to ignore if for now

[12-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes with pegs CC, a forex dex can be done

[12-Sep-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
settled in KMD

[12-Sep-18 05:13 PM] snowdamn#2414

I tried several times in the past to write arbitrage bots, but somehow was too stupid...

[12-Sep-18 05:16 PM] LocoMB#8593
but come to think about it, it seems as writing arbotrage bots is a nasty business, and most of them fail for some reason, mostly fringe errors- so that makes me feel a bit better

They dont even buy the eth first is technically wrong, as you sell eth, so in se someone is buying first to open your short
