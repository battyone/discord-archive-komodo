Malcom turdfalls wife was a board member of some Med company and most of the mandatory vaccines were brought in when he was the unelected PM

[02-Nov-18 03:06 AM] ryman112#0068
As a Adult I never get vaccinated and I can say I haven't been sick in 10 years or so.  Common cold stuff for a day runny nose etc but nothing to whine about

[02-Nov-18 03:07 AM] ryman112#0068
There are over 200 strains onf the flu and the vaccine only helps the most prevalent one that year with about a 13 percent success rate.  No thanks

Also how I ended up doing 130 in a 55 (mph) looking for an unlit area to “evacuate” myself

Here only old people and healthcare professionals get flu shots

[02-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you are healthy most flu strains are just a pain in the ass and you will feel pretty sick for a week or so, but your body will get better on its own

[02-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Other vaccines are mandatory for kids like measles/chicken pocks or whatever these are

[02-Nov-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And just have your kids take them, they litterally save lives.

[02-Nov-18 08:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the fact flue vaccines are not mandatory proves medical companies are not so powerful as people think, and anyway the power comes from same people sponsoring them by buying so called suplements - a multibillion $ market of fake medicine

[02-Nov-18 08:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I bet not many of you know that creation of new antibiotic for some desease cost can be about 1billion EUR

[02-Nov-18 08:54 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
When knowing it's such a huge investment no wonder they want to make big money on medicine, you also would charge a lot for such

[02-Nov-18 08:57 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
It's new tech as well as cybernetics, quantum computing and so... There are old cemeteries full of people from the era before vaccinations.

[02-Nov-18 08:57 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
The other side of it is that knowadays everything get commercialized faster and stronger. Hence we trust pro scientists less. But we have no other choice, maybe just find more trusted professionals to listen to.

[02-Nov-18 08:59 AM] Meyse#0952
its a myth that some medicines cost 1B eur or whatever, there are no numbers to back this up, or they refuse to give out numbers

[02-Nov-18 09:01 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
research can be expensive in any area

3. Cost of developing a new antibiotic and resulting estimated net present value (eNPV) − base case
Our assumptions for the base case model (i.e., with no incentives) R&D costs and eNPV are shown in Table 1. The estimated global cost of developing a new, targeted antibiotic, excluding the post launch study, was calculated at $1581 million (at 2011 US prices), which is similar to that of Mestre-Ferrandiz et al. [17]. Pre-clinical R&D contributes the greatest share of the capitalised development cost as (i) a large number of projects need to be initiated at this stage due to low probability of progression and (ii) from the long time remaining to drug licensing impacts the cost of capital.

Drugs typically take 12 years from the initial discovery stage to reach the market, and while estimates of costs vary, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry puts it at £1.15bn per drug.

Drug development is highly resource-intensive and expensive with only one in 5,000 medicines making it to the market – this is how it works

nah i dont, just things i heard in documenteries etc. universities/hospitals actually do all the research for new medicines/treatments and then the pharma industry just takes it over for a small fee and ask crazy prices for it. im exaggerating a bit ofc
