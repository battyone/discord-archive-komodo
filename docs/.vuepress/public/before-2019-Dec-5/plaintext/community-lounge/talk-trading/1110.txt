yes

[04-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
im not sure which side started it but there was a lot of attacking back going on between K64 and redfox

[04-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if K64 is a scam, im sad, but if they arent a scam im almost even more sad because that would mean that the komodo community attacked one of its most promising projects

[04-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if they can eventually come out with solid evidence and prove their claims (funding, etc), i hope the komodo team will mend fences

redfox and K64 are ecosystem projects

[04-Sep-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo itself tries to stay neutral on these matters, but when baseless accusations come, we have to set the record straight

[04-Sep-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
believe the team that has delivered the advanced tech for many years, or believe K64, it is your choice

Bitcoin benny is involved in kmd and redfox

[04-Sep-19 08:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
So kmd is not neutral

[04-Sep-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
having people involved in different things, dont make the different things the same. in any case, all redfox did was help K64 during the early days, they entered a contract and werent paid. those facts were posted.

[04-Sep-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
we have many contributors to komodo, sometimes they disagree. does that mean that komodo disagrees with itself?

[04-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its unfortunae that it all spilled out so openly in this case

[04-Sep-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alexfrog as soon as there is ANY evidence that K64 has such funding, then we can certainly acknowledge that fact. as of now, there is no such evidence. that is a fact

[04-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes i understand

[04-Sep-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
let us stick with facts as we can debate unsubstantiated claims forever and they will still be unsubstantiated

the math of BTC Dominance:  70.5%
it continues to squeeze all the altcoin prices, until that reverses, there cant be any altseason. in the meantime, i guess it makes for stress and dramas

[04-Sep-19 09:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dwy website is really chaotic lol

[04-Sep-19 09:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not really sure of the point he is trying to make

really, how much more of a governance is needed for 99% of things?

[04-Sep-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the 1% that isnt a technical issue, those would be up for some sort of voting process

[04-Sep-19 09:23 AM] Lumbi#8378
I have been thinking a lot about governance lately... anarchy is a paradox.

[04-Sep-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
bugs are bugs, if a PR fixes a bug, it makes sense to merge it

[04-Sep-19 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
in my opinion, it isn't so much for the governance itself. it is more for the outsiders (maybe even insiders) to see what's going on inside

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jorian#4555
as well as have a clear statement about a decision

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jorian#4555
discord talks get lost so fast

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the whole "governance" thing probably came about when BTC legacy devs politicized increasing the blocksize so they can push through segwit and LN

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i decided that 75% should get 75%

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
when politics invades into the code, that is when all the governance talk

[04-Sep-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
keep politics out of the code

[04-Sep-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
use math to resolve things whenever possible to do so

[04-Sep-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
reduce the things that governance is needed for

[04-Sep-19 09:28 AM] rainbro7#4735
Yes please

[04-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it is when devs deviate from the math based decisions (like, gee 1MB is too small, lets increase it to 2MB) that governance is needed

[04-Sep-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know when komodo deviates from such common sense math stuff

IMO governance does not fully (edited) equal decision making. Decision is needed when you have a situation such as this:
- "this thing" is possible to do - Fact
- Should "this thing" be allowed to be done? - Decision needed
- If NO, we need a fix to prevent "this thing" being done - Decision needed
- If Yes, should we do "this thing" (Komodo Team), what will be the +/-  - Decision needed based on the goals and vision of the team.

- If Yes, WHO should be able to do "this thing" - Governance and open discussion  needed - NOW we are going 'outside'

but why is KMD in the top 10 gainers ?

[04-Sep-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
with all this externally created controversy, shouldnt it be in the bottom 10?

If you are talking about the big reward mining, k64 and redfox, yeah played over and over

[04-Sep-19 10:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
People are shooting themselves in the foot by wasting Jame's time where he could be coding and their own time by not doing the community marketing they should do

[04-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
agreed

[04-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if there is hard evidence of any of the bullets in the mail type of stuff, let alone k64 funding, please share, if not, stop beating a dead horse

[04-Sep-19 10:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I agree, still like always, a lot of new tech to complement tech already working with kmd is being developed and i see little discussion about that and a lot of drama over old/finalized topics

[04-Sep-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
People think they cannot change the market sentiment but it only takes 1 post that someone sees that might want to buy into KMD

[04-Sep-19 10:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The sum of all these little efforts will bring more in the way of awareness than any big marketing stunt

[04-Sep-19 10:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We should all be focused on that, we can all contribute in different ways, it may be you shitpost on twitter that gets attention or post memes on reddit, it does not matter

It is the snow ball effect. A single snow flake causes avalanches

[04-Sep-19 11:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
Dwy's website is great for KMD. Also, Dwy broke a code by making that website, the code of privacy between KMD developers and their private messages. This transgression will not be forgotten

👌 🤔 🤦 🌧 

[04-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Neko#5830
I hope k64 is not a scam, I find the idea interesting but komodo's instance has  been perfect and will set the tone for future projects be more careful, better safe than sorry

[04-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I fail to see how his website is great for KMD

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alexfrog all free advertising is good advertising

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i guess

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
Honestly, as somebody who was involved with this "debacle" for months, the website is a really shitty summary of it

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
And boring

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
and nobody will read it, except a few KMD haters

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
and people who already hate jl777

[04-Sep-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
so Dwy gave them some ammunition. All that will do is get people talking about KMD

[04-Sep-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds good for us

[04-Sep-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
the website is also "tactless"

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, as an outsider, why would I trust that website? Written by a "defector" that will say anything for attention. Smart people will realize that it's not very "trustable" information

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
and hence, it will be mostly ignored

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i wasnt aware of the debacle before, my impression of it is that some NNs were undermining in order to capture big reward blocks when they detected them, thus gaining more rewards than 'fair'.  And jl777 changed things to make NNs get only 75% of rewards again, as they should.  And dwy didnt like the solution (I dont understand why?), and that people have threatened him.

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, amazingly, there is no murder or crimes. It's all just drama

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
nothing interesting at all happened

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
The thing thats sad about it is that someone who was useful to komodo development is no longer contributing

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
just a bunch of devs yelling into their keyboards for 3 months, and finally we had to pay Dwy to leave because he ruined the productivity of the entire team

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
this was after he begged to be paid to leave, and could not find somebody to buy his nodes

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
I offered, with permission of James, but then he got all offended, like I offered to buy his wife

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
These are the boring facts.

[04-Sep-19 12:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
Scam or not, gaming is an incredibly difficult thing to do right.   Even if K64 is legit, the likelihood of them making a decent game with decent marketing is abysmally small. I haven’t researched the team members backgrounds, but unless they have some big wigs from Activision or EA in their ranks, the odds of success are very, very remote.

[04-Sep-19 12:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
The budget and manpower needed to create a game that is even found in a budget bin in GameStop is amazing.

[04-Sep-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
Amazing that k64 is still a thing
