Mandatory wallet upgrade....what does that mean for me having mine on a ledger nano locked away?

[27-Nov-18 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it means that you need to move to a non-proprietary wallet or wait until ledger upgrades

[27-Nov-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ledger should update in time

[27-Nov-18 05:45 PM] ryman112#0068
Its kind of a pain for me to go get this thing.  So basically before dec. 15th I need to travel back to my home town and get this thing and update it?

[27-Nov-18 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, you need it to use it to get rewards anyway
if not grabbing rewards, you can update whenever you next use it

[27-Nov-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless there's a transparent address update that I missed

[27-Nov-18 05:53 PM] ryman112#0068
Im out of town working and didn't bring it with me so I suppose Ima make a special trip lol

[27-Nov-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you need to update it before you use it?

[27-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
presumable it all happens server side at ledger HQ

[27-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so you wont have to do anything special, let alone travel home to get it. if you arent going to do any transactions, why would you need to update anyway? even if you ran a full node, there is no need to update before you need to do transactions

[27-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and using a ledger is basically using a lite mode wallet, where the real nodes are maintained by ledger

[27-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so let ledger update, use the ledger next time you use it

[27-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
why is this a pain? to do nothing

[27-Nov-18 05:55 PM] ryman112#0068
Thanks @jl777c

[27-Nov-18 05:57 PM] ryman112#0068
It is certainly not a pain now that I understand.  Not that I wouldn't enjoy seeing family.

[27-Nov-18 06:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
as long as your private key/seed is safe, your kmd are safe

[27-Nov-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's a pain sitting here doing nothing waiting for $100 KMD & $50k BTC! :trollface:

[27-Nov-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wants the former and not the latter_

[27-Nov-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
what if i told you the latter has to happen for the former?

[27-Nov-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$50k BTC is just stoopid

[27-Nov-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what if i told you the latter has to happen for the former?`
Then I'd tell you that crypto is doomed and we're just pissing our lives away

i like your take better

[27-Nov-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Does IBM stock need to be $4k for Apple stock to be $300?

[27-Nov-18 06:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
$100 KMD no matter what BTC does!!! 🤓

[27-Nov-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that

[27-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Vertigo#0439
When are they opening Kmd trading?

[27-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Vertigo#0439
Re opening?

[27-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Vertigo#0439
Bittrex

[27-Nov-18 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD trading is not disabled

[27-Nov-18 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
only KMD deposits and withdrawals. you can trade

[27-Nov-18 07:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
https://bittrex.slack.com/messages/C0779H5NV/ <- I bet they could know more

[27-Nov-18 07:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
digitalprice.io accepts deposits and withdrawals of kmd

[27-Nov-18 07:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For those dollar cost average traders out there :p

[27-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Hermes#6934
Is that just now...I thought they halted trading

[27-Nov-18 07:20 PM] tolken#2655
You can buy kmd on BarterDex 😉

[27-Nov-18 07:21 PM] tolken#2655
actually put it in your wallet too.

[27-Nov-18 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

i just have to call it out from time to time :/

[27-Nov-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figured folks had given up on retaining ownership of their coins and trades

[27-Nov-18 07:39 PM] tolken#2655
people love their binance.

[27-Nov-18 07:39 PM] tolken#2655
The feeling is strong, that they can do no wrong.  Who needs priv keys when someone can handle it for you? 😛

[27-Nov-18 07:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Who needs priv keys when someone can handle it for you?`
I shit you not, someone asked the other day if the could have the PIRATE pool pay direct to their dp deposit addy 🤦🏽

[27-Nov-18 07:41 PM] tolken#2655
I’ll keep shilling BarterDex, despite its unfortunate state. I believe in the team, I’m just impatient 😛

[27-Nov-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX now is like the apple lisa. we need to wait for the macintosh

nah, BarterDEX at least works 😛

[27-Nov-18 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
binance is also working on their own dex

[27-Nov-18 08:13 PM] tolken#2655
Another  “DEX” with KYC?

[27-Nov-18 08:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
let's wait and see what kind of dex is binancedex

[27-Nov-18 08:14 PM] tolken#2655
Don’t think we have any other choice.

[27-Nov-18 08:17 PM] barv#0867
Their first demo was an on chain dex @PHBA2061 , but I saw too little to draw conclusions

[27-Nov-18 08:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, it's still too early to jump into conclusion, let's just wait

[27-Nov-18 08:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
their advantage is having million of users

[27-Nov-18 08:36 PM] Acura#2748
My last info was that the DEX of Binance must be able to do the following: Token burn, freeze token, and some other technical things.
Then I was a bit surprised what the freezing of coins has to do with a Dex.

[27-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Acura#2748
So in my opinion, there will be KYC or a centralized middlemen for such things

[27-Nov-18 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Another “DEX” with KYC?`
as long as people want fiat involved, that's pretty well going to happen every time

#ETH/ETCsplit

[27-Nov-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's that whole 'we want it all immutable! (unless we want it mutable)' thing

[27-Nov-18 09:24 PM] barv#0867
There are different levels of being decentralised. BarterDEX is totally decentralised and Binance will probably be less. But less then BarterDEX is still more then they are now.

[27-Nov-18 10:40 PM] Hegelian#0018
Does the coinmarketcap barterdex show the entire volume?

[27-Nov-18 10:40 PM] Hegelian#0018
Of hyperdex and barterdex?

[27-Nov-18 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Confusing as it may be, HyperDEX and BarterDEX (GUI) are just GUIs for the BarterDEX system, so the answer is : 'it should'

[27-Nov-18 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
except not all the coins traded on barterDEX are tracked by CMC...

[27-Nov-18 11:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that
my answer was assuming that the question meant the volume of a given tracked coin
as far as the *entire* bartedex volume, the answer is likely: no, because that would involve tracking every combination of every known usable coin

[27-Nov-18 11:23 PM] Vertigo#0439
Jl777c Do you know why deposit and withdrawal suspended?

[27-Nov-18 11:24 PM] Vertigo#0439
I really want to deposit on my wallet my new coins for my 5.1%

[27-Nov-18 11:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Vertigo you'd have to ask whatever exchange you're talking about

[27-Nov-18 11:25 PM] Vertigo#0439
Bittrex

[27-Nov-18 11:29 PM] PHBA2061#2530
probably because of the sapling update

Too many redirect it says blocked by Google

[27-Nov-18 11:56 PM] Take Bread#8113
I've been getting "too many redirects" on the website all day. Thought it was a local issue, was gonna try to troubleshoot later

[27-Nov-18 11:57 PM] Take Bread#8113
@Vertigo #talk-general has our answer 😉

[27-Nov-18 11:59 PM] Vertigo#0439
OMG no deposit or withdrawal website is down. James exit scamming catch him!

With the new fork does that mean kmd will be verus  PoS or asset chains can pick up verus PoS?

[28-Nov-18 05:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe asset chains may be able to choose which algo and PoS/PoW options. My understanding is that KMD itself will still be equihash.
