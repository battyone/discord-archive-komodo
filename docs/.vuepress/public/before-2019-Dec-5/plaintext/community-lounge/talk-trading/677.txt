Man I wanted to get more ARRR but price went up so fast... I get paid tomorrow...

[24-May-19 12:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
Did some stupid thing on Coinbase now I been waiting 4 days for my $100 to clear...

[24-May-19 12:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
Instead of buying BTC straight bought USD coin and it takes 4 days to clear...

[24-May-19 12:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doh

[24-May-19 12:54 AM] LeshAft9#0083
did/will Komodo DEX support atomic swaps with XMR? I guess I'm not clear if it's possible

[24-May-19 12:57 AM] JimD#9272
MATIC still good buy or should I just get more KMD at this point ?

[24-May-19 01:09 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so ive been running Agama on lite mode this whole time, for KMD
at what point shld i do a native mode? Is there any advtange to doing so if im just holding the coins, and not engaging in any z-transactions?

[24-May-19 01:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you want to use ARRR yes.  
Pirate chain has nearly 1,000 active nodes in the last 3 days.   Almost 3x that of zcash.  
These nodes help strengthen the network as well as allow you a more private output for your send transactions.

[24-May-19 01:22 AM] Alecandro#1179
So once you hold ARRR, you need to run native mode in order to send ARRR?

[24-May-19 01:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[24-May-19 01:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[24-May-19 01:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How much work it would take to make it possible?

[24-May-19 01:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have no idea

[24-May-19 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
sit on your butt and wait for zcash to do it

[24-May-19 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
not much work at all

[24-May-19 01:38 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so once ive done the sync up for the blockchain on PirateOcean, does that mean ive synced to KMD as well? or would i still need to undergo the 20 hr process of syncing that chain up in native mode

[24-May-19 01:38 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
in agama

[24-May-19 02:03 AM] Alecandro#1179
Hey guys so can someone dm me regarding Agama wallet issues?

[24-May-19 02:05 AM] Alecandro#1179
I can do it on a Mac as well right?

[24-May-19 02:11 AM] mobipoi#5774
WTB Dex ,  Dm if interested

[24-May-19 02:13 AM] Alecandro#1179
Disregard got it working. Only question is once Native mode for ARRR completed and chain downloaded, if you close the wallet, does it have to download every time?

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it would have to update to the latest block everytime you open the wallet

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Alecandro#1179
Okay, gocha so the first time is the worst

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Alecandro#1179
Next question. How long does it take for a pirate withdrawal to show up in Agama wallet?

[24-May-19 02:28 AM] Alecandro#1179
From digital price?

[24-May-19 02:29 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I've never bought pirate from DP , so others can chime in üòÑ

[24-May-19 02:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
What‚Äôs the app you use to trade ARRR called again?

[24-May-19 02:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I bought privately from team member earlier this year

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but you can buy from app https://app.barterlly.io/

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Alecandro#1179
That‚Äôs it. Thank you!

[24-May-19 02:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

it is to show the address is yours or watch only address

if ismine = true , it is yours

[24-May-19 02:41 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if iswatchonly = true , then it's not yours

[24-May-19 02:43 AM] Alecandro#1179
Anyone in here know how long it takes for a withdrawal to show up from DP?

[24-May-19 02:43 AM] Alecandro#1179
It‚Äôs been about 20 mins already

[24-May-19 02:46 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
has the TX been generated?

[24-May-19 02:47 AM] Alecandro#1179
On DP it says status- completed, transaction has ‚Äú...‚Äù confirmations ‚Äú-‚Äú and shows the time

[24-May-19 02:48 AM] Alecandro#1179
So no, it shows no txid

[24-May-19 02:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I read on DP discord , some withdrawals took 2 hours

[24-May-19 02:51 AM] Alecandro#1179
Oh shit okay, it‚Äôs just slow then. No worries. Thanks buddy

is there any logical reason for binance to need 120 confs on KMD deposits?

dPoW? Never heard of it before

[24-May-19 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
back then it was because of Bitmain releasing some powerful miners

[24-May-19 08:43 AM] jorian#4555
which could lead to 51% quite easily, iirc

[24-May-19 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah all equihash coins got em

[24-May-19 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bittrex is 20 or 30 I think, even without dpowconfs

[24-May-19 08:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from general blockchain rules set, it's good to have 120 conformations for a cryptocurrency to accept securily deposited to an exchange. good enough about of confirmations to count as non-reversible to some extent, to get some level of security satisfaction, depending on that cryptocurrency's network hashing power securing it.
KMD solved that issue of trusting the confirmations of that too long by second layer of Bitcoin hash power security via dPoW consensus rules, for that reason any exchange can just chose to confirm the transaction only after 1 to 2 confirmations and consider them irreversible.
But even after requested an exchange don't change their confirmation times to small number, what else a person can do.

binance confirmations logic isnt using the dpowconfs, and they dont have logic to detect notarizations

[24-May-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the latest version will fix that, but from what we see, it is rawconfirmations they are using

KMD keeps dozens of coins secure

[24-May-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
with such a timeframe, there is no practical chance to mess with non-notarized blocks, most (all?) the other exchanges automatically use the dpowconfs, so they wait for notarization. without any way to extract hacked funds, KMD has a very small target surface

[24-May-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
all the complaining wont change the fact that security MUST come first

[24-May-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
now, we made some changes so that it is possible with latest version, binance will automatically use the dpowconfs. in that case, we can recommend them to reduce to 3 confirmations

[24-May-19 09:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
3 dpow confirms or raw confirms?

[24-May-19 09:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That would be so nice, could make kmd a viable alternative to bch or ltc for example to transfer funds from one exchange to another
