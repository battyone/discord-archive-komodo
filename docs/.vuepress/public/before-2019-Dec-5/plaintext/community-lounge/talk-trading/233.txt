that's some small fishing coming in in comparson

[19-Oct-18 12:50 PM] BlockTech#6895
I think it's just the whale splitting his wall.

[19-Oct-18 12:51 PM] BlockTech#6895
He saw that putting a 750k wall nobody was selling to him, so he probably started to make small ones because every time one 10k wall desapear, another wall bigger appear.

[19-Oct-18 12:55 PM] BlockTech#6895
I've been following his walls a lot, and it got from 900k to 750k without any sell at the price where the wall was, but only on the smaller order (10k)  just above the wall were filled, and when they were filled, the big wall changed again and was 50k smaller, and small walls appeared again over it.

[19-Oct-18 12:56 PM] BlockTech#6895
But i'm maybe wrong ^^ my imagination playing with me üòÑ

whale seems to have deep dived to 18k

[19-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
what does this mean?

to me, it confirms my suspicions that I must order sushi this evening üç£ üòã

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Two things. Bitcoin is going to take a shit and bring everything with it or... bitcoin will rocket making 18k be worth more than what it is now.

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c it's kinda weid, tradingview says there is a wall at 18k, but it doesn't show on binance live charts. I think tradingview shows old info

[19-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Bittersweet#9376
It will either go up, or down

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I change the decimals displayed to see the deeper stuff.

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Bet on this

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
144 BTC in the 18ks at 5 decimales

[19-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
whale is so deep we cant see it clearly

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i do too, doesn't show for me O_O

[19-Oct-18 01:18 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I still say that wall is not the only bitcoin he's buying with.

can anyone see the whale in the actual orderbooks on binance? tradingview tells me that there is 1 mio at 18ksats. But I don't see that on the binance view.

[19-Oct-18 04:55 PM] cipi#4502
yes, it is there... change the decimals to 5 and you will see it

[19-Oct-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@ 5 decimals, I'm only seeing 15k at 18k sats

[19-Oct-18 05:16 PM] cipi#4502
i see 790k at 18k

[19-Oct-18 05:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@cipi that's the thing. I don't see it, even when changeing the decimals üòõ
