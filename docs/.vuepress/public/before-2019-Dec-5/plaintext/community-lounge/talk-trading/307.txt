[26-Nov-18 01:16 PM] house#8741
Hmmm, commercial law would be applicable to crypto ?

[26-Nov-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
imo, a lot of it is
and contract law (depending on the situation and judge)

[26-Nov-18 01:18 PM] house#8741
Right. Equity law should be the overriding principle for crypto

[26-Nov-18 01:18 PM] house#8741
Ok, that makes sense

[26-Nov-18 01:28 PM] DrKush#8774

reliance on others for life's essentials is a slippery slope

[26-Nov-18 01:37 PM] DrKush#8774
duniter makes crypto creation other than by mining;)

and many people for some reason are eager for more wall street participation in crypto...

[26-Nov-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
imo, those that want wall street involvement is because they can't imagine a world where crypto currency stands on its own and they can't let go of "traditional" banking theories
>A viable means of exchanging value that doesn't revolve around the wealthy and/or governments? what madness is this?

[26-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the next rally will start when the ETF's will be approved. It's the perfect narrative for another big run up.

[26-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I saw a video of fatketoshi drinking scotch saying he was selling BTC until it was under $1000 ...

[26-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If he really is satoshi ....

he cannot sell for ever

[26-Nov-18 03:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
the trend deff looks manipulated / stupid to me. sideways for a couple of days then market sells and repeat. he could well be doing that

[26-Nov-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Him or its soemone else and hes just claiming it is him, for ego or something.

[26-Nov-18 03:47 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah that aswell

[26-Nov-18 03:48 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
seems too prolonged to be mass panic selling , someone is most defiantly market selling when they feel like it

[26-Nov-18 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would have thaught everyone who would panic sell, would have done so by now... There was ample opertunity to exit at a reasonable price.

[26-Nov-18 03:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah exactly, there would most certainly be a rush for the exit. but it wouldn't last this long imo

[26-Nov-18 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He claims to have more BTC than Wu and Ver

[26-Nov-18 03:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yup he is not satoshi 100% but i reckon he has / had a nice bag

[26-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[26-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he wouldnt crash the whole space

[26-Nov-18 03:51 PM] Cassius#9158
Well, he's all in to make SV a success

[26-Nov-18 03:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Unless he has some major backing from corperations who will build in SV ... that no one knows about ... this is the worst way he can go about making bitcoin the reserve world currency.
