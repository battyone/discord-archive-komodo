I noticed KMD and many other alts didn't seem affected with the last two minor BTC dumps. I'm hoping it's now the alts turn to move up.

mktcap of btc is the only one that matters, maktcap of abbc coin vs energi or whatever is people rearranging deckchairs on the titanic.
 bitcoin hits 10k, alts bleed a bit more, then everything gets bought back up, wait for it....

last BTC sale was fro 700k sats... what is so funny?

last I sold was for 0.015 BTC per...

[01-Jul-19 06:12 PM] Oriol02#9169
I bought some days ago Supernet for 20KMD each

[01-Jul-19 06:13 PM] jansako#3330
sure thing, the offers are all over the place...

[01-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jansako#3330
I would say the spread is somewhere 10-55 right now

[01-Jul-19 06:17 PM] dan.#2473
55? eh

[01-Jul-19 06:18 PM] jansako#3330
it was just a fraction that sold yesterday @700k sats

[01-Jul-19 06:18 PM] dan.#2473
yeah thats the thing. its low vol and no one knows about this yet. in bdex days the price got pounded on whenever there was liquidity

[01-Jul-19 06:19 PM] jansako#3330
it'll come back again... good ol' days of $300+ per 😃

[01-Jul-19 06:19 PM] dan.#2473
it could, sure.

[01-Jul-19 06:20 PM] dan.#2473
id wager itll be more than that in fiat terms

[01-Jul-19 06:21 PM] jansako#3330
highest I have seen was 40+ KMD/SN when KMD was pushing $10

[01-Jul-19 06:21 PM] jansako#3330
lowest was like 6-8 KMD I think...

[01-Jul-19 06:22 PM] jansako#3330
or sub- 100k sats on Polo :troll_hardcore:

[01-Jul-19 06:26 PM] dan.#2473
dont wanna start up the whole debate again, but all those assets need liquidity and markets, but they take a beating whenever there is so its a catch 22

[01-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jansako#3330
I think Barterrly helps with the liquidity, and there always was some OTC trading. I found that I was always able to rebuy if I got luck to sell into one of the "pumps" (not really a pump, just someone buying more than say 50 at a time 😃

BTC going to 6K

[01-Jul-19 06:39 PM] JimD#9272
for some reason when it makes big moves up I see articles telling my BTC to 30K in 90 days and now I see BTC to 6K on days when its down

[01-Jul-19 06:39 PM] JimD#9272
sometimes I think the financial press is filled with shills

[01-Jul-19 06:40 PM] JimD#9272
say it aint so

[01-Jul-19 06:47 PM] jansako#3330
press = shills (Disclosure: I am a former PR manager). Different media just shill for/against different things 😃

We can also notice from the chart above how KMDBTC touched the support level back from March 2017. We can also see that a strong bullish wave followed the bounce from this support.
