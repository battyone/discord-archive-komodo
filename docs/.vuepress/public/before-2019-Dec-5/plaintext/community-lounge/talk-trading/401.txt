within 30 minutes on binance was sold 35k kmd. pressure continues

[06-Feb-19 03:37 PM] Alecandro#1179
someone's got 21btc in buy orders at 17k

[06-Feb-19 05:41 PM] Markus#5464
its whalebro

[06-Feb-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah he is pushing price down

[06-Feb-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so he can buy the new orders on the way up again

[06-Feb-19 06:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
its the method whalebro used last months of last year

[06-Feb-19 06:27 PM] PTYX#6840
What if the whale bro is a whale sister?

It def could be a whale sis....

[06-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if whalesis I would be fine with that

[06-Feb-19 08:02 PM] jspook16#3059
There were quite a few sisters that capitalized on the last bull run. To me they seem to take profits more efficiently. I just let it run...straight into the ground

[06-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Alecandro#1179
Next time will be different :troll_hurt:

[06-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
I just took my first ever Vitamin D supplement and

[06-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
I feel it in my head

[06-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253
so it does do something

[06-Feb-19 09:11 PM] jspook16#3059
Next time... I may let it run to 20 USD :troll_thuglife:

"whalesis" 🤦🏽 ffs, as if "whalebro" wasn't silly enough 🙄

[06-Feb-19 09:38 PM] yorklab#7270
Someone just dump into the whale's bid; he's no longer a whale.

[06-Feb-19 09:39 PM] yorklab#7270
Maybe a baby whale.

[06-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Lieutenant#1428
any other coin when a purchase order of 100btc or more +10 +20% but no kmd. 
А couple of months ago whalebro easy bought (no price increase) several million kmd. it's unbelievable.

someone with that much komodo could surely suppress prices easily if they wanted to though, right?

[06-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what if that is what they have been doing

[06-Feb-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Absent the firm belief that it will dip to 16.5, I can't understand who doesn't sell at 18.5 but decides to dump at 17.5 😕

[06-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Alecandro#1179
yes exactly, dumb

[06-Feb-19 09:48 PM] Alecandro#1179
makes no sense

hmm maybe we double bottom at 13.5k?

[06-Feb-19 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤔 TA done with Crayon, it must be accurate

[06-Feb-19 10:10 PM] yorklab#7270
I've seen these spikes down before on XRP, it never really set the direction; just an anomaly. Maybe someone just needed out now and saw an opportunity...........or it could be because I bought a few days ago, that usually causes a dip.

[06-Feb-19 10:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To pass on to CryptoBridge considering doing what CoinBene did?

[06-Feb-19 10:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Steve Lee any links you prefer me to use?  They're asking.

[06-Feb-19 10:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks for the DM 👍

[06-Feb-19 11:29 PM] yaheardme#2938
imho I only see kmd falling to those levels if btc breaks below 32 on to 29

[06-Feb-19 11:30 PM] yaheardme#2938
however that is what it is just an opinion

How does it relate to KMD or is just info? 😊

[07-Feb-19 11:04 AM] Acura#2748
Just as an Info - maybe the market will react on the news

[07-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Acura#2748
Previous alert about bakkt is false, it's a fake website. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️

@Acura ok np will read it.

`it's a fake website`
_generally assumes that all coins/tokens/projects that have a "web site" of 1-3 pages is, at best, a scam_

[07-Feb-19 04:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Anyone know when the kmd>USD market is live ?

[07-Feb-19 04:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
on bittrex

[07-Feb-19 04:18 PM] modereck#4269
it was supposed to be today

[07-Feb-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, it's currently just after 8 am their time

[07-Feb-19 04:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That makes sense then Genie they are on the opposite side of the "flat plane" to me 🤣

[07-Feb-19 04:56 PM] modereck#4269
KMD volume increasing...

[07-Feb-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
USD pair might bring some new money

[07-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Alecandro#1179
i hope so!

[07-Feb-19 06:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Bitcoin Benny - Yes.   I sent KMD pages on dPoW and discussed directly the reasons and exchange would want the coins they list to be covered for many reasons.  Confirmation times and  Security being the biggest benefits, in addition to all the work being coin team side and not exchange side.

[07-Feb-19 06:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I ran an exchange... 
"10 btc listing fee and security deposit without dPoW, 2 BTC with dPoW" 

😛
