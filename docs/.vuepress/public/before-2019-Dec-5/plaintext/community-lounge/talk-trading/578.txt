I expect to see ZEC hashrate double again in the next few days/week

[24-Apr-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
as Z11's turn on

[24-Apr-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_literally purchased S7-LNs the day before S9s were announced_

[24-Apr-19 12:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
Z11's are about 10x the hashrate of a z9m or about 2.5X the hashrate of a Z9. a9++ is similar. I expect to see the price of ZEC continue to go down as asic miners fight to decide who will break even.

[24-Apr-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
Z11 owners are getting theirs first, a9++ owners are at a disadvantage. Both will aggressively sell to try to break even

[24-Apr-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i value your opinion, does this seem plausible to  you?

[24-Apr-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I expect to see the price of ZEC continue to go down as asic miners fight to decide who will break even.`
Or it could be like BTC and become the driving excuse for a rise 🤔

[24-Apr-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
we have never seen 2 equihash asics launched at the same time, to compete

[24-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it forces miners to hodl

[24-Apr-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as dumping "to break even", I think there's a certain level of that in anyone in that equipment price range no matter what the market price does
but those, imo, are those that really couldn't afford to buy it to begin with

[24-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of miners could be mining as it is a KYC free way of buying coins

bitmain KYCs now, don't they?

[24-Apr-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[24-Apr-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
that has been for a while

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
they added that when the z9m came out, i think

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, the bulk of the hash rate is concerned with KYC issues being all up in their guts, but the bulk of miners are lemmings that would fingerprint their 1st born and give you screen grabs of a colonoscopy if it meant they'd make $2

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
after

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
definitely after

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i bought a z9m just before the cutoff for KYC-only

[24-Apr-19 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
it was during 😃

[24-Apr-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not yet

[24-Apr-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in many ways, their only dealing with BTC and only being a service hub should put them ever adding it way off into the future

[24-Apr-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"their" is possessive (which is what I wrote and meant)
"they're" is a contraction for "they are" (which isn't)

aaand back on topic... good things happening on ARRR/KMD 😄

[24-Apr-19 12:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
my portofolio is happy

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] mrlynch#5735

[24-Apr-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_arbs ARRR/BTC and ARRR/KMD because it's a non-rational movement_

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
i don't have any btc left 😦

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
and i'm not buying anymore.... last time i had a good opportunity i had to wait 47 mins for confs

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
might as well move away from btc all together

[24-Apr-19 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
plenty of fiat on-ramps and exits for kmd

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
seems a better, quicker fit

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only 47? **You're** lucky!

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
it was pre-vbk spam 😜

[24-Apr-19 12:53 PM] mrlynch#5735

[24-Apr-19 01:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
lol  no deal

[24-Apr-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when the GUI is complete, you'll be begging for that deal 😛

[24-Apr-19 01:06 PM] mrlynch#5735

[24-Apr-19 01:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh that

[24-Apr-19 01:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was wondering, who here is up to become a marketmaker for barterdex network?

[24-Apr-19 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are looking for brave people who want to become marketmakers

[24-Apr-19 01:23 PM] klein#5233
I'd be willing to put some bids at 10k sats

[24-Apr-19 01:23 PM] klein#5233

[24-Apr-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_waits to see if DP decimates the value of CHIPS like it did ARRR_

[24-Apr-19 01:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm banking on that :3040_kingpeepo:

[24-Apr-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it'd be good for newcomers, to be sure, for us long time holders, not so much 😦

[24-Apr-19 01:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
depends on what you class as `long time`

[24-Apr-19 01:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's all relative my friend

[24-Apr-19 01:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
The top 75 accounts have 95% of the coins...

[24-Apr-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since the block reward was 50 😛

[24-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Very few people knew the coin existed and even cared to buy and hold it. Doesn't surprise me that most coins are held by few wallets. It will get spread out once price goes up.

[24-Apr-19 02:00 PM] dokrates#8987
im almost ready to rebuy

[24-Apr-19 02:00 PM] dokrates#8987
a little bit more and i'll start rebuying

Seeing how the GUI is coming, I wouldn't wait too long. Maybe a few months if nothing goes bad.

[24-Apr-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_would rather lose and die as a blazing failure than buy even 1 vote_

What gui?

[24-Apr-19 02:15 PM] ch6ris#5240
such morals genie. :unicorn:

[24-Apr-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not even morals, per se; either folks think I should get the job or they don't

[24-Apr-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now, if being a NN paid $1M a year, I might change that position 😛

[24-Apr-19 02:21 PM] ch6ris#5240
Guess it might one day, highly doubt it.
