Notary operating cost burns, ICO crew, interest cashers

Selling the bottom

[02-Aug-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`seriously tho who tf sells at this price LOL`
people that bought before May 2017 or are mining if for a decent profit

[02-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000

no part of me *wants* to sell at a pseudo of $1.36, but the electric co doesn't want to hear "well the market will eventually come up and I'll have double what I have now" üò¶

[02-Aug-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and there are those that couldn't afford to be in the markets to begin with, bought in at last year's bubble, and are letting fear finally win

[02-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I should have sold 85% ago :abusedsmily:

look for $10k BTC next run up

[02-Aug-18 03:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
run up might last long

[02-Aug-18 03:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
like 2-3 months

[02-Aug-18 03:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
goal to hit $12k

[02-Aug-18 03:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
if $10k fails, we're in for a long wait

`goal to hit $12k`
@snowdamn what other delusions do you suffer from?

[02-Aug-18 03:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
delusions?  2-3 months is a long time

[02-Aug-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
There's no logic holding BTC over 4k, much less up to 12k

[02-Aug-18 03:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
oh, this is about logic

[02-Aug-18 03:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok

jl777?

[02-Aug-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
a 12k BTC price is nothing more than emotion and no tech to support it

[02-Aug-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
jl777 provides tech that is actually of value
ergo 
BTC = üí© 
KMD = üíª

[02-Aug-18 03:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, i'm here for KMD, but with the current state of crypto i can't see alts doing much with BTC < $12k.  not because i say so, but because of prior trading /volume levels

[02-Aug-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
BTC is a flaming dogshit that has no more current real-world value (other than pure hype and name recognition) than ZET

[02-Aug-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
clinging to BTC and $100k pipe-dreams is Like driving around in a Model-A Ford and telling people how it's faster, better, and safer than their new car with seat-belts, air-bags, and bumpers

[02-Aug-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
BTC is literally behind in the race for tech they invented ffs

[02-Aug-18 03:37 PM] snowdamn#2414
you're talking tech (agree), i'm talking BTC already having futures and one step before ETF

[02-Aug-18 03:37 PM] snowdamn#2414
i.e. trading

[02-Aug-18 03:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
coinfairvalue.com
Looks at usage and takes out the speculation btc at 4k; kmd at 4usd

[02-Aug-18 03:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder, notaries/miners and the likes need to sell more units of kmd or btc when price in usd is lower to cover costs, wich suppresses price

{Reactions}
üíØ ü§û ‚òù 

[02-Aug-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And I'm saying that any future BTC price is based on unicorn farts and glitter

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[02-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But with price in fiat higher, they need to sell less to cover costs

[02-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Isn't that kind of a downward spiral when prices keep dropping?

[02-Aug-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Prices keep dropping -> they need to sell more units of kmd to cover fiat costs -> price drops more -> they need to sell more units of kmd to cover fiat costs -> ...

[02-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bottom is when they turn of the miners/equipment?

[02-Aug-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@CHMEX I'd never seen that site before, but I like the BTC number they came up with

[02-Aug-18 03:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I think they have a good algo to get the speculation out

[02-Aug-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't say I agree with a $4 KMD though üò£

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at the point where your tech has outpaced granddaddy, your value should too

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe add all assets and it will be higher

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I like how Tether is 0.79$ hah

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
they give Tether ~$0.80

[02-Aug-18 03:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
do they know something we don't know?

[02-Aug-18 03:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`do they know something we don't know?`
That the USD is built on the same unicorn farts and glitter that BTC is...

[02-Aug-18 03:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
Etherum transacts all assets on top of eth KMD could be seen as transacting all assetchains on top of kmd... -„Äã value would be higher

[02-Aug-18 03:42 PM] xRobeSx#5136
good point @CHMEX

[02-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
P/E highest for KMD

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
And currently they look at kmd transactions even looking at payments would skyrocket their valuation

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
Blocktivity.info looks at payments

[02-Aug-18 03:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
anything less than $50 KMD will mean crypto is officially ‚ö∞

[02-Aug-18 03:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
so don't worry too much about it

[02-Aug-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's not dead, it's just an irrational market based on fuzzy feelings and not much more

[02-Aug-18 03:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's only $10B counting total supply in > 10 years

[02-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I could use $50 KMD right about now

[02-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then I‚Äôd have more z9‚Äôs than @ComputerGenie

[02-Aug-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
doubt that

[02-Aug-18 03:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Any reason to choose the mini over the full size?

[02-Aug-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
üòà

[02-Aug-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because mini has specs and "full size" is anyone's guess

[02-Aug-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
we still don't know that z9 actually has 4x chips the minis have

[02-Aug-18 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if it has less chips pre-OCd, then it's less value than equiv # of minis
if it has 4x chips then value difference is nominal

[02-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think they‚Äôre juicing the settings to get more

[02-Aug-18 03:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
KMD @ pseudo of $50 and you only dumping 34k will not get you above me üòõ
at a pseudo of $50, I'd be tapping my cold storage wallets

[02-Aug-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is all in and in it to win it_

[02-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tariffs fucked you up at all or did the z9‚Äôs avoid a hit

[02-Aug-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I got batch 1 before that mess and we have a month to go for batch 2, so I dunno yet

[02-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gotcha

[02-Aug-18 04:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Cryptoon Notaries cant just turn their gear off if makeing a loss...

[02-Aug-18 04:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But we can downsize our servers. etc... Myself I got my own server upfront, so its purly hosting fees... and I tell you it hurts to dump KMD at these prices to pay for that even. If I was a notary from last year... I'd be cashed up and it wouldnt matter, but i started with like 3k in capital from a stress test on BarterDEX üò¶

[02-Aug-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are  notaries losing money at these prices for sure.

[02-Aug-18 04:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I doubt those guys would be selling

[02-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@blackjok3r yeah turning of rigs wasnt meant for the notaries

[02-Aug-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
painful as it might be, the selling pressure from notaries will be a very small percentage of daily volumes

[02-Aug-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I doubt selling 500 KMD is making much diffrence.

[02-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wish I had a big piggybank so I could set up a private LP for notaries so they could sell to me instead of the 'open market'
