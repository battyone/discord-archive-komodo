in a way it has started, but it is not complete yet by any means

[19-Dec-18 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and a long ways to go

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, or combination thereof is created for an established brand with the intention of developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders.

it is not a matter of just changing the logo, though that will happen also. but if you are looking for some specific event date to time trades around, there wont be any single date, it is a process

[19-Dec-18 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
from cointelegraph:
The Bitcoin/Dollar rate is trending inside a bear flag while eyeing a potential inverse head and shoulder breakout. We have two possibilities as the pair trends ahead. The first one is a reversal that could see the pair test support near the 100-period moving average or form a double bottom at 3127-fiat in an extended selling action. The second possibility is an extended upside run towards 4414-fiat upon breaking the intermediate resistance at 4038-fiat. The latter would establish an inverse H&S while a breakout above 4414-fiat will fix the next target at 4750-fiat or less.

it seems to be saying that based on blah blah blah factors blah blah blah, the price will either go up or maybe it will go down

[19-Dec-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
The problem with most of this "analysis" is that it is just guesswork put into fancy terms, NOBODY predicted todays whale signal pumps across a lot of the crypto. Now once big capital moves, yes, there are predictable bounces and oscillations, etc., but the big moves are what makes the big changes and those are unpredictable

Vast majority lose in the end when day or swing trading, and TA is fine for having something to maybe tips odds in ones favor sometimes...  but it's best to take gains from a streak of good trading luck (that's ultimately what it is) and hold projects for long term based on fundamentals.

[20-Dec-18 03:21 AM] üõ°bstr156#5540
If I do trade, my main indicator is volume, because it isn't a lagging indicator like moving averages and whatnot.

[20-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Audo#5667
There is no set date for rebrand. We will take our time and make sure everything is finished. That is very important, let me explain why.

There are mainly two reasons why we are doing the rebrand.

#1 Repositioning the Komodo brand in the eyes of the investors / developers

> If implemented properly, a change to the positioning and brand promise of a company has major consequences for the organization. Everything is adapted in line with the organization‚Äôs new strategy and promise, its products or services, HR policy, customer contact, corporate identity, and so on. Rebranding makes this change visible for all stakeholders.

#2 Outdated Image (many outlets still say Komodo is a privacy coin)

> One of the most common reasons for undertaking a corporate rebranding project is modernization. Trends mean that over time brands come across as old-fashioned if they have not been updated. 

In other words, the Komodo technology has changed/evolved so much during the past 1-2 years that we want to reintroduce the whole thing through this rebrand.

@dokrates  why too late ? it's not about just changing the name. Better to be patient & cautious rather than doing a hasty move

bitcoin was too strong.

[20-Dec-18 11:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
It just wont die, no matter how hard they try

[20-Dec-18 11:28 AM] designer#4893
After deviating from the stage of denying Bitcoin simply because it is not commonsense, 
the public will begin to ponder on the issue related to lost coin, the amount of uncertainty about the total amount of Bitcoin. 
You will soon realize that the fact that you made worthless money is not a problem, and that the early bitcoin lost a large amount is a real problem.

[20-Dec-18 11:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
you mean like lost private keys?

[20-Dec-18 11:34 AM] designer#4893
yes.

[20-Dec-18 11:34 AM] designer#4893
dead coin

[20-Dec-18 11:36 AM] designer#4893
If it is a bitcoin that cannot be moved forever, the current bitcoin price is relatively underestimated. 
On the other hand, if Bitcoin, which was considered not to be moving, is poured out onto the market one day, prices will plunge and perhaps the vicious circle of collapse that critics have been calling for.

[20-Dec-18 11:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think that has been attempted somewhat. pure conjecture on my part though. seems like btc blockchain analysis could give some clues as to how much is lost forever but who knows. Seems hard to believe that many early adopters would not have cashed out by now, So if its been sitting for 8+ years, seems likely to be lost.

[20-Dec-18 11:50 AM] designer#4893
UTXO formed before 2011 is almost immobile. 
Most of the UTXO remain intact with 50 BTC, the amount of mining per 10 minutes at that time. 
the total amounts to approximately 2 million BTC. 
these bitcoins are likely to be permanently immobile, or dead coin. 
or it may be held by a long-term investor.

If you hardfork bitcoin and set a claim period for a new coin that seems valuable,
It's data that suggests a more specific estimate of what percentage of dead coins are actually out of long-term addresses.

[20-Dec-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
nice info, thanks @designer

daily BTC volume is about 1 million per day, so even 2 million dumped over a week wont be any giant effect, certainly not more than we have seen during the bear market selloffs

[20-Dec-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and after it is sold once (there are always buyers), it is in the hands of people with a much higher cost basis who likely wont be selling it for a 2% gain

[20-Dec-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
also, there is no death spiral as mining diff adjusts every two weeks

[20-Dec-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`death spiral` has to assume that *no one* that's bought a miner since March '17 will ever run their miner again and then add "loss" on top of that
I hope that BTC dies in 100 different ways, but that will never logically be one of them

KMD #18 of top 100 today in 24hr gains. I think being around #20 everyday with 10% gains is better than being pumped 50% and coming back down. If it can just do the +10% per day for a few weeks...

[20-Dec-18 03:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
There seems to always be that one coin to pull somewhere between 5% - 10% per day for weeks on end until it's reaches so high in the CMC ranking that people question what it is and why is it up there. Always wanted Komodo to be that coin one day.
