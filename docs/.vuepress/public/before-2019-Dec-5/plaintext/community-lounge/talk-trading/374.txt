But 2% would be a good value

[12-Jan-19 10:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
3.1415% would be even better

feel free to setup a marketmaker bot that does lots of trading

[12-Jan-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that not many people are willing to sell KMD at current prices, but also not many are in the buying mood due to overall bear market

[12-Jan-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
with mm2, we should be able to get a GUI deployable marketmaking

0/ Using UTXO age dynamics across market cycles, we attempt to time a price bottom for #Bitcoin by understanding when selling pressure from long term holders will wane. Our analysis suggests a likely bottom for $BTC in Q1‚Äô19 (see report for detail)

KMD is a steal under $2 if you go by this valuation method

[12-Jan-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
```diff
- if you go by this valuation method
+ period
```

[12-Jan-19 05:22 PM] yorklab#7270
@Tek If that site knew about all the things taking place over the next two quarters, they would have probably put a much higher value to KMD. What really stood out to me was all the transactions taking place over a 24 hr period relative most other projects.

[12-Jan-19 05:26 PM] yorklab#7270
I did a sort based on transactions and Komodo is 9th on that list.

[12-Jan-19 05:28 PM] yorklab#7270
All but one of the eight that had a higher amount of transactions have a MUCH higher market cap.

[12-Jan-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is only KMD transactions, really the total ecosystem transactions has some part of the KMD valuation

@yorklab coinfairvalue counts operations in KMD case thats payments which are higer than transactions alone. Just remember that in case somebody asks. Daily stats are on dexstats in the transaction and payment tab it also has volume and addresses used

[12-Jan-19 07:47 PM] yorklab#7270
@CHMEX when you say payments do you mean rewards?

No its basicly outputs vout above you have one transaction but if you see the output on the right side two addresses where paid so two operations. If you find a poolpayout transaction it makes more sense maybe. One transactions pays x miners.

ETC 51% attack didnt destroy much ETC value... untill we see coins loosing at least 50% value permanently due to such attack we cannot count anybody will take such threat seriously

[12-Jan-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the effect on ETC will take longer than a day

[12-Jan-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
especially since many exchanges are still not trading it, or requiring thousands of confirms
