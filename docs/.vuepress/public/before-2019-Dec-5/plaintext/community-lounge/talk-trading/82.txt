[03-Aug-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@bpkdasbaum the emotion of BTC "only" being up 16% is what happened üò£

[03-Aug-18 02:02 PM] dontrustverify#1166
This will last until the Bitcoin Dip

[03-Aug-18 02:03 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
datadash started shilling too last week ^^, but he is still cautious and waiting for the dip

[03-Aug-18 02:03 PM] dontrustverify#1166

[03-Aug-18 02:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
national cryptos are inevitable and it will be a different ball game then

Drew this a week ago, hate that it's going this way, and we are below support line :E 4th dip and rally seems highly unlikely though, usually it's just 3

[03-Aug-18 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I do love all these charts based on a manipulated happy feelz 20k BTC

[03-Aug-18 02:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
btc has the "lucky" side that apparently 6k is the bottom for miners.

[03-Aug-18 02:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
kinda thinking that if we break much lower, it will go to 5k and pull everything with it.

[03-Aug-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_still hopes that BTC drops to 16 cents and people finally let it die and declare their independence_

[03-Aug-18 02:09 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it would be nice to have independent moves, but dat first mover advantage and net effect.

[03-Aug-18 02:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'd rather see national cryptos fill the gap than see BTC at 16 cents.  then BTC will be free to find its ultimate role and perhaps become what the small blockers want it to be

[03-Aug-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
As a miner, the swings feken kill me, I can't imagine this roller-coaster from a whale perspective; Pepto must be making a fortune

go to bed all warm and fuzzy .... wake up to a loss of $600k

[03-Aug-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt a loss unless you sell, marking to market is not a good way to get good sleep

[03-Aug-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`it isnt a loss unless you sell`
I guess I need to invite you to my next stakeholders meeting, because I can't seem to explain that notion to them üòõ

[03-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it also isnt a gain until you sell

[03-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not a hard concept

[03-Aug-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
personally, I'm loving a BTC at anything over $5k; but the feelz of folks at anything *under* $20k is some wild shit to understand

[03-Aug-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
many are quite happy with BTC  $5k, they just arent the types to be posting about it

[03-Aug-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
usually the smaller the player, the louder they post

mainstream crypto is the least crypto thing that crypto can do

[03-Aug-18 02:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Where do you want crypto to go?

[03-Aug-18 02:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Or what would be the ideal outcome for you?

[03-Aug-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at that point, it will be so regulated that you will not even recognize it

[03-Aug-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
banks operate the world on a 90% vapor margin, do you **really** think that is going to just go quietly into that good night?

[03-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think people get upset over the bitcoin price even when it's up so much because they see it as the glass ceiling for alt coins. Until that changes there will always be people hating that bitcoin isn't making new highs.

[03-Aug-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Kitchen Table is a $7k "glass ceiling" really a "bad" thing? ü§î

[03-Aug-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the problem is that every one of those people wants to turn "currency" into "commodity"

[03-Aug-18 02:24 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
To them it is. Facebook could announce tomorrow a partnership with Komodo and sure, we'll get a nice pump but guess what the max marketcap can be achieved. Whatever bitcoin says Komodo can have.

[03-Aug-18 02:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
By the way, been out of the loop somewhat, any new ico planned for komodo? I realize icos have been less lately

[03-Aug-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the largest issue is that BTC wants to be a commodity and somehow the weight of that **commodity** against USD is the determining factor of **currencies** against USD üôÑ

@kickinthachickn Sell $kmd for what?  When the CEO of Binance calls it the future, you‚Äôd best take notice.  Did you take advantage of the opportunity to dump $eth at 190k sats way back when too?
