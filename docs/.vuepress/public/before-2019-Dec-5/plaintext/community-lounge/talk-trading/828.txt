And all of a sudden kmd started pumping together with btc

[23-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10x in a week?

[23-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Impossible is nothing, 60k in 2 weeks is casual.

[23-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
every alt did that at that time

Total #Altcoin Marketcap (excludes bitcoin):

Looks ready for blastoff any day now, targeting a overall 2X in value.

This would add $130 billion dollars to the total cap, $ALTS would absolutely fly at levels not seen since December 2017 / January 2018.

[23-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and then went to hell in 2018

[23-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Markus#5464
dont know if we can compare last cycle with this one

[23-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
January was fullblown altseason

[23-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we are definitely not at the same part of the cycle now

[23-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We cant compare it till the cycle is over :p

[23-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we are in early 2016 i think

[23-Jun-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
many believe the cycles are tied to halvings

also everything what comes to kmd have been improving quite alot so i would say last bull phase could be a piece of cake of what is coming if it reach the right ppl with big bags

[23-Jun-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
an unmistakable timeshift between alts and btc

[23-Jun-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and it seem the magnitude for the btc is about double the last time, we might not get the 20x price growth this cycle, but only way to know is see what happens

[23-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Alexfrog#1338
btc moves up first, then large caps, then mid caps, and down to the worst shitcoins, and when the shitcoins are all taking turns with +100%+ days, you know they are about the pull the rug out

[23-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Markus#5464
when u start to see those massive blow off top wicks then its time to get out

[23-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Markus#5464
like the kmd pump to 39k, clear sign to get out and buy back cheaper

[23-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Markus#5464

This sounds horrible to me:
- entirely new blockchain (new coin)
- implicit admission that $ZEC was never scalable, and that opt-in privacy doesn't work
- roadmap has "a lot of similarities with ETH"
- "sharding" panacea
- subsidy for ZEC foundation https://t.co/R5vLXtKOCP

Currently the "shielded pool" (anonymity set) for @PirateChain is about 30 times larger than Zcash's, even though it's pretty new and $ZEC has been around for years!
Something you might not hear at #Zcon1 . Where are the talks about increasing zaddr usage?

Zcash is lying to you when it says it needs a new protocol and blockchain because "nobody is using its private transactions":
https://t.co/mFn3GlTViU
Just look at @PirateChain , a shielded-only coin. $ZEC chooses not to do it for financial reasons. 
Their finances > your p...

If you know this then the whales would know it. I would think the whales would be getting in now. But then again, I loaded up at 17K several days and ago, now look at it.

[23-Jun-19 01:49 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, 80K sounds good to me!

[23-Jun-19 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

If this week closes at about $1.50, we will have a good confirmation that lower prices have been rejected

After all it seems like for kmd the usd price is kore important than the satoshi price
