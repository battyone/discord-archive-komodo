Our ICO is a run at election for kmd

[12-Apr-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Alright#0419

You mean we plan to raise funds by getting notaries elected, but that has nothing to do with how someone would acquire it

[12-Apr-19 02:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

also the 50% from my notary(if elected) is solely for notarization tx fees

[12-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Alright#0419
not a dev fund or anything like that

[12-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Alright#0419
the other 50% is the dev fund 😂

[12-Apr-19 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Labs ppl commit to multisig yes?

[12-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Alright#0419
going to revisit it after we have results from elections and figure out who's pledging towards it

Verus is preparing PBaaS, possible test chain launch today

[12-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“we have enhanced the Komodo crypto-conditions quite a lot in order to implement PBaaS. Verus already supports enhanced crypto-conditions, and we have advanced quite a lot since we implemented the nothing at stake solution using crypto-conditions. at this point, the Verus crypto-conditions have much more capability than their starting point. we are wondering if we should call them their own thing, as implementing PBaaS would be quite difficult without our enhancements. I am looking forward to seeing if their Python-cc system will be good for applications developers. if so, we will support that at some point as well.”

[12-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“honestly, i don't actually see any project doing what we will soon release, and it is easy to confuse all the discussion of BaaS with PBaaS, which is en extension of the core blockchain distributed consensus protocols that allows a system of loosely connected chains to function securely in a decentralized manner. I think what we are doing is very different from Red Fox Labs”

[12-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“this is actually a major development, and though I am working nonstop on it rather than explaining, we will soon be able to explain in more detail and let the world know that we have something, not just unique, but that truly advances the crypto industry and enables many new use cases”

The other thing I just noticed about the KMD daily chart is that we just bounced off the 200MA as well

[12-Apr-19 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm very weird... The amount did arrive on the exchange and is available... I guess a bug on blockexplorer.com

[12-Apr-19 08:01 PM] dokrates#8987
