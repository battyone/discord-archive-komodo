[07-Dec-18 09:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3359 is actually an average of + 0.25x every month for the last 30 months (7.46x total)

[07-Dec-18 09:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a realistic gain (albeit at the extreme high end of realistic)

[07-Dec-18 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think 30 months, might be 32 but I'm too lazy to actually look

[07-Dec-18 09:25 AM] snowdamn#2414
you mean if HODL from before 32 months ago, right?

assuming Bitmain wont give up BCH so easy - you think they will wait it BSV goes up to 200$ then cash out BSV and buy in BCH?

[07-Dec-18 11:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or Bitmain can stay neutral ?

Fundamentals no longer exist in crypto. What started as a sound movement with noble principles and genuine cause has turned into another tool for scammers, bankers and Tai Lopez’ers to make a quick buck. Do not fool yourself into thinking this is about a hedge or utopia ...

native wallet is more secure than lite wallet

[07-Dec-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but more importantly it is more reliable as it doesnt rely on external servers

[07-Dec-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
a fake SPV server can try to convince you that you received funds that you didnt actually receive

[07-Dec-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it cant take away your funds, but it could make you think you got somethiing and then you send in response to that. it would require taking over all the spv servers you are using and having yourself specifically targeted. essentially the same thing can be done to a native node via eclipse attack, but that is  harder to do

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Dec-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so i guess lite wallets are less secure in that it is easier to conduct an eclipse attack against it than a native node, not that an eclipse attack is easy to do, just easier

[07-Dec-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is more a secure vs more secure

[07-Dec-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
now if you are cross checking things locally, along with an explorer that isnt corrupted, then the eclipse attack doesnt work

Alright guys, 

I'm crying while typing this message, however I've got to leave Twitter for a few weeks. 

Currently experiencing one of the most difficult times of my life with the study struggle, which literally kills me mentally and didn't pass another one.

Take care.
