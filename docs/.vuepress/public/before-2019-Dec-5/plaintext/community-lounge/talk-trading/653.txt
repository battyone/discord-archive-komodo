How likely is it to make a bad trade during this bull market? 😄

[16-May-19 01:42 AM] Tek#5253
very unlikely

[16-May-19 01:43 AM] Tek#5253

[16-May-19 01:44 AM] Tek#5253
m ETH is mooning so fucking hard

[16-May-19 01:44 AM] Tek#5253

[16-May-19 01:44 AM] Tek#5253
I never traded this well

[16-May-19 01:45 AM] Tek#5253
i made up a lot of btc

[16-May-19 01:45 AM] richardt#2807
I miss the days when mooning meant coins going 30x-50x

[16-May-19 01:45 AM] richardt#2807
Nowadays 15-20% is considered mooning.  Sad.

[16-May-19 01:45 AM] Tek#5253
implying 20% isn'tt a moon

[16-May-19 01:45 AM] Tek#5253
50x is just absurd 😄

[16-May-19 01:46 AM] richardt#2807
it was not that uncommon years ago! haha

[16-May-19 01:47 AM] Tek#5253

[16-May-19 01:47 AM] richardt#2807
Don't trigger me, bro

[16-May-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253

[16-May-19 01:51 AM] Tek#5253
maybe I should sell out some into fiat incase buttcoin drops to 8k

[16-May-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
then I can trade everywhere

[16-May-19 01:55 AM] Tek#5253
seems like eth is going for 0.034

[16-May-19 01:56 AM] designer#4893
If exceeding $10,000 was news, it was a civilized turn of events to exceed $1. The question is, this is a new type of fish with iron cuffs, so it was not a universal sword. "Why is the price going up?" 
this will not be able to reach a helpful conclusion now, as he did five years ago. It should ask why it has been holding out for nearly nine years with more than a dollar and bite off until it gets a responsible answer. Humanistic intellectuals need more courage than knowledge or intelligence.

[16-May-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rather 1200% pumps

[16-May-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not 1200x

[16-May-19 02:05 AM] dukeleto#7326

[16-May-19 02:06 AM] Tek#5253

[16-May-19 05:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
What is sad?-> `sad to see shit like verge up so much more than kmd`

[16-May-19 05:06 AM] phm87#7395
Xvg team paid McAfee to get pumped

[16-May-19 05:25 AM] Malti#3948
Doesn’t verge have a ‘forced fanbase’? By which I mean dumb money that was lured in it by some P&D groups and now people are stuck in the coin as they don’t wanna sell for losses.. that has its network effect I guess

[16-May-19 06:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
basically

[16-May-19 06:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Its called a rekt bagholder

[16-May-19 07:15 AM] cascrypto#8206

lol- what's up? everybdoy totally bewildered by sudden lack of erratic price antics?! 🎪 
weeeelll... as ordered, so delivered: it is _totally_ erratic that there is no erratic price caprioles as expected by everyone 🤣 🤣 🤣

[16-May-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
It seems btc bull is getting a bit tired. the last jump up from the green line was very small. first time it was so small and short lived since the recent pattern started. http://159.69.45.70:8050/
I think this could mean that the whale pushes might be taking a break for now and normal TA might apply. how much it will correct... no clear idea, just guessing maybe to the low $7000 level?

[16-May-19 09:47 AM] LocoMB#8593
looks like somebody pushed the big fat 8⃣ button on the price elevator, and the service crew just put a good haulover into the whole thing .. smooth .. 'ding'

[16-May-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. large funding to push to 8000 via stairsteps using a daily frequency

[16-May-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
with so many whales having accumulated so much btc, this is just a cost of doing business

[16-May-19 09:49 AM] LocoMB#8593
ah - so the cardiologists strongly recommended using the stairs, not the elevator

[16-May-19 09:50 AM] crumb#2550
some money **might** find its way to smaller cap stuff now, but you never can tell what games are going on

[16-May-19 09:50 AM] LocoMB#8593
most alts are moderately green in BTC terms - no surprise

[16-May-19 09:50 AM] crumb#2550
let's see how long that lasts

[16-May-19 09:51 AM] crumb#2550
hopefully more than just few hours

[16-May-19 09:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
alts are like those chain smokers 🚬  now trying to catch up - let BTC wait a bit for them to catch up and have a breather

[16-May-19 09:52 AM] crumb#2550
i restrain myself from calling them alts now. thanks to ComputerGenie :abusedsmily:

[16-May-19 09:52 AM] crumb#2550
he has a good point

[16-May-19 09:52 AM] LocoMB#8593
oh I missed that- but I don't have a good feeling about the term 'alts' too- just very concise term

[16-May-19 09:53 AM] crumb#2550
i call them 'smaller cap stuff' for now.
