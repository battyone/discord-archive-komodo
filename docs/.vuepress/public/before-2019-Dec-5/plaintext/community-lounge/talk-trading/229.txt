If you can get a saving with 1% interest these days consider yourself lucky. Last time I checked it was 0.1 or some shit these days.

Sticky request, for science

It feels kinda weird though. 6k+ will already get you into the richlist 1-1000. That's not a lot of ppl, some are split adresses, some exchanges and so on. ~500 peeps on this discord.

[17-Oct-18 11:34 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Is there a visualisation of all addresses?

he transfered 30k btc that's 3 pizzas worth for him :> @Gazza

[17-Oct-18 11:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
Good questions, bpk

[17-Oct-18 11:54 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Gazza the move was on october 15th thoiugh. That's the day that we got the whick and tether panic sell into btc

[17-Oct-18 11:54 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
he might have already sold his btc and now buying back in lower

[17-Oct-18 11:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If one were to believe that satoshi on bct were *the* satoshi, BTC was never meant to have any fees for the average user until block rewards hit inflation range

[18-Oct-18 12:03 AM] Gazza#1311
@bpkdasbaum point, thanks

[18-Oct-18 12:04 AM] Gazza#1311
tether dump and pump in BTC was a complete  robbery , some bought at 7500 on binance lol

[18-Oct-18 12:05 AM] bishop#9773
@Gazza if you potentially have worthless tokens, buying something with value, even at a premium, is worth it

[18-Oct-18 12:06 AM] bishop#9773
the tether premium

[18-Oct-18 12:06 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
does tether need a matching order from another user?

[18-Oct-18 12:06 AM] Gazza#1311
hmm i was never ever fan of tether and never held money in USDT, but on that day bots went crazy and their calculations got fxxked

[18-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Gazza#1311
does tether need a matching order from another user? - what do you mean? it's not 1:1

[18-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Gazza#1311
it diped to 90 cent twice last year

[18-Oct-18 12:08 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 There is also concerns that the fees were inflated by bcash

[18-Oct-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meh, FUD

[18-Oct-18 12:09 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I mean if I want to get btc for tether, does somebody else has to buy my tether? or is that a direct trade with the exchange? since bitfinex basically owns tether.

[18-Oct-18 12:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as I'm concerned, there's no shortage of silly feks blaming BCH for the shortcomings of BTC being what Core wanted it to be

[18-Oct-18 12:10 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
If it requires a matching order from another user, some peeps bought the worthless token?

[18-Oct-18 12:11 AM] Gazza#1311
I mean if I want to get btc for tether, does somebody else has to buy my tether? or is that a direct trade with the exchange? since bitfinex basically owns tether. - good question but i don't the answer, let me check with my team

[18-Oct-18 12:11 AM] bishop#9773
you're buying from other users

[18-Oct-18 12:12 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
ugh, so someone is the sucker :L possibly bitconnect all over again. let's see a stable coin go to zero :>

[18-Oct-18 12:13 AM] bishop#9773
people have been calling for tether to die for a long time

[18-Oct-18 12:14 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
most weird and funny thing is, the moment fear sets in and ppl want to get rid of it. It still pumps BTC XD

[18-Oct-18 12:14 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
The fear was that if tether breaks, btw will break too

[18-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Gazza#1311
people have been calling for tether to die for a long time - i don't think usdt gonna die anytime soon, but volatility in USDT can drive market nuts

[18-Oct-18 12:14 AM] bishop#9773
it has to cause btc to increase........

[18-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It still pumps BTC`
That's where the whole "store of value" myth that Core regurgitates comes into play

It still pumps BTC - alts go crazy and these pumps are temporary

[18-Oct-18 12:18 AM] bishop#9773
it goes back to... if your token is worthless, you would pay a premium to someone else to get out with something of value... the person selling is banking they can profit too, but it ultimately ends with a game of hot potato with someone holding a bag of worthless shit

[18-Oct-18 12:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, there's a huge irony in the # of people that "hate" bitmain but don't realize that the fact that they take BTC as payment is a good 50% of the reason that BTC is still viable at all

[18-Oct-18 12:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
KMDICE doesnt even have 12 hours of being alive

as much as the OTC market died, neither does PIRATE 😝

[18-Oct-18 12:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
OTC market died? 😦

[18-Oct-18 12:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much, yes and reverse-greed mentality of basically giving it away isn't helping either

Problem is... as long as anyone buys that shit now they are giving profit to the institution that created it

"CME: Average Daily Volume for Bitcoin Futures Grew 41% in Q3"
this continues and we get ETF
dies out we have to wait longer

[18-Oct-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doenst more futures "bets" with less BTC volume mean more possible manipulation ?

[18-Oct-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO thats not good ... we want the volum on BTC itself

[18-Oct-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Someon wants to buy a few billion dolalrs worth of BTC price has to go up

[18-Oct-18 05:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
they only care about the price feed being dependable
the more Volume the more you can depend on it

[18-Oct-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If they can bet a fwe billion it will go down, then sell a few hundred miullion to win the bet ... seems pretty bad idea

[18-Oct-18 05:55 AM] snowdamn#2414
no idea what the cut off point is though

[18-Oct-18 06:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought ETF’s were supposed to invest in the underlying asset?

[18-Oct-18 06:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So if there is volume in etf there is volume in btc?

[18-Oct-18 06:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or was it only some etf proposals that had this?

[18-Oct-18 06:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, but that is after ETF approval
at this point, Volume is in reference to futures

[18-Oct-18 06:29 AM] snowdamn#2414
and they don't care about the Volume, they care about the price feed
