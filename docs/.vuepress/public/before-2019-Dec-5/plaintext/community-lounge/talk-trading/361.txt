13k sats with $3k BTC (40 cents) seems to be the panic sell low

[30-Dec-18 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But natural behavior for blockchains is to gain more relevance on their 3rd to 4th year

[30-Dec-18 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Look at btc, eth, dash, ltc, ...

[30-Dec-18 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
3rd to 4th year seems to be confidence years

[30-Dec-18 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Xmr too

good to see KMD raising, still I think people need a face that will talk for KMD like Zooko for Zcash, Roger for BCH, Antonopoulos for BTC or Vitalik for Eth

[30-Dec-18 09:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
someone popular doing frequent media posts and conference talk or lecture monthly

[30-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Acura#2748
good idea

[30-Dec-18 09:54 PM] zatJUM#9924
Why not create an official avatar that could "talk" for jl777? üòâ

[30-Dec-18 10:00 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
clearly JL does not want the position of offical representative and being core dev is good place he likes

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
representatives are often not core devs too

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
like Andreas and BTC

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810

somehow when I read Hollowman voice in my head allways sounds like Bender from Futurama

[30-Dec-18 10:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
didnt see him for some time here

5% is insanely good

[30-Dec-18 10:36 PM] BlackJesus#6161
realistically with banks now a days your always dealing with sub 1% as an investor unless you HAVE MONEY.

[30-Dec-18 10:37 PM] ver_User#6608
5% on an asset that fluctuates 5% in a day, or an hour, easily, is kind of hard to believe it matters to be honest... it's hard to compare to fiat IMO. 

It is of course good, but I wondered if it was coded in to inspire more holding more than anything else üòâ

[30-Dec-18 10:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it helps and definitely provides holding pressure. There isn't a fiat investment out there that can inflate itself and be liquid within a matter of  clicks... Or even spent in the invested form. (outside of credit which isn't the same thing)  edit: 24/7/365

[30-Dec-18 10:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
had to add the end for someone going to say buying a home and opening a line of equity credit on your house which is usually a terrible idea unless you know what you're doing.

[30-Dec-18 10:41 PM] bishop#9773
Try stocks... üòõ

[30-Dec-18 10:43 PM] BlackJesus#6161
added something in there for you bishop üòÉ

[30-Dec-18 10:43 PM] bishop#9773
lol

[30-Dec-18 10:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
not 7am to 3pm

[30-Dec-18 10:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
monday - friday

[30-Dec-18 10:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
5% is not insanely good, its just not really available to people who are not connected.  But believe me, the accredited investor crowd has pretty low risk ways of making 7-12%.

[30-Dec-18 10:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
being an "accredited investor" is hard to be

[30-Dec-18 10:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
i know

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its like 500k-1m income annually

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its fucking unreal

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is a net worth definition as well

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
and you have to shake alot of peoples hands in the process of obtaining it no doubt about it

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] ver_User#6608
but what exactly are you investing in?

[30-Dec-18 10:45 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It's just unrealistic unless you have money

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ver_User#6608
I don't want to invest in some fund that people tell me I get x% return, and they go and play the stock market with my money

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
when i say money I'm talking 5m net worth minimum

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
right, i agree.  Achieving 5% returns for the average person is near impossible.

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ver_User#6608
7-12% can't be possible on a balance you have access to right?

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
definitelyu

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] bishop#9773
I think CFA charterholders should automatically be accredited

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ver_User#6608
kmd is there for you to decide what you want to do whenever, so...

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
that's tied down paying dividends

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
7-12%

[30-Dec-18 10:46 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, fuck that

[30-Dec-18 10:47 PM] ver_User#6608
I can make 7-12% in one trade

[30-Dec-18 10:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
An accredited investor needs to have a net worth of over a mil not including primary residence

[30-Dec-18 10:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
lmao

[30-Dec-18 10:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
they added that last revision cause its most definitely a revision to stop "Middle class home millionaires" from investing

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ver_User#6608
so, as long as KMD stabilises one day, 5% is excellent and far superior to anything else around üòÉ

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ver_User#6608
how many years to get to 1% swings a day?

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] ver_User#6608
(normal forex swings)

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
There's tons of americans who bought houses in the 70-80's and held onto them and have homes worth 1-2.5m

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Has to beat inflation rate

[30-Dec-18 10:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
lots of trades can make 20% or more, but trades are risky.  I personally think the whole walled garden of accredited investors is to keep people who arent rich from becoming rich, not to protect poor people

[30-Dec-18 10:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So more than 7-8% a year

[30-Dec-18 10:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
it is

[30-Dec-18 10:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
the argument goes, "people without oodles of money are too stupid to make investment decisions, so we will make it illegal for them to do so... and thereby protect them"

[30-Dec-18 10:49 PM] ver_User#6608
investment also must have some risk, it's not my thing, I assume it must though... I wouldn't like to be "invested" in this stock market right now... doesn't feel like I'd necessarily get my money back if I needed it...

[30-Dec-18 10:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
because i mean come the fuck on excluding your primary residence... That's literally 90% of american middle class wealth alone!

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, but housing is in a huge bubble

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
and the powers that be know this

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
lmao

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its always in a buble

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
so they know that being a home equity millionaire isnt shit any more

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
exacltly because it doesnt qualify you to become an acreddited investor

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
To play devils advocate,  how many people bought into bitconnect

[30-Dec-18 10:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
whicch when you obtain that status your empowered to make more money

[30-Dec-18 10:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's why it exists unfortunately ,  people as a whole are dumb

[30-Dec-18 10:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Because all of a sudden your allowed to invest in UBER NETFLIX AT HE PRE SALE\

[30-Dec-18 10:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
but dumb people "should" lose their money

[30-Dec-18 10:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats the only way to learn

[30-Dec-18 10:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
the cost of an education, if you will

[30-Dec-18 10:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
if we are all incredibly wrong about KMD and it fails miserably, we should lose our investments.  and if it does great, we should earn lots of money.

[30-Dec-18 10:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its like "woah" "Your saying, now that I have money I can make more money even easier"

[30-Dec-18 10:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Welcome to the American Dream

[30-Dec-18 10:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, it is easier to make money when you have money

[30-Dec-18 10:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
and it should be

[30-Dec-18 10:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
right?  if you are playing an RTS, you need the money to build the infrastructure to make earning more money easier

[30-Dec-18 10:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
it should be a hell of a lot easier for a billionaire to earn 100 bucks than for someone with no education and zero bank balance to make 100 bucks

[30-Dec-18 10:54 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I understand where you're coming from but if this is an rts and it goes on forever eventually you run out of resources or things to do. Which is seems like we're at.

[30-Dec-18 10:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I know I use to do that. I'd play campaigns and take over the NPC cities lol and replace their gates and buildings with mine. But eventually everything is done except the last objective.

[30-Dec-18 10:55 PM] PTYX#6840
I bought bitconnect :)

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, we could get into the FED and all of that.  but it isnt capitalism that brought us to where we are, its government and government is doing what it always has done, printing money out of thin air recklessly and making a huge mess out of the economy

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] ver_User#6608
oh no @PTYX

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Sold at 100$ and kicked myself when it reached 300

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Lol

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
did you really lol.

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Ico price was 1$

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] PTYX#6840
Yea I did it based on the growth of their community over a short period of time

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I refused to be apart of that scam. I called the kettle black from day one.

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] PTYX#6840
But I didn't think it was going to be such a scam. Until the lending thing. And then I got out

[30-Dec-18 10:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Of discovering it.

[30-Dec-18 10:58 PM] PTYX#6840
when they announced it, the hype was so large around ICOs. I basically looked at their social media growth and put 1000$ on it as a gamble. I think one of my friends did too.

[30-Dec-18 10:58 PM] PTYX#6840
In any case, i was one of the lucky ones.

[30-Dec-18 10:59 PM] PTYX#6840
I remember having my doubts about the legitimacy of the team because there was none. but in those days it was normal.

[30-Dec-18 10:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's excellent man I'm glad you got out unscathed.

[30-Dec-18 10:59 PM] PTYX#6840
komodo didn't even have a team page back then.

[30-Dec-18 11:00 PM] PTYX#6840
bitconnect.......never will we forget.

[30-Dec-18 11:00 PM] PTYX#6840

[30-Dec-18 11:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I remember seeing that video with carlos live lmao. I knew it was going to be an instant internet classic. There's just no way.
