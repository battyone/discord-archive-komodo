i dont recommend to buy coins very often, for those that listened when i recommended PIRATE at 0.05 KMD... it seems already a nice double

[28-May-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
or triple if in fiat terms

[28-May-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
with all of the ZEC issues, PIRATE appears to become the premier zksnark privacy coin

[28-May-19 05:06 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[28-May-19 05:06 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[28-May-19 05:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Much better.

[28-May-19 05:09 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
all these services also require you to go through so much background checking. For coinbase I had to put in all my info, scan a passport and drivers license, verify SSN, and then they asked me questions about who my friends were, past addresses, and past workplaces.
Ex.
Which of these people are you friends with?
a. John Smith
b. Jack WIlson
c. Dan Goodman

[28-May-19 05:09 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they literally have a database with all past workplaces, associates, and residencies

[28-May-19 05:10 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
its SEC regulation, thats the real kicker

[28-May-19 05:10 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
yep

[28-May-19 05:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Time to fuck off out of this shithole

That friend req I only seen to be asked by immigration officials,  and that too not to that much extent

[28-May-19 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what kind of special idiots made those laws to that extreme for BTC buying exchanges?

[28-May-19 05:14 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
politicians controlled by central banks

[28-May-19 05:15 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
who fear blockchains ability to subvert their economic monopoly

[28-May-19 05:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Their kids will tech these parents of their foolishness, in matter of few more years.

Own exchanges as Government's own cryptocurrency exchanges?

"i dont recommend to buy coins very often, for those that listened when i recommended PIRATE at 0.05 KMD... it seems already a nice double"    

Does it count if I ignored you at 0.05 and bought at 0.03 üòÑ

[28-May-19 05:48 PM] joe2x4#5987
@FlyingDutchman the company (cough CIA) that has the infos is called Lexis Nexis. If you get your file from them, they have all places you lived, plus your neighbors, names, addresses, phone numbers, medical, criminal, etc. Non of it verified to be correct
https://personalreports.lexisnexis.com/access_your_full_file_disclosure.jsp

[28-May-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i guess i did recommend when it was still around 0.03 to 0.05, but with halving coming up it was a pretty easy call to make, with CMC listing and ZEC troubles, just helps. and govt do their part by overregulating

[28-May-19 05:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[28-May-19 05:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
actually i think it was in the 0.03s-0.04s when you said it was clearly worth 0.05

[28-May-19 05:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and we should spend our 5% KMD rewards on it

[28-May-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, thats right. the 5% and 0.05, i figured cant go wrong. so now it is 0.12, that is 4x for the ones that were prompt

[28-May-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but at 0.12 it is still trading at close to mining cost

[28-May-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so those waiting for it to drop back down to 0.05... might be a while

[28-May-19 05:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
So theoretically once mining rewards go down price should increase correct? For miners would need to sell higher to cover same costs? In theory?

[28-May-19 05:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You‚Äôll see a drop in hash I‚Äôm sure

[28-May-19 05:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
unless you are mining VBK :troll:

[28-May-19 05:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
back at 0.03, mining cost was 0.03

[28-May-19 05:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
now at .12, mining cost is .12

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Until mining surpluses are sold off from the first era

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im guessing that in the future at price X, mining cost will be X

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
Okay I see

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
FOMO into halvening

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Damp after

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some other news maybe moves the prices?

[28-May-19 05:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who knows

[28-May-19 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
`Until mining surpluses are sold off from the first era` valid concern

[28-May-19 05:58 PM] Alexfrog#1338
all i know is pirate is my only coin that hasnt been utter garbage in the past 18 months

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
ARRR price has tracked its mining price very well, much better than most coins

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the daily mined coins have been consistently been sold during the entire time

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
not sure what that means

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure there is that much excess. and most excess are people "buying" by mining

[28-May-19 06:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
miners dumped to us all cheap the whole time

[28-May-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I can tell there will just be half the coins available for sale, and if anything higher demand due to CMC, exchange listings and all the other issues

[28-May-19 06:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, the only thing left to see is if the price doubles again, or if the hash declines after halvening

[28-May-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
1700 sats and #277 without counting its largest exchange, which is trading higher

[28-May-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt the price will double tomorrow though, not from here.

[28-May-19 06:27 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
wasnt arrr ranked like #2000 like a week ago on cmc

[28-May-19 06:28 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and now its 270

[28-May-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it was 2000 just because they didnt rank it

[28-May-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
got lumped in with all the other unranked at the end of the list

[28-May-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it came out at #320 or so

[28-May-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810

Shilled my man @Malti ARRR last week when arrr dipped to 600sats and below, told him he wasnt going to see another opportunity like this ever again

[28-May-19 07:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[28-May-19 07:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But he didnt follow my supersolid advice

[28-May-19 07:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And only bought at 900ish

[28-May-19 07:22 PM] Malti#3948
Bought at 600 as well brotha

[28-May-19 07:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah thats what I said
