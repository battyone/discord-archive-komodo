injecting something that makes you sleep 9 days in a row doesnt sound healthy

[14-Aug-18 03:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
although, many people in crypto world would pay good money for something that knocks them down until bear is over

[14-Aug-18 03:47 PM] ryman112#0068
What is this seven months of Bear?  You would think it is getting close to being over.  I get they are trying to shake weak hands but at some point they aren't shaking they are killing the very market they wanna get into.  Seems counterintuitive

[14-Aug-18 04:09 PM] harry.staal#3321
I will do some TA just follow the lines and you will be ok

[14-Aug-18 04:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is no "they"

[14-Aug-18 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
these are just narrative bulls invent to justify their bag holding

[14-Aug-18 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are marketmakers, and liquidity providers and such

[14-Aug-18 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they just try to move market a little bit pass the indicator points to get people to sell or buy into them

[14-Aug-18 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but there is no grand scheme controlling the correction

[14-Aug-18 04:17 PM] ryman112#0068
I hope your correct and there is no grand scheme.
