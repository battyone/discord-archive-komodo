[20-Oct-19 09:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
That means you will get 3,6$ per day for 1 dex

[20-Oct-19 09:47 AM] coingirl87#6489
Round about 110$ per month for 1 dex

[20-Oct-19 09:48 AM] coingirl87#6489
1 kmd cost 0,55$ at moment and you say more than 20 kmd for 1 dex is too much?

[20-Oct-19 09:49 AM] coingirl87#6489
That is 11$ for more than 100$ a month

[20-Oct-19 09:51 AM] coingirl87#6489
In other words...you invest 11$ for one time and get more than 100$ every month

[20-Oct-19 09:51 AM] coingirl87#6489
And now say again more than 20 is to much

[20-Oct-19 09:52 AM] Jimm B.#9993
You compare the current KMD price with an imaginary future dex reward value that is not guaranteed.  In addition, you do not include KMD's 5%.

[20-Oct-19 09:52 AM] coingirl87#6489
To be honest....fair price is far above 100 kmd per dex at the moment

[20-Oct-19 09:54 AM] coingirl87#6489
On crypto there is nothing guaranteed

[20-Oct-19 09:54 AM] coingirl87#6489
The volume of 54 billion is also still low

[20-Oct-19 09:54 AM] mobipoi#5774
Projections are realistic , web Dex will make it scalable

[20-Oct-19 09:55 AM] mobipoi#5774
Dex is worth around 100kmd

[20-Oct-19 09:55 AM] mobipoi#5774
it an independent assets from kmd

[20-Oct-19 09:55 AM] coingirl87#6489
There is even more potential than in my calculation...but also less potential

[20-Oct-19 09:56 AM] mobipoi#5774
No not less

[20-Oct-19 09:56 AM] coingirl87#6489
But 20 is a joke

[20-Oct-19 09:56 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Okay ... let's say your guess is true.  What do you think the KMD price will be like when the time comes?

[20-Oct-19 09:56 AM] mobipoi#5774
We are at the bottom of volume

[20-Oct-19 09:57 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes correct...we are in bottom of volume and in botton of kmd price

[20-Oct-19 09:57 AM] mobipoi#5774
Future volume with growing market will be trillions

[20-Oct-19 09:57 AM] mobipoi#5774
So more than 
10x current volume

[20-Oct-19 09:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
A lot of trading of assets that didn‚Äôt have market before

[20-Oct-19 09:59 AM] mobipoi#5774
Yes best thing is to hodl if you have Dex and find something else to do

[20-Oct-19 10:01 AM] mobipoi#5774
It one of does assets ,  you can't have enough and if you sell you maybe selling a ticket to a free life , and future dividend

[20-Oct-19 10:02 AM] mobipoi#5774
That said I will buy dex for anything under 19kmd :troll_hardcore:

[20-Oct-19 10:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
WTS .01 DEX for 18.99 KMD just for you üòÑ

[20-Oct-19 10:13 AM] Markus#5464
@coingirl87 then there is not rly 54 bil volume, most of that volume is fake volume

[20-Oct-19 10:14 AM] Markus#5464
if u remove stable coins volume then volume is pretty much only a few hundred mils

[20-Oct-19 10:16 AM] coingirl87#6489
So stable coins volume is not possible on dex?

[20-Oct-19 10:17 AM] Markus#5464
some are possible, dont know if Tether is possible tho

[20-Oct-19 10:18 AM] Markus#5464
but i would not touch Tether in current situation anyway, they have a lawsuit of 1,4 trillion usd

[20-Oct-19 10:23 AM] hastrup#8742
and thats why i dont want to buy dex

[20-Oct-19 10:24 AM] hastrup#8742
i want the useless ones like jumblr

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
whats price of jumblr?

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] hastrup#8742
you have some?

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
nope

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
but i read something about 1 kmd, is that true price?

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[20-Oct-19 10:25 AM] hastrup#8742

so 10 kmd for them?

[20-Oct-19 10:29 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what does HODL consist of?

[20-Oct-19 10:29 AM] Markus#5464
if ppl want 40 kmd for DEX then BOTS/JUMLBR should be valued at 12 kmd

[20-Oct-19 10:30 AM] hastrup#8742
The HODL asset chain is designed for long-term holders in the Komodo ecosystem. The name HODL is a direct reference to the popular acronym in the cryptocurrency community, ‚ÄúHold On for Dear Life.‚Äù Essentially 10% of all assets that the Komodo team builds are placed into the asset base that supports HODL‚Äôs value. There are occasional exceptions, as some monetization formats do not suit long-term holding.

We automated the process of tracking the overall value of the cryptocurrency assets held in the HODL fund. Users who are familiar with the UNIX command line can discover the current market value of an individual HODL unit by entering commands within an installation of BarterDEX. Please ask for more instructions on our Slack channel if this interest you.

The Komodo team also has ‚Äúmarket maker‚Äù bots trading on BarterDEX that are programmed to trade around the actual value of HODL. Therefore, the price of HODL on BarterDEX can reveal its approximate value.

[20-Oct-19 10:31 AM] hastrup#8742
dex is only worth the price what ppl want to give for it and its not 40 kmd

[20-Oct-19 10:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so HODL hold 10% DEX/SUPERNET/BOTS/JUMBLR ... etc?

[20-Oct-19 10:32 AM] hastrup#8742
i think so

[20-Oct-19 10:33 AM] hastrup#8742
Total Coin Supply: 10,000,000

[20-Oct-19 10:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
let me do calc real quick üòÑ

[20-Oct-19 10:40 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
based on the 10% value of all the assets currently latest traded price, HODL is worth 17.76 kmd

[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] Acura#2748
Do I see that just right that a buy order for about 10246 DEX exists for 11.11 KMD each, or do I have a display error? Found on hyperDex

[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] hastrup#8742
i cant get into hyperdex

[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] hastrup#8742

10k DEX buy order means a buy order of about 1% supply of DEX

[20-Oct-19 10:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's just a buy order not a sell order üòÑ but I will buy all the supply at 11kmd (maybe)

[20-Oct-19 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
did your read my "buy" word as "sell" ?

[20-Oct-19 10:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Ok thanks, in terms of calculating the Dex value for other assets such as MGW, JUMBLR, BOT ... would be nice to have some metrics that gives live value

[20-Oct-19 10:52 AM] mobipoi#5774
Of those assets

[20-Oct-19 10:55 AM] hastrup#8742
@Gordon Komodo  where did you find info about 10%

[20-Oct-19 10:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the value of 24 hodl = (24/total supply of HODL) * value of 10% of all assets @hastrup

[20-Oct-19 11:00 AM] Acura#2748

[20-Oct-19 11:01 AM] hastrup#8742

why im that blind lol

[20-Oct-19 11:03 AM] hastrup#8742
then we need to find some add of the hodl and im in for your price

[20-Oct-19 11:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
rumour said that jl777c is going to airdrop all the assets that HODL hold soon and rid the HODL asset altogether

[20-Oct-19 11:04 AM] Markus#5464
would be way easier if they would just merge all assets into 1

[20-Oct-19 11:05 AM] hastrup#8742
@Markus i dont think so  lets say you only want to make a bot for trade. now you just need to invest in bots. and not the whole ecosystem

[20-Oct-19 11:06 AM] hastrup#8742
but some asset can be merge togheter

[20-Oct-19 11:07 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
now that i know what it hold i have second thought üòÑ

[20-Oct-19 11:07 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
