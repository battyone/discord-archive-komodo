i wonder if the bulls will pull the plug out of btc when it hits 20k

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Malti#3948
for the lolz

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I agree to your risks analysis mate, not bashing them. ðŸ™‚

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
To be honest I change my risk percentage in each project tokens holding by the time.

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
From the moment I first step into coin, all we did is going backwards

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it increases decreases as things go

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have to follow that

[26-Jun-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not to be emotional with your portofolio

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] CoinKing88#1540
i think we gonna see 30-35K before it slowing down, whales want to make sure everybody knows we surpassed the last ATH and trick large amounts of people into buying in before a first sell off

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you really think KMD is gonna tank and only gonna go down, get yourself some peace, sell them.

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you'll find some good buyers around

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
I cannot do that

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you think it's a shitcoin and gonna be pumped and dumped, wait for the pump and then sell it all.

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
get rid of it

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not goof for health holding shitcoins

[26-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
But if I sell it now

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
For almost 8x less price than I bought it

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948
that's actually a very nice way of putting things @grewalsatinder

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
It doesnt do any good to me

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948
"do I want to get rid of KMD?"

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
Its a loss loss situation

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948
hodl

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
I want to, but not @ 10k satoshies

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I am only giving you advice for ANY coin/cryptocurrency on how to manage your risks

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
be it KMD or whatever

[26-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
however Im prolly gonna cry when it tank to 5k

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Malti#3948
@Caglio if you believe another coin has a bigger probability of 10x then you should buy that one

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh no worries, I am a degenerate gambler, not first not last loss I had in my life

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe ETH, LTC, XRP, BCH

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Malti#3948
the fundamentals here are

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
but im not planning to go there ðŸ˜„

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Im just saying, whatever we all think

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] p.#1126
Stop

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
All that happens its sinking

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Malti#3948
its ATL (sats wise) and the project has made HUGE progress during the bear even

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Sinking forever

[26-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Dead cat bounces, then even bigger sink

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] p.#1126
Every alt that is not a major

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] p.#1126
Einstein

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Well mister brain

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
tell whatever you want to

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
but I seen us at 45 k

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
now we are at 10

[26-Jun-19 01:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ATL was 6k sats

[26-Jun-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for KMD

[26-Jun-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ICO price was around 10k sats to 12k sats

[26-Jun-19 01:27 PM] p.#1126
@Caglio you can say that for most coins brainiac

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] p.#1126
You think you made a secret choice to buy kmd

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] p.#1126
Knowing it was different

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] p.#1126
And would pump while all alts dump

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] p.#1126
Hahahaha

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder so only guys that bought @ ico are ok

[26-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Caglio#3337
thats amazing

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Also look at dollarvalue caglio, all alts dived while BTC went up but in dollars it not as bad as it looks in sats

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] p.#1126
Its called  a stop loss and risk management

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont know @p. what are you just saying to me

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] p.#1126

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
2 years now grewal

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not bad, you'll learn how bear and bull markets work ðŸ™‚

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this way or another

[26-Jun-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Emmanuel  ðŸ˜„

[26-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not selling, but its depressive, I mean 10 k sats is a joke lol

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not referring to KMD alone when I talk to you ðŸ˜‰

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Malti#3948
buy when everyone else is selling. Sell when everyone else is buying

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Malti#3948
so you know what to doooooooooooo

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm saying observer how alts and BTC markets go in bear and bull markets and how things change

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and learn

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] p.#1126
44 million buy at 28k range remember that

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or you'll end up with nothing jus gambling

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] p.#1126
Seems like interest in kmd

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and panicing

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Caglio#3337
I am just holding, I am not a seller

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that works too

[26-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Caglio#3337
If I was selling, I would prolly made a fortune, cos it always drops

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean you just sell after a pump, and eventually you get more

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
thats all what was happening whole 2 years

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont u agree

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but even just blind holding is very harmful ðŸ˜„

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
don't just hodl too ðŸ˜…

[26-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Ah well

[26-Jun-19 01:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you snooze you loose kind way... you keep holding, and don't sell, or take % wise profits out, you lose the chance

[26-Jun-19 01:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
still learning aspect still comes in play

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont want to sell and buy

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos its reminding me of a gambling

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
And I use to gamble a lot

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
I am just stating hte facts

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
and our mentality is : its bad, but its gonna be good

[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Which, facts proven, doesnt happen

[26-Jun-19 01:36 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess we had ATH hit back in 2017, like all coins do once or twice

[26-Jun-19 01:36 PM] Caglio#3337
But I really dont see that happening again
