Which was known all along. Basically it was a con. No other way around it. Supporters claim it was just "poorly handled"

[11-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Japesmith#0609
It now exists as an ERC20 generated from a peepcoin snapshot. They never had any devs (not sure if they do now) - just promises.

I expect they'll fork PIVX at some point, and the remaining features will be "added later" ... Scammers will make money in the meantime until it fades into obscurity.

Ring ct is a selling point?

I've seen a few crypto traders pamping it, so it got some attention

[11-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Japesmith#0609
I've seen a few opportunities for joining a pump train recently, but I've avoided due to a mix of principles and fear of holding the bag. I'm not sure which bothers me the most 🤔

You think institutions let bitcoin break Hoffman's line of 100Billion marketcap?

@ryman112 Are you saying that you doubt that 1 c++ coder and 3 java coders got together and in 5 months time created the fastest transaction system on the world, that can use their own new consensus mechanism super-nodes to prevent ballot rigging?

Please see the comment below the Picture with information about DBX with links to the Whitepaper. DBX uses a Data Storage Side-Chain to support the main chain for more simultanous management of transactions. Projects as EOS are also reaching hundreds of thousands of transactions with the use of Side-Chains, however due to our DDPoS Consensus Mechanism that uses passive voting the DBXChain can manage transaction much faster and more efficient. DBX project started already in 2016, however we chose to not have any funding until first version of the Mainnet was done and first Dapp integrated earlier this year.

So many buzzwords

[12-Oct-18 07:40 AM] barv#0867
There will be many projects solving issues like scalability to come, but most lack a sustainable vision (and visionair team). The elegance of the Komodo principles are what makes Komodo unique. Even if projects like DBX seem to be true, it's only temporary

[12-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
often I see people complaining that "Komodo lacks focus" or "Komodo is doing too many things at once"

[12-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
well, if we werent doing all the different things, how would it be possible to create a single solutions that solves all the issues?

[12-Oct-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
massive tx/sec is certainly possible and easy if you neglect to work on security

[12-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
massive security is possible if you dont care about performance

[12-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
etc.

[12-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why on all the cutting edge area of crypto, KMD is having a proposed solution (happens to be mostly working for most cases)

[12-Oct-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
what few people understand is that it all works together

[12-Oct-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is what comes from lacking focus

If it wasn’t clear that their cardboard derby car shitbox was a pile of crap going nowhere, it certainly is now

[13-Oct-18 03:10 AM] tolken#2655
@jl777c I kind of think of your lack of focus being a bit like tightening screws down on a panel. You don’t exert all force down on one screw or you’ll strip the screw or buckle the panel. You have to make your way from one area to the next, partially drilling them down, ensuring all pieces are in alignment before fully committing and tightening everything down.

[13-Oct-18 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
actually that is a very good analogy

[13-Oct-18 03:12 AM] tolken#2655
It’s leadership as well.  Knowing when to let go so others can take over and put your talents where they’re best utilized.
