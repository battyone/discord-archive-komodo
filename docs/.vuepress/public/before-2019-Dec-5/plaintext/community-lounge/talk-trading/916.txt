all applications that utilize crypto conditions can now be activated/utilized without syncing/storing the chain. the scale and speed at which said applications can iterate is also signifigantly increased.

keep in mind it is still early days and we need to verify all CC are indeed nSPV compatible. since nSPV came after all existing CC, it is possible some did things in ways that would be problematic to do via nSPV

[13-Jul-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so far we only got faucet CC working well, but we just got it working at all yesterday, so it is good progress

[13-Jul-19 02:14 PM] Markus#5464
do u have a next to do idea when u finish nspv?

[13-Jul-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not at this moment

[13-Jul-19 02:15 PM] SHossain#0007
@Markus a lot of things needs to be tested

[13-Jul-19 02:17 PM] SHossain#0007
i just got a little bit tested yesterday. there are few more fixes from James today. but, i'll have to wait about 4-6 hours before i can get back to testing nSPV CC

[13-Jul-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the tech i used to implement nSPV (new p2p messages) can be used for a large variety of things

[13-Jul-19 02:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
so now "smart contract" operations can potentially run on mobile phones? the proverbial lightning in a bottle. thanks for the tip @SHossain

[13-Jul-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
likely i will come up with something pretty cool but cant say what it is yet

[13-Jul-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure nokia phones can run nSPV, but all modern smartphones seem to have the specifications for it

[13-Jul-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV doesnt use any HDD space at all

[13-Jul-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
and so far it is less than 100MB of RAM

[13-Jul-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but we are not running the komodod on mobile yet, just desktop, so there is that part that also needs to be ported to mobile

[13-Jul-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and dont expect things to go as fast as when i am coding things

[13-Jul-19 02:30 PM] Markus#5464
at this point i wonder if there is something kmd can not develop, seems every new tech is like easy peacy to make for u guys

[13-Jul-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is

[13-Jul-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
now i have literally coded almost the full spectrum of crypto, there isnt any "new" territory and the second, third, fourth time around, it is much easier

[13-Jul-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and since all the various parts are all coded to work together, they mostly work together. still some bugs in edge cases due to all the complex interactions

make it possible to run a website through blockchain then u could run smart contracts on it and nobody can shut it down or risk down time

[13-Jul-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
static website would be easy, but an active website is the problem. i guess if all the data for the website was on the blockchain,then all the fullnodes could serve up custom generated webpages

[13-Jul-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe things like a distributed database, where the project would pay nodes to host their database and nSPV clients could then remotely query

[13-Jul-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
ideas welcome as i havent decided what is next, still have a ways to go for CC via nSPV

Some ‚ÄúDEXs‚Äù have obvious backdoors, like 0x or Bancor. Others have ones that are hidden, like MakerDAO. But all of them are centrally controlled, and none of them will do any better than a traditional web app at resisting censorship.

markus, that chart above is funny to me.  it 'predicts' a forming head and shoulders which is not yet completed, while ignoring the smaller inverse H&S that is already completed (between the 'head' and 'right shoulder' on that chart), which predicts 17k sats.

[13-Jul-19 04:29 PM] Alexfrog#1338
a H&S is supposed to predict a move after the neckline is broken.

[13-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Neko#5830
yeah the bearish pattern is not complete yet

[13-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Markus#5464
I know it didnt complete but its a possibility

[13-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Markus#5464

let the DEX come out of beta sometimes later this year... let it gain traction.. let more devs und users into the ecosystem... price will appreciate organically with that

[13-Jul-19 05:39 PM] Neko#5830
it will depend on the news, chainlink pumped solely on partnerships with big companies

[13-Jul-19 05:40 PM] Lennart#9331
i could be wrong but i believe it will dump the same way. saw a lot of announcements pumps that didnt last long

Komodo has the back-end tech, everybody else has the pretty interfaces. 99% of investors don't understand the back-tech, but they understand pretty interfaces. AtomicDEX and the new website will hopefully be the start of Komodo having the nice interface to connect to the tech.
