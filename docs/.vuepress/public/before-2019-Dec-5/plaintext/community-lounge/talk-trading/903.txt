it is new territory

[08-Jul-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
getting to #40 in CMC was a first in a long time, jumped above a lot of projects i never really heard of before

[08-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea that‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs what I was talking about a little over the weekend. How there‚Äôs still even projects ahead of KMD that I‚Äôve never heard of lol

[08-Jul-19 04:53 PM] yorklab#7270
I think the higher volume could indicate that there's more interest outside of the Komodo community.

[08-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea that would make sense logically. And with rebrand right around the corner, that is only bound to increase

[08-Jul-19 05:19 PM] debaas#3337
USD chart still very bullish

[08-Jul-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i do have a theory

[08-Jul-19 05:20 PM] debaas#3337
But alot of weird bs products in the top 50 right now. Stuff noone ever heard of.

[08-Jul-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
we have a lot of people who signed up for the atomicDEX beta test

[08-Jul-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some significant percentage of them are getting a bit of KMD , since 100% of people interested in atomicDEX would be crypto traders, this seems not an unreasonable theory

[08-Jul-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and when they see the beta release is as good as they hoped, likely they will increase their stakes

[08-Jul-19 05:22 PM] debaas#3337
Once companies start using antara and announcing it we gonna see big moves. If you are a business and want to have your own blockchain without having to start from scratch,  komodo is the only thing out there ready for it.

[08-Jul-19 05:23 PM] alen#3721
When aprox do you plan to release the atomicDEX for the mass

[08-Jul-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i hear the beta invites will be going out this week and then depending on how it does will determine when. after all these years developing it we dont want to rush it a few weeks just to release it

[08-Jul-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
my nSPV work is in anticipation for needing a way to handle millions of users

[08-Jul-19 05:26 PM] alen#3721
No rush ofcourse. Have  no doubt this is a game changer

[08-Jul-19 05:26 PM] debaas#3337
yeah

Joint Staff Statement on Broker-Dealer Custody of Digital Asset Securities

[08-Jul-19 06:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
"An entity that buys, sells, or otherwise transacts or is involved in effecting transactions in digital asset securities for customers or its own account is subject to the federal securities laws, and may be required to register with the Commission. "  ü§î

[08-Jul-19 06:59 PM] cascrypto#8206
Another example is where a secondary market transaction involves a broker-dealer introducing a buyer to a seller of digital asset securities through a trading platform where the trade is settled directly between the buyer and seller.  For instance, a broker-dealer that operates an alternative trading system (‚ÄúATS‚Äù) could match buyers and sellers of digital asset securities and the trades would either be settled directly between the buyer and seller, or the buyer and seller would give instructions to their respective custodians to settle the transactions.[9]  In either case, the ATS would not guarantee or otherwise have responsibility for settling the trades and would not at any time exercise any level of control over the digital asset securities being sold or the cash being used to make the purchase (e.g., the ATS would not place a temporary hold on the seller‚Äôs wallet or on the buyer‚Äôs cash to ensure the transaction is completed).

12500?

[08-Jul-19 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, but head and shoulders can be very tricky

[08-Jul-19 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it can also just be a triangle forming or a wave B

[08-Jul-19 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wave B would mean that now we are headed sub $10k again

[08-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If ih&s we should see 15k I think?

[08-Jul-19 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo that would be the best scenario

[08-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
