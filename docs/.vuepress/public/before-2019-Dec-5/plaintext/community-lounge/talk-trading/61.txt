in any case, I dont do GUI

[20-Jul-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so it has to be others that make the user facing products

the only thing about KMD that isnt doing well now is the price

[20-Jul-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
everything else is doing pretty well and if you cant understand the latest marketing charts that are being made, well, it seems we need to make cartoon animations? but we did that too, with the atomic swap trains video

[20-Jul-18 07:30 PM] riseandfall#3726
@meatspoon : (step 1) we all discovered BTC first, (step 2) then thought about alternatives (Ripples for JL, personnally i used to believe in IOTA, some others were impressed by DPOS solutions),(step 3) you realize that POW blockchain is not perfect but is the best solution (and KMD discovered the 3rd step long time ago)....you just have to wait when other people will discover step 3 (the more stupid they are, the longer it takes)

[20-Jul-18 07:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@meatspoon only jl is anon but all people and companies making deals for KMD are not anon. So why should it matter if the founder is? It's not him making the deals

[20-Jul-18 07:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is james being anonymous

[20-Jul-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, I made dozens of commits per day, but since I dont publish my home address, it is over

[20-Jul-18 07:37 PM] yorklab#7270
@meatspoon Some may hesitate to get involved because of the anonymity of JL. But that's how it will stay, so you're either you're good with that or your not, it's not going to change.

[20-Jul-18 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jl777c its not commits you need to push! its tweets!

bottom line of meatloaf is.... jl777 needs to get public because people that bought kmd at $8 are pissed and want to know who he is to go ask for a refund

There will be mechanisms to work on price in the future I believe.

I can think of a couple.

oh, i forgot to join the convo. i have a small stash of KMD as well üòõ

[20-Jul-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
and, i'm not a developer. but, still understand most of the Komodo tech and how it works

[20-Jul-18 08:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
@KomodoWorld Imagine you are pitching a smart contract platform to a room full of corporate bigwigs knowing that the decision on which platform to use will be multi year commitment of resources and personnel.  The guy before you pitched Ethereum, an established platform with a transparent developer group and functional projects.  You have to pitch KMD and they will ask you who helms the ship.  You will say "JL777" and a room full of balding white dudes in their 50's and 60's are going to ask you to repeat it.  It would be outlandish.  The big money makes decisions, right or wrong, the way they have made decisions since forever.  It will be off-putting.   Some may not be bothered by it that much, some may not even care.  But many of those people aren't even going to want to hear the pitch.  Big money is very risk averse, especially if they can't even identify the person heading the show.  It is bad for PR since JL777 cant do actual interviews.  Its just a bad look.  And it doesn't have to be a bad look, which is frustrating.  Its such an easy fix.

[20-Jul-18 08:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
As I mentioned before, I am in it for the ride.  I ain't selling.  I really hope for KMD to be wildly successful--honestly.  But, despite JL777 claiming "everything" is good except for price action, that isn't accurate.  Marketing is awful.  Do a youtube search for Komodo KMD, look at the top videos, their view count and their content.   It's all third party people stumbling around verbally about KMD.  Google it and you find more obscure, outdated, crap articles about it.  The marketing is awful.  The wallet is, like I said, staring at a bunch of potatoes with random labels on them.  And the only reassurances that team members or community members can give an irritated investor are smart ass comments, calling me a troll for being critical, or straw-man'ing me by claiming I said something I didn't.  So the community is rather toxic towards anyone who has critical questions and the only explanation that anyone wants to give me is, "you just don't understand how sweet the tech is, bruh."

[20-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets pay some youtube celebs to start shilling kmd guys

[20-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They are working on all that as well

[20-Jul-18 08:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pretty much  every month this year some public event has been attended as well by Komodo team members.

[20-Jul-18 08:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
Anyhow, I gotta bounce for a while.  To the minority who responded to me with an open ear and helpful responses, thank you.  To those of you who just called me a troll, straw man'd me and implied that I was just too stupid to understand what they weren't willing to explain, you might want to rethink how you handle understandably irritated people who are in the same boat as you.  What kind of community do you want to be here?  Because that is part of marketing too, the kind you don't have to pay someone for.

[20-Jul-18 08:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have been provocative towards those like you who immediately developed a butt hurt stance when I was critical of KMD shortcomings

[20-Jul-18 08:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You came here shilling ETH and expected a long known to be anonymous dev to reveal himself because of arbitrary reasoning.

Poly, if you cant tell the difference between shilling and stating reasonable things, I dunno, man

[20-Jul-18 08:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes... there are a couple of people that are anonymous, but there is a big community of devs that constantly help on anything regarding the technology

[20-Jul-18 08:12 PM] c2k#4915
@meatspoon i agree with some of what you said. but strongly disagree with the bald heads in a room. corporate is changing. those bald guys are being replaced by young talented risk-taking millennials who understand that not everything needs to be so transparent. i believe this is the weakest thing you mentioned.  just my2c

people i have talked to dont care much about who wrote the code

[20-Jul-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
people do care about what can komodo give in exchange for them adopting it

[20-Jul-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and that is really something that may be bad on us

[20-Jul-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

same happens with ETH

[20-Jul-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
people like ETH because there was easy money to be made

[20-Jul-18 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why ETH is tanking now? Because those easy money incentives are being attacked by governments

[20-Jul-18 08:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No Casper sharding or plasma in 3 years .  Millions locked irretrievably unless hard fork .  But you say all the big corporations are committed to it.  You say no one wants to work with projects with anon devs yet the most widely adopted cryptocurrency is one created by anon devs.

[20-Jul-18 08:16 PM] c2k#4915
i also believe this is a constructive conversation and helps the community and platform grow. you dont want to be surrounded by like-minded people all the time. thats not healthy. you need people who are giong to shake the apple cart a bit.

the entire premise of it has to be ETH or KMD is wrong

it will be both

[20-Jul-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jul-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and the comment about not remembering text based games and that tech evolves. this is indeed true, but ETH by its nature centralizes all contract around the ETH chain. KMD is taking a totally different approach

[20-Jul-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
each assetchain will be able to run their own contracts and pay fees in itself

[20-Jul-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
just a fixed notarization fee per chain, not a per tx tax

[20-Jul-18 08:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Call this far flung speculation,  but it could be conceivable to have an ETH like chain even as much as Solidity being used for writing the contracts.

[20-Jul-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
with a few thousand total chains, it doesnt make much sense, this model, but with a million chains, then even getting a small percentage to dPoW creates permanent demand and not based on users but on blockchains. blockchain to blockchain usage,

[20-Jul-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
in theory there is no reason there cant be a solidity based chain that secures itself with dPoW

with BTCD it was the same way, for a long time the price kept going lower and lower, then it went 100x pretty fast

[20-Jul-18 08:34 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It went 100x after nearly all of them were swapped in. Still kick myself for not holding some for that pump. Would have ended up with double kmd with extra bitcoin to spare.

[20-Jul-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if only we could all predict exactly the price movements...

[20-Jul-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
cost averaging seems to be a good compromise and even you only capture half the overall move, when things are going up so much, it ends up being ok

[20-Jul-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
avoids putting in too much durin peaks and you accumulate more when it is down

[20-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I kind of did predict there would be a pump with over 90% out of the market. Never expected to reach to highs that it did so went ahead and swapped them all in.

[20-Jul-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
