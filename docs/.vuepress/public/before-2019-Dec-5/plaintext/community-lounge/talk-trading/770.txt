[16-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Tek#5253
the inflation is below bitcoin inflation until the halving

[16-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Tek#5253
and its bottomed out

[16-Jun-19 08:26 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, I think the normal trend is for BTC to moon then after it stabilizes goes back into alts

[16-Jun-19 08:26 PM] JimD#9272
All the damn KMD traders go into BTC when it moves up so KMD always falls

[16-Jun-19 08:27 PM] JimD#9272
they will be back soon after their bitcoin gainz level off

[16-Jun-19 08:27 PM] Tek#5253

Soon will have a way to buy with fiat ( wire transfer at first but moving on to CC ASAP ) on our website and eventually in wallet as well

[16-Jun-19 08:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Requires KYC out the ass though, but all fiat portals do

[16-Jun-19 09:00 PM] jspook16#3059

@Tek  seems like its about time for a possible ETH move.  LTC has had a couple precursor moves. ETH used to do that too.

Although in America these days fully automatic triggering words/statements will incapacitate most people.  Arguably less satisfying than turning them into a ground beef fountain, but a lot cheaper and with fewer legal consequences.

thats for last week

[17-Jun-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
today its 84

[17-Jun-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
not 61

[17-Jun-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
correction to $6000!

[17-Jun-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
well its possible

[17-Jun-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
who knows tho

[17-Jun-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC seems to be climbing the "wall of worry"

[17-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe when it gets back to $15000 people will finally be convinced the bear market is over

[17-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
of course at that level, a brand new bear market could start

[17-Jun-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not convinced that each cycle has to go to some multiples more than the previous cycle

[17-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Markus#5464
i think this is a halvening rally

[17-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
Ye dont think so either that is needs to multiply x times, not so sure either about the parabolic rise what ppl draw from all those previous market cycles

[17-Jun-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
sooner or later it wont hold the way its curved right now

[17-Jun-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly. it will keep doing it, until it doesnt

[17-Jun-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and this cycle could be the one that breaks the pattern, or not

[17-Jun-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the rise back from $3100 has been pretty powerful though

[17-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Markus#5464
it would be interesting to see how price of bitcoin would have looked like without all stable coins

[17-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Markus#5464
pretty sure it would be way less

[17-Jun-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it would be a lot higher

[17-Jun-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of capital is diverted into stable coins that would have gone into BTC instead

[17-Jun-19 11:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
CME has a gap that will need to be filled

[17-Jun-19 11:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Now  ~  9300 $  - if back  to gap ~8450 $   =  800$   .   All in  short 100x
