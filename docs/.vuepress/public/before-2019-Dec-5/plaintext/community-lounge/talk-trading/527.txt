which is probably incorrect usage but that what i meant

[09-Apr-19 08:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
you should ask "what is the worst that can happen if X is compromised?"   If the answer it's all dead, then it's centralized. In case of dPoW the absolute worst case is that the blockchains must rely on their ordinary consensus, without checkpoints, until the situation normalizes

[09-Apr-19 08:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
'decentralization is a spectrum' - this is a useful notion

[09-Apr-19 08:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
i have put this in the toolbox 😃

👌 

[09-Apr-19 08:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
i disagree with that tho - that is a very extreme centralisation

[09-Apr-19 08:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
the last thing

[09-Apr-19 08:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
but i get your point

[09-Apr-19 08:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
not even the banks are that centrlisaed

[09-Apr-19 08:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
i do agree

[09-Apr-19 08:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
however

[09-Apr-19 08:24 PM] nocturnal#2177
its still solving a systemic problem through an undesireable means

[09-Apr-19 08:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`about why to buy KMD`
because it's feken KMD, what other reason is there?

[09-Apr-19 08:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
last thing from me

[09-Apr-19 08:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
what i meant was

[09-Apr-19 08:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
its not creating a perfect self running system

[09-Apr-19 08:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
its using people to govern

[09-Apr-19 08:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
to slve the problem

[09-Apr-19 08:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
which is centralisation to a degree

[09-Apr-19 08:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
but that ok

[09-Apr-19 08:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
just working it out

consider also that it's not set in stone forever, there will be dpow v2 and other improvements. and dpow itself could be no longer necessary in future if there are new algo immune from attacks. komodo has the tech and flexibility to update and stay on the cusps of innovations

I'm looking forward to Avalance and others, but of course they need to prove themselves in the field before being considered. We'll see in a few years

$VBK deposits just opened up on @BittrexIntl 

Will be an interesting to watch what miners do with their stash. Price already down 32% from IEO 4 days ago. 

IEO tokens have dumped *after* listing...but Binance Launchpad projects still well above IEO price for comparison.

Genie, what do you compare KMD to if not BTC?

[09-Apr-19 09:58 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Price wise

[09-Apr-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
KMD

[09-Apr-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
And I don't mean that as a joke either. I'll often make a deal something along the lines of "will you do this for X KMD?"

{Reactions}
💯 

[09-Apr-19 10:03 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's fair. How do you decide how much X KMD is ?

[09-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
Whatever both parties agree to

[09-Apr-19 10:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean, when you initially ask, how do you chose how much to ask

[09-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
what I think is fair for the effort involved to accumulate that KMD

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Apr-19 10:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
As much as I probably shouldn't, I still use USD/AUD to work out the value I should be giving to the coins

[09-Apr-19 10:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Mainly because I know how much it costs me to mine them in AUD

`I don't `
so 50000 AUD is a fair price for a burger and small fries?

[09-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If you were starving in a desert about to die of starvation I’d say yes

[09-Apr-19 10:08 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No. I don't decide how much x AUD is. Typically, as a consumer, I look at prices others have set and decide whether I want to pay that much for it

[09-Apr-19 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol @Crabby Paddy

[09-Apr-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I look at prices others have set and decide whether I want to pay that much for it`
BINGO!

[09-Apr-19 10:09 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If I was a business owner and had a burger and fries on the menu, I'd set the AUD price based on how much it cost to generate (buy ingredients/cook, etc) and how much other people are selling burger and fries for

[09-Apr-19 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Would you set that AUD price based on the AUD/BPS/USD markets or just based on AUD?

[09-Apr-19 10:11 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If I was selling it in Australia (a specific geographic location) I'd base it on AUD markets. If it was international, you have to look at other markets

[09-Apr-19 10:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more specifically, have you ever know even one person that figures AUD value based on AUD/BPS/USD daul market?

[09-Apr-19 10:12 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not that I can think of off the top of my head. But I do know international businesses have to base value on multiple markets

[09-Apr-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If it was international, you have to look at other markets`
If you're in Aus and your customer is in US, would you dual market the value of AUD/BPS/USD or just figure AUD/USD?

[09-Apr-19 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using BTC is the exact same as randomly throwing pound sterling into that mix

[09-Apr-19 10:15 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yep, and If I'm in Aus, buying a British product, selling to an American?
