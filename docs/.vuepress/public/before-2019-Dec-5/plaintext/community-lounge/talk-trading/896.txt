Still looking for SUPERNET for a friend. Message me if you have 100+ to sell.

[05-Jul-19 09:11 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@hyperDEX i know a guy on the waves discord who want to get rid of his Supernet. He's a longtime holder doubt he would sell cheap though

[05-Jul-19 09:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is Sasha still shitting on his asset hodlers?

[05-Jul-19 09:16 PM] freakbros#9074
What price is it going for

[05-Jul-19 09:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Sherdogz  that is fine. My friend is not going to pay crazy prices, he did a pretty big trade already at under nav.

I'd take a thousand block of supernet at 15kmd per for anyone wanting some liqudity

[05-Jul-19 09:22 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Sasha is getting desperate i think... He always said he didn't care about the price. Now he's tweeting about a buyback

[05-Jul-19 09:26 PM] joe2x4#5987
Waves should just migrate to Antara smart chain and use gateway cc. Then waves market on kmd techüåä üîÑ :Komodo:

How much of the 30,000 BTC is there left?

[05-Jul-19 09:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He is trading at 50% of NAV unless he sold it

[05-Jul-19 09:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
even at half he would be at nav

@joe2x4 they marketed jl777 tech for his ICO.....

[05-Jul-19 09:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL i love this comment....

 Instead increase fees in a scalable way to a point where miners make 5 % interest.

hmm this sounds familiar minus the miners

@Sherdogz  https://twitter.com/WelderCrypto/status/1147231282667184128 I did not think of this. Say you might do a buyback to get people to buy but just say na wont do it because community doesnt like it. Pump for free? üòÑ

if i had a waves bag i would get out and in on Pirate....probably highest return possible coin atm available

[05-Jul-19 09:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Look at the recent swap, 2-3 years after promising to sort them out, they got cents on the dollar for their old sasha assets

[05-Jul-19 09:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This is how he treats his earliest investors

[05-Jul-19 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Sasha took James multigateway setup and made waves with 30k BTC invested. He has used many tricks, like airdropping coins so people keep their waves, like announcing partnerships, like launching another project outside of waves.

[05-Jul-19 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
These are short term tricks just like the buy back to manipulate the price higher

[05-Jul-19 09:49 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes and he doesn't have to he's/waves got a lot of btc with the waves ico. He must be sitting on a huge stack of btc

[05-Jul-19 09:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But like all things, you can only keep the music going for as long as the community believes, by doing that tweet, everyone just saw sasha in his underwear and it is not a good sight.

[05-Jul-19 09:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Sherdogz is there a public BTC ICO address?

[05-Jul-19 09:52 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@hyperDEX i don't know if there is but i know at the time they collected a lot of BTC with the ICO.

[05-Jul-19 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
over 30,000

[05-Jul-19 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So maybe sasha being the great trader that he is sold it at the low üòÑ

[05-Jul-19 09:53 PM] Markus#5464
what did EOS take as payment in their ico? bitcoin?

[05-Jul-19 09:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Not too sure but i heard i think they kept half if crypto and half fiat

[05-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Markus#5464
alright

[05-Jul-19 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
ETH if I remember correctly

[05-Jul-19 09:59 PM] Sherdogz#6731
üòÑ  that's why he doesn't care about the price. Hes already loaded.

[05-Jul-19 10:00 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what do you guys foresee being KMD marketcap in the next 5 years?

[05-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Markus#5464
impossible to say

[05-Jul-19 10:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Does anyone know how vechain works? From a tweet, they have no max supply so they can print more whenever and they have to stake the vechain coins for VTHO to transact with the network.....WTF

[05-Jul-19 10:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So print 25M worth, then place on market, buy up 25M, no loss and got a pump out of it üòÑ

[05-Jul-19 10:05 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
could KMD have something like a 15% marketcap dominance 5 years from now?

[05-Jul-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
@FlyingDutchman Wait for it...

[05-Jul-19 10:06 PM] Markus#5464
in 5 years we could be in a bear market

[05-Jul-19 10:06 PM] Markus#5464
bull cycles are usually 4 years

[05-Jul-19 10:07 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
even if were in a bear market, the market could sitll be huge

[05-Jul-19 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
In 5 years, i think we will be in the top 20 projects

[05-Jul-19 10:07 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
bear market in 5 years could mean total marketcap of $500B @Markus

[05-Jul-19 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
All these useless projects will die off and all the good projects with tech will rise

[05-Jul-19 10:08 PM] hyperDEX#6586
5 years.....5T not 500B

[05-Jul-19 10:08 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
lets hope lol

[05-Jul-19 10:17 PM] phm87#7395
market cap of gold is/was around 8000 B so if crypto can replace 10% of Gold, I think that it is a reasonable target (sorry if my numbers are outdated)

[05-Jul-19 10:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think we have to take into account the global savings

[05-Jul-19 10:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There will be a % that flows into crypto

[05-Jul-19 11:23 PM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX in five years it will not be 5 t as in trillions but in B not in billions, but in bitcoin. The USD will be long gone üòâ

$KMD has traded between $1.00 and $2.00 for over 2 years regardless of the price of $btc.

You new guys won't understand the candle that takes it up to $10-$20 in the future.

whats the final supply of kmd?

[06-Jul-19 01:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
200 mil

[06-Jul-19 01:20 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so if we assume that KMD will have 2.5% dominance in the future, and we set a target price of $500 per KMD for the full supply, that means we need a KMD marketcap of $100B and a total crypto marketcap of $4T

I think people think it's bad simply because they're accustomed to clear cut max supply numbers
