[28-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c where / how do you check volume over exchanges

[28-Mar-19 10:02 AM] BanHammer#8115
nah I don't think so

[28-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Tek#5253
oh wow coinbene took over the most volume from binance

[28-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Tek#5253
when you check the actual order books on coinbene it doesn't seem to be moving a lot more than on binance

[28-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Tek#5253
think they reporting fake volume

[28-Mar-19 10:55 AM] Tek#5253

[28-Mar-19 11:00 AM] BanHammer#8115

[28-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Keppie#5156
Took me years of practice

[28-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Keppie#5156

Yup, and next time. Let's continue in #talk-other-topics

[28-Mar-19 11:04 AM] BanHammer#8115
hehe, probably best

[28-Mar-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Let's go!  Close this month above 27k sats... that will paint a chart that will attract bigger volumes

[28-Mar-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
after all TA is reduced to who gets to paint the chart that will support their case.

[28-Mar-19 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is why triangles are so hard to trade, they mean a fight between bulls and bears is happening for who gets to paint the chart on their favor.

[28-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Caglio#3337
When you try to sell kmd, and then later to rebuy it

[28-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Caglio#3337
u send money on lets say binance

[28-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Caglio#3337
and trade komodo to what ?

[28-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Caglio#3337
tether ? btc ?

[28-Mar-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess is BTC I just want someone to tell me thats right, cos never before I traded. I would just buy and hold, and I want to take this 27k satoshiees now, and make you all rich when it comes to 35k ( :

[28-Mar-19 01:15 PM] BanHammer#8115

[28-Mar-19 01:15 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
However I dont even know how much can I earn on it

[28-Mar-19 01:17 PM] BanHammer#8115
don't use all your kmd, so you won't miss if it suddenly goes moon

[28-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
It is it even valuable to try

[28-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Haha you are right yeah

[28-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Keppie#5156
You 2 are betting on the fact our new trendline will break?

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] BanHammer#8115
a couple % if you're lucky

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Keppie#5156
Tricky right now if you ask me

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
You think its going even more up ha ?

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
oh fuck it

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] BanHammer#8115

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
if it goes more up, ill just sell everything

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
And quit damn crypto forever

[28-Mar-19 01:18 PM] BanHammer#8115
maybe it's smart to wait a bit

[28-Mar-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326

[28-Mar-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
a swap 5 years in the making

[28-Mar-19 01:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
ðŸ•¸ .. I find this kind of hilarious.. still, they are following up- WAVES seems to be in pretty good shape, as a project overall

[28-Mar-19 01:23 PM] LocoMB#8593
also- the thing that coinomat didn't work is not to be blamed on them I think, because almost _all_ the fiat gateway providers that started in that time have hit some kind of brick wall or another

[28-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Sad part is that KMD was at one point 10 dollars. We're just waiting for it to get back to there.

[28-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Caglio#3337
ok this comfirming time

[28-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Caglio#3337
to send money on binance isnt the fastest, its been fucking 15 minutes already and not even half of comfirmations rofl

[28-Mar-19 01:35 PM] west775#4114
Takes 2 hrs on binance, last times I've used it

[28-Mar-19 01:35 PM] west775#4114
