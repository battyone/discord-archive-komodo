lack  of users has to do with lack of liquidity and lack of a good gui, nothing to do with mm which most users don't even know they are using

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Jetter73#2234
Then MM is the issue currently. It does not allow people to trade even when there is liquidity.

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] jspook16#3059
well there are trades happening now

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] jspook16#3059
ive been able to trade pretty consitently

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Then MM is the issue currently. It does not allow people to trade even when there is liquidity.`
How do you figure that to be?

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Jetter73#2234
There are random crashes, random errors. This is not something that can be adopted by normal people that use facebook.

[26-Oct-18 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've had a mm running for 3 months

[26-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Jetter73#2234
Congrats

[26-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Jetter73#2234
Let me know when you get the masses using mm 1.0

[26-Oct-18 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm doesn't "just crash" inless the GUI makes it crash

[26-Oct-18 04:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Let me know when you get the masses using mm 1.0`
I'm still waiting for you to tell me something that's wrong with mm and not GUI issues

[26-Oct-18 04:03 AM] house#8741
Wondering if @Jetter73 feels the same about monero/zcash as he appears to about arrr?
Legit question

[26-Oct-18 04:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This is not something that can be adopted by normal people that use facebook.`
It was never meant to be, that's the reason for GUIs. mm is a P2P backend client

@house I am about value, can you say that Verus with Mike in charge is the same as a chain that someone else can spin up?

[26-Oct-18 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jetter73 one of the reasons luke specifically came onboard was to poke holes at it, his results are generally atypical edge cases

[26-Oct-18 04:06 AM] house#8741
I value mike tout as a competent dev above the coin for sure, I was specifically about arrr

[26-Oct-18 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`can you say that Verus with Mike in charge is the same as a chain that someone else can spin up?`
Given that it's open source, the answer is "setting aside dPoW, yes"

[26-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Jetter73#2234
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Never mind. I cannot change what you think, but trying to say something is good enough for yourself but not for 99.9% of people will not help us get anywhere.

[26-Oct-18 04:08 AM] Jetter73#2234
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I can make another private chain and pay whatever the KMD fee is and i will get the same chain technically.

[26-Oct-18 04:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jetter73 You main problem with mm seems to be that you don't understand what it is, does, or is meant to do.

[26-Oct-18 04:09 AM] Jetter73#2234
It seems to me that is your problem also.

[26-Oct-18 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I can make another private chain and pay whatever the KMD fee is and i will get the same chain technically.`
I can guarantee you that you can't buy your way into dPoW for a verus clone

[26-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Jetter73#2234
Did you even understand what i wrote? I said that Verus is different to PIRATE and with PIRATE anyone can spin up a new chain.

[26-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Jetter73#2234
So how can both be valued the same.

[26-Oct-18 04:10 AM] house#8741
‘Yes and that is vastly over valued for what it is too.’
You seem to be making rash assumptions @Jetter73

[26-Oct-18 04:11 AM] Jetter73#2234
So either one is inflated due to mining costs or something is vastly undervalued. But by swapping KMD at that rate, whoever is selling KMD is vastly underselling the worth of KMD.

[26-Oct-18 04:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It seems to me that is your problem also.`
I'm like 1 of 5 people that have ever used mm actively without a GUI; you, literally, couldn't be more off-base with your assumptions of what I do/don't know about mm

[26-Oct-18 04:12 AM] Jetter73#2234
Anyway, good day to you guys. I just wanted to point out we don't to con people into swapping their precious KMD into test coins.

[26-Oct-18 04:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jetter73 KMDICE is not a "testcoin" it's a live, valid chain

[26-Oct-18 04:12 AM] house#8741
good day brother Jetter ... no malice here, just clarity ... is good to discuss these things in the open

[26-Oct-18 04:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMDICE is a testcoin in the exact same way VRSC is

[26-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Jetter73#2234
Yes i agree @house . Not saying PIRATE or KMDice has no value, but if you are valuing it at 0.4KMD and at the same rate as Verus, well, that is not good especially for people that don't know or understand what they are buying.

[26-Oct-18 04:14 AM] house#8741
to be fair Genie had pointed that out specifically about 2 hours ago

[26-Oct-18 04:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
PS - if you scroll back, you'll see that I wholly agree that 0.4 for KMDICE is silly

[26-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Jetter73#2234
So we agree on something.

[26-Oct-18 04:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
except that you're entirely wrong that mm "sucks", I'd image we could agree on many things

[26-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Jetter73#2234
Let me know when you have ComputerGenie GUI up and flawlessly running MM, we can then tell people working on MM 2.0 not to bother.

[26-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Jetter73#2234
We are stupidly paying people to work on something that is perfect and ready to scale.

[26-Oct-18 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Let me know when you have ComputerGenie GUI up`
Well I started on a rebase and fixing of BarterDEX GUI, but ungrateful dikwad users and their attitudes got the better of me and I left the space almost entirely for months
so, there's that...

[26-Oct-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the only problem with marektmaker is that it had to have all of its multitread capabilities removed to make it stable for the GUI

[26-Oct-18 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this has made it slow

[26-Oct-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181

like it was back in PIZZA/BEER tests

[26-Oct-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't say "the only problem", it has several issues, but most of what he was attributing to mm is GUI issues, not mm

[26-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not suign it for trades though

[26-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure it was disabled for good reason

[26-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the app is multi threaded but the RPC interface is single thread

[26-Oct-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
can only take 1 command at a time ... there has already been proigress on repalacing the http server in a rust variant .. mm2 will solve most issues and progress is happening on it.

[26-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as a dodgy hack you add 2 RPC ports

[26-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and issue it 2 commands at once...

[26-Oct-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if one command has it hanging for a while the other port still works

there is a simple reason KMDICE price appears expensive, it is simply due to there being 10x fewer coins than PIRATE

[26-Oct-18 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so a 0.3 KMD price for KMDICE is the equivalent of 0.03 price for PIRATE

[26-Oct-18 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
300,000 KMDICE mined vs 20 million PIRATE, each day PIRATE mines as much as entire supply of KMDICE

[26-Oct-18 05:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thank you sir @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 🙏🏼😊

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[26-Oct-18 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
marketcapwise $100k vs $2 mil, though the KMDICE marketcap will increase as more coins are mined, just like PIRATE

[26-Oct-18 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
to base any decision on the price of the coin, misses many factors that are much more relevant

[26-Oct-18 05:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c that would be a great argument except for 2 things
a) the diff is 1/10 that of PIRATE
b) a loop script can net you 7k from just 400 while you sleep for a mining/playing cost of less than 1 cent

[26-Oct-18 05:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
More than KMDICE or even PIRATE I am excited about CASINO. Eagerly waiting for update and help anywhere possibly to that project from @forkwitch

[26-Oct-18 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
hashrate i think is artificially low due to the pool issues. i know there was a lot more hashrate mining it than reflected in the blocks found. so more than normal, the hashrate for KMDICE is a volatile factor

[26-Oct-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
b) do you claim there is a way to get much higher winning odds than you should be able to?

[26-Oct-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL did a statistical test and it showed thing were within expected ranges

[26-Oct-18 05:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "higher" but at low odds and only 5 seconds delay, you'll win more than you loose and it all adds up

[26-Oct-18 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
how will you win more than you lose if the odds are calculated correctly? it seems there is bug

[26-Oct-18 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
10473238.63434446 KMDICE
after thousands of bets the house is down 27000 coins, but I think decker has 20,000 of that

[26-Oct-18 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
also 10% hashrate seems to make sense to achieve price parity with PIRATE as that accounts for the 10% coin emission

[26-Oct-18 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for simplicity:
if you bet 10 at 4 odds...
you win..
you now have 50...
You now have to loose 5 times in order to loose your original bet

[26-Oct-18 05:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at higher odds you *will* get thrashed (I don't think 1500 odds is "real-world" possible to win in a lifetime)

[26-Oct-18 05:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's literally the same principle that I used when playing craps for a living

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the house has a considerable edge, unless you do x, y, and z

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but what if you lose the first bet at 4 odds?

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you reup

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
which should happen most of the time

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
😃

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so not any bug, just the possibility of having a "system" that is guaranteed to work, until it doesnt

[26-Oct-18 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
either way you still have to loose much more often than you win just to break even

tbt, it's not really any different than mining, you can find 10 blocks in a row and none for 9 days or 1 every day for 10 days

Since there is a very big spread between minbet and maxbet you can push up dispersion to the cosmic highs and earn well if moon in correct position
