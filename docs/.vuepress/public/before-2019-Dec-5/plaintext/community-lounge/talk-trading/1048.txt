It is pretty sad that people cannot see logic and yet are so weak not to just sell due to their indecisiveness

[08-Aug-19 07:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you think it will go down, sell. That is the only logical thing to do

[08-Aug-19 07:27 AM] coingirl87#6489
How much is komodo fund for marketing?

[08-Aug-19 07:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
How much you fund or do to do marketing?

[08-Aug-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87 how much kmd for you to stop nagging all the time ?

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] coingirl87#6489
I invest 32 btc into komodo

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] coingirl87#6489
That was my fund

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Community marketing is more important than the team marketing, look at how selfish and short sighted you guys seem to be here.

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] coingirl87#6489

[08-Aug-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So how much time or effort or funds have you dedicated into promoting KMD?

[08-Aug-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you do nothing but complain you are not helping yourself.

[08-Aug-19 07:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You put 32 btc in and just hodl through all this alt rektage ???

[08-Aug-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So i guess you dont want the price to rise

[08-Aug-19 07:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wow just wow

Treat everyone‚Äôs opinions as complaints~~ very good

[08-Aug-19 07:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Opinions is fine, i welcome solutions. If you dont have solutions then why complain? Do something about it

[08-Aug-19 07:30 AM] coingirl87#6489
I have no technical or dev skills thats why i invest 32 btc into komodo because i like jl777 and the ideas of him....i like and share each post in social networks

[08-Aug-19 07:30 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats all what i can do

[08-Aug-19 07:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is fine. Everyone can do what they can.

[08-Aug-19 07:31 AM] coingirl87#6489
Fuck yeah..i invest 32 btc at ico and hodl

[08-Aug-19 07:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you have no money and have time, use the time to assist in testing/socials etc. If you have no time but have money, help fund some dev stuff or set little bounties

[08-Aug-19 07:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87 lol then you still massively up ?

[08-Aug-19 07:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The thing here is that, people say marketing is shit and do better marketing with little money, GIVE A SOLUTION instead of stating the obvious.

[08-Aug-19 07:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
At ico 32 btc

[08-Aug-19 07:32 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
F hell

[08-Aug-19 07:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If there was a magic button that the marketing team can press that said "GREAT marketing" and one that had "SHIT marketing" to determine the outcome, which one would they press?

[08-Aug-19 07:32 AM] coingirl87#6489
I have no time because i work 6o hours a week...i spent all my money to komodo because i believe in it

[08-Aug-19 07:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But yet you have time to complain üòõ

[08-Aug-19 07:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I do many more hours than that

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
Bit i dont like how things on marketing will handle

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats why i compain

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
And team make jokes about it

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is fine but you have stated a problem, what is the solution

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] coingirl87#6489
But market reflect it with very bad performance

[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not getting paid by the team, i am on here because i help out in other areas

[08-Aug-19 07:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Market price going down does not mean bad marketing.....

[08-Aug-19 07:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is what people are missing

[08-Aug-19 07:35 AM] coingirl87#6489
So whats you think is reason price of komodo goes down more than of other 93 coins of top 100?

[08-Aug-19 07:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87 not a lack of marketing , facepalm

[08-Aug-19 07:37 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why you invest 32 btc and are basicially a whale from many perspective , but doesn't even even take the 1 day that would be needed to learn how this market works ?????

[08-Aug-19 07:37 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[08-Aug-19 07:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Komodo heavily bot traded maybe more than others first ..... Second and mostly it didn't drop as much as others because of rebrand buyers. Now there is a heavier sell off but it's still equal to others

[08-Aug-19 07:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@coingirl87

[08-Aug-19 07:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
1 month i dont know but it seems equal

[08-Aug-19 07:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
