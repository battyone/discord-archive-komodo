this evening I was out to dinner and a young guy in the nearby table was showing Blockfolio and a BTC chart to his girlfriend. I suppose there are many other people into crypto around me, but it's funny this the first time I spot one

@Caglio If anyone deserves that role, its down to you and Tek.  But why only have one court jester when two are available?  I enjoy your sage wisdom.  Keep it coming.  Side job, you should write fortune cookie tid-bits.

@KomodoWorld the girl probably didn't go on a second date because that's how newbs get wrecked. First rule of crypto club is you don't talk about crypto club.

now they can t live without it, internet is down, it s armaggedon.
Then came regulations, and advertising, and the exact same people now just act like it was obvious that this tech was a lifechanger, because after all, govs finally switched to it claiming it s better for climate and blablabla.

@Deleted User if you're for real about vene, hit your boy up. Let's take a trip

Been looking for a cheap place myself 😄

[27-May-19 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
the race has already begun, just look at all countries claiming to be the next crypto nation, no other reasons but economics and incentive to get a share

[27-May-19 09:25 PM] PTYX#6840
you just need someone there to make the purchase. they don't sell outright to non-citizens

[27-May-19 09:26 PM] PTYX#6840
@Hermes isn't that right?

[27-May-19 09:26 PM] PTYX#6840
hermes was explaining to me that offices and commercial spaces are also very good investment. If you don't end up selling it or renting it you can use it for other businesses.

Soon we will be adding an option to get a trading discount when using $DP to pay for your fees.
This means we are adding a new incentive to use the $DP-coin.
But that's not everything! 1/3

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] PTYX#6840
we are already in the process of doing it.

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
nice
i mean for $3k it's worth the risk 😂

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] PTYX#6840
regarding arrr, we are waiting on ztx to be availble on mobile. once it is, we will be among the first to add it.

[27-May-19 10:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok, 2 convos mode activated

[27-May-19 10:04 PM] PTYX#6840
fishy said there were some issues with ios and android might be available soon. i have to check up on the situation.

[27-May-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
vene: if it pamps it pamps, if it doesn't fekk it, just $3k

[27-May-19 10:05 PM] mrlynch#5735

viewkeys in testing i believe

[27-May-19 10:05 PM] PTYX#6840

[27-May-19 10:05 PM] PTYX#6840

[27-May-19 10:06 PM] PTYX#6840

[27-May-19 10:06 PM] PTYX#6840
it's a very active community.

[27-May-19 10:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you have the time it would be great for non-techies to get into arrr
aaand chameleon would be first z-z mobile wallet

[27-May-19 10:07 PM] PTYX#6840
it's a win win for sure

[27-May-19 11:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is there a way to ask binance to open a kmd/usdt market?

[27-May-19 11:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyone here knows? @SHossain maybe

[27-May-19 11:24 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Off topic but anyone who held OUR in the past 24 hours has been airdropped ZEXO (Zaddex) at 5:1 so please keep your wallet keys safe 🐉

@siu - Chainmakers Just came here to ask when usd pair

[28-May-19 12:16 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Could be useful for some

[28-May-19 12:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
KMD lacks a USDT pair

[28-May-19 12:16 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes

[28-May-19 12:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo it would be very beneficial marketwise

[28-May-19 12:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not just because of "usefulness"

[28-May-19 12:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but because USDT tends to pump coins 😂

[28-May-19 12:17 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hehe

[28-May-19 12:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
every time the printer pumps 100m of USDT into the market, we know a little bit of that will go to KMD

[28-May-19 12:35 AM] JimD#9272
Whats gonna make KMD moon next ?

[28-May-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rebrand?

[28-May-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
K64 and Pirate?

[28-May-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
All of the above?

[28-May-19 12:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
mobile dex

[28-May-19 12:45 AM] JimD#9272
Rebrand might work.  People will be like, "THIS COIN DOES EVERYTHING"

[28-May-19 12:46 AM] JimD#9272
whats the new theme gonna be like

[28-May-19 12:46 AM] JimD#9272
or is that a secret

[28-May-19 12:47 AM] JimD#9272
is this coin going to pick a more popular type of lizard or are we gonna with a more techy sounding name

abusedsmily 

[28-May-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and by that you mean that it lost 100% of the pump?

[28-May-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but it didnt lose 200% of the pump?

[28-May-19 02:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
"any day that KMD doesnt lose 10% of its marketcap is a great day"

[28-May-19 02:26 AM] richardt#2807
what pump?  KMD is up because BTC is up.  Pretty much no change in ranking on CMC

[28-May-19 03:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Kmd will have a pairing with KSB (OURs stablecoin) on zex so that would be a fiat in and out 😛 no tether pump tho

[28-May-19 03:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
when ksb pump?!

[28-May-19 04:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was odd to see KMD not shaking much while BTC rising in value like before 🤔

[28-May-19 04:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

lack of hype- I have come to accept this as a good thing

[28-May-19 04:14 AM] LocoMB#8593
the lack of hype I mean.. ultimately power of utility will Trump all silly $hitcoins

[28-May-19 04:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
hey, why not use a capital T for 'to trump' 😈

[28-May-19 04:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
I compare KMD to Vietcong - only this is is totally not about communism, but the total opposite

[28-May-19 09:15 AM] klein#5233
Are there any plans to  divest non Komodo assets from supernet and reinvest them into komodo assets?

[28-May-19 09:17 AM] klein#5233

Steaming pile of shit (IOTA): 10 Million

[28-May-19 09:18 AM] klein#5233
Yes I am aware, hadn't finished my train of thought

[28-May-19 09:18 AM] klein#5233
10 Million IOTA vs 246 pirate

[28-May-19 09:20 AM] klein#5233
LABS: 3277

[28-May-19 09:21 AM] klein#5233
What is the reason for still holding IOTA?

[28-May-19 09:22 AM] klein#5233
and are there any plans to reinvest these funds into assets that are apart of the komodo platform

[28-May-19 09:22 AM] klein#5233
like pirate and labs, more dex etc

[28-May-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been. notice no more waves

[28-May-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Pirate is privacy coin, and 99.99% of balances are on Z addresses you can't know it's actual balance

[28-May-19 09:24 AM] klein#5233
@jl777c  and IOTA?

[28-May-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
