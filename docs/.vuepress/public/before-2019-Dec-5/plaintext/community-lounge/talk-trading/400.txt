rewards aside, I do just that, daily

[05-Feb-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
many of us do

[05-Feb-19 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, security is messy and you sacrifice it at every point you take the "easy" way

[05-Feb-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
27.9 million years to bruteforce a privkey is still infinitely quicker than against someone using a new key/address pair on a regular basis

not to mention that there is the random possibility that the seed to whatever addy you stick with just happens to be "doh I shouldn't have picked this addy"

[05-Feb-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or "123456789"

`well, you can't fix stupid`
I'm not saying that someone picked "123456789" intentionally, I'm saying that `getnewaddress` __could__ result in that being the seed because you can't walk it backwards and find out before you decide "I love these letters, I'm keeping them"

[05-Feb-19 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and same might happen with change addresses`
true, but if it's only in that address until the next transaction, what would you care if someone cracked "123456789" 15 txes after you stopped using it?

[05-Feb-19 08:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention that "easy" is a relative term, the rigs out now can create rainbow tables in weeks that would have taken years to create with "top of the line" just a year ago

[05-Feb-19 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it should, so stop thinking that change addys are "stupid" 😛

[05-Feb-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
all keys are high entropy

[05-Feb-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
256 bits

[05-Feb-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
a small number like 123456789 would require 200+ bits to be 0

[05-Feb-19 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
x chars is same probability to crack, yes; however, you can't run a sustained attack on a moving target

[05-Feb-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
statistically more remote than 2^64

[05-Feb-19 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, RWLAapmNwixocgcPPdV13EmDtbNPcQwoZD is an addy that has been used 😛

[05-Feb-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810

not if he's targeting your funds specifically is what I meant

[05-Feb-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's precisely how vanitygen works

[05-Feb-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the difference would be using phrases instead of random hashes

[05-Feb-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is much more efficient to search for N addresses at the same time

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how do I store my coins the best way then?

[05-Feb-19 08:27 PM] hastrup#8742
I use veracrypt whit multiple USB as backup

[05-Feb-19 08:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my store coins are on SD cards in 3 locations, all more than 1000 miles from me

[05-Feb-19 08:28 PM] hastrup#8742
If I also need to get them for trading

[05-Feb-19 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`If I also need to get them for trading`
x for trade
y for use
z for later

[05-Feb-19 08:29 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I also do that but I have only 2 pkaces

[05-Feb-19 08:29 PM] hastrup#8742
Places

[05-Feb-19 08:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even 1 is better than within arm's reach 😉

[05-Feb-19 08:30 PM] hastrup#8742
So seed on veracrypt  USB is not a bad idea?

[05-Feb-19 08:31 PM] hastrup#8742
I don't have wallet. Dat on them

[05-Feb-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👍🏽 encrypted and keys only is always a better idea than copy/paste/gone .dat file

[05-Feb-19 08:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
of course you could encrypt the dat and put that on encrypted....

[05-Feb-19 08:34 PM] hastrup#8742
I there a pass on agama when using native? because when I have try in the past there was none that is the reason I use lite I want pass to log in

[05-Feb-19 08:35 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and thx for info👍

[05-Feb-19 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just barely getting reacquainted with agama, so I'm not the one to ask about how-tos with it 😛

[05-Feb-19 08:37 PM] hastrup#8742
Is there a multisig option in veracrypt?

[05-Feb-19 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know even less about that app 😛

[05-Feb-19 08:38 PM] hastrup#8742

The only chart you need.
My rough view on what I believe is going to happen.
Break that trendline before we can even think about having bullish discussions.
