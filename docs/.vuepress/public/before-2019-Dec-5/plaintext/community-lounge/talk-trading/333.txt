Considering it seems just a matter of time, that sounds dire.

[06-Dec-18 09:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
unfortunately most people will think like this : delaying =>  bad news => better sell my btc üòÇ

[06-Dec-18 09:32 PM] tolken#2655
Hopefully crypto maintains independence and becomes even more resistance to centralized manipulation.

[06-Dec-18 09:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
sec are waiting for the next bull run. once it starts, they will allow an etf to keep the price in an acceptable range.

[06-Dec-18 09:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
don't want things getting out of hand. at least we get a hint for how long we wait.

[06-Dec-18 09:37 PM] tolken#2655
They will wait till feb then punch you in the balls.

[06-Dec-18 10:05 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The SEC can delay it until end of March then they have no choice but to decide.

[06-Dec-18 11:00 PM] Torankoku#4818
short term, btc etf may be helpful but long term, it is probably harmful to ecosystem

[06-Dec-18 11:09 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't even know anymore. Remember Btc futures  hype then they came out and just Fu... BTC some more.

[06-Dec-18 11:48 PM] actionslacks#4072

Man, you gotta wonder how much that cost to pull off.

[07-Dec-18 12:38 AM] Vertigo#0439
We should throw both of them in the trash right next to bitconnect

If you truly believe

[07-Dec-18 01:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
Pretty massive pump and dump all in all. But it will pale in comparison to the larger economic crash coming.

[07-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Vertigo#0439
Stocks?

[07-Dec-18 02:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
Definitely stocks, probably bonds, some real estate as well.

[07-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Vertigo#0439
So our savings are better off in crypto?

Maybe the big institutional whales know this and are switching as we speak from stocks to crypto

[07-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Vertigo#0439
To ride the wave up and avoid the stock crash

[07-Dec-18 02:03 AM] actionslacks#4072

So my question is how long can most of these projects stay in business.  What is the point in which the fail?  Is KMD good to weather this storm?

[07-Dec-18 04:20 AM] jspook16#3059
Is crypto dedded?

[07-Dec-18 04:25 AM] ryman112#0068
Sure looks dedded lol but Ima pretend I just found out about it.

```Various reasons are offered as to why the market reacts as it does on a daily basis.

One day it‚Äôs a trade truce that gets bullish hearts racing. The next day the Dow falls 800 points.

But none of the sponsored commentators touch on the real reason‚Ä¶the US market is not just overvalued, it is in over-overvalued territory. Therefore, it must fall‚Ä¶and fall hard.

The US bull market of 2009‚Äì2018 is over. Now it is time for the bear to go to work.

And what a mauling it‚Äôs going to be.

It‚Äôs shaping up to be almost as severe as what bitcoin believers have suffered so far ‚Äî a loss of up to 80% in value.```

Looks like if you have survived the crypto crash already... Buying is a good idea at this time.

[07-Dec-18 06:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to buy more bitcoin, but there is no seller for cash üò¶

[07-Dec-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also want to start buying but I ran out of money ü§£

[07-Dec-18 07:41 AM] Lumbi#8378
I see possibly sub 800 BTC to crash out new money.

[07-Dec-18 07:43 AM] Lumbi#8378
it'll take some time and dollar weakness to bring it back to 2017 levels

[07-Dec-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might go that low for a few seconds

[07-Dec-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends on what the dollar does

[07-Dec-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really

[07-Dec-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181

hard to time things, but it's obvious they're reversing end of 2017
that or crypto deaded

[07-Dec-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire end of 2017 was just apr tof the plan ... why els would the main stream media in USA and AUS (maybe other countries too?) be shilling BTC at the ridiculous ATH (not to mention BCH and coinbase, as you stated lol)

[07-Dec-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Run it up .... get the public ot buy it

[07-Dec-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Dec-18 07:48 AM] snowdamn#2414

i doubt it will

[07-Dec-18 07:51 AM] snowdamn#2414
the deaded scenario is always a possibility, but, IMO, $7.5k BTC is the current pricing
trading games until we hit it again

[07-Dec-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
$1000 is over sold ... but if none wants to buy it ...

[07-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Lumbi#8378
the great thing about the last run up is it got good tech people in the space and there has been massive evolution. The comeback is going to be epic. It's a great time to be alive üòÑ
