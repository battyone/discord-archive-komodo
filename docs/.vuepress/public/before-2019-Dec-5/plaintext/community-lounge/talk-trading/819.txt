certainly some part is by people that hold against the entire project the agama hack, but by and large people are very happy to find out their coins ended up in the sweep address vs. the hacker address. for the latter, they are all quite surprised that they still get a refund

[22-Jun-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i know there are no guarantees in crypto, but i try to demonstrate that we will do what we can within our powers

[22-Jun-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
with 1000 people affected, that is 1000 that now have a more secure setup and hopefully a lot more that dodged a bullet are taking security more seriously.

[22-Jun-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the hackers are after your crypto

[22-Jun-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is up to you to make sure it it secured. we have all seen that CEX are not really able to keep it that secure, anybody that thinks govts or banks can... the amount of money being stolen from banks each year, seems to be something that is tried to be hidden. it doesnt matter so much as insurance and the "printing presses" just replace it anyway

[22-Jun-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i strongly urge everybody to store all their crypto on dedicated hardware, be is some unix laptop or hardware wallets. the node that has your passphrase should not be running any unknown software at all.

[22-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Markus#5464
CEX should just do like bitmex and it would be more secure....let ppl withdraw once a day and let CEX keep all funds in cold storages

[22-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Markus#5464
sure maybe not as nice since u can just withdraw once a day but more secure for sure

[22-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Markus#5464
that way they can validate if withdraws are valid or if there is any suspicious activity before the withdraw is getting processed

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] nael55#5863
i always wondered why an exchange didn't operate like that

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] nael55#5863
or 2 withdrawal periods daily

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but then another exchanges says they process withdraws every 12 hours

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] nael55#5863
yes it's cumbersome for user, but some might appreciate it

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then one say every 4 hours

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
...

[22-Jun-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
with thousands of exchanges, competition will get us back to where it is

[22-Jun-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the big question is why arent there dozens of credible bitmex competitors

[22-Jun-19 03:10 PM] nael55#5863
regs..i think many fear they'd go the 1broker route if they started a mex competitor

[22-Jun-19 03:11 PM] nael55#5863
there's deribit now - that's grown in popularity this year

[22-Jun-19 03:12 PM] nael55#5863
leverj is trying for a noncustoridal version of bitmex but they are taking some time

[22-Jun-19 03:13 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Why do I HODL this coin? WTF?

[22-Jun-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
because day trading leads mostly to 80% capital losses

[22-Jun-19 03:14 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Deep breath

[22-Jun-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
just close the trading page, stay calm

[22-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you have a very small amount, current price is an illusion

[22-Jun-19 03:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Second deep breath

[22-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
when 1BTC of buy will boost the price 5%+, it is not a real price

[22-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there seems to be 8BTC available less than 17k

[22-Jun-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so believing 13k is a real price for any significant amount is false

[22-Jun-19 03:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok......it does look fake ....buuuut...damn

[22-Jun-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if you have $100 worth, then it is a very real price

[22-Jun-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the smallest bankrolls are able to get the biggest ROI due to this effect

[22-Jun-19 03:16 PM] yorklab#7270
```because day trading leads mostly to 80% capital losses```
Been there done that.

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think I need a beer

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
I made 200% gains trading kmd regularly february to april

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is hard not to believe the price is 12k, but unless you can exactly pinpoint minute by minute prices or have a really small bankroll, it is all just imaginary price points

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I own lots of pizza and beer

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
so ofc u can do profits

[22-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but you have how many years of trading experience?

[22-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
i dont i started trading half year ago

[22-Jun-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
wow! you are one of the few then, most that start trading actively are soon forced to stop

[22-Jun-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
but, you more do swing trades not day trading

[22-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
well i learn quick, when i want to learn something i do it quick i dont give up

the price is upside down now, where the price is below the fast MA, which is below the medium MA, which is below the slow MA

[22-Jun-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
this is actually the signal to buy

[22-Jun-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the hard part is to wait until it all reverses to sell

[22-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Markus#5464
JL im kinda interested in learning more about blockchain but i like to do analysis, thats basically what i do at my job, business related analysis. How can that be used when it comes to blockchain?

[22-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
we had this signal last aug/sep, also in nov, and even may. this appears to be a repeat of the same signal of may

[22-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus chainanalysis wants you!

[22-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
find out who owns what coins on the blockchain and report them to the govts

[22-Jun-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
to protect the women and children

[22-Jun-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464

This one seems more real than the others.

[22-Jun-19 03:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We never had an actual capitulation on bottoms

[22-Jun-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can use it to identify/differentiate chains that are used, like blocktivity

[22-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  Will we be able to overcome the historical maximum in the next 2 years? What is your theoretical opinion? Are there any fundamental reasons for this? Upcoming partnerships - an influx of investors and new projects?

[22-Jun-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
historical max in fiat seems to have nothing that protects it from being exceeded

[22-Jun-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
historical max against btc... that is harder to predict as it really depends on how crazy this bull really is

[22-Jun-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and will there be rogue waves that hit

[22-Jun-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe like last time, the ultimate ATH during the bull comes briefly

[22-Jun-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
these spikes, which are very hard to catch, but overall the crypto prices in general appear to be headed much higher

[22-Jun-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
possibly, much much higher

[22-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if institutions have made policies to allocate x% into crypto

[22-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that will be contagious and they are all pack animals

[22-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Markus#5464
with that being said fill ur bag, keep it cold, forget about it and check back when euphoria is about to kick in

[22-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the time to sell is during the fomo rogue wave

join the club, SuperNET "lost" over $200 million!

[22-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  meant paired with the dollar - for the next great years - or the price after halving Bitcoin? And paired with Bitcoin, and so it is clear that it is impossible to predict - after all, we will eventually eventually get away from the correlation with Bitcoin when we mature!

[22-Jun-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
