Is bitpanda off limits to US?

[25-Jun-18 07:26 PM] PTYX#6840
they serve the US but withdrawals are for SEPA accounts which means EU only.

[25-Jun-18 07:26 PM] PTYX#6840
They have other withdrawal methods though

How are they going to regulate bitcoin based coins? Too late, BarterDEX is already here.

[25-Jun-18 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
They can only regulate fiat gateways.

Are the transactions fees always high when trading against BTC on BarterDEX?

[26-Jun-18 07:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
atimic swappig BTC is generally a bad idea.

[26-Jun-18 07:11 AM] Cranky#9935
So it seems

[26-Jun-18 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
only for 1 or more BTC, then it isnt so bad

[26-Jun-18 07:12 AM] Cranky#9935
right, so is KMD pretty much the mainstay in use for atomic swaps by most ppl?

[26-Jun-18 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LTC is good too.

[26-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Cranky#9935
I guess many of the trades would be made offline and just completed through BDEX

[26-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Cranky#9935

Re: the EOS blacklist:

EOS block producer who did not update his config gets emotionally abused for not "complying with an order" of the almighty ECAF, due to being absent for personal reasons. 

After multiple apologies and further abuse, he is threatened with a law suit

@jeezy the lawsuit thingy has more to do with the guy that got hacked and he was supposed to have his account frozen but the person in charge with doing that didn't got the memo, the hacked wallet lost 3000 something EOS because of that

a BP that gets paid 10k $ daily to ensure the things are running smoothly this is quite a big fuck up, i sold all my EOS after the news, I got sick of so much incompetence

[26-Jun-18 09:18 AM] jeezy#3408
I agree from a professional standpoint that you could hire a team for 10k a day making sure that stuff runs smooth

[26-Jun-18 09:22 AM] NoLandBeyond#2267
and this is nothing, EOS has so many issues that haven't even surfaced yet it's crazy, wait until people realize that BP's are not only getting paid 10k daily but they are also allowed to speculate on  RAM prices practiced on EOS blockchain, there are people that tripled their amount of EOS in just 5 days by buying and selling RAM lol
