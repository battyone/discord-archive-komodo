[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Keppie#5156
When creating a new wallet, i should not use the agama seed generator ?

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Keppie#5156
No idea what the breach is

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
Just make a paper seed

Or verus agama are fine

[05-Jun-19 10:48 AM] BanHammer#8115
Is this the reason Bittrex had KMD maintenance?

[05-Jun-19 10:48 AM] BanHammer#8115

[05-Jun-19 10:49 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[05-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Keppie#5156
This whole security thing is a mess. It’s insane to think this breach could have cost us all a ton of money.

[05-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Keppie#5156
I assume the dev’s sweeped all of our addresses using the same method as the hacker intended to do?

[05-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Markus#5464
Who said there was any hacker

[05-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Markus#5464
pretty sure there was not

[05-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Keppie#5156
@Markus they wouldnt have sweeped everything without a real threat

[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Markus#5464
It was a threat but there was no hacker, they did it to secure ppls funds meanwhile they solve the issue

[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a hacker

[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there was an exploit in upstream

[05-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Markus#5464
but no funds were lost?

[05-Jun-19 11:21 AM] gcharang#6833
not yet

[05-Jun-19 11:23 AM] 차미숙#8912
Oh so there was a bug but that hacker didn't think about kmd yet?

[05-Jun-19 11:23 AM] 차미숙#8912
Like the bug was for some other IT shit

[05-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think during the following days we will see some coins with big probs that got maliciously attacked exploiting the vulnerabilities

[05-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Good to see kmd devs on top of things

[05-Jun-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont know what other projects are affected, we have our hands full

So much stress ☠️

[05-Jun-19 12:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
I hope this focuses the team on the wallets for a moment.  Last night they were saying, "Quick, transfer to Ocean wallet!"  So I downloaded that and it was taking forever to sync, i didnt have enough space on my SSD and the Ocean wallet is plastered with disclaimers about how it is Beta and funds are not Safu in it.  So the team was recommending a beta version wallet as a safe haven for funds that were compromised out of their other beta version wallet.

[05-Jun-19 12:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
right right

[05-Jun-19 12:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
but the idea was, "Take your funds out of our beta wallet that was compromised and create a new wallet that has disclaimers about how your funds are not safu and put your funds in the new non-safu wallet"

[05-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
then send it to a ledger, or paper wallet, or even CEX

[05-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[05-Jun-19 12:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
I get it (sort of).  But the whole mantra over here is that the tech is top notch... that it blows every other project out of the water.  But I dont think its controversial to say that if KMD cannot be held and transferred safely, that is a big problem.

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
and what about all the other coins that barely have wallets within the KMD ecosystem.  I got OUR and ZEXO that i am unsure what to do with.  Its a giant Cluster F

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Can we let the team do what they need to, there is time to kick them later......

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
i get it, but is Agama the official wallet for KMD nor not?  Its up there on the Komodo website

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's focus on making sure everyone's funds are safe

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
and letting everyone know

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
but thats sort of my point, i dont know where to move them.  they were OTC trades

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you have a ledger?

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
> racist unemployed guy
you mean realist

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User i get it, but it IS a KMD issue because KMD hosts the file download on their site

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
it looks like an official wallet

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
i only slept 6 hours lel

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
or 5

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is an agama thread in the official discord

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is official support provided here

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
AGAMA=KMD

[05-Jun-19 12:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is an issue of optics here...

[05-Jun-19 12:20 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Guys it’ll be fine.  In two years when the rebrand finally launches we’ll look back at this and laugh at remembering how the vulnerability caused the rebrand to be delayed until 2021

[05-Jun-19 12:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@meatspoon you can send all the ecosystem coins to any other newly created secure address starting with R

[05-Jun-19 12:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
if Komodo is telling people, "use Amaga, here it is on our site, its the best thing we can offer" which is the subtext, then that is a problem

[05-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
yeah very

[05-Jun-19 12:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
@gcharang what kind of wallet?  and dont tell me Ocean

[05-Jun-19 12:21 PM] gcharang#6833
verus agama

[05-Jun-19 12:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
is there a lite wallet that works?

@gcharang that link is to a preview/beta wallet?

[05-Jun-19 12:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
if i understand this correctly, this is the problem.  There is no official wallet that isnt beta or isnt a full chain sync sort of thing.  I want to be wrong about that, so please tell me if i am

[05-Jun-19 12:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
and there are clearly naming convention issues... If two wallets are both called Agama and the idea is Agama is compromised.... sigh

[05-Jun-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
plz can we discuss this after the funds are secured?

[05-Jun-19 12:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
Fine.  I have tried to discuss this months ago in the wallet channels, giving criticism and suggestions for wallet issues.  Most of that was ignored at the time.

[05-Jun-19 12:28 PM] bishop#9773
@jl777c  Are we above the 95% secured threshold yet? I know 90 was floated hours ago

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Markus#5464
@Tek wow 7k btc buy wtf 😄

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
im just wondering how mcuh of it went through

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
volume spiked to 15k butts

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Tek#5253
so maybe all of it

[05-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
it honestly looks like some bots are constantly trying to push KCH price down then if it falls below a certain thresshold another bot starts defending the price

[05-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
BCH*

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] dokrates#8987
wow

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] dokrates#8987
komodo hacked coins of people just to protect them

[05-Jun-19 01:03 PM] dokrates#8987
well done

[05-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If a police found your wallet on the floor and decides to move it into a secure area to give back to you (with proof of ownership) @dokrates would you complain 😛 or would you rather they left it on the floor

[05-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Knowing someone can/will take it

[05-Jun-19 01:13 PM] McBeastie#0134
@dokrates  better the money with the Jedi than the Sith Lords.
May the KMD be with you!

[05-Jun-19 01:13 PM] dokrates#8987
that's not the same case. A similar would be, police found the mechanism of your door's house vulnerable, and they  went inside your home and changed the door, with a letter saying to go police station for the new key, so you can enter your home 😛

[05-Jun-19 01:14 PM] dxer666#8963
why kmd trading in bittrex disabled?

[05-Jun-19 01:14 PM] dokrates#8987
btw i think is a very  nice help from komodo.

Close enough, it’s the best thing they could do in a blockchain sense 😅 the idea remains. Yep thank you komodo for doing this, rather than everyone complaining, they did what they had to do and secured us all

[05-Jun-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we are hearing of a few wallets that we were not able to save, so make sure to move them to secure addresses if you used ANY variant of agama this year with ANY coin

[05-Jun-19 01:15 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
surprised price hasnt tanked from this
