[30-Jun-19 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep

[30-Jun-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If KMD can step up to 1.50 would be nice 😛

[30-Jun-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586

how much has BTC dominance fallen from the peak (which is when i think the ATL was)

[30-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Markus#5464
highest BTC dom was 65,9% its now 64,5%

[30-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Markus#5464
so not big change

[30-Jun-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so down 1.4%, but price is up much more, seems a 10x+ effect

[30-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Markus#5464
its strange that alts didnt recover more then this after such significant drop in btc price last week

[30-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Lennart#9331
on CMC was 62,9 now is 61,8

[30-Jun-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus why you look at price? BTC dominance is what matters, by definition of BTC dominance

[30-Jun-19 09:31 PM] p.#1126
Isn't btc dominance  always 99% :troll_thuglife:

[30-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Markus#5464
cause mostly when btc rises then alts suffer and when btc pullback then alts recover

[30-Jun-19 09:31 PM] p.#1126
Those cmc numbers might be off :troll_king:

[30-Jun-19 09:33 PM] Lennart#9331
to me it seems this BTC rally has been fueled by freshly printed tethers, no "real" new money flowing into the market. Maybe they're now cashing out real dollars to make up for their lost / locked funds (Bitfinex)

[30-Jun-19 09:33 PM] Lennart#9331
i dont know, all this Tether printing is fishy IMO

[30-Jun-19 09:33 PM] Markus#5464
@Lennart something ive found interesting this week is Bitfinex mostly have been having more then 50 withdraws of 500+ btc each time

[30-Jun-19 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i saw an article that found a 5800+ BTC going to a single address, likely from those 500+ BTC

[30-Jun-19 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds like a little accumulation going on

[30-Jun-19 09:35 PM] Markus#5464
might be Fidelity and Bakkt accumulating before launching their services

[30-Jun-19 09:35 PM] Lennart#9331
omg these are numbers..

[30-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Lennart#9331
and they buy on Bitfinex with Tether?

[30-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Markus#5464
never used bitfinex idk if u can deposit raw usd there

people only come here to complain about about marketing when kmd is dropping

[01-Jul-19 02:33 AM] meatspoon#7860
well...  I came here long ago... I have also complained about marketing (or the lack-thereof) from time to time... perhaps coincidentally as price action moves down.

[01-Jul-19 02:34 AM] meatspoon#7860
If KMD truly has the best tech, then marketing is lagging way behind.  Maybe the new joke should be 1/-marketing/tech or some such.

[01-Jul-19 02:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
I dont think kmd is in competition with the majority of what's out there. cmc ranking is pretty irrelevant to anyone besides those betting on horses.

[01-Jul-19 02:41 AM] p.#1126
Who isn't.

[01-Jul-19 02:42 AM] meatspoon#7860
The "having the best tech" thing also comes with the footnote of "but careful using the recommended wallet... because we have the best tech... and its vulnerable to hacks"

[01-Jul-19 02:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is #talk-trading. but most of the profitable trades i made this year were projects cmc chooses to ignore. they have lost all credibility with me.

[01-Jul-19 02:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
most of the crypto hype machine is completely bought and paid for upfront by liars and shills

[01-Jul-19 02:46 AM] meatspoon#7860
I see a decent amount of hype in this channel.  Is some percentage of that paid shilling?

[01-Jul-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
everyone supports and hypes what they own of course. I'm talking about fb groups, youtubers, the twitteratti etc. you can pay them and they will lie for you.

[01-Jul-19 02:48 AM] meatspoon#7860
fair 'nough

[01-Jul-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can pay exchanges to create fake volume, etc

I’m gonna write a letter!

[01-Jul-19 02:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
in 5 years I've seen lots of shit that was once a sure thing either fade away or die a violent death. i'll bet you that at least half of the cmc top 100 will be gone, merged, rebranded, exit scammed etc in the next 2 years

[01-Jul-19 02:56 AM] actionslacks#4072

It’s fucking unscalable garbage

[01-Jul-19 03:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
miners create the value for eth, take away the miners you get what? staking whales who buy up all the eth and the ecosystem atrophies and dies

[01-Jul-19 03:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

eth can be dogshit compared to other ecosystem coins.  it has first mover advantage

[01-Jul-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But it doesn’t

[01-Jul-19 03:09 AM] meatspoon#7860
the USD is dogshit.  but its the cleanest shirt in the laundry

Awesome

[01-Jul-19 03:09 AM] meatspoon#7860
compared to KMD?  it doesnt have first mover advantage?

[01-Jul-19 03:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Great job

[01-Jul-19 03:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
First mover in the unscalable category:

ETH!

Here’s your trophy!

[01-Jul-19 03:10 AM] meatspoon#7860
y'all KMD peeps are completely fixated on something that likely will not happen for years... ETH being dethroned as a smart contract platform
