or live in a nice place

[30-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
cause thats just absurd

[30-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
and i'd never agree to it

[30-May-19 08:58 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you think we agreed to the tax system in the countries we were born in?

[30-May-19 08:59 PM] p.#1126
So kmd didnt just post huge gains yesterday? Seems like that was UP not down

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog yes you did

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
when your mother signed your name on your birth contract

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
nope no gains in KMD yesterday, that was fake news

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
i didn't agree to anything tho

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
:troll_cool:

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] BlockTech#6895
Binance wallet adress went from 160k KMD to 600k yesterday, accumulating ?

[30-May-19 09:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
thats just 1 of binance's addresses

[30-May-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
well now i understand

[30-May-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
binance probably collects huge amounts of kmd through interest

[30-May-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
then they feed it to their bots to kill the price

[30-May-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD inflation isnt actually high compared to most coins

[30-May-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and is avoided if one claims interest themself

[30-May-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
lmao what

[30-May-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it only taxes people who keep their coins on exchange

[30-May-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
no, it just taxes people who keep their coins on exchange more

[30-May-19 09:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if you collect rewards you beat inflation

[30-May-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
depends on the market price and how much buy support there is

[30-May-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
cause if no one is buying the inflation you get dumped

[30-May-19 09:07 PM] Tek#5253
> be whale have 2 million kmd

[30-May-19 09:07 PM] Tek#5253
thats 100k kmd a year or so

[30-May-19 09:08 PM] Tek#5253
bought in way back when kmd was still 20 cents

[30-May-19 09:08 PM] Tek#5253
already broke even selling interest for as long as i can remember

[30-May-19 09:08 PM] Tek#5253

always smart.  wait for things to go up as much as possible before buying, because if they went up they will go up more
