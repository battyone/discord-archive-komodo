yeah BTC for the win, but thats like buying bonds and fixed income and just waiting, where is the fun?

[18-Apr-19 01:43 PM] PHBA2061#2530
There are already some implementations of Plasma on Ethereum
so yes, Ethereum can scale, the real question is to what degree

[18-Apr-19 01:43 PM] infotech-al#5583
@Markus KMD is my largest bag after BTC

[18-Apr-19 01:43 PM] infotech-al#5583
just need to diversify a little more

[18-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
then imo eth classic is better bet then eth itself

[18-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Markus#5464
more potential to grow

[18-Apr-19 01:44 PM] infotech-al#5583
i thought that also, but the ETH train is already run away, ETC is left standing at the station, it will never come close to the hype of ETH in my opinion

[18-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Ludom#5832
Eth classic is dead

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Ludom#5832
No devs

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] infotech-al#5583
strictly speaking in trading terms

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't really trade.

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
when is ETH going to update so that u can stake ETH?

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] infotech-al#5583
i do more buy and hodl anyway, i just a bot for some trading

[18-Apr-19 01:45 PM] Ludom#5832
I didn't came in crypto for the money. I was here for the exciting projects and the fun

[18-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Ludom#5832
The money came because I was in the good place at the right moment.

[18-Apr-19 01:46 PM] infotech-al#5583
I hate the word shilling, but i am a strong advocate for KMD on twitter

[18-Apr-19 01:46 PM] infotech-al#5583
i came in for both

[18-Apr-19 01:46 PM] infotech-al#5583
the money and the fun

[18-Apr-19 01:47 PM] infotech-al#5583
this is the most fun i have in tech since i started in tech, KMD is the real deal and hope it continues people need to see more of this tech.

[18-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Ludom#5832
I was in crypto before Eth

[18-Apr-19 01:47 PM] infotech-al#5583
wow

[18-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Markus#5464
any1 know what is current status on NEM? did they get the funding to keep going?

[18-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Ludom#5832
Lot of the project I saw their grounding

[18-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Ludom#5832
I was one of the lucky bastard who received bunch of NEM because I wrote "interested" on a forum

[18-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Ludom#5832
I was the first to dump it on Nxt platform

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Ludom#5832
Wasn't a good idea ðŸ˜„

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
i had some NEM back in the day, said i'll back up my key tomorrow but my computer crashed!

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
so there is that!

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
ouch ðŸ˜„

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
wasnt much

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
but still learned my lesson!

[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] infotech-al#5583
lol

[18-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Ludom#5832
I remember to trade the token of James on the asset exchange of Nxt

[18-Apr-19 01:51 PM] Ludom#5832
It was fun

[18-Apr-19 01:52 PM] infotech-al#5583
fun is just beginning, next bull run will be lots of fun, because people FOMO in

[18-Apr-19 01:52 PM] infotech-al#5583
it will be crazy

[18-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Markus#5464
fomo will start when its time for parabolic rise

[18-Apr-19 01:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
BNB started their own chain

[18-Apr-19 01:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
lots of things happening in this space, so hard to keep up

[18-Apr-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
having a single road for all traffic in a city, good idea or bad?

[18-Apr-19 01:53 PM] infotech-al#5583
bad idea for sure

[18-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Markus#5464
horrible ðŸ˜„

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
having a single chain for all smartcontracts, good idea or bad?

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] infotech-al#5583
bad for sure lol

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
who have that

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding will arrive 6 months after LN

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] infotech-al#5583
love the socratic method! lol

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just common sense

[18-Apr-19 01:54 PM] infotech-al#5583
true

[18-Apr-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody stuck in a traffic jam for hours, instantly knows that if there are many roads with more capacity than cars, no problem

[18-Apr-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
once there are more cars than the roads can handle, problems

[18-Apr-19 01:55 PM] infotech-al#5583
so you dont think ETH will be around longer, i am saying there is room for the tech and for the price to go back to $1k

[18-Apr-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say anything about longevity or price

[18-Apr-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i just asked about good idea or bad

[18-Apr-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
is the boeing max 737 automatic controls a good idea or bad?

[18-Apr-19 01:56 PM] infotech-al#5583
true indeed

[18-Apr-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
having a complex solution to a problem creates the near certainity of disaster

[18-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Ludom#5832
+1

[18-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
but boeing max had some software problem i quess thats why those 2 crashes happened

[18-Apr-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if the problem was simple, then there wouldnt have been a software problem

[18-Apr-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe having oversized engines on a small plane, just creates instability?

[18-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and all the sharding proposals remind me of unscrambling the omelette problem

[18-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not that it is impossible, it is just very very difficult and unlike to work well

[18-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the eggs taste really bad after being unscrambled

[18-Apr-19 02:00 PM] infotech-al#5583
now im not validated anymore ðŸ˜¦

[18-Apr-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding also shards the hashrate

[18-Apr-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
shard it 100x and each shard gets 1% the hashrate

[18-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
I like the way JL explain and compare technical stuff with real life situations ðŸ˜„

[18-Apr-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they can add dPoW though

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a lot of needless jargon in crypto

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
afaik Ethereum already has some Plasma implementations as scaling solutions

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
most of it is people trying to convince you how smart they are

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin has LN

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i think 100 BTC of capacity?

[18-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Markus#5464
depends how many nodes running if im not wrong?

[18-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Markus#5464
not sure

[18-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know a way to have a single road be able to allow millions of cars on it without traffic jams

[18-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i do know how to have 1000 roads with million cars on it to have no traffic problems

[18-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it is easy to imagine the two cases and instantly know that a single chain for all is just not a good idea

[18-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and what is sharding?

[18-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is splitting things into different subchains

[18-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but they all need to interact in some realtime? fashion and prevent double spends in all possible cases to be as secure as the main chain

[18-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont even bother to try to solve such very difficult problems

[18-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i prefer changing the problem into a simpler one

[18-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
since I am a simple C programmer

gotta be simple enough to fully understand it, otherwise any implementation will have bugs

[18-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is, even simple things can have bugs

[18-Apr-19 02:04 PM] infotech-al#5583
no GOLANG for you ðŸ˜ƒ

I think now it's time to select best option. KMD way is best and adaptable with new tech ways...true inovation so growing is part of it.

That explains the continuous rally of the past days

[18-Apr-19 02:57 PM] Malti#3948
Insider info

[18-Apr-19 03:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the continuous rally is because people are hoarding bnb to buy into IEO's

[18-Apr-19 03:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and because they like pumps

[18-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what goes up, must go up forever

[18-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Malti#3948
Not in the case of KMD
