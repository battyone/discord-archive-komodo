[14-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Vertigo#0439
Some ARrrrrrrRr and kmd

[14-Dec-18 01:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Zcash's zk-snarks is vastly superior to Monero's Bulletproof. One is an elegant solution and the other is using simple mixing mechanics. It's essentially checkers and chess. Lol

[14-Dec-18 03:39 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There always seems to be good arbitrage opportunities on KMD all over.  The liquidity is just low enoug. üòú

[14-Dec-18 03:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@BlackJesus it‚Äôs a fantastic coin

[14-Dec-18 03:55 AM] Vertigo#0439
So u guys expecting a dump after exchanges open back up for KMD trading?

[14-Dec-18 03:55 AM] Vertigo#0439
I hope not I have all my modos on my wallet.

Dump? Lol

[14-Dec-18 04:04 AM] jspook16#3059
Keep your Modos tucked away. 2019 will decide our fate

[14-Dec-18 04:06 AM] jspook16#3059
If coin collect can pull off mobile atomic trading and provide the volume we might just make it past the winter

[14-Dec-18 05:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Whose going to start a website for a repsitory of commerce shops that accept KMD?

[14-Dec-18 05:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The Wordpress plugin is ready as available for use.

[14-Dec-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Someone could start a searchable website that lists all the shops that accept KMD as currency.

[14-Dec-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Work with shop owners to either have an affiliate program or perhaps earn money through ad revenue.

[14-Dec-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The plugin is free and available now on GitHub.

[14-Dec-18 05:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Are there any ecommmerce vendors here that are willing to accept KMD?

[14-Dec-18 05:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Please reach out to me if so.

[14-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Lumbi#8378
@FishyGuts Zooko's closing statement is on point. zkSNARKs is the way forward.

[14-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Lumbi#8378
XMR is still a hedge for those that don't trust ceremonies...

[14-Dec-18 12:34 PM] Jacob#8416
what do you think when we start to grow? rebranding should go to the best price.

[14-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Jacob#8416
$2 is good target

[14-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Vertigo#0439
$11.50 ATH!

[14-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
20$ is good target

[14-Dec-18 12:47 PM] Vertigo#0439

[14-Dec-18 12:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My mum called me, afer losing 90% asking if she should sell now... so we must be near a bottom.

is that hash going to other forks ? or just gone ?

[14-Dec-18 12:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright yeah.... I thought it will go more down, like to 3000, 2500, 2000, 1500
just speculations.... no reason exactly.....

there is much difference in SHA256 ASICs for the past 2 years

the image miners being dumped like rubbish from a construction site was something

[14-Dec-18 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I moved my two miners to a firend's place where he rented a specific place/room to put miners in AC cooled environment.
instead of rent, I'm letting him use my old physical notary node server which was taken off from the colocation from last year.
mining pirate using these miners üòÑ

[14-Dec-18 01:03 PM] Vertigo#0439
Well in the positive side some 9 months ago if I went down 50% in one week it would be $8k now a 50% down only means $700

[14-Dec-18 01:03 PM] Vertigo#0439

bottom memes are getting fierce

[14-Dec-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder if you believe TA stuff, we are going down to 2900 pretty soon, with the next support at 1200ish if that is broken. I don't necessarily believe TA, but many people do, and it effects where people put buy/sell orders

@PHBA2061 no need to believe in it

[14-Dec-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@PHBA2061 i listen to what TA people say similar to how I read the newspaper headlines, to see what the latest lies/bias/manipulation is. Knowing what the masses are being told can be valuable, as long as you don't start believing it too üòÉ

[14-Dec-18 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am less interested in knowing what the BTC bottom will be than knowing how long it will stay there. Absolutely no TA can tell us that, they all use linear interpolation. Straight lines that all point to zero right now

[14-Dec-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think we are much more likely to see BTC @ $1K before we see it at $10K

[14-Dec-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I don't need to use fake math for that estimate

[14-Dec-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTC @ $1K for a day or so doesn't mean much. BTC @ $1K for 3 months is veeeery different

they're trying to squeeze the $3000 crowd hard
make them believe they'll get it so everyone loads up on shorts
then, shoot the fish in the barrel
