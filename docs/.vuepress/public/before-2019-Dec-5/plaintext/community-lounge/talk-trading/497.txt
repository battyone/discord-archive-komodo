Thankfully the govt is still mostly inept but as crypto adoption increases I‚Äôm certain scrutiny will follow.

[29-Mar-19 08:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Government will always be inept

[29-Mar-19 08:30 PM] actionslacks#4072

[29-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Or even more

[29-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean someone can be rude, but no spitting is necessary

[29-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Minnesotans are an odd bunch anyway

[29-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337
I will just be rude backwards, and if he is still rude, I will beat him up senselessly

[29-Mar-19 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337
However no lives were lost

[29-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337

[29-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[29-Mar-19 08:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
