[01-Aug-19 02:09 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ouch

[01-Aug-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Specially if it grows in a day

[01-Aug-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Then selling is the best option, cos it can only go down

[01-Aug-19 02:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Now I know why you so worried every drop

[01-Aug-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Then I could rebuy it

[01-Aug-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
stuff like that

[01-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
So instead of crying about my constant losses day after day, I rather spend time coming here and being mental and annoying those who are annoying me @ first place ( :

[01-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
But, at least we are not at 0.50$ anymore

[01-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
We need to give it more time

[01-Aug-19 02:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hold alts when btc dominance is so high is bad

[01-Aug-19 02:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Doesn't matter the alt

[01-Aug-19 02:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Kmd looses less than other coins really

[01-Aug-19 02:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But still money flows out

[01-Aug-19 02:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Especially before or during btc moves

[01-Aug-19 02:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We reaching point where many traders expect strong move

[01-Aug-19 02:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
As we reach multiple year long pivot points

[01-Aug-19 02:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Smart money already exiting alts

[01-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Btc goes up, kmd goes down

[01-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Btc goes down, kmd goes down

[01-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Kmd goes 10-15% up, everyone jerks off in ecstasy

[01-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
even tho we are like 35% down in a week

[01-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Caglio#3337
But top 10-20 coin easily

[01-Aug-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
Price drops to 1k satoshi.... great we fill bags

[01-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I mostly just consider how it is doing vs the other alts

[01-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
and right now the answer is quite poorly

[01-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
back down to 60th rank

[01-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[01-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Sdunbar#5064

[01-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Sdunbar#5064
heading that way now i seems

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
We have been almost 70 like few weeks ago

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
But we dont have to be unhappy, we need to buy more

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
Its bargain at 1$

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Sdunbar#5064
im done buyin at this point

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Sdunbar#5064
have been for a long time

[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
That is the smart thing to do

[01-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I'd have to be confident it will have value one day but after 2 years ive reached the point im not sure anymore

[01-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Sdunbar#5064
have to re-evaluate first

[01-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Sdunbar#5064
make sure it actually IS a good idea

[01-Aug-19 02:31 PM] actionslacks#4072

[01-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Sdunbar#5064
lol

[01-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Caglio#3337
Fuck my beliefs

[01-Aug-19 02:32 PM] grumpygoron#4320
It‚Äôs the best recommendation of any product or brand to suggest ‚Äújust buy more‚Äù when things are bad üòÇ hoping the community will throw more money in to make a bad situation not look worse.  Rather than the supporters hoping that the people in charge of getting this out there (marketing) it‚Äôs easier to hope WE do it for free while also buying more

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Marketing... what marketing

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Worst dead marketing ever

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] dan.#2473
gonna bring the people pissed off out of the woodwork, but price is not dollar/tech, its marketing. this entire fuckin space is marketing. if you didnt take _any_ gains you're fuckin nuts and greedy

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Exactly dan

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Marketing we dont have

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos we cannot afford anything

[01-Aug-19 02:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
