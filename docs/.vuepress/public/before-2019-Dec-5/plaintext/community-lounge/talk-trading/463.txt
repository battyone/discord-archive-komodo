[13-Mar-19 02:39 AM] yorklab#7270
@REX I believe it's reputable. Yes, there is KYC. There are certain states in the US (more than I thought) that cannot use the site.

[13-Mar-19 02:41 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Mar-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When december pump in 2017 it hit some stupid price on binance for a few seconds... It looked like after msot of the order book was sold, someone just bought the rest for lulz

[13-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
why are people dumb enough to pay 4x as much for something on one exchange, compared to its price elsewhere

[13-Mar-19 02:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe they know they can sell it alter for more? 🤷

[13-Mar-19 02:44 AM] yorklab#7270
Maybe the only place they can buy.

[13-Mar-19 02:45 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 02:45 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 02:45 AM] yorklab#7270
I'm just wondering why they suddenly felt the need to buy; what prompted it?

[13-Mar-19 02:45 AM] 74D30#6106
