Markhanna went long so we may crash to 3800

[07-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The delay was just an excuse to dump the whole market. It was already known there was a high chance of it being delayed until September. SEC can delay it up until March if they wish.

then what to expect when they'll have no choice but approve it ðŸ˜’

[07-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe this is only a matter of time

more blood -> more weak hands on panic

[07-Aug-18 10:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm same old way to pump with good news
Then panic sell with not so good news.
Also making a news out of no news....

i hate this ETF BS... don't need them and don't want them... if people want to invest in crypto, then  they should buy crypto, like everyone else too... if they are not intelligent enough to do that they should invest their money in "Pork Bellies Futures"

[07-Aug-18 11:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
B..but institutional money and custody

[07-Aug-18 11:27 PM] bishop#9773
The ETF actually needs to hold the underlying coins for it to have any real value

[07-Aug-18 11:27 PM] bishop#9773
if it is just a tracker like futures, no actual demand

[07-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How will these custody issues be resolved?

[07-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Joe basementdweller ex-NEET is a network security guy for 60k/yr

[07-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Has ability to view private keys to 5 digit bitcoin stack

[07-Aug-18 11:29 PM] bishop#9773
Coinbase charges 1% annually to custody Bitcoin for institutions

[07-Aug-18 11:30 PM] bishop#9773
most likely a small fraction for redemptions with a multisig wallet 3 of 5, 5 of 7 dealio for the bollus

[07-Aug-18 11:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe only the CEO has access to the vault where the in-house encryption keys are held?

[07-Aug-18 11:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True

[07-Aug-18 11:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Forgot about multisig

[07-Aug-18 11:32 PM] bishop#9773
When a true ETF product does come to light (that actually holds coins and doesn't track an index), I'll propose a 1% allocation for our model portfolios

[08-Aug-18 12:50 AM] ryman112#0068
Down she goes

[08-Aug-18 01:19 AM] ryman112#0068
Kmd firesale though.  Gonna have to grab some more.

[08-Aug-18 01:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm telling you 3k btc 2019

[08-Aug-18 02:01 AM] bishop#9773
I disbelieve

[08-Aug-18 02:04 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I've got my money where my mouth is sitting on it in coinbase :)

[08-Aug-18 02:04 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Usd... Haven't bought anything lol

[08-Aug-18 02:10 AM] bishop#9773
I may be interested in a KMD bet

[08-Aug-18 02:12 AM] bishop#9773
85% drawdown from highs, gross

[08-Aug-18 02:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
My main bet is in BCH I can see that flippening happening during this bear and BTC will have no means to reflip it

[08-Aug-18 02:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The flip will instantly be insane gains and I think that'll be before komodos moon

[08-Aug-18 02:34 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Alot of people never saw the Myspace -> Facebook flip or the Yahoo -> Google. It's coming don't worry

[08-Aug-18 02:36 AM] bishop#9773
BCH... ewww

[08-Aug-18 02:36 AM] bishop#9773
I'm not a core guy but bcash, no no no

[08-Aug-18 02:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It's better for the ecosystem that something that can scale becomes the base. Not to core/ethereum

[08-Aug-18 02:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Core and ethereum are both scaling on dreams

[08-Aug-18 02:37 AM] bishop#9773
8MB blocks doesn't solve the underlying scaling issues

[08-Aug-18 02:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
32mb

[08-Aug-18 02:37 AM] BlackJesus#6161
They forked like 2 months ago

[08-Aug-18 02:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Heck Komodo is forking in a couple of weeks at block 1million

[08-Aug-18 02:38 AM] bishop#9773
might as well go 1gb blocks ðŸ™„

[08-Aug-18 02:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
They eventually will

[08-Aug-18 02:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
At that point vendors and miners will be running nodes

[08-Aug-18 02:39 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Everyone else will use spv proofs to access their funds

[08-Aug-18 02:39 AM] bishop#9773
Well good luck

[08-Aug-18 02:39 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The way Bitcoin was always intended to be used

[08-Aug-18 02:39 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Spv Merkle proofs

[08-Aug-18 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
times have changed, btc isn't going to be used for day-to-day

[08-Aug-18 02:40 AM] bishop#9773
there are better alternatives for that

[08-Aug-18 02:41 AM] bishop#9773
cash-like txs should have 10min block times (so your bch doesn't solve that)

[08-Aug-18 02:41 AM] bishop#9773
shouldn't*

[08-Aug-18 02:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161
BTC as a digital gold doesn't work. Usage drives price

[08-Aug-18 02:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If usage creates high fees then users leave

[08-Aug-18 02:42 AM] bishop#9773
and the hashrate is what exactly?

[08-Aug-18 02:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
10minute settlements beat visa/mastercard/amex 3-5 day settlements do you know what a pending transaction is. :/

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The hashrate is negligible miners mine what's profitable

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] bishop#9773
10 minute blocktimes will not be used for day-to-day txs

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Bitcoin's hashrate could easily be subjugated to BCH's they aren't going to mine at a loss.

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] bishop#9773
not from a practical standpoint anyway

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It should be

[08-Aug-18 02:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
And 10 minute settlement destroys everything we have on the fiat system

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Ever made a 10k bank transfer on coinbase

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Wait 7 days

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
That's settlement

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
I agree the traditional settlement is broken

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
no argument there

[08-Aug-18 02:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The chain is meant for day to day transactions point blank or it's worthless

[08-Aug-18 02:45 AM] bishop#9773
so use a faster blockchain and settle on the mainchain

[08-Aug-18 02:45 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Why do that when the main chain can just work and I don't have to get an IOU

[08-Aug-18 02:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I can actually get my coins in 10 minutes and not have them escrowed in a hot wallet until resolved onchain

[08-Aug-18 02:48 AM] bishop#9773
then you should believe coins like KMD are pointless in the grand scheme of things

[08-Aug-18 02:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Kmd offers localized solutions and a defense community to avoid centralized offerings

[08-Aug-18 02:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Decentralized community*

[08-Aug-18 02:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I've been with kmd for a while now. Recyling hashrate is ingenius and I see becoming a standard of local blockchain solutions

[08-Aug-18 02:53 AM] bishop#9773
but your point was just that the main chain can just work... everything else at that point is noise, is it not?

[08-Aug-18 02:53 AM] bishop#9773
one block chain, no need for anything else, right

[08-Aug-18 02:58 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You misinterpreting the base currency has to just work no frills. Be safe always work, consistent network fees.

[08-Aug-18 02:59 AM] bishop#9773
I guess I fail to see how you can make exceptions... if you want personalized solutions, then you admit the need for multiple blockchains. If you made it that far, then day-to-day txs can use a faster blockchain. Hence, BCH doesn't solve anything

[08-Aug-18 03:00 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Komodos has purpose for how they are enabling personalized blockchain solutions with the security of the highest hashpower chain. Bch solves bitcoin. Komodo is not Bitcoin and isn't trying to be.

[08-Aug-18 03:01 AM] bishop#9773
so if I have a 1 second blockchain backed by bitcoin's hashrate how is BCH relevant?

[08-Aug-18 03:01 AM] BlackJesus#6161
For some reason you guys think bitcoina hashrate is loyal which is wholly hilarious.

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] bishop#9773
until proven otherwise....

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
When BCH is worth more than BTC the hashrate will follow

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] bishop#9773
if*

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
No if

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It's going to happen

[08-Aug-18 03:02 AM] bishop#9773
guess I love your facts about the future

[08-Aug-18 03:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Venders are already abandoning it as well as the biggest businesses birthed from it

[08-Aug-18 03:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Bitpay bitmain owe everything to Bitcoin and they have moved to BCH

[08-Aug-18 03:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If they don't know the market no one does. /End rant

[08-Aug-18 03:04 AM] bishop#9773
bitmain stockpiling BCH.... shocker.

[08-Aug-18 03:04 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I guess they don't know the market

[08-Aug-18 03:05 AM] bishop#9773
Well, I look forward to being proven wrong. Until then, BTC is king

[08-Aug-18 03:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
And became a company with more revenue than Samsung on accident

[08-Aug-18 03:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Samsung which owns the entire Asian Cell Phone Market.

[08-Aug-18 03:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Which is vastly superior to the euopean market

i agree with rejection of ETF

Oooh kill 'em markets new lows

[08-Aug-18 07:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I cant see it going below 5k too much buying historically between 5.5k and 6.5k
