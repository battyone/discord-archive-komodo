25k sats right now

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
thats not too bad

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] altcoinist#1501
Looks like hype is over

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Mainly I'd just like to see it uprank itself vs other coins

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
its done well enough through the bear though

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
didnt lose a ton of places

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Markus#5464
Ofc it will be 2-3 dollars at some point but we had to cross 30k everyone was having big hopes for that then this happens

[02-Mar-19 04:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
new coins hit the market all the time so for it to maintain a ranking of 50th place on CMC is quite good imo

[02-Mar-19 04:24 PM] Markus#5464
well 98% of new coins got no use case its just a money grab

[02-Mar-19 04:24 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yep

[02-Mar-19 04:24 PM] altcoinist#1501
Every time I sell it kmd goes up. Should I sell now? 😂

[02-Mar-19 04:25 PM] Markus#5464
never sell with a loss in crypto, especially not komodo

[02-Mar-19 04:25 PM] Markus#5464
it could recover tomorrow

[02-Mar-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
I feel expert traders will punch me for this words hehe

[02-Mar-19 04:26 PM] Sdunbar#5064
never sold once personally

[02-Mar-19 04:26 PM] Sdunbar#5064

`Listing on huobi caused this dump cause price on huobi was 24.5 when it was 27 everywhere else`
You give "average" traders far too much credit

[02-Mar-19 04:27 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Well it did set up an arb scenario where the price should equalize

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
somewhere between the two values

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
am i wrong on that?

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bait

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
not enough volume on huobi to arb

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Sdunbar#5064
fair enough

[02-Mar-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
huobi is a game for the trading contest

[02-Mar-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the traders want to push the price lower, so they have inventory to sell at higher. they are happy they got others to sell to them

[02-Mar-19 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What are the minimally acceptable specifications for a Komodo notary node?

[02-Mar-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
64GB RAM, TB SSD

[02-Mar-19 04:33 PM] altcoinist#1501
Kmd is 18 k Satoshi on Cryptopia. I wonder if it'll be possible to buy it at this price when cryptopia will go live

[02-Mar-19 04:33 PM] peritonlogon#7708
So I up my ram to over 64 gb on my 8 year old work station / server that would work? It's got like, 2 old xeons.

[02-Mar-19 04:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
32GB no bueno?

[02-Mar-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
32GB will likely run out of memory, also this assumes a relatively modern CPU. wont work on a nintendo, even if you put in 64GB of ram

[02-Mar-19 04:37 PM] Sdunbar#5064
correct me if I'm wrong but Huobi added KMD without KMD paying any sort of listing fee?

[02-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$350/mo for a VPS that would support that

[02-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Roughly

[02-Mar-19 04:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
idk but huobi probably added kmd on their own

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
AWS pricing anyway

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
👆  @Hollowman9000 Yep.

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn’t check digital ocean or others

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
25% of the KMD you get (if you use the KMD to pay for it).

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Notary Node works is not glamorous.

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
At current price?

[02-Mar-19 04:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
true

[02-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s a healthy return

[02-Mar-19 04:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its about supporting the system.  Node holders would also be in very strong positions to grow the brand.

[02-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Alright#0419
you should shop around to DCs themselves if you plan to run a notary

[02-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Alright#0419
rent a dedi at a yearly rate

[02-Mar-19 04:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Pirate is running for 2 nodes at least.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 pledge some % to LABS notarization tx fee fund? 🙏

[02-Mar-19 04:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Explain @Alright

[02-Mar-19 04:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085

lol

[02-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
to notarize a chain, notaries must pay a transaction fee with each notarization. We plan to fund this with a KMD notary node or several pledging some % to this fund.

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
BTC o KMD?

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
if not, our notaries will be responsible for getting the KMD themselves, which is not great

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
KMD

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What is the notarization fee in BTC?

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
LABS doesn't touch BTC

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Annual estimate of costs?

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For notaries only

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
1 KMD/chain/day

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know there are others.

[02-Mar-19 04:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Dont you guys do a [redacted] large number of chains at a time sometimes?

[02-Mar-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if not, our notaries will be responsible for getting the KMD themselves`
I was under the impression we were doing it that way and made allowances to that end

[02-Mar-19 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
My plan( if elected) is split all mining rewards between myself and a multisig. Multisig funds will only be used if LABS notaries requests KMD from it

[02-Mar-19 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
Hoping the multisig can just grow and grow, so we have some stability. I don't want our notaries to have to worry about purchasing KMD to keep the network going

[02-Mar-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so LABS NNs have pure profit and no overhead? 🤔

[02-Mar-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
Need a VPS

[02-Mar-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
and knowledge

[02-Mar-19 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
and community involvement

[02-Mar-19 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```diff
- pure profit
+ pure profit less $240 per year
- no overhead
+ no coinage overhead```

[02-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how many hours have you spent managing your testnode notary?

[02-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s like 3.5 cartons of Marlboro reds brah

but test vs live, 30 seconds with each new chain

[02-Mar-19 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
8x a day 😛

[02-Mar-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not saying that it's "no work"; just that I'm not that altruistic or Socialist to maintain 2 nodes and put in work on one of them to pay for someone else to profit off theirs for them not doing 2x the work

[02-Mar-19 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_feels the need to remind that he has spent in excess of 5k hrs paying out of pocket to work on "free" projects_

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `I'm not that altruistic or Socialist to maintain 2 nodes and put in work on one of them to pay for someone else to profit off theirs for them not doing 2x the work` huh

[02-Mar-19 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's no way to word it and *not* sound like a dick, but....
Why should I run a KMD NN *and* a LABS NN **and** use my KMD NN income to pay for someone else to run their LABS NN for free/less?

[02-Mar-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, yea man, no worries

[02-Mar-19 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've no issues with kicking in when needed but promising a dedicated amount just isn't me

[02-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
not a big deal, I just think we should have some dedicated source of funds for it. We can support ~50 chains with 1 full KMD notary's mining rewards. Not having KMD to fund it is a good problem to have as it would mean we have a tonne of LABS chains 😛

[02-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
KMD ICO'd to fund BTC tx fees for years to come

[02-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
I'm hoping this can be the equivalent for LABS
