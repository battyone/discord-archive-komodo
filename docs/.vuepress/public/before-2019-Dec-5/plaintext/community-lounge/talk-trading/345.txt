Barrel?

[18-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Vertigo#0439
Or a 7.62x39 AR pistol for  900kmd

[18-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Vertigo#0439
No just stripped upper

[18-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never understood the rifle caliber ‚Äúpistols‚Äù to be honest

[18-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Much fireball, such sad velocity

[18-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Vertigo#0439
7.62 works 223 sucks since it relies on speed only.

[18-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
In a short Barrel is just a powerful 22lr

[18-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have an AK, most x39 ammo offers nothing more than glorified pistol profile wound tracks

[18-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have Tula 8M3 but even that‚Äôs been shown to be questionable

[18-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Vertigo#0439
I use this Tula soft point ammo for hog hunting

[18-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Their 160gr .308 soft tip showed pretty promising results

[18-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not a stretch to think their x39 offering performs

[18-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Vertigo#0439
Search pewpewtube on YouTube I reload ammo and test them. On gel and chronograph

[18-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So how‚Äôs it do on the hogs

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Vertigo#0439
So far only tested 380.....

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
380?

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Acp?

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
:abusedsmily:

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Torturing those hogs

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah from a tiny Taurus tcp

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Vertigo#0439
No 7.62x39 on hogs

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Vertigo#0439
380 testing on ballistic gel only

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I know, how‚Äôs the softpoint do on the hogs

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Good stopper?

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Vertigo#0439
Good like a 30-30

[18-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Vertigo#0439
I haven't seen any hogs this year the damn coyotes are rampid running everything away...

[18-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Coyotes are shoot on sight too

[18-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pew pew

[18-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe I don't know the coyote rules here in Fl

[18-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Vertigo#0439
I don't know if they are consider pest or not

[18-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm in a commie state to the north of you, probably couldn‚Äôt transfer the pistol anyway

[18-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don‚Äôt pay attention to the shitty new laws they keep passing

[18-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah in NJ is a felony to possess any mags with more than 10rds now

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
LEOs too üòÜ

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah...

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But they‚Äôll soon fix that

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Something about animals and more equal than others

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Vertigo#0439
Lol

[18-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Vertigo#0439
My AR identifies itself as a single shot 22lr so it should be ok.

[18-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bought a bunch of lowers before our ban

[18-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thinking a 6.5g is in the cards

[18-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Vertigo#0439
Nice yeah I'm stocking up some ammo  before the next presidential election.

[18-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[18-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Vertigo#0439
But but ar10 much more powerful

[18-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Vertigo#0439

I sold my last bit of DGB two days ago went all in kmd lol

[18-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Likewise#6767
keep on eye on that volume, at 26 BTC yesterday now at 70. Usually volume picks up once they start pumping. Have noticed that over last couple of months. Usually over th span of a few days it hits 150 to 200 BTC, then it starts dropping.  Made quite a bit over the last few months following that pattern\

[18-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Vertigo#0439
Pamp it!

[18-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Likewise#6767
look at the volume, then look at volume of others

[18-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Likewise#6767
1560 should hold though and hopefully we are off to the races

[18-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:37 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[18-Dec-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[18-Dec-18 02:50 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Likewise#6767
yestrday it was around 30 to 40. today 70 btc sometimes 26 btc, really low volume. At the end of a pump  I noticed it reached 200BTC volume, then sell off back to 30 btc volume.......üòè some group just plays with it

[18-Dec-18 03:34 AM] jspook16#3059
Anyone remember when waves was about a dollar in the past few weeks?

[18-Dec-18 04:08 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes, what gave it this boost to 2.5$ ?

[18-Dec-18 04:13 AM] jspook16#3059
I think they released some long awaited for functionality but I didn't read what it was exactly. I hope our day comes as well

[18-Dec-18 04:17 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[18-Dec-18 04:27 AM] jspook16#3059
Well I'm at the mercy of whale bro now. Pirate killed my kmd stash and then the market murdered my portfolio

[18-Dec-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

"So exchanges receive a total of USD 48 million in coins per day. What percentage are they selling every day? Let‚Äôs assume 50%: that‚Äôs USD 24 million every day" exchanges make about double the coins miners are mining

[18-Dec-18 11:28 AM] PHBA2061#2530
no matter how the market is, bearish or bullish, exchanges always make money out of it üòÇ
