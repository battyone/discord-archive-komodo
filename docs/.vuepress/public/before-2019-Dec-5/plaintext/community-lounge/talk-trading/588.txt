Oh, I guess you just look like the guy who put a couple of wheel gun rounds into Mel's big rig.  But with better equipment.  Perhaps a long lost sibling in the wastelands with similar tastes for face-covering accessories/neck-braces.

@Hollowman9000  what do you think of THC? Hempcoin. They're migrating to kmd? I saw a comment of yours on their message board that didn't look positive.

[29-Apr-19 04:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Bitboy when was that comment made?

ok so I got this email from Bitfinex:
_Dear Bitfinex trader,
By now, you may be aware of the events of the last 48 hours, but I want to personally give you an update on what has happened and how we are proceeding as a business._
...
_We have been humbled and encouraged by the support we have seen from our customers and wider community in the face of these allegations. We are here to assure you we‚Äôre as strong as ever, we are not going anywhere, and we‚Äôre unwaveringly committed to you. _

now this is getting interesting. I think I also saw some rumourmongering about how a major part of the EOS ICO was sunk into this Ponzi to kite it along a little bit further- no idea if true, but it could really facilitate a nice blowout of shitcoins like EOS üåã üöΩ

[29-Apr-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
EOS just recycled the same funds over and over and bought vast majority of their tokens. established a high marketprice and dumped it all, a nice multibillion dollar gain. and nobody can complain as their legal agreement was worded such that they could do whatever they wanted

trading at OTC price now

[29-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
having OTC sales at half the price of IEO (at the same time) almost guaranteed this outcome

[29-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems a discount of 20% or so should be the most for big buys

[29-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
selling at the same time to different people at 2x price... it is just not a good dynamic

[29-Apr-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`sounds like a pyramid scheme`
most commodity coins are

[29-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
big whales get to buy at half price. granted half the coins were locked for a while

[29-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but they could sell half at 2x the cost right after market opened and before deposits were allowed...

[29-Apr-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and the rest of the coins are profit, however much vbk trades at when they unlock
