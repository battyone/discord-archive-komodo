[05-Nov-19 09:04 PM] JimD#9272
I guess Im somewhat lucky I was poor during the 2018 so I didn't get whacked by the market capitulation

[05-Nov-19 09:04 PM] JimD#9272

[05-Nov-19 09:04 PM] JimD#9272

[05-Nov-19 09:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is it obligatory to say average cost?

[05-Nov-19 09:10 PM] richardt#2807
My gut feeling told me it would go under 0.50 and that would be a good time to buy

[05-Nov-19 09:12 PM] richardt#2807
Difficult to predict satoshi's nowadays, now that bots try to peg things to USD

[05-Nov-19 09:12 PM] richardt#2807
And BTC doing whatever it wants

[05-Nov-19 09:13 PM] Oszy#5734

[05-Nov-19 09:13 PM] JimD#9272

[05-Nov-19 09:14 PM] richardt#2807
Anytime an alt wants to pump, BTC ruins the party

[05-Nov-19 09:19 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
