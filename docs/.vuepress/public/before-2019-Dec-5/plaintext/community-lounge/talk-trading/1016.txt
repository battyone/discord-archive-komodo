[05-Aug-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
price going down but u make less bearish momentum

[05-Aug-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
thats very bullish

[05-Aug-19 07:25 PM] allbits#5898
@digital bullion that's a misleading characterisation that you shared

[05-Aug-19 07:37 PM] p.#1126
we go to 6-7K first

[05-Aug-19 07:37 PM] p.#1126
and potentially die there

[05-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Markus#5464
going below 8k would ruin 1 year support

[05-Aug-19 07:37 PM] Lumbi#8378
what would trading be without a whiff of  p a n i c   -- from time to time. 😉

[05-Aug-19 07:38 PM] Lumbi#8378
that's how orders get filled

[05-Aug-19 07:38 PM] p.#1126

@Markus dont feed the birds 😛

[05-Aug-19 08:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The amount of time @Caglio and @p. spends in here can be better spent on socials as it would help the project. Instead you guys sit here and waste time and potentially cause other people to sell because of your BS all day every day.

I would say just dump and be done with it. Go enjoy life.

[05-Aug-19 08:23 PM] Neko#5830
@Markus is one of the reasons I still visit this channel

[05-Aug-19 08:39 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@p. my job to do what? I dont get paid to do this. I do what i do because i believe in the tech. If you dont believe in it just dump. @Caglio it does not help to complain daily about something we cannot control.

[05-Aug-19 08:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I bought in the 80k region if that makes you feel any better?

[05-Aug-19 08:41 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 08:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Cool

[05-Aug-19 08:41 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337

[05-Aug-19 08:44 PM] Caglio#3337
And just one question, a lot of people over here says: I am in here for tech

[05-Aug-19 08:44 PM] Caglio#3337
Cant you be in here for tech without spending money ?

[05-Aug-19 08:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean fuck being in for tech if it costs me 10 grand

[05-Aug-19 08:44 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats some shitty tech if it gives you losses

[05-Aug-19 08:45 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 08:45 PM] p.#1126
its the state of the market

[05-Aug-19 08:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I agree

[05-Aug-19 08:46 PM] p.#1126
but still the common opinion about this project is lack of marketing and activity

[05-Aug-19 08:46 PM] Caglio#3337
