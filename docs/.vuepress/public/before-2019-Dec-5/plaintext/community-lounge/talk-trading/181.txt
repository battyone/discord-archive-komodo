[29-Sep-18 01:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes and, if it were up to me, there would be a hard-to-miss suggestion, in red, for depositors to also send from a z-address

[29-Sep-18 01:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll buy any big bulk amount one wants to sell me of PIRATE at 0.05 KMD, if you bought at that price yesterday.

@Yassin Your BTC decimal is in the wrong place, 1M = 18.9 BTC, so it would round up to 20 BTC
