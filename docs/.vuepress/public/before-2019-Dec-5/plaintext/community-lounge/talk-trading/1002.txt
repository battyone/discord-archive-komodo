[04-Aug-19 05:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Don't think it will go down to 900 sats

[04-Aug-19 05:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Kmd is bottomed for now

[04-Aug-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
alot of divergences on kmd

[04-Aug-19 10:46 AM] Markus#5464
pretty bullish

[04-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
but i would assume thats what is happening to most alts atm so not just kmd, i think some sort of alt recover is quite close

[04-Aug-19 10:49 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
We need volume
