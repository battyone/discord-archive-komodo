and it made a lower low the last week

[16-Sep-19 10:03 AM] Markus#5464
Isnt that mostly cause of new asic miners being released regularly

[16-Sep-19 10:04 AM] Markus#5464
To me its a clear issue if u can keep making more advanced miners to increasse hash rate which make mining cheaper and coin value drops constantly for that reason

[16-Sep-19 10:05 AM] Markus#5464
Its pretty bad

[16-Sep-19 10:06 AM] Markus#5464
waiting for @jl777c to read this and sleep on it and come up with a solution for this üòÉ

[16-Sep-19 10:09 AM] Andersen#8337
It was a wise decision to remove the Z-address  support from KMD .  But unfortunately, few people know about it.

Okex delists Dash, Coinbase pro ads it

[16-Sep-19 10:15 AM] Andersen#8337
Oh, that's weird.  In the regulator's lair, Dash is available.
And somewhere in Asia he's a hindrance to everyone.

[16-Sep-19 10:18 AM] ca333#0118
we saw the problem before it arose @Andersen - even before DEC we discussed this over lengths internally and came to the conclusion that removing it is necessary to keep a healthy market position - something that many users highly value. An additional positive side-effect was/is the still experimental state of shielded transactions. However - since we have ARRR no one has to worry about privacy.

@Andersen Dash has a legal entity in Australia

[16-Sep-19 11:02 AM] Tek#5253
they lobby for Dash to the regulators to treat it like bitcoin

[16-Sep-19 11:02 AM] Tek#5253
cause it is, actually bitcoin

[16-Sep-19 11:02 AM] Tek#5253
with some things build on top

[16-Sep-19 11:02 AM] Tek#5253
I guess for america and western countries that's a done deal and dash isn't an issue

[16-Sep-19 11:02 AM] Tek#5253
but for asia it might not be settled yet

[16-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Tek#5253
@ca333 it was a good decision, I'm glad to hear this as investor

[16-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Matthias#2174
Maybe to avoid potential delistings, it might be worth for the team to notify/remind the exchanges that KMD doesn‚Äôt support z-address any longer?

[16-Sep-19 11:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
@Tek I hope you shill atomic dex to your dash groups at least as much as you shill dash here.

[16-Sep-19 02:55 PM] cipi#4502
`I feel BCH is going to outgrow BTC if they don't raise the blocklimit and stop focussing on LN`
BCH only works as long as there is a blockreward, because the txfees are like 0 and as such the miners only mine the chain because of the blockreward... when its gone, the miners will be gone
BTC thinks more longterm... after the blockreward will end, the idea is that the miners will continue to mine only with the txfees as reward

[16-Sep-19 02:56 PM] jorian#4555
it will not happen in our lifetimes, so it's not something we should worry about

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] jorian#4555
for something that only exists for 2 years

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] jorian#4555
or 10

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah, it's like jl has said a couple of times in similar situations/hypotheses

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
when the problem is nearing, they will come up with a solution

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why now worry about something that is still a long time to happen

[16-Sep-19 02:57 PM] jorian#4555
and theoretically, wouldn't BTC be hoarded like mad when the max supply is totally mined? and become a risk-off asset just like gold?

[16-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why wait to hoard it though

[16-Sep-19 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
so that would mean no BTC transactions, or at least not enough to pay miners

[16-Sep-19 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
it's already being hoarded

[16-Sep-19 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
who uses BTC as payments anyways

[16-Sep-19 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
far too valuable

[16-Sep-19 03:00 PM] cipi#4502
and far too high txfees... and blocktime of 10 minutes is also not suitable for small payments... who will pay a $1 coffee with BTC when the txfee is also $1 and it takes 30 minutes for the tx to be confirmed üòÑ

[16-Sep-19 03:01 PM] cipi#4502
pretty sure they will increase blocksize, but not as long as there are still blocks that aren't full

[16-Sep-19 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
where do you pay 1$ for a coffee though :p
