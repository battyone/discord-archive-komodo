It was looking so hopeful not so long ago

[29-Jul-19 03:18 PM] JimD#9272
We were at 1.80 and I thought I was a super smart guy

[29-Jul-19 03:19 PM] JimD#9272
apparently all the super smart guys sell high

[29-Jul-19 03:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i sold high, and rebought higher than what it is now.

[29-Jul-19 03:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There are a LOT of different levels of smartguys

[29-Jul-19 03:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
selling high doesnt mean you will re buy smart.

[29-Jul-19 03:23 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, there is always the distinct possibility of missing a major mooning event waiting to buy back in at a lower price

[29-Jul-19 03:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the anemic volume in this correction is telling tho... imo its just a matter of time and the overall market.

[29-Jul-19 03:24 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, good time to buy a bit more

[29-Jul-19 03:25 PM] JimD#9272
apparently BTC is going to 100K

[29-Jul-19 03:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
right now BTC seems posed to test lower $8k which is where it has been said it will bounce because of the weekly 20sma which is essential to build steam for ATH

[29-Jul-19 03:28 PM] house#8741
Nicola Tesla was a super smart guy ... didn't do him much good. Timing I think is more important today, above that... just being here is signal enough that you are on the right track @JimD ðŸ˜‰

[29-Jul-19 03:29 PM] JimD#9272
Bhaha, KMD has such great tech.  I have to believe merits will win out over hype in the long run

[29-Jul-19 03:40 PM] p.#1126
Every alt coin community thinks they have the best tech

[29-Jul-19 03:40 PM] p.#1126
this is the thing

[29-Jul-19 03:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
price almost not moving at all or just going slightly down on a 30btc daily volume on binance is more a signal of boring, vacation time than of a decisive move down imo.

[29-Jul-19 03:47 PM] JimD#9272
@p. That doesn't make it so, who has better tech than KMD

[29-Jul-19 03:48 PM] p.#1126
I know that

[29-Jul-19 03:48 PM] p.#1126
but every cult has favoritism

[29-Jul-19 03:48 PM] p.#1126
you think LINK or RVN, or FTM, or VSYS, or XRP care about KMD tech

[29-Jul-19 03:48 PM] p.#1126
no, they consider themselves better even if they aren't

[29-Jul-19 03:48 PM] p.#1126
and in mass

[29-Jul-19 03:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
ethereum 2.0 is coming ðŸ™‚

[29-Jul-19 03:49 PM] p.#1126
but im just talking about retail pleb mindset

[29-Jul-19 03:50 PM] p.#1126
all time low 2.0 is coming for most alts

[29-Jul-19 03:50 PM] p.#1126
but eth weekly seems close to breaking out

[29-Jul-19 03:50 PM] p.#1126
alts that survive may follow

[29-Jul-19 03:55 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, Im not sure where the next generation of retail plebs is gonna come from

[29-Jul-19 03:56 PM] JimD#9272
.the memories of getting burned in the last one are still fresh

rekt

[29-Jul-19 04:20 PM] JimD#9272
For now

[29-Jul-19 04:20 PM] JimD#9272
KMD should sneak its way into the top 20 eventually

[29-Jul-19 04:23 PM] Neko#5830
its a 1bi blockchain for sure

so analyzing the order books. the peg is strong af

[29-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Caglio#3337
@JimD at least u havent bought at 6.5$

[29-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Caglio#3337
And those top 10-20 talks

[29-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Not happening

[29-Jul-19 04:44 PM] JimD#9272
ðŸ˜­

[29-Jul-19 04:45 PM] JimD#9272
I think most stuff is timing so around now would be a good time to buy anyways

[29-Jul-19 04:45 PM] JimD#9272
who knows what the future holds

[29-Jul-19 04:49 PM] JimD#9272
Thats a pretty clear bounce

[29-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
We will see

[29-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
We wont be top 10 coin ever

[29-Jul-19 04:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats all I know

[29-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Alecandro#1179
@Caglio quit trippin bruhhhhh, itâ€™s possible

[29-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Caglio#3337
With this mindset and marketing ?

[29-Jul-19 04:56 PM] Caglio#3337
No its not

[29-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
If there is no good tech involved, we would already be out of top 100

[29-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Neko#5830
can I see KMD as a top 10 or 15 in 2021

[29-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, ppl used to say that for 2018

[29-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
then 2019

[29-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Soon it will be 2023

[29-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Same stories all around, every single discord I am in

[29-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Caglio#3337

Yaaaay, moon soon

[29-Jul-19 05:04 PM] JimD#9272
We are gonna make some money

[29-Jul-19 05:04 PM] JimD#9272
BTC maximalists may never make FU money but they are probably making some nice side money

[29-Jul-19 05:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio he bought at 6

[29-Jul-19 05:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[29-Jul-19 05:29 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No wonder y are salty

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 yeah, the best invested money ( :

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
Should have sold it when it bounced @ 7.5 ( :

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
But instead I bought "dip" at 5.5

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
5.0

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
4

[29-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
even 3

[29-Jul-19 05:36 PM] LocoMB#8593
seems crypto has become an highly specialized niche of tech and collectors afficionados, like those model train geeks and stamp colelctors of yore... ðŸš‰ these techies sure had their prcie posessions and price ponies, but the mainstream didn't give a fuck, except for the occasionall 'ahhh' and 'ohhh' when some outrageous gimmick was presented

[29-Jul-19 05:36 PM] altcoinist#1501
@Caglio how did u learn about kmd?

[29-Jul-19 05:36 PM] LocoMB#8593
now, about mass adoption adn real world effects....  I would think that cryptos ultimately do have real worls use cases and realw orld effects, but maybe we were all a bit over-enthusiastic about the time scale involved?

[29-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Caglio#3337
@altcoinist Well whole 2017 was a crypto year, so I was looking for projects that can pay off

[29-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Neko#5830
KMD will take off, but it won't be when we want it

[29-Jul-19 05:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
Pretty sure nothing paid off from 2017 caglio

[29-Jul-19 05:37 PM] Caglio#3337
I loved the privacy option it was giving, and that 5% interest seemed nice

[29-Jul-19 05:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, 2017 was the year that made most of the stuff- with up to 3 years runup (NXT or ETH anyone?!?!)

[29-Jul-19 05:38 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks oh Neo paid

[29-Jul-19 05:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
2017 made half a dozen projects get some solid support that were started  between 2014 and 2017

[29-Jul-19 05:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
nope

[29-Jul-19 05:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
my discord is slow af. Just figured it's the nsa.

[29-Jul-19 05:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
as james said- this is a marathon, and we are in a consolidation phase ... a loooong consolidation phase

[29-Jul-19 05:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Deleted User I don't know anything, my discord is slow and laggy one day and super snappy the next.

[29-Jul-19 05:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
I would suspect some javascript browser fuckery... just for fun, do a ps -ax check those insane shit that browsers do all the time

[29-Jul-19 06:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
browsers are shitty pieces of software, and js is a shity language- that makes it shitty^2 - launching a gazlillion sub-processes...
chrome is the worst I think, and many open source browsers are in fact chrome derived

[29-Jul-19 07:44 PM] cipi#4502
having many tabs open affects the performance greatly... in firefox, there is a setting called "Content process limit", which defaults to 4, but you can set it as high as 7... unfortunately 7 seems to be the max. setting

Anyone staking on binance?

[29-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Deltazulu#2710
no because "not your keys -> not your coins"

[29-Jul-19 09:18 PM] crumb#2550
Junkie seems to have too much attitude and confidence. let's see what happens. no one is right 100% of the time

[30-Jul-19 01:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@crumb only people that knows what is going to happen is the whales manipulating it up and down. They follow TA for a while until they counter trade. Grain of salt should be given

[30-Jul-19 02:25 AM] allbits#5898
That's not really true. Even the whales don't know what will happen next. That's true of the biggest players on wall street and it's true in crypto also.
