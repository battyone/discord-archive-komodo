You should check yourself.

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] Tek#5253
Maybe read the Bible. it sounds like you need Jesus

[07-Aug-19 07:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are right, you did not say 0 but you are implying that it will keep going down, if so sell now.

[07-Aug-19 07:31 AM] weldon.gull5#3242

I love that song, first time listen to it in "Wreck-It Ralph"

[07-Aug-19 08:36 AM] Flint#6435
the price has fallen as people look at bitcoin and ethereum and ask the question: why dont some altcoins fall so fast and the project with super technology is falling? it turns out that there are far fewer true holders - holders do not sell what they believe in price fluctuations - they make investments for several years - but as the chart showed, there are very few of us! the price is rolling down and most importantly there are no trading volumes! the coin is not interesting to anyone now, in spite of its uniqueness, ordinary people dont even see in it what they see in ethereum which is confident!

[07-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Flint#6435
and its not a matter of binance at all, as they try to explain here - the thing is simply that people dont see the point of losing money and it is better to wait out the dump in Bitcoin - and the true long-term unit holders as it turned out - this dump showed a lot - these extremely small trading volumes say more than any "experts"! Therefore, you need to do marketing! Tron has already shown that marketing works wonders - although the project itself is worse than Komodo in every way! The project may be ‚Äúthe most advanced‚Äù any number of times, but without good marketing, very few people who simply don‚Äôt notice altcoins in this ocean will know about it.

[07-Aug-19 08:46 AM] CoinKing88#1540
All it takes is 1  tweet from the right person to get back on the radar. Its sad but true. Look at LINK or ENJIN they pumped hard on mediocre news. It harsh to see the price bleed though.

[07-Aug-19 08:49 AM] CoinKing88#1540
The 1 thing we should not do is whine in here about the price all the time. If you cant handle it, sell and leave the channel. You can complain about it once in a while but some people are just here to whine after a dip time after time. That's just stupid.

[07-Aug-19 08:49 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I recommend the team to do marketing every day, but no one agrees.üòã

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Any technology needs to let more people know that a way to do a lot of marketing work, one way is the price rise.

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] CoinKing88#1540
"to do marketing" - the twitter of Komodo is actually pretty active. You guys want them to blow the marketing budget in a week to create some foolish short term gains

[07-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Flint#6435
@CoinKing88  Youre absolutely right! But McAfee does just not for free!)) A comment by Snowden or Steve Wozniak would be enough

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
There are too many altcoins in the market, no one really cares about your technology.

[07-Aug-19 08:51 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Why are you here then? To point that out to us?

[07-Aug-19 08:52 AM] Flint#6435
when even loud announcements such as Antara do not help then questions arise: what generally, apart from the manipulators according to the "pump-dump" scheme, will help if even loud news does not help???

[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@Flint the crypto market is still so immature. A while back a researcher from IBM tweeted about the potential of KMD, 0 reaction. If Justin Sun from Tron creates another scam contest or something everybody loses their mind. Its still your average 20-30 year old male who doesnt know anything and is chasing short term gains in the crypto. Until that changes KMD will probably stay where it is now

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
@CoinKing88 twitteralone isn't enough

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Flint#6435
he is right - there is too much garbage and it is impossible to consider good projects with technology! old adherents know - but new ones don‚Äôt come to the community during a dump

[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
where's the anonymous board promotion marketing department? where's the reddit department? where are the ads on crypto blogs?

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] Tek#5253

where are the KMD markets on exchanges?

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@Tek The blog op medium from JL777 is the best ad there is.

[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@CoinKing88 Marketing and technology are two issues, there are technical blogs with marketing blogs

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] Flint#6435
@Tek good question

[07-Aug-19 08:56 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Except for people who know about technology, few people know the existence of KMD.

[07-Aug-19 08:57 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
For example, in China, 95% do not understand technology, only recognize the market.

[07-Aug-19 08:57 AM] Tek#5253

Well we can all help that, i got a KMD avatar on the dutch forums and post about KMD when they got updates. If we all do that, we help marketing ourselves

[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Everyone saw that a lot of garbage altcoin, there is no technology, but the market value is very high, many people like it, why?

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Now the market environment is determined, not the technology leader, but the market is dominant.

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Flint#6435
remember ico  EOS- without a working project on the Ethereum blockchain, they managed to attract billions and grew even when the market fell - we need marketing gods - we need a special fund automated with voting to allocate funds for promotion! There is something similar in the little-known Smartcash project! Enthusiasts for a small fee will be ready to popularize the project on the ground - to promote - to conduct seminars - to enter into partnership programs and so on .....

[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
If the team pays attention to market development, the community will get better and better, the technology development will be more advanced, and the participating population will increase.

If so, we are also very willing to contribute to the community for free.

don't know if the core of the team can see what we said.

find a marketing god and introduce them to KMD marketing team. They are most welcome to join/help and also get paid if they are really a god of marketing.

If everyone is willing to help the community, start by looking for the god of marketing.

[07-Aug-19 09:07 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
what exactly do you mean by marketing? Paying some vip to shill or coindesk/cointelegraph to publish articles? Do you know how much does it cost? It's a complete waste. The only thing that matters long term is tech and having delopers using it.

[07-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Flint#6435
I mean the same! there are probably many people in our community who are close to excellent speakers, speakers and marketers! as well as close to universities and institutes where you can organize something like a flash mob motivating to pay attention to the project! To about technology. not only IT adherents knew, but every student and housewife! Develop a promotion system for promoters! For example, how BAT rewards in the Brave browser can do something similar for Komodo developers

[07-Aug-19 09:08 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@KomodoWorld I never thought that good marketing would cost a lot of money.

[07-Aug-19 09:09 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Simply spending money to advertise, it is not called marketing

[07-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Flint#6435
Yes, the marketing gods are not altruists! can we create a platform for the collection and moderation of proposals for promotion where the community will vote to whom to allocate funds and to whom not! Then even those who are far from the project will have a motivation!!!

[07-Aug-19 09:10 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
do you thinik advetisting is effective? I don'.t .  I prefer money is spent involving universities, CS departments and creating courses.  Showing it to the experts that will make use  of it.  That will make the difference and in fact it's the plan

[07-Aug-19 09:10 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
A variety of sales methods: such as viral marketing, hunger marketing, etc.

[07-Aug-19 09:11 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
if you have ideas feel free to propose them. What you see on twitter, reddit and socials is a 99% shillfest wishout any connection with fundamentals or actual use.

[07-Aug-19 09:11 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@KomodoWorld I mentioned, I am talking about the ideas of most people, not the ideas of people who know technology like you. The people who know technology are a minority.

[07-Aug-19 09:12 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
The KMD project is for all the people of the world, all investors, not computer technicians.

[07-Aug-19 09:12 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the whole space is still in its infancy, it's a decades long affair. The grandaddy itself Bitcoin was hijacked and turned into a pyramid scheme parked on CEX and the market likes it. Just saying...

[07-Aug-19 09:13 AM] Flint#6435
how difficult is it to integrate rewards in the Komodo into the browser extension? for likes and views for example? To increase audience reach is the best advertisement - make it viral! I personally will be ready to donate to the common pool monthly for these purposes - as it is in the same Brave browser. question to @jl777c

[07-Aug-19 09:14 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
As far as I know, 50% of investors around me don‚Äôt even know how to use wallets, just exchanges buy and sell.

[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@Flint I also agree to donate for marketing.

[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
For example, the current PI COIN project is a typical viral marketing, very successful.

[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
organize a meetup in you zone, inviting CS students

[07-Aug-19 09:17 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@KomodoWorld You made a mistake, the student is not the main object of investment

[07-Aug-19 09:18 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
komodo target is developers, the more they use the tech the more there will be value

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
hundreds, thousands of smartchains for any purpose

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Can value be seriously deviated from the price? What depends on maintaining basic operations and subsequent development?

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] Flint#6435
how about affiliate program with eSports event Wow CS Go, PUBG and so on? This is a very dynamically developing area where millions of potential members of the community - where the active majority - where easily this topic will become viral?

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Developers don't need daily expenses? Ideal society

[07-Aug-19 09:20 AM] altcoinist#1501
developers dont need kmd to run a smartchain

[07-Aug-19 09:21 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
The so-called technical staff, look at the top 100 capital of the altcoin, there are several real-tech altcoins, this does not need to explain the importance of the market

[07-Aug-19 09:21 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I think this topic is meaningless in the discussion.

[07-Aug-19 09:22 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
anyway it's a matter to have patience, Bitcoin is doing its thing and later Alts will have their turn. Komodo is very strong in fundamentals

[07-Aug-19 09:22 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Proof of fact

[07-Aug-19 09:24 AM] tagco#7905
Hello everyone, I chose KMD instead of TEZOS because I got a deep understanding of the white paper and spent two weeks understanding the information on the website and the team. After a year, what I want to say is that in the secondary market, more than 90% of investors do not have long-term plans. They only pay attention to short-term prices, and an important insight is that if short-term currency prices continue to rise,  They become HOLDERs. Please note that this is still not the understanding of the product, but the belief that pure market volatility brings. Therefore, I really hope that the project side will consider more investors in the secondary market than purely technical ones.

[07-Aug-19 09:24 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
We work now, not in the future, to ensure the benign development of the market, the normal development of KMD's community, rather than being eliminated

[07-Aug-19 09:25 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
@tagco üëç

[07-Aug-19 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is specific category of marketing needed for KMD.
Dev specific marketing.
if someone noticed the documentations and developer portals has been raised to the level of perfection than an year or 2 ago.
I always really been expecting such thing from such a solid tech project, but that lacked a combination of some specific skilled people who both understands playing with words and the technical understanding of the subject matter.
We got a team of people in that section really doing hard work in this area. Give big thanks to these guys we have such a solid dev docs.

There is also some advanced tutorials to see in dev documentations, they are really worth checking. if someone learns one can make their own Antara Modules using their own blockchain using Antara Framework stack.

[07-Aug-19 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tend to help in the education part, but I kinda stay back since I what I have in mind I want to do, I want to have it before I start something on it.

[07-Aug-19 09:26 AM] Flint#6435
we need widespread use of the token! not only on DEX, which does not interest gamers and techno-gigs - introduce a token in the repository as a reward using a browser extension! Or maybe create your own browser with VR support - this will definitely attract users! We need all students and business and ordinary housewives receiving some amount of Komodo for a tweet with the largest number of reposts! Let it be a competition - it is fascinating by human nature! Steve Jobs once made a bet playing on the nature of man and won! We are no worse!!!

[07-Aug-19 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all the past year I have been raising my dev skill level, and it wont be long I will actually contribute good enough to the education part, as an independent member of the community, without any pay from the Komodo team.

[07-Aug-19 09:27 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
More activities, allowing ordinary people to participate, very simple participation

[07-Aug-19 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I expect the same level of contributions from community, form those ppl who actually care about the project and want to see this project raised and adopted  by devs and businesses.

[07-Aug-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's specific, and those people are percious who understand this aspect and this kind of marketing that I'm talking about.

[07-Aug-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's code based marketing than words and writing of articles or documentations kinda marketing.

[07-Aug-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Take the example of the CPU market in hardware, just an analogy.

[07-Aug-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo is like "Intel Inside"

[07-Aug-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like the core of the computer system.

[07-Aug-19 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
People don't really need to understand the ins and out of the inside tech. they need product to use.

[07-Aug-19 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But the technical ones need to understand and get education on that part.
