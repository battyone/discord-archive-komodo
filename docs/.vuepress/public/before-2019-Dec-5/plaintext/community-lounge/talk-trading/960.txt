Whiplash pump dump

[23-Jul-19 01:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many coins are being transferred to their hot wallet?

[23-Jul-19 01:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
5-10% bonus?

[23-Jul-19 01:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then expect lightning dump on thin buy orders

[23-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Markus#5464

His case for gold comes as central banks get more aggressive with policies that devalue currencies and are about to cause a "paradigm shift" in investing.

Bitcoin, a real gold and digital gold, is the best investment product.

[23-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Alecandro#1179
good ol KMD, time to fully retrace the pump smh

[23-Jul-19 01:55 PM] altcoinist#1501
can you fork real gold?

[23-Jul-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you get the fork hot enough

[23-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you get the fork going fast enough

[23-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
can you stick up a fork up your ass ? sure you can

[23-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
can you stick up a bitcoin up your ass ?

[23-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
only if you put it on a ledger nano or trezor

[23-Jul-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unlike you, the rest of us never tried 🤷🏽

[23-Jul-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ugly lie, remember when you asked me how to cure your flacid cock, and I told you to stick up a bottle of tabasco up your anus. You said thank you cag afterwards, therefore you did it

[23-Jul-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd have to have one before it could be flaccid or otherwise 🤷🏽

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe u asked for a friend, how can I know

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Have to have one?

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Xir?

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe you're projecting your dreams again 🤷🏽

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
If you put a finger up your friends ass, who have a finger up the ass... him or you ?

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why are we talking about this?

[23-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Or in Genies case, a finger up your cat`s ass

[23-Jul-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why are we talking about this?`
Because, @Caglio seems to have some sort of anal fixation 🤷🏽

[23-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
We were just talking about #lifehackswithcag and a tabasco trick I teached you

[23-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
And now you turn on your teacher

[23-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Tsk tsk

[23-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Next time when you try to wake up that flacid monstruosity ( yours or your friends ) ask someone else

[23-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Ungrateful brat

[23-Jul-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
MonaCoin ! ! !

[23-Jul-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you seem to have an odd fixation with male genitalia and anuses, are you trying to tell us something?

[23-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
I am pretty sure I would be able to tell something if I wanted to, took you a while to write that response tho, I was thinking you can google ur answers faster

[23-Jul-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's 2019, no one will judge if you just come out, you don't have to hide it these days

[23-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Caglio#3337
Hide what ? I am not the one that used pink unicorn and a little sperm as an avatar

[23-Jul-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`took you a while to write that response tho`
imagine that, I have other things to do that I find more important than you
whoda thunk it?

[23-Jul-19 02:14 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah totally

[23-Jul-19 02:14 PM] Caglio#3337
Like getting invited at that first party of ur life ?

[23-Jul-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and a little sperm as an avatar`
the new komodo logo was no choice of mine 🤷🏽

[23-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, they should have used this picture of yours instead

[23-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Its better honestly

[23-Jul-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they aren't much different

[23-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Yours is pretty cute, it could attract some kids

[23-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Like cartoonish porn

[23-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
We would get sued even faster that way

👍 

[23-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
So the whole thing is that now binance will give you your 5.1% reward if you hold KMD on their exchanges?

[23-Jul-19 02:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think you will get something its based on snapshots and balances > 1

[23-Jul-19 02:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Most probably not 5%

[23-Jul-19 02:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
And if they claim once a day I guess they waive some rewards

[23-Jul-19 02:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
Interesting, thanks

[23-Jul-19 03:21 PM] dan.#2473
doesnt it make more sense for binance to do the airdrop unannounced?

[23-Jul-19 03:22 PM] dan.#2473
it might not be worth it for small fry, but a whale, if they trust binance, could send a lot of kmd there and get a big % of the air drop

[23-Jul-19 03:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
binance wants your kmd now? wtf is going on 🤔

[23-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
until binance gets hacked again , it's a risky move

[23-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
a lot can happen in 1 month

[23-Jul-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just wait until they start double moving to collect on the 2 hr wait time for deposits 😛

[23-Jul-19 03:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
a kyc exchange is openly soliciting it's customers to store their kmd bags on its servers. it's a trap!

[23-Jul-19 03:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
i aint touching that shit

[23-Jul-19 03:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not your keys, not your coins

[23-Jul-19 03:48 PM] tolken#2655
@actionslacks this is good, I’m not sure about the concern. Neo and other coins have enjoyed this ok Binance for ages. It doesn’t change the fact that you shouldn’t keep $ on exchanges, but it’s nice to know you can still get rewards ok funds you wish to trade with.

[23-Jul-19 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you don't get the rewards for KMD while it's on an exchange, the exchange is taking it for themselves, or it's being given back to miners

[23-Jul-19 04:08 PM] p.#1126
Being scared of binance is not going to help adoption

[23-Jul-19 04:08 PM] p.#1126
:yassinheart:

[23-Jul-19 04:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
i still have ptsd from cryptsy, maybe exchanges are more trustworthy these days but with the sec crackdown i would think advertising the 'interest' may bring unwanted scrutiny

[23-Jul-19 04:12 PM] p.#1126
If you are from usa then yes i would be cautious

[23-Jul-19 04:12 PM] p.#1126
But who lives in that hell hole anyways 😂

[23-Jul-19 04:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Didnt binance get hacked a while ago

[23-Jul-19 04:18 PM] Caglio#3337
And everyone got their money back ?

[23-Jul-19 04:23 PM] tolken#2655
https://mobile.twitter.com/blcucassidy2012/status/1153629968796045312 in the Binance KMD announcement thread, someone asked about where rewards come from, can anyone reply with a good summary? I know they’ve been written many times, I’m just not sure where the latest is.

[23-Jul-19 04:24 PM] tolken#2655
@p. Binance as it is today will be off limits to US citizens soon anyway.

[23-Jul-19 04:24 PM] tolken#2655
@Caglio yes, they used the safu fund

[23-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Caglio#3337
@tolken that kinda makes me feel secure ( :

[23-Jul-19 04:25 PM] tolken#2655
the safu fund is only safu as long as it’s safu 😛

[23-Jul-19 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
yeah, it’s not much different than what jl777 did, except that was jl777s personal funds. In both cases, if the hack is substantial enough, those funds will dry up.

[23-Jul-19 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
Best make sure your security isn’t Swiss cheese.

[23-Jul-19 04:29 PM] p.#1126
Lol

[23-Jul-19 04:29 PM] p.#1126
Binance vs jl777

[23-Jul-19 04:29 PM] p.#1126
Not same universe

[23-Jul-19 04:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
i would imagine binance is intrigued by mm2, perhaps this is a way to increase their footprint in the kmd'verse

[23-Jul-19 05:41 PM] Markus#5464
best for Binance would be to partner up with KMD to implement MM2 into Binance DEX it could benefit both KMD and Binance in a great way

[23-Jul-19 05:47 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe there is already a partnership

[23-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
Cause imagine Binance DEX with possibly millions of users sharing same liquidity pool as AtomicDex mobile app

[23-Jul-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
thats some good shit right there

[23-Jul-19 05:48 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe binance waiting for the test results of closed beta

[23-Jul-19 05:49 PM] coingirl87#6489
And after that make an announcement of oartnership with komodo

[23-Jul-19 05:49 PM] coingirl87#6489
But maybe i am dreaming

[23-Jul-19 05:49 PM] dan.#2473
u be dreamin

[23-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Markus#5464
well i cant see why it would be bad for binance or kmd....it would definitely bring adoption to decentralization

[23-Jul-19 05:50 PM] tolken#2655
Why adopt a proven technology when you can just write an entirely new one from scratch?

[23-Jul-19 05:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think holding the largest kmd balance outside of supernet makes binance a defacto parter in a way.

[23-Jul-19 05:51 PM] coingirl87#6489
Why do you think account of  8 Million kmd is from binance?

[23-Jul-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
not sure what binance kmd address is right now but last time i checked it had 1.8 mil kmd

[23-Jul-19 05:52 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe its my account
