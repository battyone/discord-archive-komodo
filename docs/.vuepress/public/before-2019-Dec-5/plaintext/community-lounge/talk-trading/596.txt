Fascinating to see how the November $BTC price plunge coincides with seizure of Bitfinex-affiliated funds. Coincidence? https://t.co/bQIgymcL4s // @kylesgibson @BennettTomlin

More like @radix42 is tweaking the recipie.  More to be worked out, as it appears you get every flavor of milkshake for now instead of a single, but that still has functionality and capability unlock potential, from my understanding.
