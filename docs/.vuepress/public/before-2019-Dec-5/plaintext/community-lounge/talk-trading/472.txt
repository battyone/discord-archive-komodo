Bitcoin Benny tweeted that RedFox_Labs is about to do some insane stuff. Perhaps this had something to do with Huobi spiking up yesterday.

this whole breaking resistances part is where you just buy and hold

[13-Mar-19 05:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
trading this this early might just make you accumulate  less

[13-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Tek#5253
I'm mostly buying

[13-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Tek#5253
not selling

[13-Mar-19 05:13 PM] Strob#3417
@74D30 I tried to arbitrage in the past and could make a few and low profits at the beginning but soon the BOTS came in and ate everything in their way! You look at all exchanges and if you see a big enough difference in price like maybe 7% and more, you can try to buy where the price is low and sell on another exchange where the price is higher. You can make money that way when an exchange is starting and the bots are not already filling all the gaps automatically. But you can also loose a lot when you discover the price difference is due to deposits or withdrawals suspension, infamous "wallet maintenance" and such BS.

dunno man but i've withdrawn the kmd I bought to my wallet again

[13-Mar-19 07:10 PM] LocoMB#8593
.. my KMD haven't seen an exchange since Jan 2017 🗜

[13-Mar-19 07:10 PM] Tek#5253
didn't own any kmd before late 2018

[13-Mar-19 07:11 PM] LocoMB#8593
has been a looong wait - become a way of life, just HODL (and collect 5%)

this pump is great for KMD exposure, people will start researching "why pump" 😄

[13-Mar-19 11:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thanks

[13-Mar-19 11:33 PM] Caglio#3337
@FishyGuts how do we get vote tokens ? I ask that cos I have my KMD on mobile agama, and last year I havent received any :/

[13-Mar-19 11:36 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Vote tokens are airdropped to KMD holders 1:1 for KMD they hold. Maybe you had to add it to your agama? 
When the voting begins we will have a how to video on sending your votes in.

[13-Mar-19 11:36 PM] Caglio#3337
So I need to add "vote" to agama ? gonna try it now, thanks

[14-Mar-19 12:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
why did you do this 1 day after i sent all my KMD to exchange to sell the pump 😛

[14-Mar-19 12:42 AM] ryman112#0068
The Ark people really hate on KMD on reddit lol.  I haven't done any digging but some of them say KMD is centralized due to using AWS and that ark has acheived some of the same feats 1 year prior to KMD.

[14-Mar-19 12:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ahaha.  @Caglio @Alexfrog The vote stuff isn't released yet.  I didn't mean to post it here.

[14-Mar-19 12:43 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So I deleted it.

[14-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Well tbh ark is also a solid project but kmd is steps ahead of ark , I have a bag with both projects but they should due theirs diligence before talking bs .

[14-Mar-19 12:45 AM] ryman112#0068
Agree

[14-Mar-19 12:48 AM] ryman112#0068
It was a article about creating your own blockchain in under an hour.  They claim 20min blah blah blah.  I mean seriously if you were to sit down and create your own blockchain I would imagine you would wanna take your time and get it right and not just create shit in 20min but thats just me.

[14-Mar-19 12:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I used to have Ark bag, but dropped it because toxic community

[14-Mar-19 12:51 AM] Caglio#3337
@FishyGuts yeah not working yet, well hope it will work out when needed, smt was wrong last year, and I didnt got any vote, maybe due to shitty mobile agama back then. New one is much better

[14-Mar-19 12:51 AM] Caglio#3337
I wish I have bags of anything ( : except pac coin ofc

[14-Mar-19 12:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Toxicity generally breeds when there is doubt, sorrow and fear.

[14-Mar-19 12:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If your best leg up is to talk down on other projects, you must not have that much progress to discuss.

@FishyGuts Since someone asked about vote coins here: does the ledger nano allow to receive the votes (without having to import the WIF on another  wallet?)

[14-Mar-19 01:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
pretty sure you need the agama  wallet to receive and use the votes @Strob

[14-Mar-19 01:45 AM] Strob#3417
Or cli I guess?

[14-Mar-19 01:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure you could use cli as well.  You may wanna check with support though

[14-Mar-19 02:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the vote chain will be like another asset chain , so  ledger nano won't be able to access it

[14-Mar-19 02:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
we need to hold at least a tiny bit of that pump

[14-Mar-19 02:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
thats all i ask

[14-Mar-19 02:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
