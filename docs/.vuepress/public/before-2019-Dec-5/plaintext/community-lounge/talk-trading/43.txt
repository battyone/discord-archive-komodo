at least, for EU plebs

[03-Jul-18 10:38 AM] jansako#3330
I did a test BTC/Fiat withdrawal a few days ago, worked without a hitch. Obv. it required verification etc üòÉ Tried Bitpanda as I had issues with Coinbase because my ID is from a different country than where I live. Duh Coinbase, EU!!! Hope to save some tx fees not having to do KMD-BTC-Fiat.

[03-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nice

[03-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the verification of bitpanda was weird though :p

[03-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wonder how that functions internally for them

[03-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If they‚Äôre handling KMD directly for fiat

[03-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or if BTC is still in the mix

[03-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They are probably holding a portion of kmd themselves

[03-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Like coinbase is also doing probably for btc etc

[03-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Jazzy#0001
They're probably tied into a different exchange that handles liquidity

[03-Jul-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Most cex verification makes me think of:

Just moved into coinex token a bit I think this token is going to explode quite a bit as did bnb

[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I had 150 bucks of cet just sitting on there and it returned me a assortment of about 5-8 bucks

[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So I decided to Penta down

[03-Jul-18 10:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

(Batch 2)

[03-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Either price comes down or that was a busted idea to begin with

[03-Jul-18 10:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If they do a batch 3 it be late October early November

[03-Jul-18 10:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I suspect z9 full power December/January

[03-Jul-18 10:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Second batch will get atleast 2 months just like first batch.

That pretty legit. Bitmain does have money to burn honestly

Looks like they had a hacked account, hacked many others to buy their sys then withdrew the BTC

[04-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Steve666#9642
How much would you be laughing if you had set a order up there too.....

[04-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Steve666#9642
They would probably roll back anyway with this kind of money involved though

#Syscoin Binance hack in steps:
1. Mine alot of $SYS
2. Send $SYS to Binance
3. Set very high sells vs. $BTC
4. Hack Binance API
5. Use $BTC of Binance users that use API to buy $SYS
6. Take over $SYS mining power to prevent rollback of chain
7. Hope to get $BTC out of Binance

[04-Jul-18 01:57 AM] Steve666#9642
Wait didnt this happen a few months ago?

[04-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Steve666#9642
Was with via coin the other time

[04-Jul-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
mining power can't prevent a rollback of the chain, but that doesn't matter, they got the BTC

[04-Jul-18 02:05 AM] Steve666#9642
yeah exactly

[04-Jul-18 02:06 AM] Steve666#9642
maybe it was to stop people moving sys to binance to sell at the crazy prices
