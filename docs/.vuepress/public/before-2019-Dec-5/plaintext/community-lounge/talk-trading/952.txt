likely a pay to play arrangement

@bishop I can't deal with that much drop that fast

[20-Jul-19 07:55 PM] bishop#9773
Then you're overexposed. 2% is nothing in crypto.

Rebrand would have been nice with a USD pair announcement :troll_lol:

We finally released ChainSwap first public beta!

[20-Jul-19 09:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We also made the code open source

[20-Jul-19 09:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Give a test and let is know

[20-Jul-19 10:01 PM] Oszy#5734
cool downloaded now

[20-Jul-19 10:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We use the same netid as mobile dex so you can provide liquidity and trade from desktop

[20-Jul-19 10:08 PM] allbits#5898
Congrats! Will try on Monday

[20-Jul-19 10:09 PM] bishop#9773
@siu - Chainmakers I don't see any coins to add on there, just white space and nothing comes up when searching

[20-Jul-19 10:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Click the cross in wallet

[20-Jul-19 10:10 PM] bishop#9773
Under swaps I mean. Same restriction about having coins in the wallet first before they show up there?

[20-Jul-19 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Select coins you want to activate then press ok on the bottom right

[20-Jul-19 10:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[20-Jul-19 10:44 PM] Markus#5464
sux that K64 blurred out some financial partners and few exchanges

[20-Jul-19 11:24 PM] bishop#9773
Supposed to be more clarity on Monday

[20-Jul-19 11:24 PM] bishop#9773
apparently

[20-Jul-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Nothing against K64, but how are they valued at 0.3KMD

[20-Jul-19 11:36 PM] bishop#9773
I'm sure 78M euro in funding doesn't hurt

[20-Jul-19 11:37 PM] bishop#9773
but it's not like k64 is equity

[20-Jul-19 11:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes but that means nothing for coin holders?

[20-Jul-19 11:37 PM] bishop#9773
in the short-term, no, not really

[20-Jul-19 11:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
just a drop in the bucket

[20-Jul-19 11:38 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Who provided the 78M investment or is that unknown at the moment

[20-Jul-19 11:38 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't seen it yet

[20-Jul-19 11:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I would wait for that before investing. What do the coins do on the platform?

[20-Jul-19 11:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Benny had 78M to splash around?

[20-Jul-19 11:41 PM] Oszy#5734
no redfox has 5M from K64

[20-Jul-19 11:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They should have blurred the binance logo more :abusedsmily:

[20-Jul-19 11:43 PM] Oszy#5734
dat was before

[20-Jul-19 11:43 PM] bishop#9773
that happened prior to the paper

[20-Jul-19 11:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[20-Jul-19 11:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If there‚Äôs one thing you can count on, absolutely no FOMO in KMD land

[20-Jul-19 11:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD turnstiles have cobwebs

[20-Jul-19 11:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So just so i understand, someone invested 78M euro into K64, getting a % of equity. Just say it was for 50%, that values the company without any released games at 160M

[20-Jul-19 11:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Something does not add up.

[20-Jul-19 11:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wait and see if they can deliver is the name of the game

[20-Jul-19 11:47 PM] bishop#9773
Apparently one of their latest rounds puts the valuation at 1.2B or some whacky number, although when I asked how that number was derived, nothing could be provided

[20-Jul-19 11:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
too many red flags

[20-Jul-19 11:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Indy games market is very competitive, so many studios

[20-Jul-19 11:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no way they can be valued at 100M let alone 1.2B

[20-Jul-19 11:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[20-Jul-19 11:57 PM] bishop#9773
so if that's not the case, pretty foolish to be putting that out there

[20-Jul-19 11:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I've seen people mention Atomicdex in other coin discord with others commenting how great it is but if you look at Komodo price you would think no one gave a fuck.

[20-Jul-19 11:58 PM] Markus#5464
but they have partnerships with Lenovo and Nvidia?

[20-Jul-19 11:58 PM] bishop#9773
but then you have the whitepaper that makes it sound like they are doing an IEO with 30M coins

[20-Jul-19 11:59 PM] bishop#9773
I'm actually left more confused reading the whitepaper compared to some of the details that have been spewed in their discord

[21-Jul-19 12:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs why I love the kmdverse

[21-Jul-19 12:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
as far as unicorn dreams go, K64's is really nothing compared to what other projects are promising. kmd's price non-action could be due to exchange operators getting a whiff of what kmd is cooking and turning off the taps.

Put it this way

If KMD gets price murdered then mnuchuks or whatever his name is should ban all crypto period

[21-Jul-19 12:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because that will prove the whole scene is a farce

hmmmff

[21-Jul-19 12:30 AM] allbits#5898
Atomicdex has no effect effect on KMD price. Its value is captured in DEX, which is starting to look like a homerun

[21-Jul-19 12:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
is there liquidity with dex assets now?

[21-Jul-19 12:34 AM] allbits#5898
None

[21-Jul-19 12:35 AM] allbits#5898
No price discovery

[21-Jul-19 12:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe it's just the calm before the storm. once beta testing is done and its shipped things may go a little crazy. i guess we'll see

[21-Jul-19 12:39 AM] richardt#2807
I think at the moment, a lot of people think KMD tech is still a gimmick.  They're intrigued by it, but haven't found a good reason to buy/use it.  It'll be a tough hump to get over.

[21-Jul-19 12:40 AM] allbits#5898
People use things that are useful. Atomicdex is amazingly useful

[21-Jul-19 12:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
a kyc free p2p direct exchange app seems like it would be on every crypto junkie's smartphone.

[21-Jul-19 12:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
i overestimate the average crypto investor quite often however.

[21-Jul-19 12:41 AM] richardt#2807
Sure, once it's finally available to everyone

[21-Jul-19 12:42 AM] richardt#2807
I think we all overestimate the intelligence of the average crypto investor üòÑ
