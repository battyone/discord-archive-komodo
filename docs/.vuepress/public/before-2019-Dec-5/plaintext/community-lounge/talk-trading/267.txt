Im curious to see what unforseen circumstances this will all bring about though

[08-Nov-18 07:41 PM] wolfgang#3508
THere will be negatives along with the positives

[08-Nov-18 07:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
by the way, I am really loving this channel recently.  lots of ideas exchanged, opinions that differ but are argued respectfully...  The tone and culture here seems to be improving.  Thanks to everyone that is a part of that.  Kind of different than a couple of months ago, IMO

[08-Nov-18 07:44 PM] wolfgang#3508

[08-Nov-18 07:44 PM] wolfgang#3508
plz sir

[08-Nov-18 07:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
lol

[08-Nov-18 07:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
lambo example is perfect
you sell a shitload of crypto, don't report
buy lambo, get tax+penalty 
buy lambo with crypto, get tax+penalty

[08-Nov-18 07:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
A couple months ago I was getting dogpiled if i mentioned BTC or ETH in a remotely positive light.  Recently I have been able to point out positive things about some coins that would have gotten me called "stupid" a couple months ago

Welcome to BarterDEX. Just pay the full amount of 0.00000000 BTC.

[08-Nov-18 07:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am sure they are going to try to make some examples of people to scare the rest of the herd

[08-Nov-18 07:47 PM] wolfgang#3508
@grewalsatinder   problem is its too complex for the normies - and lack of voume

PSA: if you are not a tax resident in a tax haven, you will pay LESS taxes if you report

[08-Nov-18 07:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
or life will suck under the radar because you cannot maintain a decent standard of living

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
so go above radar and get hit harder or report

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
I guess people could in theory sell crypto for cash, right?  Like that local bitcoins thing?

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
obviously unloading tens of thousands of bucks would be risky.  some dude got nailed for that

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
yup

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
but if its a matter of a thousand here, a thousand there....  shrugs

[08-Nov-18 07:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
only solution is to move, which is respectable

[08-Nov-18 07:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
but under the radar life sucks

[08-Nov-18 07:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
just keep moving. In the states, I think it could be the quiet revolution. If the user base gets large enough and just flat out refuses to participate in the fiat economy. boom... over.

[08-Nov-18 07:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
something we can hope for.  but we are likely a long way off from that

[08-Nov-18 07:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
buy houses, tax+penalty
buy lambos, tax+penalty
etc.

[08-Nov-18 08:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
Being taxed through the nose as the productive class to feed the 65% of the population soon to be unproductive will be the biggest driver for crypto adoption possibly imagined

[08-Nov-18 08:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
need to establish residency where 0 tax first, then you can do wonders
but without that even direct crypto usage won't save us from taxes

[08-Nov-18 08:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
yup

[08-Nov-18 08:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
but was that elephant able to see a bunch of other elephants humping and partying way from their sticks?

[08-Nov-18 08:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
(sadly, i think you are right, Emmanuel, but i will try to remain optimistic)

[08-Nov-18 08:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
There is a movement rising.

[08-Nov-18 08:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
don't blow your load yet, though, action.  we have barely just pulled into the drive in with our date....  we got a long time before we consummate this thing

[08-Nov-18 08:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
wish i had a lambo even with the taxes! üòÇ

[08-Nov-18 08:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
Guns are pretty important (i am not a boomer). If the dollar loses world reserve status, guns will be needed.

[08-Nov-18 08:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
All that inflation will rush back to the US and it will crush the lower and working classes

[08-Nov-18 08:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah dollar is first to inflate to oblivion imo

[08-Nov-18 08:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
de dollarization is accelerating

[08-Nov-18 08:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, unfortunately, i am not filthy rich. I am working on changing that, but it seems somewhat unlikely.

[08-Nov-18 08:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
Hehe

[08-Nov-18 08:15 PM] jansako#3330
YOu guys do realize that taxes are mostly paid based on 'tax residency', which is NOT the same as 'regular' residency

[08-Nov-18 08:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
‚ÄúFilthy‚Äù is pretty subjective.

[08-Nov-18 08:15 PM] jansako#3330
if you are staying in a country for X amount of time, you pay taxes there. period. (unless company etc...)

[08-Nov-18 08:16 PM] jansako#3330
well, that is why passports have been invented

[08-Nov-18 08:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
if in US, move before showing any prior activity
the solution i posted above is not that easy for US

[08-Nov-18 08:16 PM] jansako#3330
like I said, unless...

[08-Nov-18 08:17 PM] jansako#3330
then you must prove you earned the money someplace else etc.

[08-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jansako#3330
indeed. you must not earn any money any more for the rest of your life

[08-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jansako#3330
then there is a question of how do you stay in the US as a foreigner for the rest of your life

[08-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jansako#3330
you know of a visa like that?

[08-Nov-18 08:20 PM] jansako#3330
and once you go green card, BAM,

[08-Nov-18 08:21 PM] jansako#3330
but yes, there probably are ways around that, see most of the high net individuals

[08-Nov-18 08:22 PM] jansako#3330
@Deleted User more what YOU cannot do, like get a drivers license, not sure about buying a property... some countries you cannot buy a property if you are a foreigner

[08-Nov-18 08:22 PM] jansako#3330
obviously voting is out of the question

[08-Nov-18 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
Gun ownership would not be possible

[08-Nov-18 08:23 PM] jansako#3330
you mean 'legal gun ownership' üòÉ

[08-Nov-18 08:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, not legal.

[08-Nov-18 08:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
Right. But getting a felony gun charge as a foreigner would suck.  They might send you to the Booty House.

[08-Nov-18 08:24 PM] jansako#3330
probably with any charge I guess. Like busted while driving with a fake license etc

[08-Nov-18 08:25 PM] jansako#3330
can;t get a bank account either, can;t rent a house without one

[08-Nov-18 08:25 PM] actionslacks#4072

You can rent. I am a landlord and i dont care who lives in my places as long as they pay rent.

[08-Nov-18 08:25 PM] jansako#3330
Cost of having a kid?

[08-Nov-18 08:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
no but illegal immigrants dont pay taxes in america

[08-Nov-18 08:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
they get tax money

[08-Nov-18 08:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
But their quality of life is piss poor

[08-Nov-18 08:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
being poor in usa sucks no matter who you are

[08-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jansako#3330
There is one big question though... all of those things you CAN do, but SHOULD you? Will that make you sleep better at night? Will that make you happier? I will take my answer off the air üòÉ

[08-Nov-18 08:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
That social contract argument is so silly, isnt it?  Its amazing educated people still invoke it.

[08-Nov-18 08:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
But i also agree with jansako. ‚ÄúShould‚Äù is a tricky beast.  I personally dont initiate force against others which means i wont use coercive systems to my benefit.

[08-Nov-18 08:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
Unless i am coerced to do so.  Heh.

[08-Nov-18 11:18 PM] Vertigo#0439
Beeing poor outside USA is even worse.

[08-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Vertigo#0439
You get no help from the government. Just a big F you good luck hope u don't die.

[08-Nov-18 11:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
@Vertigo  i am certain you are right about that.

[08-Nov-18 11:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
I agree with that. It is probably better to be a poor person in modern day america than a king in the 1200‚Äôs. Aside from the obviously better healthcare a modern american receives, the poor have tvs, smart phones, often adequate caloric intake and they are incredibly unlikely to die by sword, pitchfork, the plague, etc.  i agree that being poor sucks, but it sucks massively less right now than the other 99.9% of human history. So thats something.

[08-Nov-18 11:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
You do gotta look on the bright side. But I did read somewhere that current tax rates are higher now than in medieval serfdom times.

And there is historically unprecedented upward potential. The internet is literally free college to anyone with a will to learn and the discipline to follow thru. Never before has it been so possible to start life poor and end it comfortably or even rich.

[08-Nov-18 11:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
I believe that, action. And that is a sad commentary on how large and invasive people have allowed governments to become.

[09-Nov-18 12:41 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
all of those benefits only apply to first world though, maybe somewhat to second, third world is just a shithole they don't get tvs phones and adequate carloric intake, some still live by the sword/guns, pitchforks, they create their own plagues (that funny indian village that thinks rats are gods comes to mind)

"they are believed to cure epidemics such as the plague, caused by rats"

[09-Nov-18 12:48 AM] Vertigo#0439
Everything is relative to the time and knowledge available  years from now we are going to say what an idiots we used toxic poisonus chemicals to try to cure cancer.

[09-Nov-18 12:48 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
add space to that

[09-Nov-18 12:50 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
time, knowledge and space, maybe also what we learned from history / ancestors. Europe learned from the plague. you don't see ppl in france or germany worshipping rats. it's is available knowledge, just not relevant in india

[09-Nov-18 12:52 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
back to trading though.

[09-Nov-18 12:53 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
whale-chan had his wall last time I saw at 18k. we are currently bouncing of the 0.616 fib, which is usually a bullish sign

[09-Nov-18 12:53 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
but man, without the whale, volume is low, he still had 36 btc left last time I saw the wall
