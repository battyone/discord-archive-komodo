Expecting something like this to play out on $BTC so I am opening a fat long. Honestly, trading is so fucking simple not sure how you plebs manage to lose so much money. 

Long the intergalactic bottom, stop at 0, target the moon = Lambo.

[21-Jan-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
CANT YOU SEE THE HIGHER LOWS

[21-Jan-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But nonetheless the dumping is getting less and less each time

[21-Jan-19 10:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
close to - or at the bottom I think

[21-Jan-19 10:57 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Tbh when we hit around $3100-3200 a couple of weeks ago i thought we are close.

[21-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
double bottom at 3100?

[21-Jan-19 11:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, kmd discord still one of the - if not the most active one I am in

[21-Jan-19 11:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so that's also saying a lot tbh

[21-Jan-19 11:03 AM] jorian#4555
still, 2019 could be a year long bottom

Would agree that the lack of hollowman9000 would suggest we are in the "ive forgot all about crypto now" stage.

Public sector and agricultural benift the most 😂 
Public sector is definatly going to be one of the last to adopt I think... All those ppl who are employed to litterally do nothing are not going away easily.

----

agree with crypto flatlining being a positive sign overall. Tradeview chat is dying. Also agree it could take a really long time to see anything positive despite this. 

however, longs and shorts data on bfx still show longs are a massive target, they need to be continually destroyed until they give up before we can actually go up properly.... I personally gave up and am just watching BTC, waiting for optimal entry zones and watching price action. Other traders are probably buying every level, getting stopped out, and trying again. Revenge traders who do not want to miss the next great bull run... when they all go short we can go up 😉

[21-Jan-19 01:53 PM] ver_User#6608
sadly this could be below 3k, I hope not though, hopefully a good shakedown soon and some spikes in long and short data would be enough for a new upswing.

$KMD 3D Chart: 
Support is at 1845 sats, we will see a bounce to the resistance line at 2579 sats. 
Accumulation has been growing upon finding the local bottom. The 2.6K Sat to 3.4K sat line has a lot of volume gaps - realistically we will see move above this area to 3.4K ...

i'd just like to say that crex24 wasnt able to answer my question despite asking once a day for now 4 days in a row. maybe not the best of exchanges with this kind of 'support'

[21-Jan-19 04:47 PM] ver_User#6608
In particular when it's based off one trendline and basic of basic support/resistance. Even gorillas can spot that stuff. 

The other day I saw someone post "IN 36 HOURS EURUSD WILL BE AT 1.15XX" so I said to him, probable, maybe, not WILL. He said, "SEE MY PAST ANALYSIS". 

36 hours later, euro was at 1.143...

upside seems likely, but time is the hardest factor in charting IMO, especially when making long term lows/highs or corrections.
