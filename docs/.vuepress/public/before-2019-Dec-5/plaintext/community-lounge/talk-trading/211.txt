it may have been good

[14-Oct-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but we never did, not sure why

[14-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if you say 'we welcome xxx attacking a chain backed by us, if you have any questions feel free to drop by'

[14-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aren't you drawing a huuuuuuge bullseye on your backs? 😄

[14-Oct-18 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Aren't you drawing a huuuuuuge bullseye on your backs? `
If we're right, how is that bad?

[14-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It might sound somewhat cocky and get too much unwanted attention

[14-Oct-18 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the problem is, that at start notarizations are not that significant

[14-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I'm thinking random tards ddossing kmd website or whatever they want to 'punish' our cockyness

[14-Oct-18 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean, with emc2 it took some days/weeks to make every notary to be in sync and all that stuff

[14-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not necessarily actually 51% attacking chains

[14-Oct-18 02:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so if a coin announces that its being notarized, but the network just started to notarize and there is still lag in the notarizations, the coin is pretty much vulnerable still

[14-Oct-18 02:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so that could be used negatively against us

[14-Oct-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon I'm still not seeing how that would be bad long-term

[14-Oct-18 02:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that that is why we kept this a bit silent, since we tried to prop up notarizations of EMC2 ahead of schedule and we were not sure if it would be ok or not.

[14-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`random tards ddossing kmd website` just draws Komodo further into the public eye

[14-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
long-term

[14-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
also true

[14-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But short term it would be inconvenient

[14-Oct-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So is talking to me, but you do that 😛

[14-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
🙈

[14-Oct-18 02:42 PM] SHossain#0007
if our tech is 100%, it will speak for itself and defend itself. at least that is what i think.

[14-Oct-18 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
if any issue found, we will fix it and that will make even better

[14-Oct-18 02:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's actually kinda scary to think how easy it is without dPOW
ensuring your confirmations logic includes notarizations is avery small price to pay

[14-Oct-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt 100%,we need to find out that it isnt and then make it 100%

we are always in the lookout to improve where possible.

that being said we dont want to be ddos all the time just to find some website issue not relevant to core functions

ive been waiting for an hour to get a btc tx confirmed... such future

[14-Oct-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You should have used LBTC (or whatever they're calling that "liquid" shit) :trollface:

[14-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so liquid

[14-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so 2014, mgwBTC

[14-Oct-18 03:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
wish they hadn't spiked EMC2's hashrate right before the attack
just read about it on mainstream crypto news
Komodo would have earned a reference if geocold continued

[14-Oct-18 03:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
"Geocold, who incorporated the “mischief-maker” epithet into his Twitter name in response to last week’s post from news.Bitcoin.com, had intended to 51 percent attack Einsteinium (EMC2). When the time came to perform the feat on Saturday, Oct. 13, however, he discovered that its hashrate had soared 15-fold to 1.4 TH/s. Given a week’s notice, the EMC2 community had thwarted the attack by acquiring huge amounts of hashpower. Geocold had anticipated this, and swiftly moved on to one of the alternative alts he had lined up as part of his contingency plan."

[14-Oct-18 03:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so much fail lol

[14-Oct-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given current pricing for rental, 1.4 is about on par with cost I called when I 1st hear of all this (~$3k total daily network cost)

[14-Oct-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, either I was late to the party or the "news" was

[14-Oct-18 03:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i do agree that @Geocold51 should have prepared better.

[14-Oct-18 04:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd be happy to see a public display of 51% attack on a CPU mine-able Asset chain.

[14-Oct-18 04:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
make a veruscoin CPU minable asset chain, and call the attackers.
- Display the 51% on non notarised chain. show it being reorged to whatever level they can
- Start notarizing it on @blackjok3r @Alright managed Stacked notary nodes and then show it not getting past the notarized height for reorg.

[14-Oct-18 04:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can put a bounty of this display in public.

[14-Oct-18 04:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Geocold51 interested?

[14-Oct-18 04:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright ?

{Reactions}
👀 

[14-Oct-18 04:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be make 2 assetchains. one non-notarised and another notarised.

[14-Oct-18 04:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
attack one after another to show results.

[14-Oct-18 04:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
fail or success, that would be interesting display of how 51% is done on a bockchain and also to show how to secure it.

[14-Oct-18 04:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c thoughts ?

[14-Oct-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do we have any CPU-minable algo other than verushash?

[14-Oct-18 04:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not sure mate...

[14-Oct-18 04:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I say CPU minable as that's what gives the advantage to an attacker.

[14-Oct-18 04:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can even chose equihash for assetchain which is default

[14-Oct-18 04:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or even PoS

[14-Oct-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Was curious, because even with verushash, if properly motivated, it could go GPU quickly

[14-Oct-18 04:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep

[14-Oct-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
best to use a nicehash mineable algo

[14-Oct-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but a demo of attacking dPoW and a non-dPoW coin is a good idea

[14-Oct-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
just leave out some of the details, so we dont make it a guide on how to do it, just the results of what happens after we do it

[14-Oct-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
duke wants to test HUSH, so that can be the dPoW protected chain, and we need a volunteer non-dPoW chain for the other

[14-Oct-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto

[14-Oct-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup, wheels within wheels are already turning

[14-Oct-18 04:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for non-dPoW, just make a test minable chain 🤔

[14-Oct-18 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`komodod -ac_name=BITEME -ac_supply=0 -ac_halving=2100000 -gen -addnode=`

[14-Oct-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup, we were going to call it `INSECURE` 😃

[14-Oct-18 05:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

The coin mentioned above is now moving up quick.
That has led to people DMing me wanting to buy in.

The setup that I pointed out is very simple.
Historic support, trading range, breakout.

If you're bullish find other coins that have a similar setup instead.
They're every...
