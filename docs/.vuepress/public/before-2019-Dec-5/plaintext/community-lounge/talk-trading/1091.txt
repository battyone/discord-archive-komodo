Blockstream dont try to make anything :troll:

[26-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
blackjoker gets it

[26-Aug-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
except smaller blocks

theey have been making Lightning network for 5 years now

[26-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
and it still shit

[26-Aug-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LN doesnt really work, but `100GB blocks, is also not feasable

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
Thing is changing bitcoin in big ways can dmg its reputation i think thats why they try to not change it but add layers onto it

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
for now @blackjok3r

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
Dash has 512 MB blocks in their scaling plan

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No they are just sill;y... A small increase in block size is fine..

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
yuo don't understand

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
4MB insterad of segwit would have been fine.

[26-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
Ye possible

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
it wont be long before we can chemically store data ( we already can just not at scale )

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem with huge block is network has problems proagating them

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
but eventually we will be able to store the entire contents of the internet in an object the size of a cup of coffee

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
its based on how code is stored in DNA

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
chemical storage

[26-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
also bandwith will go another few thousand x higher

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
so in the end the 100gb blocks wont be a problem

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
Does it make any difference if a chain is PoS or PoW when it comes to block size?

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I am not sying this is proble  forever... But really... many chains solves it all anyway...

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No. But PoS has many problems

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
Okay

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
PoS isn't fair

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
its fiat 2.0

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
well PoS is u buy as much as possible and there u go

[26-Aug-19 10:52 AM] Tek#5253
mining is fair

[26-Aug-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
yea

i hold both PoW and PoS assets but I do know PoW is more fair and valuable

[26-Aug-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I like a combo of both myself, but still not 100% sure on what is best.

[26-Aug-19 10:54 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well scam is maybe wrong , let's say a dishonest sheme

[26-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Markus#5464
About Kmd, how is active user reward calculated? is it different from PoS tech?

[26-Aug-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes very much so.

[26-Aug-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It simply allows more vout value to be spent than vin value... according to formula based on time

[26-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
Right it does not validate any blocks like PoS would right?

[26-Aug-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No.

[26-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
Ok

[26-Aug-19 10:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notary nodes mine 75% of blocks, the rest goes to ASIC/GPU miners... the 5% is calcualated by all nodes in block valuidation.

[26-Aug-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464
Alright thats cool

it needs many nodes still... but I think I can make it work with just a few. Hopefully get nSPV working sometime soon with MoMoM.

meh false alarm. I guess dash just tweets everytime they get mentioned somewhere

[26-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Tek#5253
well gotta give credit where credit is due

dash is more secure than bitcoin now

blah blah lighting network payment channels. aantonop's alright, just a little misguided. There's worse than dash out there, but it's not more secure than btc. That was likely a paid mention/endorsement, otherwise it would only be viewable to patreon supporters. dash is still trash :troll_lol:

[26-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Tek#5253
@actionslacks its more secure than bitcoin

[26-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Tek#5253
because it has anti 51 tech

[26-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Tek#5253
bitcoin does not

[26-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Tek#5253
it also has its own hashing algo

[26-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Tek#5253
not sha256 only

[26-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Tek#5253
you can't really argue my claim. it is how it is.

[26-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Tek#5253
dash is a way more developed bitcoin

[26-Aug-19 03:20 PM] Tek#5253
simple as

[26-Aug-19 03:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
so should all the btc maximalists be dash maximalists now?

BTC was doing > muh lightenin network for the past 5 years

[26-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Tek#5253
well bitcoin used to have > muh security

[26-Aug-19 03:21 PM] Tek#5253
but now there are others that have better security

[26-Aug-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i feel no desire to notarize to DASH instead of BTC

[26-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
having 70 exahash is more secure

[26-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there just isnt the mining equipment in the world available to attack the BTC

[26-Aug-19 03:22 PM] Tek#5253
you cant compare the sha256 delivered hash to dash X11 hash

[26-Aug-19 03:22 PM] Tek#5253
there isn't for dash either

[26-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for DASH it seems that if you dont have a masternode, you dont really have a fullnode

[26-Aug-19 03:23 PM] Tek#5253
you can share masternodes and stake

[26-Aug-19 03:23 PM] Tek#5253
you don't need 1000 dash anymore

[26-Aug-19 03:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
what if the majority of dash masternodes decide to chainlock a forked chain?

[26-Aug-19 03:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
collusion attack

[26-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that probably becomes the mainchain

[26-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
hashrate doesnt protect DASH

[26-Aug-19 03:24 PM] Tek#5253
it does, but chainlocks is the protection if there is 51 percent

[26-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Tek#5253
since its x11 and not sha256

[26-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
anti-collusion powers of MN which is achieved by, well not sure

[26-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Tek#5253
i don't know the fine details

[26-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a chain reorg attack that would get more than the cost of the MN, it seems bribery attacks are possible

[26-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is not quite so simple to state about the security levels

[26-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the security of the entire MN would need to be properly evaluated and it seems there could be a very small number of people who control majority of MN

[26-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
with chainlocks, the DASH security becomes similar to PoS, where participants have the stake needed to run a MN

[26-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I hope everyone is in the mood for KMD pumps soon. Chart looks good, just depends if we need one more dip first.

[26-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
one attack vector that exists against DASH that doesnt with BTC, is that the MN could simply be compromised and using a MN-botnet to basically control the chain.

[26-Aug-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
DASH seems to have taken a pragmatic approach(ie, it'll probably work), but saying it's "more secure than bitcoin" is laughable
