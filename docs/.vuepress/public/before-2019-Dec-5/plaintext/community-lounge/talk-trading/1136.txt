it's amazing how some coins come out of nowhere and go straight to top 20. Cosmos (atom) is like poor man's komodo and there it is. Launched in march 2019. wtf.

okay, I see Tendermint been around since 2014. But still, it's quite amazing. I noticed Cosmos first time couple months ago, but I didn't look at it closer back then. Anyway, super high valuation for such new platform in this bear market.

[13-Sep-19 05:18 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I'm not not saying it's shit. It may even be good, but I'm not interested in it.

I have RVN

[13-Sep-19 06:02 AM] tolken#2655
Is it just me, or is this guy on stage basically stating that it‚Äôs revolutionary idea is that it (Bancor) will make ‚Äòbots‚Äô to replace ‚Äòhuman‚Äô market makers? https://mobile.twitter.com/TechImagining/status/1172188057543593984

[13-Sep-19 06:03 AM] Tek#5253
RVN is a BTC fork with improved algo

[13-Sep-19 06:04 AM] Tek#5253
And some other additions

[13-Sep-19 06:04 AM] Tek#5253
Would recommend

[13-Sep-19 06:05 AM] tolken#2655
Doesn‚Äôt that basically describe all btc forks?

[13-Sep-19 06:05 AM] Tek#5253
Yes; all BTC forks are Bitcoin

cosmos is got a smart business strategy.

[13-Sep-19 06:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
cosmos and komodo have many of the same features,  the main difference is in the consensus mechanism.   Other differentiation is in adoption strategy

[13-Sep-19 06:19 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
How to recognize bad bitcoin fork? It's got Bitcoin's name in it.

[13-Sep-19 06:22 AM] tolken#2655
@polycryptoblog Seems like Cosmos is doing quite well with adoption so far. Certainly has gotten a lot of hype. If it has anywhere close to kmd‚Äôs tech, that doesn‚Äôt bode welll for Kmd.

[13-Sep-19 06:22 AM] tolken#2655
What‚Äôs the difference in adoption strategy?

[13-Sep-19 06:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Take atomicdex vs  IBC protocol.    atomicdex already works with exterior chains.   IBC needs adopted

[13-Sep-19 06:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
easier to do something when you can just do it instead of relying waiting on others to implement

[13-Sep-19 06:27 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Even great projects like kmd need hype. No hype, no adoption.

[13-Sep-19 06:32 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I mean, I would like to see official kmd twitter account tweeting 15 times a day how great kmd is. üòÉ

Obviously overdoing it is bad. Announcement of an announcement may even be good sometimes, but announcing there will be an announcement of an announcement announced is just too much.  üòÇ

[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] phm87#7395
After 2 weeks of work and test, I was able to add stratum proxy for equihash into my pool (mini nicehash). For legal reasons, I won't open it to everyone. I will do an announcement but I need to prepare stuff for communication/marketing.

[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] phm87#7395
If sth required 1 week of work on tech side, I think that it is normal to use 1 to 3 weeks to market it

[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] phm87#7395
About twitter, some btc dev are using it properly (academic lvl, no troll no shill). Maybe we should push more twitter on kmd

[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
there are lot of things that can tweeted, like jl777 quote of the day. dev interviews. platform comparisons etc. you name it.

[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
@phm87 absolutely. üëç

Just about dpow, I found a dozen of blog posts to retweet

[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
yeah, dpow of course.

[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] phm87#7395
About dpow, I d like to do a demonstration of it (video of a 51% without and with dpow) on a testchain

[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I agree more stuff needs tweeted.   @phm87   we tried doing that at a small gathering but the technicals are over most peoples heads ,  commandline doesnt make for good video lol

[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] phm87#7395
Yes but we can show qt and coins that disappear

that is true

[13-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Markus#5464
Problem with kmd is that ppl dont seem to care about it.. Tech gets done and works but theres no adoption happening, its not enough with finding devs to build on it u need to find interest from ppl to actually invest and trade it and bring liquidity

[13-Sep-19 10:22 AM] Markus#5464
Also too much things going on at the same time, i remember probably half year ago bitmex CC was being made, havent heard anything about that since and if its done why is there no showcase?

[13-Sep-19 10:24 AM] Markus#5464
I think kmd team/devs should showcase more how new tech can be used rather than just make it and think ppl will find out themselves about it or how it can be used

you mean like with atomicDEX?

[13-Sep-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it takes a lot of effort to make a showcase, so we focus on one at a time. the good news is that there is a big pipeline of things that can be showcased

I think Rogue was a good example

[13-Sep-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
It brought alot of attention

[13-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Markus#5464
Also im not sure to make a showcase that u need to actually build it, it can be showed in a technical video so even a dummy can get a feeling of what it actually means

[13-Sep-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
without an actually working system, people will just say "thats just a video and not actually working"

[13-Sep-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the scope of what we already have working at the blockchain level seems to just be too hard for most people to believe. cli apparently isnt enough unless you are some famous twitter personality

[13-Sep-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so we will make a working showcase, serially, and after the second (or third) one, maybe the market will realize that we can actually deliver mass market end user solutions and then we can get more resources to work in parallel.

[13-Sep-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the USDK will create the ability to lock KMD in an interest free loan to issue stable coins, that can then be used in atomicDEX (without ETH gas)

[13-Sep-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so here and there the KMD is ending up needed for the key functionality, even though people are not forced to use it for everything

[13-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Tek#5253

[13-Sep-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i think one aspect you need to understand is that atomicDEX is what enables a lot of other things, like having a USDK stablecoin without atomicDEX in high volume usage... it wont really have much effect. in conjunction with a high volume atomicDEX, then we get a stablecoin that is a normal BTC protocol that costs 0.01 USD per transaction.

[13-Sep-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
even the bitmex CC, without atomicDEX to be able to swap into and out of the BET coin, it ends up isolated. the way i see it is that atomicDEX joins otherwise separated technical solutions, into a single integrated solution. the integration is at the financial low friction atomic swap level, but that is sufficient

[13-Sep-19 11:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
"I think Rogue was a good example"  - Yes I agree.  There was even this company that was going to build on that idea, called Komodore64.... üòÑ

[13-Sep-19 11:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
"the USDK will create the ability to lock KMD in an interest free loan to issue stable coins, that can then be used in atomicDEX (without ETH gas)"

Oooh, so people are going to be able to create a USD stablecoin in Komodo?

[13-Sep-19 11:17 AM] Alexfrog#1338
How will it maintain its $1 value?

[13-Sep-19 11:17 AM] Alexfrog#1338
or am i misunderstanding

[13-Sep-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
maybe like eth --> dai

[13-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Markus#5464
