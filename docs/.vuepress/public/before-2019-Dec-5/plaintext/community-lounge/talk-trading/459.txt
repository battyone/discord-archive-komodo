barely double of what it was in november

@blubbi  @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   A little late, but in electronics at least gold is used for its corrosion/galvanic  resistance for connection and its ability to be used in extremely thin layers

when you look in to the research of "self-healing alloys", gold loses its luster (pun intended)

[07-Mar-19 09:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

hey @jl777c  is the rebrand coming this year or next?

[07-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Markus#5464
this year

[07-Mar-19 09:49 PM] Keppie#5156
Q1 right ?

[07-Mar-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
you should ask that in #komodo-team channel not jl777

[08-Mar-19 01:23 AM] richardt#2807
Probably more likely Q2 or Q3 because it sounds like they plan to roll everything out with the new mobile trading app

[08-Mar-19 01:23 AM] richardt#2807
and the blockchain creation tool on AWS

[08-Mar-19 01:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@SHossain @grewalsatinder @jl777c 
Does this make you feel like it represents MoMoM?

that's example image of Merkel Tree

[08-Mar-19 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, imagine a tree's stem growing another tree on it, and that tree's stem is growing another tree on it

[08-Mar-19 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think that would make sense ü§î

[08-Mar-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, in that sense I guess your image makes sense too

[08-Mar-19 03:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[08-Mar-19 07:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
777 should be at the top or bottom.

[08-Mar-19 07:27 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Imo. Doesn‚Äôt make me right.

[08-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Wazzup#0510
I would remove the words entirely on the first one and only leave 777 top center

[08-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Wazzup#0510
both look great tho

@Keppie   I wish I got 25 BTC ones,  but I felt those were too expensive for the service.  The 1000 BTC  " bearer bars" I felt were stupid and served no purpose.    I used to sell the 1 BTC coins on Ebay for 40.00 and make a decent profit, then paypal clamped down on them...

[08-Mar-19 10:30 PM] NNoperator#3835
@Draeth  you may want to incorporate a way to conceal a private key, so they can be loaded with value.
