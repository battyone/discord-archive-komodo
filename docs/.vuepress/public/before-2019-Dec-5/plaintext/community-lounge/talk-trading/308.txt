I remember selling a good amount of my kmd holdings @ $1.59 when we had the whale bro pump less than a month ago and thinking I scored big time when I bought back at $.95, lol.

Why the hell SV and ABC are still a thing?

[26-Nov-18 07:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
SV ranks 7 on cmc, 150,000 btc trading volum lol

[26-Nov-18 07:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have no idea, may be thanks to "Satoshi Vision" tag

[26-Nov-18 07:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think Komodo can easily reaches top 10 if we  rename back to Bitcoin Dark with the quote "beyond Satoshi Vision" :trollface:

[26-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
When is relaunch supposed to be?

[26-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Caglio#3337
we are going below 3000 soon

[26-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Holidays are coming, prices going to drop

Thinking of buying a btc to give as a present to my parents or something like that

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_hopes BTC drops to 1k and never recovers past $1200_

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Dont do it bro

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Here is a paper wallet, look at it in a couple of tears

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Years loooool

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe tears 😂

[26-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Well actually do it

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Its a nice gesture, specially if they arent going to check the prizes all the time

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337
but if they have at least one family where they can brag about bitcoin

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337
dont do it

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Thinking of buying a btc to give as a present to my parents`
Do you really hate them that much?

{Reactions}
😂 

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337
cos they will start to get nervous after that family tell them about dying crypto

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I would stay out of it

[26-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[26-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I cant start to imagine the effort it would take to explain komodo to them

[26-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I am still sorry I talked so much about crypto, so my mother bought herself 1 fucking LTC when it was at its highest

[26-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let alone btc

[26-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So lets start easy

[26-Nov-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The best 2 things that could ever happen to crypto is BTC sub $1500 and no longer a base for pairing

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Llama#1330
if everything was independent that'd be nice

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Llama#1330
but trading pairs would need to change

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Best thing for crypto would be

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Caglio#3337
if it didnt got that mainstream

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Caglio#3337
We got 2000 different coins in a year

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Money spreaded all over them

[26-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Noone needs 2000 shitcoins

[26-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Caglio#3337
Im not even sure we need 10 of them, actually we dont

[26-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I am perfectly fine with using good old cash

[26-Nov-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Noone needs 2000 shitcoins` and yet BTC survives despite that belief ☹

[26-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Caglio#3337
And those theories, about sending 60 million dollars for like 10$ with crypto

[26-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Do I seem like someone who got 60 million dollars ?

[26-Nov-18 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Im not even sure we need 10 of them, actually we dont`
You could always take your maximalist view back to fiat....

[26-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I wish, too bad I lost too much of that fiat investing in "better solutions"

[26-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Caglio#3337
But anyway, lets say we need those 10 coins... we dont need other 2000 for sure

[26-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Caglio#3337
Or maybe we are going to complicate our lives a little more, so we will use one coin to buy a milk, and other one to buy bread, but only if its white bread, for dark you need 3rd coin

[26-Nov-18 08:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we dont need other 2000 for sure`
And your support for that claim is....

[26-Nov-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why do I need to only transact in whatever coin *you* decide is "worthy"?

[26-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Are you being serious right now ?

[26-Nov-18 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100%

[26-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont even know how to respond to that

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We don't need other cryptos` is about the least crypto thing one in crypto can say

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Caglio#3337
I never said we dont need other crysptos

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Caglio#3337
I said we dont need 2000 of them

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Caglio#3337
We got over 1400 different coins in 365 days

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the entire point is freedom of mobility and exchange of value

[26-Nov-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We got over 1400 different coins in 365 days`
And the "bad" part of that is....

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Lets be realistic here ok ?

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I am

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I see the ideology of a freedom

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Caglio#3337
But lets address normal problems

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] Caglio#3337
For example I am not a miner, and now I am grateful for that

[26-Nov-18 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All you seem to do is repeat the same 2 sentences with no support for such a belief...

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok sorry my support is my pure logic and looks at life

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Obviously our mindsets are quite different

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` pure logic ` says you're wrong and have been programed to conformity

[26-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Caglio#3337
I have no problems with everyone having its own coin

[26-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Caglio#3337
But in no world will anyone use those coins

[26-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Caglio#3337
everyone*

[26-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Caglio#3337
Do you think people will adapt to receiving any possible shitcoin as payments ?

[26-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I will tell you right now, they wont

[26-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Caglio#3337
Because most of them arent

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What's your `pure logic` support to say that bookcoin shouldn't be used to buy books, musiccoin to buy music, etc....

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Most of them are just thin air sold to blind believers

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah and dentacoin in dental industry

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Caglio#3337
cos you know, every dentist i met in my life want to be paid in coin that change its value on a daily basis

[26-Nov-18 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Most of them are just thin air sold to blind believers`
Ahh, see now you're conflating scams and crypto in general

[26-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Dude without scams there are too big prize fluctuations and market manipulations

[26-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Caglio#3337
I can understand few of coins really stabilize @ one prize, but I cant see 90% of them

[26-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Caglio#3337
not when they are 2500 different coins out there

[26-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Also, getting that coins is also a problematic issue... I am not a miner, I bought all my coins with fiat, and it is expensive

[26-Nov-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yeah and dentacoin in dental industry
cos you know, every dentist i met in my life want to be paid in coin that change its value on a daily basis`
No, but medicalcoin is one that he could reuse for supplies and exchange profits for whatevercoin (just like people regularly do with fiat credit)

[26-Nov-18 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not when they are 2500 different coins out there`
What are these new 500 coins that came up in the last 2 minutes?

[26-Nov-18 08:57 PM] Caglio#3337
500 coins in 2 minutes ?
