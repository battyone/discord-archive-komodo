If komodo could stop being one of the few coins in the negative today, that would be neat.

I sent more money in, but it will take a week to get there. I'm actually hoping the slow week ahead will cause the impatient to sell because I plan to really load up.

Hopefully, Whale bro doesn't decide to jump in before I do.

[24-Dec-18 10:54 AM] ver_User#6608
50k+ is target

need more accumulation....

thing is KMD seems to have one of the best accumulation bases across many albtc pairs, it's got real holders, not just pumpers. 


The previous big run ups in kmd, were they just pump and dump groups getting involved? they were very fast and short lived

[24-Dec-18 10:57 AM] ver_User#6608
either way seems to be good support for this price zone where we are now, IMO break up is imminent

[24-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Lieutenant#1428
if now there is no growth upwards, then at the next btc fall we will update the lows price kmd $ and satoshi

[24-Dec-18 02:51 PM] yorklab#7270
@Lieutenant  I think it depends on your perspective.  While other projects have been laying off or going under, Komodo has been producing more than ever and hiring. If you follow Discord it appears there may be a lot happening early next year; I get the sense that marketing has been gearing up for it. I also personally think the bear market is all but over, or at least will be soon. So IF all I just stated is true, then the current price is a Christmas present. On the other hand, although I want the price to be as low as possible by next week so I can pick up more, I already hold a lot of kmd and it does get a bit disheartening to see the sellers take it down (a double edge sword for me).

[24-Dec-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
when the price was the same, I sell my stratis and bought KMD. It was the biggest mistake in my life. üò∞

[24-Dec-18 02:55 PM] yorklab#7270
Yea, I'm the worst trader on the planet. I sold XRP to buy kmd, then KMD went down and XRP shot up.

Story of my life.

[24-Dec-18 02:57 PM] ver_User#6608
looks real good, another positive I believe in being in a coin like KMD instead of other higher market cap more mainstream alts is that there is more "room to grow" relative to bitcoin. ETHBTC psychological ceiling is effectively 0.2 region, quite close and basically the upper range that has been established already, beyond that and market cap is now ETH at no.1... Lower probability event. 

Lower market cap coins like KMD with very real utility value and an established base that just needs a wider network of awareness, have still have much greater room to grow relative to bitcoin than the other top tier coins. 

Crypto low may be in, but it may take months of ranging to confirm that, for now a bullish cycle is happening and it's only a matter of time for KMDBTC to make some big moves IMO

ETH may be going crazy for now, but it has a limit, and it's a good influence for other cryptos to follow, when profits cycle out of the eth pump and look for new opportunities

[24-Dec-18 02:58 PM] ver_User#6608
@yorklab the way I always see it is, if you still have assets, you still can swap them around and make more value. At some point for many it's better just to hold, but the possibility exists. Anyways, crypto is still in early days, massive growth to be expected to continue long term

[24-Dec-18 02:59 PM] yorklab#7270
Agree, and at least while holding KMD you gain the rewards, which is like buying at a lower price.

[24-Dec-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
what conclusion can we draw? Buying kmd is very risky, it is better to buy any other coin with a probability of 90% you will earn more money.

{Reactions}
üòâ 

[24-Dec-18 03:08 PM] yorklab#7270
I think you have to come to your own conclusion. Higher risk, higher reward (and loss). One other thing to consider; a whale has been buying massive amounts every so often below 20,000, so someone with a lot of bitcoin seems to think it's worth buying.
