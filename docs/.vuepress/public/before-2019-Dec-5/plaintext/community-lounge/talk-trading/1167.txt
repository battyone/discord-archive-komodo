Starting to look like that pump was a fakeout

[04-Oct-19 08:02 PM] tolken#2655
Alrighty then, let‚Äôs dump it.

@Andersen make sure you read some reviews, some people get their funds locked and their accounts closed there:

[04-Oct-19 10:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[04-Oct-19 10:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No one cares anymore

I burn the remnants of my portfolio every now and then when I need a big screen for the basement or something but shit is trash now

@tolken not too hard, i have looked into having assets on the ledger. But no one is willing to pay for it or contribute to it, like most things

[04-Oct-19 11:48 PM] Neko#5830
when time is right it will happen

[05-Oct-19 12:49 AM] tolken#2655
@hyperDEX bummer. Good to know.

[05-Oct-19 02:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Neko no it doesnt work that way

[05-Oct-19 02:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone wants things for free. People do not understand the concept of investing 1% to get a 1% increase on the remaining 99% you hold.

[05-Oct-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
Feeling confident that bottom is in, look at this weekly chart and indicators, macd about to cross to the upside and stochastic started curving upwards. It can be a good sign üòÅ

Gonna be hella funny to watch bitcoin maximalists panic and  FOMO into alts near the top.

Bitcoin is just another shitcoin folks. It has more skin in the game, that's true, but in the end it is just another shitcoin.

Hollow runs in kmds blood..he will find a way to survive

Hollow should puck whats needs to be discussed, that his role if he doesn't offend he should be banned

[05-Oct-19 08:12 PM] cascrypto#8206

He does make a good point regarding venmo though

[05-Oct-19 11:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
venmo, where all of your contacts transactions can be viewed after sending them money. "oh look ms. not-anon got her nails done for $50" social programming.

[06-Oct-19 12:15 AM] Neko#5830
venmo will run on komodo

[06-Oct-19 12:24 AM] JimD#9272
Someone hurry up and start crypto banks with easy secure APIs that any coin can hook into to be connected to fiat onramps.

[06-Oct-19 12:25 AM] JimD#9272
I really don't see why banking can't be a decentralized service

[06-Oct-19 12:29 AM] JimD#9272
We can't call it Komodo bank or people will laugh at me.  Maybe call it "The Andrew Jackson Settlement Bank"

[06-Oct-19 04:13 AM] jspook16#3059
There seems to be a good deal for btc-kmd on atomicdex right now. Don't know what the transaction fees are but I think it's about 10% under market.

[06-Oct-19 04:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@JimD  the Andrew Jackson settlement bank where if you have a complaint you duel for the outcome

if there will be adoption growth and new listings on decent exchanges I expect 1-10$ each, if no listings or unknown exchanges only - same as it is

You mean for the Dex Asset ?

[06-Oct-19 01:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
correct

[06-Oct-19 02:01 PM] Acura#2748
last highest price i had ever seen on DEX Asset was for me 58kmd end 2017

[06-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Acura#2748
i think, over 200kmd could easily reached if all is completed and working

Interesting how this trading app has managed to connect to a completely decentralized exchange like Bisq through the API. Usually trading apps only connect to centralized exchanges:

there is some DEX on the mm2 orderbooks - https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
You'll probably need to use CLI to access the trade tho, not sure if any gui has it in just yet.

[07-Oct-19 05:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think you can use chainswap

[07-Oct-19 08:02 AM] hastrup#8742
Or hyperdex

[07-Oct-19 08:02 AM] hastrup#8742
It's about 30 for buy and 11 for sell

there is some bashing going on to kmd because there is a fee for using antara network gui and atomicdex gui listing.

$7.5k is the whole chain infrastructure on a automated managed SERVICE

Feels like these people came from a non-open source culture, yet they talk as if they were gurus of what decentralized means

[07-Oct-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yey, you have projects in open source culture that work like this every day

[07-Oct-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
canonical for ubuntu as an example

[07-Oct-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
redhat as another example

[07-Oct-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
