anyway, in the future, I will continue to announce if I have a need to buy ( or sell) whatever coin

[22-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
😮

[22-Jun-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I have many obligations for revshares and performing that fiduciary duty is about a million times more important than whatver FUD will be thrown due to it

[22-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
how dare you be personally and financially invested in your own projects 😡

Why wouldn’t you be involved in your own project?

Charlie’s reasoning was always bullshit to me

If jl777 wanted to manipulate the price, he wouldn’t have used autoprice with a margin of 3%

[22-Jun-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"BTC\",\"margin\":0.003,\"refbase\":\"komodo\",\"refrel\":\"coinmarketcap\"}"

[22-Jun-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i used 0.3% margin

[22-Jun-18 04:05 PM] tolken#2655
Ahh, Initially you were at least at 3% I thought

[22-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thought you said 3%

[22-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Change it?

[22-Jun-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the facts clearly show I am not doing anything manipulative. if the facts are not enough for you, then go ahead and believe the FUD and just sell

[22-Jun-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it was originally at 3%,but I wasnt getting much at all, so I decreased the margin

[22-Jun-18 04:06 PM] Tyrael#0138
prove it ! give us your ID and bank records !

[22-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tolken#2655
Goofballs that think the intent is manipulation.

[22-Jun-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the proof is on the blockchain with  the prices it sold at, most at 0.3% margin, I think about 1 BTC at 3%

[22-Jun-18 04:07 PM] bishop#9773
Did you get the entire order filled jl?

[22-Jun-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
let me check

[22-Jun-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet, still have about 15BTC left

[22-Jun-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
Does this equate to most volume through bdex for a given period ever? 😃

[22-Jun-18 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
no, as the big chunks were OTC

[22-Jun-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
Ahh :/

[22-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
would have preferred over barterDEX, but the primary issue is not to promote barterDEX but my fiduciary obligation for revshares

[22-Jun-18 04:11 PM] tolken#2655
I hear ya.

[22-Jun-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
I put the financial obligations ahead of creating pumpable news and this is often used as a negative point

[22-Jun-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but I just cant see the long term value in making some short term news item, which will be forgotten in a few days at the cost of the total revshares people will get

[22-Jun-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and for all I know, the news will be called "manipulation" and hurt the price, as it seems quite random when it isnt paid for "news"

[22-Jun-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so I just concentrate on doing what I am able to control directly and get the best deal possible for the revshares

[22-Jun-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
note that I personally get some of the revshares, so some will scream it is a conflict of interest that I do things on behalf of the revshare

[22-Jun-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so basically no matter what I do, I will get criticized. therefore the only logical thing to do is ignore it and just do what I feel is the right thing to do

[22-Jun-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, social media "news" falls in to 2 categories :
Let's pump X to make 3000000000000000000000000x gains
Let's FUD Y because we didn't get 3000000000000000000000000x gains

[22-Jun-18 04:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
too much bullshit and real news gets burried

[22-Jun-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If social media gave a shit about real news, I wouldn't even have a measurable %age of the swaps on BarterDEX, imo

[22-Jun-18 04:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought the dip today

[22-Jun-18 04:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It's as good a time as any tbh

[22-Jun-18 04:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont really see it making lower lows

[22-Jun-18 04:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And if it does

[22-Jun-18 04:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I've been steadily buying more KMD for the last week

@jl777 I honestly don’t care how you manage the funds or at what price you pump or dump your kmd. I can voluntarily dump my holdings at any time and respects your right to do the same.

[22-Jun-18 04:33 PM] Tyrael#0138
this happens when you promote "Verge"

[22-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Tyrael#0138
@tolken ok, dumping 2M KMD sec

as everyone can see nano was using a very weak RNG (estimated at 29 bits), but of course their revolutionary new consensus mechanism that seems to ignore the basics of consensus logic, is perfectly fine. right?

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Is bootstrap poisoning what happened with the wallet yesterday?

[22-Jun-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea, but my guess is there are more issues than just the bootstrap poisoning, then again maybe their dev fixed all the issues

[22-Jun-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i just saw the nano price, it seems they lost 90%+ from their peak! But I thought they had fantastic marketing. With fantastic marketing how is it possible for the price to drop 90%+??

maybe they will make a smart contract that enables govts to automatically suspend accounts and confiscate funds, why bother with the formality of a rubber stamp when you can make rubberstamp contract
