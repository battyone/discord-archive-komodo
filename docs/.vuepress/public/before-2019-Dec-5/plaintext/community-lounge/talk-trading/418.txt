There was a bright flash and the ground is shaking

[15-Feb-19 01:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If I shoot at the blast wave, will that stop it?

[15-Feb-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no need to panic, he's far enough out on the fringe right that it's likely the last political thing we'll agree on too 😛

AOC looks like a Ridley Scott alien that is midway through extending her inner mouth/teeth to finish a kill.

@jv9sound @MartinSpaniard @jackmurphylive I think you’ll find that there are more of us little ‘L’s than you’d imagine.  

My principles for government:
-don’t touch my money
-don’t touch my guns
-fuck off out of my life in general

I can’t wait for all the Me Too crap about her juggling D’s as a bartender to come up

[15-Feb-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`don’t touch my money`
nice to see that you're onboard with abolishing SSI and the VA 🙂

I’m good with a few crew-served weapons emplacements and a heavily mined and patrolled DMZ

[15-Feb-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nope, can't have that; it takes your money

[15-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s more of a guideline, it starts the conversation

[15-Feb-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the right: don't take my money unless it's to oppress brown people, then take whatever you need

[15-Feb-19 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sigh, there’s the divide again

[15-Feb-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Having borders is oppressing brown people. Naturally.

[15-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We’re about to get smacked down for Off-topic

It is when "the wall" only is between brown/white and not white/white, silly meatspin 
I will try to use smaller words so you can try to keep up

lil meatspin, feel free to apply your vastly greater intellect to the things I do and then I'll have no reason to be here and will go away for good 🙂 ....

[15-Feb-19 02:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
Don’t make me call Dad in here. I will tell him you are being a meanie (who doesn’t know how to trade) again.

[15-Feb-19 02:09 PM] yorklab#7270
More trading talk and fewer off-topic and personal attacks would be nice.

[15-Feb-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some did not, but I think everyone in the community (shy of one or two) did migrate

[15-Feb-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ARRR had a nice rally for a short bit, but dumpers came right back and raced each other back to the bottom again ☹
