[29-May-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
i have a hunch that BTC isn't going to be coming down much at all

[29-May-19 06:35 PM] LocoMB#8593
when it won't go after his whims, he'll throw a temper tanturm and rage quit. and start another world computer with some obscure reference that is supposed to sound cool. and blame everybody else for the failure of the last, esp. that it didn't go as he said it should

[29-May-19 06:37 PM] LocoMB#8593

Cardano is almost the worst  top coin.  except that BSV and EOS exist.  Oh and Ripple.  Oh and TRON.  Holy shit are there a lot of bad coins at the top.

whats bad about EOS? all i know abt them is that they eliminated the fees for contracts and dApps

[29-May-19 07:16 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

cardano: cant manage to release a product, lead by a guy (hoskinson) who abandons all the projects he has worked on due to conflicts with other devs (he was on both Ethereum and Bitshares, and left both).  And still worth over 2B?

[29-May-19 07:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Tron: developer sucks and is clueless, as demonstrated by various events like him being unable to fix things in his own project.  shilled by tons of noobs, shilled by mcafee, etc.

[29-May-19 07:21 PM] JimD#9272
When will Mcafee start shilling KMD ?

[29-May-19 07:21 PM] JimD#9272

kmd staying in the shadows is for the best right now. join any crypto trading fb group. the collective lack of any sense whatsoever is appalling.

[29-May-19 07:31 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[29-May-19 07:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338

calvin is a billionare canadian that got rich with illegal online gambling

[29-May-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
and csw is a narcist asshole who doesn't like to play with anyone

[29-May-19 07:46 PM] Tek#5253
if calvin pumps a few hundred mil into bsv itis nothing for him

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Markus#5464
few hundred mil?

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
calvin is a billionaire so yeah

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
he can pump a few hundred no issue

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Markus#5464
if 100 mil can move btc 1000$ i dont think few hundred mil is needed for BSV or it would already be at 2000$

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
yeah he probably only put in a few million

[29-May-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
and margin longed

[29-May-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
probably even got profit out of the move rekking all those shorters

trading kmd is fun and predicable when whalebro is in the order books

[29-May-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD top 50?

[29-May-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
where are all the whiners that complain KMD always goes down?

[29-May-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
confused

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
nice ü§î

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im pretty sure KMD is actually down, but all the websites im looking at are wrong or something

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] PTYX#6840
they are waiting for a correction so that they can complain again

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] Alexfrog#1338
or maybe KMD is going up so it can fuck over the ARRR/KMD ratio üòõ

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
once whalebro removes his buy orders it starts to tank as always

üê≥ 

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it goes up about half the time goes down about half the time

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so they complain about half the time

[29-May-19 07:51 PM] Tek#5253
so to make a good trade right now I just have to wait until whalebro is removing his order
