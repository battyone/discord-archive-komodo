I just assume the worst and buy arrr

[09-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes a real DEX is definitely exempt

[09-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so fully decentralized is exempt, likely they realized they couldnt enforce it

Have you had much correspondence with IBM @jl777c

[09-May-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
no correspondence at all, i wouldnt get too excited about any IBM things yet

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just curious

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what is interesting about the SEC doc, is that it seems to be saying that dapps can be money transmitters

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so anybody that operates a dapp that is a money transmitter, becomes a money transmitter

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the dapp runs on the blockchain...

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Prosecute a line of code?

[09-May-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
though I guess many smartcontracts are centralized and require somebody to fund it and run it

[09-May-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so it could be that ETH style smartcontracts can be MSB?

[09-May-19 05:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A pirate to ETH tx on tortuga then funds a dapp

[09-May-19 05:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who gets prosecuted

[09-May-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
devs are in the clear

[09-May-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the operating of a dapp that has MSG

[09-May-19 05:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If the origination of the funds can‚Äôt be tracked, anyone or anything could be guilty

[09-May-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think centralized smartcontracts could be in trouble

[09-May-19 05:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Maybe we should avoid to look at Binance prices, they can be altered due to withdrawals disabled. Some ppl prefers to look at a price index calculated based on several exchanges

[09-May-19 06:21 PM] phm87#7395
(bitfiniex prices were weird compared to the rest of the world during the last Tether popcorn story, not finished though)

[09-May-19 06:23 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Bot are buying large orders that show up. I would question selling this low.

[09-May-19 06:35 PM] jorian#4555
@jl777c how about seed nodes in the DEX?

[09-May-19 06:36 PM] jorian#4555
can they be seen as money transmitters, when they actually don't transmit money? according to that pdf

[09-May-19 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
```
jl777cToday at 7:01 PM
actually, it is specifically allowed!
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations.73
```

[09-May-19 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
seems no

[09-May-19 06:41 PM] jorian#4555
darn, read over that part, thanks

[09-May-19 06:42 PM] jorian#4555
in that twitter thread, users don't seem so concerned about LN being subject to require a license if the purpose of your lightning node is not routing and collect fees

[09-May-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
What is the logic behind a payment channel being a "money transmitter"?

[09-May-19 06:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That makes barterdex excempt

[09-May-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
not saying it is, just wondering *if* it is

[09-May-19 06:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Because a third party has custody  of the money

[09-May-19 06:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If i host a ln node to use it only with my funds there is no issue

[09-May-19 06:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The issue comes when you do channels for users

[09-May-19 06:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And host those coins in your node

[09-May-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure I understand LN enough

[09-May-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
in what case would you "do channels for users"?

[09-May-19 06:47 PM] hastrup#8742
Will that effect bdex?

[09-May-19 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
like a custodial service? Not necessary for LN functionality?

[09-May-19 06:47 PM] jorian#4555
bdex is unrelated to LN

[09-May-19 06:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bdex is excempt

[09-May-19 06:47 PM] hastrup#8742
But as a money transmittere?

[09-May-19 06:48 PM] hastrup#8742
What does exempt means?

[09-May-19 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
well it's p2p, so who transmits the money in that scenario?

[09-May-19 06:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bdex doesnt host money of third parties

[09-May-19 06:49 PM] hastrup#8742
OK. Thxüëç

[09-May-19 06:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Alright the ideal method is for each user to host their own LN node. But that surely wont be a realistic approach

[09-May-19 06:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you dont host your own node. You can do channels using third party services ln nodes

[09-May-19 06:51 PM] hastrup#8742
Could you host a Ln node on your phone?

[09-May-19 06:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No idea

[09-May-19 06:54 PM] hastrup#8742
It's just if you had a LN node in your cryto wallet all in one on your phone

[09-May-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
LN seems DOA because it's an interactive protocol

[09-May-19 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
whoever thought that was a good idea is not a smart person

[09-May-19 06:54 PM] hastrup#8742
XD

[09-May-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
interactive protocol meaning you must have a node up to *receive* money

[09-May-19 06:56 PM] hastrup#8742
@Alright thx

[09-May-19 07:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So we‚Äôre on the bridge of the starship komodoprise looking at the BTC primitives discovering fire on the main viewer

[09-May-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
LN hubs might be money transmitters, it is not clear either way

[09-May-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they specifically exempted the things they cant actually control, ie. pure p2p decentralized things are ok

[09-May-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
while this is a pretty large overreach in some cases, for DEX it is very clear that there is no problem for any participant in the DEX as nobody ever has control of anybody elses funds

[09-May-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
they do say that if a dapp is a money transmitter, the one that runs the dapp needs a license. I think they assume that all dapp have some centrally controlling entity that controls it

[09-May-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess with ETH smartcontracts, there is a single contract that is paying GAS fees, so by seeing who is paying those fees, you can tell who controls it. very ominous problem for ETH dapps if this is indeed the case. it will need to prevent USSA peoples from using dapps?

[09-May-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
for CC, there is no single contract. it is transactionalized and by and large each user is controlling their own funds. there is the funds that go into a global address that is controlled by the blockchain. i cant see how the blockchain itself can be liable for a license as it is just code that is run on all the nodes, so likely this will be further clarified between centralized dapps vs decentralized dapps

[09-May-19 08:02 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c thx that make sense. Could a coin be bullied into change the code whit a tracker in it? What I'm trying to ask is would it be possible to have a decentralized based code. free from a centralised place to deploy it. If that make sense

[09-May-19 08:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
they are taken by surprise.. 1 euro is 1 euro.. 1 kmd is 1 kmd

[09-May-19 08:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
their main issue is with coming to terms with this wild phenomenon that they can't control, they can't put a central bank behind it, monitor it...
