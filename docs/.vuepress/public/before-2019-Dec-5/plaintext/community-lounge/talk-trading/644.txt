similarily if you believe 13k sats is a real price for KMD, try buying 50BTC at this price

[13-May-19 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
since you cant, i claim this is not the real price

too few players in BTC market, so the statistics breaks down

[13-May-19 10:05 PM] Tek#5253

ebay is gonna accept crypto

[13-May-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but if half a dozen people can literally paint whatever chart they want because they have so much BTC/fiat, then you need to predict what half a dozen whales will do

if you bought any alt at all though you'd be up in usd

[13-May-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and the press is also bought and paid for, so you can tell what the big whales want the market to do, at least until it is the end of the cycle

[13-May-19 10:07 PM] Tek#5253
i bought some xmr few hours ago its already up 15 euros.

[13-May-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
when everybody was sure BTC was headed to $1500, was the end of the bear

[13-May-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
like when everybody knew BTC was going from $20k to $50k

[13-May-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so the polarity of the news accuracy flips

@jl777c  you just said ``the behavior of a large number of people can be statistically modeled and this is why TA "works"`` and this is perfectly valid : in some TA books, TA figures are associated with some % in each market. Not enough data in crypto to be sure of anything. TA is only based on stats (resistances at key prices based on nothing except past prices, only human psychology)

hoping btc drops a grand or more the upcoming days

[14-May-19 01:48 AM] designer#4893
Summer is coming again. Last summer was the same. 
I talk about bitcoin, and listeners hear fantasy. 
When summer comes, people are saying that they do bitcoins, and there are so many people who do wrong coins. 
And when winter comes again, you'll resent Bitcoin.
 
This summer, Starbucks and IBM are going to lie. 
Their project may be meaningful in other contexts, but what they promote is something that, 
frankly, cannot be implemented in blockchain. 

Well, what can I do? 
It's probably a summer aspect of what bugs do, and as long as they can't sleep, people dance dreamy under the moonlight.
 
You'll only hear 'You're a fool this summer.'

Anyway, if the summer of blockchain comes, 

I hope you don't react 
do think.
