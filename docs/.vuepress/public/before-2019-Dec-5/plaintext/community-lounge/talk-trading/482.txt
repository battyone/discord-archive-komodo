Actually, I never design slides. I always wing them into existence 2 minutes prior.

[20-Mar-19 08:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Well, good thing I only make games and stuff 😃 that kind of thing isn't my forte

[20-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Write down the story you want to tell and let someone else design them :p

Mornings ☕ , Wonder what today will birng

[20-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jorian#4555

[20-Mar-19 08:51 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[20-Mar-19 08:53 AM] jorian#4555
very roughly

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
it first needs a correction from the 20 week MA, then when it breaks, it needs to break 50 week.

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
also, the resistance from the ATH is near

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
"need" is too strong a word

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
"historically" based on a sample of 1, that is what happened

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this next time will most likely deviate in some aspects

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
and look at the volume

[20-Mar-19 08:54 AM] jorian#4555
comparable too

[20-Mar-19 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
my gut feeling also says more blood to be expected

[20-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jorian#4555
i dont think we've been to the lowest yet

[20-Mar-19 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe because when in bear, you always expect more bear

[20-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jorian#4555
there's no reason to just go up again without a proper capitulation

[20-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
bull comes when you dont expect it

[20-Mar-19 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There has been a lot of proper capitulation though

[20-Mar-19 08:57 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Im on the other side i think the bottom was in at 3100 🤷

[20-Mar-19 08:57 AM] jorian#4555
i think alt season is needed

[20-Mar-19 08:59 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What started the 2016-2018 Bull run?

I remember it just gaining value everyday nothing special happened

[20-Mar-19 09:01 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
On the chart, As a human we want to see patterns in things to make them make sense, And that chart would suggest a rounded bottom at 2200 but who really knows

$BTC - the last time the Both indicators on the Weekly Stochastic RSI were topped off at 100, #bitcoin dropped almost 40% which would put the price somewhere around $2400 area...

[21-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am not convinced by btc atm tbh, price keeps creeping up on declining volume, which is usually bearish?

[21-Mar-19 09:52 AM] jorian#4555
the question is: if btc decides to go down, will alts go down too or will they decouple for an alt season?

[21-Mar-19 09:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont think there is enough confidence yet to decouple

[21-Mar-19 09:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe a couple of unicorns like BNB will keep their value better

[21-Mar-19 09:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but if btc shits the bed everybody will have to clean the poop

seems like btc is still struggling with the $4K barrier

[21-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Keppie#5156
Everytime i think im bullish, i check the weekly chart of BTCUSD

[21-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Keppie#5156
Its just not looking good

[21-Mar-19 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what happens when you do nothing to increase value, value doesn't go up

[21-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they have done a really good job of breaking most all of the existing infrastructure of code that uses BTC rpc calls

[21-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they also showed they could do a seamless hardfork when they fixed the double spending vin bug, overnight

[21-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they proved they can spend 4 years to make the most complex way to implement changing a blocksize #define

[21-Mar-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
these all are things that require "the worlds best programmers"

[21-Mar-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤣

[21-Mar-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
all the rhetoric about 4MB blocks being too big to be safe is contradicted by the fact that a segwit block can be as large as 4MB

[21-Mar-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
all the rhetoric about it not being feasible to do a hardfork, totally contradicted by how smoothly the hardfork fix for the double spend vin was achieved

[21-Mar-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so basically they have become great politicians and this should put them on equal footing as the fiat establishment

[21-Mar-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Mar-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yet, the hardfork was done to fix the double spending of vin

[21-Mar-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
basically the main points from btc legacy teams are proven as total lies by their own actions

[21-Mar-19 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The main reason I lost all hope for BTC is that every "reason" for Core to not make Bitcoin better/modern boils down to "poor people can't afford $30 upgrade to their PC"
meanwhile, those people can't actually use it anyway

[21-Mar-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
they need to have the fee market for LN to be in demand

[21-Mar-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
even though it is doubtful LN can scale, if LN isnt used then btc legacy political goals cant be met

[21-Mar-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretending that it were "perfect": I see a lot of glam for LN, but I see minimal "normal" uses for it and once "average" people realize that, it will be the MySpace of crypto
