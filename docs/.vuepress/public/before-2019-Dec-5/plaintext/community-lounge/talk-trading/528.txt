I mean your comment was valid ```ComputerGenie☑Vote4me☑Today at 5:12 PM
22k is disgusting
Only if BTC is your god```
If you rely on BTC for whatever, then yep, that may be bad

[09-Apr-19 10:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was more just curious what things(comparisons/exchange rates) you use to value KMD.

[09-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yep, and If I'm in Aus, buying a British product, selling to an American?`
No, in this equation you're in aus and selling an aus product to someone in the US and no part of Europe is ever involved in the shipping or transaction...

[09-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you still look up bps?

[09-Apr-19 10:18 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was using another example where you would take into account 3 markets, sorry that may not have been clear.
No you wouldn't is the answer to your scenario.

[09-Apr-19 10:18 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Who would ever look up the BPS market anyhow :troll:

[09-Apr-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`No you wouldn't is the answer to your scenario.`
And there's the answer to your initial question

[09-Apr-19 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Who would ever look up the BPS market anyhow`
the same people that look up BTC in the middle of something not connected to BTC

[09-Apr-19 10:20 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Serious question, could you buy KMD with BTC in the ICO? (trying to find a link whereby maybe you would?)

[09-Apr-19 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this is 2019 who gives a shit about the ICO

[09-Apr-19 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
did you ICO your AUD?

[09-Apr-19 10:23 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Naa I didn't, wasn't here for the ICO unfortunately! All I'd say is that maybe some people find random links to BTC. Personally, like you, I don't. I think educating people on why it isn't necessary to use BTC to value KMD would be something worthwhile.

[09-Apr-19 10:25 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not sure when the AUD ICO was, I missed out, you can't even mine it!

[09-Apr-19 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@crunchycat coming here asking where the dump was after dumping from 2450 to 1600 sats...

[10-Apr-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
dump has been since 2 hrs after trading started. losing 50% in a week after IEO... at least the OTC buyers made a bit of money

[10-Apr-19 06:46 AM] 74D30#6106

[10-Apr-19 10:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dunno... youtube's monopoly is concerning in light of recent deplatforming and I'm not convinced their payments to content creators are that generous considering the revenues Google enjoys spamming ads in the middle of sentences.

[10-Apr-19 10:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
either way, some competition is good... if anyone manages to step up.

`1 KMD = 1 KMD`
While I 100% agree with that, there's a irony that huts my brain in that it came from someone that uses the term  "alts" 😛

[10-Apr-19 12:53 PM] klein#5233
thats because it was a joke 😛

I'm not a minimalist, I think BTC has a place in crypto (albeit an historical place, much like the Triceratops)
