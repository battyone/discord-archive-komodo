[25-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Tek#5253
the dash dao funded a project to deliver 60k phones with pre loaded dash on them

> muh self funding chain isn't interesting

[25-Jul-19 04:31 PM] Tek#5253
Not to mention dash now also has a investment department and any dash holder basically holds a share , they will buy real estate, companies, land etc etc and try to flip them for profit.

[25-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Tek#5253
imagine if the dash investment fund at one time has a good amount of lands and corporations in portfolio

[25-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Tek#5253
imagine the advantages when you have dash

[25-Jul-19 04:33 PM] Tek#5253
already dreaming about when they are super succesful and buy an island. Dash island. You can only visit if you have dash.

[25-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Tek#5253
I have a feel altcoin season is starting

[25-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Caglio#3337
@Tek im gonna buy some dash

[25-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Tek#5253
@Caglio any smart man would. BCH is trying to build what DASH already has right now, it will take 2 years at least. pre consensus to enable instant transactions and anti 51%

[25-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Tek#5253
the only thing holding dash back is the relatively high inflation compared to bitcoin.

[25-Jul-19 04:55 PM] LocoMB#8593
sure:
Reversilbe transactions are necessary because the rollack preserves the trust in dash in case of disaster. You have to preserve trust at all cost, because money without trust is nothing. In the bad case where a theft occurs and the trust in dash is lost, the only way to recover the trust is to revert the transactions.

Reversible transactions can also be used as a form of taxation. which is also necessary for a nation to work properly.

The key point is who decides the rollback of the transactions. The rollback should be decided by all dash community persons with the rule one_person--one_vote and not by the core team or by the masternode owners.

[25-Jul-19 04:56 PM] LocoMB#8593
sounds like a greasy central banker..

have they fixed this nonsense?!?! or.. prly they didn't, because hidden pre-mine-protection

[25-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Tek#5253
> muh premine 
it was a litecoin bug, not a dash bug.

[25-Jul-19 04:59 PM] Tek#5253
they used it, fixed it, and gave away all the coins to spread adoption

[25-Jul-19 04:59 PM] Tek#5253
in litecoins case. charlton lee kept them all

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Tek#5253
@LocoMB I don't agree that everyone should be able to vote. cause democracy doesn't work. dumb people shouldn't be able to vote

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
nono, I mean did they fix the 'not-money-bug-because-not-immutable'

[25-Jul-19 05:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
but you are oki with TX reversibility?

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
depends.

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
like a bit pregnant?

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
i dunno maybe having a asset that actually has reverseable TX capability is an advantage.

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
im trying to make good investments here

[25-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Tek#5253
I don't care about anything else

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
that is not a good investment

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Tek#5253
dash has a legal office in australia

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] Tek#5253
it has so many branches

[25-Jul-19 05:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
sure, like all the Wall $treet tentacles

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
what i see is that dash has all the things in place for adoption

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
you'll be better off investing in Goldman Sachs

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
nah

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah like LIBRA- but that is not a money either

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
libra is bound to fiat currency

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] Tek#5253
so useless

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
better invest in LIBRA, coz Zuck'll fuck DASH raw

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
you can't "invest" in libra

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
it would be the same as investing in national currencies

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
you can invest in Facebook or Paypal, and thus invest in LIBRA

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] Tek#5253
libra is not facebook, its their money spying tool bound to a basket of national currencies

[25-Jul-19 05:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
better go for that, coz DASH will be raped raw by Zuckcoin

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
oh, fine sematnic difference! sure LIBRA is not Facebook ü§°

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
facebook is going to die soon.

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
people are leaving

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
I left, many of my friends left

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
the hype is gone

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
it will live in poor countries

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] Tek#5253
even girls leave

[25-Jul-19 05:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
that still doesn't make DASH money, because if you can roll back TXs it is a plastic plantation token that can be yanked at its masters whim (hint: which is not you)

DASH never _is_ your coin in the first place

[25-Jul-19 05:09 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[25-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
would never invest in something with a rollback function being on a blockchain....such scamaz

[25-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Tek#5253
yall invest in super nerd shit only

[25-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Tek#5253
stacy doesn't want any KMD

[25-Jul-19 05:11 PM] Tek#5253
stacy wants dash

[25-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464
who care what stacy wants

[25-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464
nobody

[25-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Tek#5253
I do. cause that's how you make good investments. you buy before stacy.

[25-Jul-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[25-Jul-19 05:17 PM] Tek#5253
P.S , stacy will also buy NANO.

Bitcoin has better roi then dash, btc did 3-4 x roi but dash barely did 2 x

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
dash came from a few cents

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
just like bitcoin

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
give it a few more years

[25-Jul-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
gonna be 10k per dash

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] Caglio#3337
i remember glory days of dash

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] altcoinist#1501
Dash lost it's market share

[25-Jul-19 05:22 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Why is kmd so sleepy?

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
rollback functionality will likely be a govt mandated feature for crypto that seeks regulatory approval. perhaps dash is simply bending the knee to the anticipated crypto overlords

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Tek#5253
Doesn't matter, Dash didn't lose adoption or hashrate

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Tek#5253
or moving forward

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Tek#5253
bitcoin will fall eventually if they stick to 1mb blocks

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Tek#5253
its written on the walls.

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Tek#5253
no one wants to pay a $10 fee to send $100 to a friend

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Y‚Äôall must have missed the news that btc can be rolled back with a conference call. Just saying

[25-Jul-19 05:24 PM] altcoinist#1501
Dash digital trash (sorry) üòÇ

[25-Jul-19 05:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
btc is king shitcoin now, has been for awhile

[25-Jul-19 05:25 PM] Tek#5253
@Deleted User  there are , 52 BTC pools that controll all the hash

[25-Jul-19 05:25 PM] Tek#5253
they all know each other

[25-Jul-19 05:25 PM] Tek#5253
and they do 51% to reverse transactions when necissary

[25-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Tek#5253
no, if you have majority hashrate you win

[25-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Tek#5253
so if the pools decide to reverse a transaction together

[25-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Tek#5253
that's what happens

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Tek#5253
it is

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Tek#5253
it happened on BCH few months ago

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Tek#5253
and the BCH pools are the BTC pools

[25-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Tek#5253
lmao you have no clue how it al lworks

[25-Jul-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
the btc and bch miners are the same
