btc dominance 66.0, eth dominance 8.56%

[24-Oct-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
why does it feel like the dominance of btc is going down without much of the dominance change in alts ? ü§î

[24-Oct-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
fiat money getting out from cryptocurrency at the moment?

[24-Oct-19 09:37 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Because a lot of Fiat stable coins going into DeFi

[24-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Synthetix SNX, sUSD,.sETH, DAI

[24-Oct-19 09:38 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lending is over 10% for DAI

[24-Oct-19 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... interesting... so the value of those new stable coins will be up in dominance in such case ü§î gradually.....

[24-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I don't look at stablecoin dominance

[24-Oct-19 09:39 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I don't view stablecoins as crypto

[24-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
They're a tool to transfer into crypto

[24-Oct-19 09:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Based on $1 value, which is what crypto wanted to get away from

[24-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Privatoshi#9487
DAI Lending is the new Bitmex

[24-Oct-19 09:41 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Liquidating loans that fall below their collateralizion

[24-Oct-19 09:43 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@grewalsatinder. if people can't profit on basic trading or lose their tail off for holding a short period of time, DeFi is attractive

[24-Oct-19 10:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If alts ever come back, it‚Äôll be years from now

[24-Oct-19 10:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

I've trippled my kmd bag but I'm still underwater BTC wise

[24-Oct-19 11:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve halved mine

[24-Oct-19 11:12 AM] Sherdogz#6731
üòÜ  that's because you've to much KMD

[24-Oct-19 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
is there even such a thing

[24-Oct-19 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as too much kmd

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Yep in my eyes there is... Haha there comes a point when you should have enough to make good money if KMD is ever going to be worth double digits

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Sherdogz#6731
I would be happy with ‚Ç¨2 kmd to be honest

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
50k sat kmd at 50k usd btc is fine

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
;p

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
aim for the stars to land on the moon

[24-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
What‚Äôs a better buy atm, Btc or kmd?

[24-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
In your opinions

[24-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I honestly dont know

[24-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say btc dumps more, will kmd/btc also dump more?

[24-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say btc moons, will kmd/btc dump or will it also rise?

[24-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the correlation between the two movements hasnt been true anymore in the past

[24-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd/btc seems quite bottomed out atm, fibbonacci gives a 6250sat level as lowest retracement level

[24-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so there's not that much stretch

[24-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On the other hand, if you are buying with fresh fiat, one also needs to consider btc/usd price before making kmd/btc moves

[24-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you think btc to drop lower, it might be wise to wait out on kmd/btc, as waiting still yields more kmd later

[24-Oct-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
everything is dependent (as always) on big daddy btc atm

[24-Oct-19 01:05 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I‚Äôve been putting too much into crypto and don‚Äôt have much fiat reserves to buy when shtf like today üòÇ would you wait it out a bit more or keep dca

[24-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I told myself to wait a week yesterday

[24-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if btc/usd doesnt make significant moves by then I'm buying more kmd

[24-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
All I see is a dead coin walking. Maybe a nice exit pump right before the bitcoin halving.

[24-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Keytothegate#8453
My strategy has been to dca with half of what i would like to dca and keep the rest and wait for decent and real reversal and then hit that other half

[24-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Keytothegate#8453
Been waiting and dca:ing for some time nowüòÖ

[24-Oct-19 03:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok bro @Kitchen Table

[24-Oct-19 05:06 PM] Bitboy#7242
Spoiler alert @jl777c  is Satoshi

[24-Oct-19 05:25 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Satoshi got off putting in just a year or two of work.. JL been doing this grind for coming up on a decade.

[24-Oct-19 05:29 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm surprised to see that nobody trades  KMD/ETH

[24-Oct-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
Not today but normaly its pretty active on binance

[24-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
Still wanna see kmd/usd volume rise to millions üòÅ

[24-Oct-19 11:15 PM] bishop#9773
I bought some more ARRR... just getting silly at this point

[25-Oct-19 02:33 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
ya

[25-Oct-19 02:33 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i keep buying at every new atl

[25-Oct-19 02:33 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
thinking "damn! these prices just keep getting better and better"

[25-Oct-19 02:33 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
shits bout to go to zero

[25-Oct-19 04:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
the pain is being felt across all alts. if a true massacre is about to be dealt, kmd will be one of the few left standing.

[25-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Agreed kmd ain‚Äôt going nowhere

[25-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Sherdogz#6731
If KMD would Go to zero is it still feasible to run a node....

[25-Oct-19 05:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs not going to zero.

just be ready to help spread the word about stress testing when it's announced üòÑ

[25-Oct-19 05:45 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I wouldnt buy touch an alt right now, even with any of your guys bitcoin

[25-Oct-19 05:46 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you don't have to buy, just help spread ,dude üôÇ

[25-Oct-19 05:47 AM] Privatoshi#9487
My suggestion, copy CMC 1-800 to your Google Docs or Spreadsheet.  And highlight the projects you think will survive, in the end. Komodo has always been one of mine, since the beginning.

[25-Oct-19 05:48 AM] Privatoshi#9487
At 60 cents it offers the same amount of dedication it did at $4, or even higher, say $10.

[25-Oct-19 05:49 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@Gordon Komodo I've always spread the word...

@Gordon Komodo What are you saying to others, about this specifically?

[25-Oct-19 06:10 AM] Sherdogz#6731
What does blockchain have to offer for the average joe right now to adopt it. I still don't know the awnser.

[25-Oct-19 06:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
What blockchain offers: self-banking, cheap money transfer, data integrity checks , global public storage. Blockchain for the most part will not be for the average joe  , it will be mainly used in business.

[25-Oct-19 06:18 AM] Oszy#5734
financial freedom / privacy mostly

[25-Oct-19 06:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I hope it offers those two, in the near future. We are up against all World Governments. They've always gotten their taxes, going back thousands of years. 
Privacy? Blockchain is inherently perfect for surveillance.

[25-Oct-19 06:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
yes, and the cashless society is rapidly approaching. crypto is the only alternative. networks that are less susceptible to attacks will be the only ones to survive

[25-Oct-19 06:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
and if cex's are outlawed, atomic dex will be the only way to trade trustlessly

[25-Oct-19 07:04 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes i know what it offers... But most people don't care about self banking, data storage, ownership etc....

[25-Oct-19 07:05 AM] Oszy#5734
right now maybe, but the next generation will be different,

[25-Oct-19 07:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
they will when their accounts are frozen for supporting the wrong candidate or saying the wrong thing on social media.

[25-Oct-19 07:05 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Privacy is getting increasingly important but for now it isn't critical for the consumer...

[25-Oct-19 07:06 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes there must be a catalysts for thinga to happen

[25-Oct-19 07:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
its already happening. Hong Kong, Chile... the financial control grid is not yet complete, however it will be soon.

I dont want to be doomsayer, and there are other things to consider. If btc goes to zero there may be some problems for kmd. but that doesnt seem likely.

[25-Oct-19 07:18 AM] Oszy#5734
`If btc goes to zero` do you honestly think that there will be a day when everyone will give up on btc? I can see it could lose it's #1 position but not going to 0 imo.

[25-Oct-19 07:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
No, just a hypothetical scenario

[25-Oct-19 07:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
for the sake of the "kmd goes to zero" argument

[25-Oct-19 07:22 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Hypothetical.... What would it take for kmd to go to zero?

[25-Oct-19 07:24 AM] Oszy#5734
as long as btc is the main comparison for prices, anything can go to zero.  hypothetically imagine btc disappears tomorrow, what would take it's place, how much would everything else worth? the market would have to find a way to regain / keep value of everything else,  it is way too much fiat flown into the system already.
there is life without btc, we just don't know yet, how that'd look like.

[25-Oct-19 07:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
when you think about the hardware, electricity, and human time used to create and maintain the larger crypto ecosystem. You would have to erase pretty large amount of "stuff" to get rid of crypto.

[25-Oct-19 07:29 AM] Oszy#5734

[25-Oct-19 07:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
ahem... the technical expertise to build and maintain blockchains is in high demand. it goes way beyond any project traded on any exchange. right now no investor cares about a team's technical ability. just hype and bs. No proof needed at all. cough Chainlink cough

[25-Oct-19 07:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
/end rant.

[25-Oct-19 07:42 AM] Oszy#5734
these will all die like the other p&d projects, it's a longer game, there will be a day when tech will matter more than marketing and empty words.

https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/komodo-prediction   -  very soon start FOMO season for KMD!

KMD is rated C while XRP & TRON  are rated A+ ...

[25-Oct-19 10:20 AM] Flint#6435
@PHBA2061 the data set for determining the rating is very different and comparing projects with a billion capitalization and projects with a capitalization of several tens of millions is not completely correct! When KMD reaches a capitalization of one billion dollars then the ratings will be different and they will become more aware of the project! Now few ordinary people have heard about the project, but more people have heard about XRP.

[25-Oct-19 10:24 AM] Oszy#5734
`price of Komodo may drop from 0.498 USD to 0.179 USD` ok but it's because btc will go 3k, or kmd will go 2k sats? only thing you can to here is tether it üòÑ
