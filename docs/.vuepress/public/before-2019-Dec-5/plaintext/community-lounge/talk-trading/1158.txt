Brings back memories of omisego and their maccas partnership üòÇ where do you think we‚Äôre going from here on

[24-Sep-19 10:42 PM] Caglio#3337
down

[24-Sep-19 10:42 PM] Caglio#3337
where else

[24-Sep-19 10:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Trading is ok, holding is not

[24-Sep-19 10:43 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
litecoin history chart is good indication for up coming altseason.

[24-Sep-19 10:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Is it ?

[24-Sep-19 10:45 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
LTC chart sep 1. - dec 15. 2017. Dumping 3 months and then moon.

LTC dips hard before every altseason begins

[24-Sep-19 10:47 PM] Caglio#3337
ltc dips from 2017

[24-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Caglio#3337
and why dont u think

[24-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Caglio#3337
we had alt season when kmd went back from 0.5 to almost 2

[24-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Caglio#3337
it was a pretty decent alt season

[24-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Caglio#3337
now we are in a "dip that never stops" phase again

[24-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Caglio#3337
I like to call it " dead cat bounce "

[24-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Past 3 months LTC only come down with little dead cat jumps along the way. Altseason imminet? Or few weeks maybe?

[24-Sep-19 10:55 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
LTC is -67% vs btc since jun 12th.

[24-Sep-19 10:56 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
that is almost as bad kmd did since july 15.

[24-Sep-19 10:58 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Who knows? All I have is hopium left. Maybe history is not repeating itself anymore. New paradigm. Everything go to 0.

[24-Sep-19 11:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Well good luck sir

[24-Sep-19 11:15 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
stablecoins ruin altcoin markets, because big time traders always have safe haven. I miss the old times before stablecoins when everything was traded against btc only.

Nothing new under the sun. Fiat ruins everything. Crypto was supposed to be about crypto. Now we are again in fiat trap and no foreseeable way out of it. Btc maximalists are really just $usdt maximalists.

[24-Sep-19 11:22 PM] Markus#5464
Stable coins are definitely taking away the taste of crypto since the whole point was rly to go away from the fiat system but yet there seem to pop up more and more stable coins

[24-Sep-19 11:24 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
The establisment of course want crypto to be all about stablecoins. That's why we see them popping up everywhere.

[24-Sep-19 11:24 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
That kind of defeats the whole purpose of crypto.

KMD looking really bullish on weekly, bullish divergence on macd, seems like we have some sort of support around 6k and stochastic rsi is kinda bottoming for quite sometime already

[24-Sep-19 11:27 PM] Markus#5464
Dont see why it would not make a nice jump quite soon

[24-Sep-19 11:29 PM] Neko#5830
looks like it will +100% any day now

kmd is definitely not getting thumped as hard as many others. so I guess that's good news.

From the Brave browser:

"If you visit our community or social media pages, you may have noticed that we‚Äôve reached out regarding KYC and connecting your account with Uphold. Starting October 1st, 2019, if you do not create and verify your account with Uphold including Uphold Verified Membership, you will not be able to receive direct tips from Brave user funds. A user who attempts to tip a non-verified publisher will not be able to do so, and the BAT will not leave their wallet. We highly recommend that you log into your Creator dashboard and connect your Uphold account as soon as is possible."

what a joke

[25-Sep-19 05:39 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I know

[25-Sep-19 05:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
it seems everyone is caving in recently

[25-Sep-19 05:40 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
And they use traditional unsafe verification, not a blockchain method

[25-Sep-19 05:40 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
So they put data and privacy at risk

[25-Sep-19 05:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
what blockchain method? it's erc20 no?!

[25-Sep-19 05:41 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I mean, there are some new methods to verify ID, I was talking about their KYC

[25-Sep-19 05:41 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
They use Uphold

[25-Sep-19 05:42 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
And as we know, sending documents and personal data is not safe, they all get hacked sooner or later

[25-Sep-19 05:44 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Anyway, more info here:

[25-Sep-19 05:48 AM] hastrup#8742
Then bat and brave browser is over?

[25-Sep-19 05:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
i wonder how much work would be to fork it and use kmd sc instead of erc20

[25-Sep-19 05:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
I like brave. they won't kyc you just for using the browser, right?

[25-Sep-19 05:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
no, but still shady

[25-Sep-19 06:00 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@actionslacks lol fortunately no...if they KYCed for just using the browser...they would be much worse than Google

[25-Sep-19 06:04 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@mrlynch that would be amazing for mass adoption of KMD if there was a privacy browser using it

[25-Sep-19 06:05 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
but don't know if they would then be forced to do KYC anyway

[25-Sep-19 06:22 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Basically I think for it to work it would need to be a completely decentralized browser and not belong to a company, otherwise there's no way out of KYC I imagine

[25-Sep-19 06:23 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
(if it has a system of rewards with tokens I mean)

[25-Sep-19 06:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe brave would be down to help. or at least offer some advice.
