KMD stablecoin crashing to 88 cents now 😛

[23-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Not even a dollar

[23-Aug-19 11:28 PM] tolken#2655
Funny how this sub 0.0001 surge is kinda exciting. We’ve been whipped.

[23-Aug-19 11:34 PM] cryptonut#3061
if bitcoin does its part and stays boring i think we'll hit 10k soon enough

@SHossain i ordered a case with fan included but has not arrived

[24-Aug-19 12:04 AM] Alexfrog#1338
you got slightly excited?  oops, crashing again.

[24-Aug-19 12:10 AM] SHossain#0007
Nice one @PTYX . Here's how I'm liquid cooling my raspi :P

Is that actually.... A thing?

@SHossain

[24-Aug-19 12:24 AM] SHossain#0007
What do you mean? 20 degrees lower temp than running normally without liquid or fan

[24-Aug-19 12:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But what liquid is that?

[24-Aug-19 12:25 AM] SHossain#0007
Dielectric mineral oil kind of thing

[24-Aug-19 12:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok

[24-Aug-19 12:25 AM] SHossain#0007
Got it from USA

[24-Aug-19 12:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nice

[24-Aug-19 01:06 AM] tolken#2655
Yes, excited that my orders keep getting filled.

Hate when Kmd does nothing 😛

At the height of 2017 altcoin mania easily the top 20 on CMC were billion dollar markets. An $89,000 BTC would probably mean that the top 60 would be billion dollar markets. If Komodo stayed in top 60, it would easily be a $10 coin. My prediction is it floats to top 25-30 at $80-$150 per coin.

Does anybody want to buy my coin directly? I don’t have time to wait to get it set up on the DEX. I’ll give it at a discount. Someone please buy I have no funds to work with right now.

[24-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jorian#4555
@VengeanceWithout why would i buy your coin?

[24-Aug-19 04:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
Cause its on sale, bro.  Heh.  But yeah, why not just sell it on an exchange?  And I am always fascinated when crypto investors say things like, "I have no funds to work with right now."  So you want to sell your "coin" in an alt bear season at near its lowest price?  So you can have funds to "work with?"  What?  What kind of work?  More trades to put you in a worse position than before?  Pffft.

[24-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Tek#5253
no  i do not want to buy your scam

[24-Aug-19 04:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
But if he has naked pictures of his girlfriend, @Caglio might buy them...

I am just selling nudes, not buying

[24-Aug-19 04:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
my bad.  I thought you were in both the buyer's and seller's market.

Komodo Prepares For A 111.1% Profits Wave @alanmasters for BITTREX...
I love Komodo (KMDBTC) as a cryptocurrency project as well as a crypto-trading pair.

The first being because it is a solid project and the second because it always generates great profits for us. I am mostly called to this chart at the right time...

Let's take a look at Kom...

I just shared a link its not my analysis 🙄

[24-Aug-19 07:32 PM] tolken#2655
Key lesson of remember, don’t try and time it perfectly. We’re at the bottom or pretty damn near. Could be a worse time to start DCAing in.

[24-Aug-19 07:34 PM] Neko#5830

Waiting for this confirmation is worse than waiting at the fucking DMV

[24-Aug-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
if you have the txid you can push it into the btc pool with free slots

[24-Aug-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
viabtc ? I don't remember but @SHossain  knows

[24-Aug-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s almost been an hour since the last block

[24-Aug-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
in this kind of situation, I go to a bitcoin chat and I explain the situation, tell that it is unacceptable and I ask to discuss with the CEO of bitcoin then I tag/ping a BTC dev and a miner

[24-Aug-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
everyone needs humor during bear market

at the beginning of each hour they accept new tx to include in the block that they mine

Sending BTC to my wallet first was a wise decision

[24-Aug-19 09:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’ll jack my fee to get this one through

[24-Aug-19 09:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This really is fucking awful

[24-Aug-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395
if you become a BTC miner, you'll get a part of this fee

[24-Aug-19 09:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC is a sitting duck, network effect will only carry your ass so far

[24-Aug-19 09:46 PM] phm87#7395
BTC is still the blockchain where KMD is notarized to, it can still be used

[24-Aug-19 09:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Day to day utility is absolute shit

[24-Aug-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
but it seems that BTC won't be easy to use by ppl who are not rick (50$ of fee per tx soon, again)

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
One hit 3 minutes ago

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
My tx bot included of course

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe we can wait another hour

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] phm87#7395
that's cool : I saw bitcoiner waiting days to see his 0 fee tx getting confirmed

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fucking ridiculous

[24-Aug-19 09:49 PM] phm87#7395
poor ppl can still use BTC but they should be patient

[24-Aug-19 09:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Digital price fucked me

[24-Aug-19 09:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’ll pay tx fees

DP fuckery is not necessary linked to BTC : DP is DP

[24-Aug-19 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
sometimes, I prefer to withdraw from small exchanges in kmd/ltc/eth and change to btc or fiat on a bigger exchange with lover fees

[24-Aug-19 09:52 PM] phm87#7395
more and more exchanges are adopting sendmany (that exist since years) to pay per batch but also bench32 addresses where fees are 30 to 75% lower

[24-Aug-19 09:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Second block

[24-Aug-19 09:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@meatspoon look I didn’t buy them I mined them. I want to sell them cus I have no funds at all. I know now is not a good time for me to sell however to others it’s a good investment. My coin is worth 100$ USD currently and I’ve seen it go to over 700$.

@VengeanceWithout what the heck do you need $100 for?  Cashing out of crypto for a small grocery shopping trip?

No I mean they are worth around 100$ a coin. You have no idea what I’ve been through to get to this point.  I have a lot of them too.
