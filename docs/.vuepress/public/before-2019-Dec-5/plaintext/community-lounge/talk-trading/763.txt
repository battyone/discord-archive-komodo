I will need to get more details. I'm not 100%

[13-Jun-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so a user sending to someone else, that is ok? they will still let us transact?

[13-Jun-19 05:59 AM] PTYX#6840
hopefully they release more information soon

[13-Jun-19 05:59 AM] PTYX#6840
it seems to be custodians and exchanges but it's likely they would have included blanket laws for all crypto businesses

[13-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
bloomberg article said the rule might force user to trade directly with other user. They can't enforce it in this scenario anyway

[13-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
didn't mention anything about non custodial wallet

[13-Jun-19 06:02 AM] PTYX#6840
yeah, we have to wait for the actual law to see what it includes. hopefully noncustodial is out

[13-Jun-19 06:02 AM] PTYX#6840
which means dex and otc will likely spike

[13-Jun-19 06:03 AM] PTYX#6840
maybe that's why some exchanges delisted preemptively some tokens

[13-Jun-19 06:03 AM] PTYX#6840
they were preparing for something

[13-Jun-19 06:03 AM] PTYX#6840
bittrex even delisted NEM

[13-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
we all know something like this will come sooner or later

[13-Jun-19 06:05 AM] PTYX#6840
@Deleted User you might want to look into that

[13-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000

this specificity makes a huge difference. as always we can just passively wait ^^

[13-Jun-19 09:45 AM] Malti#3948
seems like the evolve campaign will run aside extra regulations

[13-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Trex delisted nem why?

[13-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What a worthless shitbox

[13-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[13-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[13-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
probably because USSA regulations

@PTYX i have helped setup cryptocoin ATM machines. They have custom limits you can set for anon people, "registered" and people who have given over lots of details, to get higher per transaction or per day limits.

anyone have info on Eidoo? I've been watching it lately, seems some big volume pops have been driving it up lately. It's been on my radar as A) It's a mobile wallet I tried out long ago, and held on to because they were doing airdrops, and B) one of the few places to buy Unus Sed Leo (bitfinex) token outside of Bitfinex. I even saw one of the Finex execs tweet about them the other day, so there must be some deeper connection

[13-Jun-19 02:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Anything from the folks at bitfinex, who brought out the tether printer and subsequently the 2017 giga pump I personally view with great suspicion.

[13-Jun-19 02:29 PM] nasbats#7785
Yeah, it's shady, but fuck it if they don't actually have a lot of good products to use, and are robust enough to have actually taken all the hits they have. Disclosure, I hold (a really small amount) of $LEO

@ryman112 yeah, holy cow.  I usually just look at my CMC watchlist and sort by %change to see who the winners are.  But today I mis-clicked and got on the top 100 before sorting by percent gain and I was shocked to see that.  The chart is hilarious.  Its like I am one of the Free Folk seeing The Wall for the first time.  WTF is that, Mance?

@ryman112 yeah, the 1-month chart is something but the 1-week chart is... well, more extreme.  exciting and interesting stuff.  I am glad there are people out there making money and getting ahead.  Cheers to those who took profit!

In the last 6 months, Binance had nearly 185 million estimated visitors on the site. At least 30 million of them came from the United States. This is a devastating announcement by Binance and proof that regulators are cracking down on non-U.S. based exchanges.
