basically all i meant was, to get a sutained bull run going we needed to break that 31 dec high we now have done so, so lets see if we get a longer term uptrend going

[18-Feb-19 05:33 AM] Likewise#6767
it is fun to trade the peaks/valleys but I'd much prefer to start a loger term trend now

[18-Feb-19 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on that we can agree
on the "no progress", we differ and dec 31 has no bearing

[18-Feb-19 05:34 AM] Likewise#6767
yeah the no progress I meant are the pumps/dumps who basicalle do nothing more the na return up/down ride/ of course now we are making progress 😉

[18-Feb-19 05:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dec 31 candle wick was almost literally 2x the bottom

[18-Feb-19 05:36 AM] Likewise#6767
lets hope we continue coz for me at 47 I have seeem anough charts, basically one last good run in crypto and I'm done. Not saying I made all in crypto, far from but if I can get a good times 5 I'm set. Life outhere, 1 to 2 million$ u are golden, Asia still has value to offer.  Yes also on the pussy not so much on the coke, bad quality lol

[18-Feb-19 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I meant are the pumps/dumps who basicalle do nothing more the na return up/down ride`
the pds themselves, yes; however, as I pointed out multiply there was a sustained upward trend through the end of each

[18-Feb-19 05:37 AM] Likewise#6767
yes started in November, since then we seemed to bounce on support and the pumps get higher which could turn it into a l;onger term uptrend

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
see, when you actually listen to the kid, you agree with him 😛

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] Likewise#6767
hahahah cool kid 😉

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] Likewise#6767
u cnac all me dad now, or are  u older then I am haha

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you got my by 1.5-2 years 😛

[18-Feb-19 05:39 AM] Likewise#6767
oh so both old for crypto lol. Guess most are early 20'es and 30'ies

[18-Feb-19 05:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't see ages, I see dots 😛

[18-Feb-19 05:40 AM] Likewise#6767
hahaha, I'm no nothing about programming and stuff completely blind for it.

[18-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Markus#5464

[18-Feb-19 05:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[18-Feb-19 05:43 AM] Likewise#6767
No, far from I come from a diving back ground, was an offshore diver on gas/oil fields, my father died at young age so I got the sto pworking at 36, took my savings+inheritance and started trading.......lots of margin calls in the beginning, then started looking into courses on global macro/ecomomics, took another approach to my trading, as in less trades higher returns and eventually become consitently profitable, some quarters good some awesome some bad but overall made good returns.

[18-Feb-19 05:44 AM] Markus#5464
alright nice

[18-Feb-19 05:45 AM] Likewise#6767
March 2017 got into BTC, took a step back from the tradional markets, made some good $ on BTC and as said, hoping for one more good run to close shop 😃

[18-Feb-19 05:45 AM] Likewise#6767
and now hodler of BTC and KMD 😃

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Markus#5464
have u ever looked into market cycles?

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes yes, big part of global macro, I use them a lot in the tradional markets

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] Likewise#6767
For market cycles a great guy to have a look at on youtube or twitter is bob Loukas, he has a video about the BTC cycles

[18-Feb-19 05:47 AM] Markus#5464
theres some ppl doing market cycle analysis on btc for next bull run, they predict it can top at 100k usd, whats ur thoughts on that?

[18-Feb-19 05:48 AM] Likewise#6767
I honestly have no idea where it could go but if this or in the near future is the start of a new 4 year bull cycle, yeah 50 to 100K why not. but have a look at Bob Loukas, free video, he explains this really well.

[18-Feb-19 05:49 AM] Markus#5464
yea i saw his video

[18-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Likewise#6767
I tend to think his analysis is pretty much as close as we can get. Or you got the bears Tone vase who still says we will see lower then 1000$. Following and knowing both in the trading industry (vase wasaround since fx when i started) I tend to give more credit to Bob.

[18-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Likewise#6767
Now, better, I have way more KMD then BTC, so I'd much prefer KMD to got lets say 8 or 9$

[18-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Likewise#6767
or KMD at 90$ yeah baby hahah

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Markus#5464
well if we consider eth went from like 9$ to 1400$ 2017

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Markus#5464
i dont see 100$ being impossible

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Markus#5464
very possible i would say

[18-Feb-19 05:53 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed, that is why I have it in teh back of my head that there is a chance of a real golden run

[18-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Likewise#6767
and I really love the 5% I'm getting

[18-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Markus#5464
it is for sure a sleeping giant, let the custom blockchain generator go live on amazons marketplace

[18-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Markus#5464
and u will see huge gains

[18-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Likewise#6767
nice, in the mean time this 5% adds up nicely

[18-Feb-19 05:55 AM] Markus#5464
haha 😄

[18-Feb-19 05:56 AM] Likewise#6767
go figure, most retired people living in the tropics would kill to get 5% steady yield

[18-Feb-19 05:56 AM] Likewise#6767
so here we got 5% yield + a big chance of multifold %%% returns.

[18-Feb-19 05:57 AM] Markus#5464
yea even better if u got a huge stack and then get 5%, basically living life on no cost

[18-Feb-19 05:57 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed

[18-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Likewise#6767
bounced nicely off of 0.000235

[18-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Markus#5464
yea was a quick bump

[18-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Markus#5464

[18-Feb-19 06:00 AM] Likewise#6767

[18-Feb-19 06:01 AM] Likewise#6767
884 BTC,

[18-Feb-19 06:01 AM] Markus#5464
yea, not bad volume on bittrex either

[18-Feb-19 06:01 AM] Markus#5464
does not usually have that amount

[18-Feb-19 06:01 AM] Likewise#6767
think binance is the biggest player

[18-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Markus#5464
yea for sure is

[18-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Likewise#6767
u got GRIN lol

[18-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Markus#5464
actually volume is higher on upbit kmd/krw pair

[18-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Markus#5464

[18-Feb-19 08:40 AM] Tek#5253
im thinking KMD isn't going to come down much anymore

[18-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
volume still super high

[18-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
nice to see

[18-Feb-19 08:49 AM] Tek#5253
im thinking 23k is the next low to pick up at

[18-Feb-19 08:49 AM] Tek#5253
if it even goes back

[18-Feb-19 08:49 AM] Tek#5253
at all

[18-Feb-19 08:59 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
2340

[18-Feb-19 08:59 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
i say...

[18-Feb-19 09:28 AM] Malti#3948
in the end it will go back down if BTC doesn't move for now

[18-Feb-19 09:28 AM] Malti#3948
we're all benefiting from a BTC pickup atm, so let's hope it keeps going

[18-Feb-19 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072

[18-Feb-19 12:30 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
