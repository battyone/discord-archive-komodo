I still don't see how people could want to hold tether without ever seeing proof that the USD exists

[15-Oct-18 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont think many people actually hold tether as a store of value

[15-Oct-18 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its used just as a mechanism for maintaining btc value during corrections

[15-Oct-18 10:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
as long as there are exchanges like binance who use only usdt, there will be use case for it.

[15-Oct-18 10:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No, I mean hold/use it at all

I get that being in this space requires less skepticism than most things in life, but it seems to me that, when it comes to tether, it's just like ICOs in that people just get so overwhelmed with fomo that they are completely devoid of *all* skepticism  😕

@jl777c over 5M worth of KMD traded today. Will we get over the magical 1k BTC mark

[15-Oct-18 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like bids building above the 350BTC bid

[15-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Buddz1993#5380
5 million volume 😃

[15-Oct-18 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dam'd near 1/2 way there

[15-Oct-18 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
75% way there

[15-Oct-18 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Decent day, would be nice if it just spiked to 30k lol

[15-Oct-18 11:33 AM] snowdamn#2414
inevitable

[15-Oct-18 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
28k would break me even 😛

[15-Oct-18 11:33 AM] blubbi#0643
yeahr

[15-Oct-18 11:33 AM] blubbi#0643
maybe a spike up to 25-28k

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was one of those suckers that bought in at $2+ :P_

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blubbi#0643
😄

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I bought some at $9 LOL

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wow

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blubbi#0643
haha :D
damn

[15-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I sold some at $10 to buy GPUs, does that count?

[15-Oct-18 11:35 AM] blubbi#0643
seems more legit

[15-Oct-18 11:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well i did buy lots cheaper, but $9 was my max. ummm bought a decent amount too at that price hehe

[15-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One of these days I'll stop using KMD as currency and bag up LOL

[15-Oct-18 11:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Should already have your bag 😃

[15-Oct-18 11:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I buy on the way up and on the way down, probably should learn to sell some

[15-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Every time I get a decent bag I buy more equipment
Damn the soul of a miner 😝

[15-Oct-18 11:37 AM] blubbi#0643
selling at the right time not to get greedy is the hardest part 😄

[15-Oct-18 11:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
says everyone that didnt sell at 20k LOL

[15-Oct-18 11:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Greedy people are we

[15-Oct-18 11:37 AM] blubbi#0643
didnt even sold at 88k xD

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're not greedy all the time, then you're in the wrong space

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I bought also a big portion at 55k sats , averaged down to  32k sats 😒

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It will work out in the end.

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or we will all be poor

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] blubbi#0643
just be patienced my friend 😉

[15-Oct-18 11:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I like my odds though

[15-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blubbi#0643
komodo will get ur lambo on day 😛

[15-Oct-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Every KMD I sold for equipment has come back 3fold plus 😁
Every KMD I held is worth 50 cents on the dollar 😦

[15-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ye I got lucky enough to averaged down to that price otherwise waiting for 55 k sats to be touched again would take quite a while.

[15-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blubbi#0643
maybe its not that far away dude 😛

[15-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380
lol since we are at 18k sats zone its quite far away

[15-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Buddz1993#5380
with btc at 7k it would be nearly 4 $ per KMD if we were trading at 55k sats

[15-Oct-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`4 $ per KMD` is still undervaluing KMD in my biased opinion

[15-Oct-18 11:41 AM] blubbi#0643
retracement took quite a long time, since aug where in a good sideway consolidation

[15-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Buddz1993#5380
yes 4 $ its extremely undervalued I agree

[15-Oct-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still doesn't understand a world in which KMD is under $100_

[15-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Buddz1993#5380
fair price would be trading at eth levels.

[15-Oct-18 11:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will take $10 for the end of the year 😛

[15-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Buddz1993#5380
but thats just me wishful thinking

[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If KMD reaches $10 i will buy everyone ramen, maybe with actual meat in it

[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Buddz1993#5380
10$ would be more or less 800 % increase I can take that!

[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and a punching bag for computergenie

[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_stopped eating ramen when BTC hit $720, but OK_

[15-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Buddz1993#5380
make it happen!

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL, i will eat Ramen even if BTC is at 20k 😃

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
or 50k, cant get enough of that crap lol

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] blubbi#0643
not this year 😄

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and a punching bag for computergenie` No need for that, that's what @blackjok3r and @Hollowman9000 are here for :trollface:

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I would eat sushi which I hate if it makes btc back at 20 k 😃

[15-Oct-18 11:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[15-Oct-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$20k BTC is as insane as a 9 cent KMD

[15-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blubbi#0643
maybe 19Q3 again

[15-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Buddz1993#5380
9 cent KMD I would buy 1 million of them 😄

[15-Oct-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_would like to see BTC back under $5k_

[15-Oct-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_and everything unpegged from it_

[15-Oct-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007

🎅🏼 (4) 🎄 (4) treasure 

[15-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Buddz1993#5380
that would be the cherry on top.

[15-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Am I the only one that thinks 120 confs for KMD is feken stoopid?

[15-Oct-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i know it is about 2 hours. but, it provides security for your deposit and saves exchanges

[15-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For ZCl I can see, but this is KMD!

[15-Oct-18 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
extra security 😃

[15-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2x BTC time is more than sufficient

[15-Oct-18 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007
prevents from double spend attack (if any)

[15-Oct-18 11:50 AM] snowdamn#2414
how much do exchanges need to times the lag to be safe?
i was under the impression they only needed to match the lag

[15-Oct-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`prevents from double spend attack (if any)`
If we need 109 notary blocks to prevent ds, then there's a problem 😛

[15-Oct-18 11:51 AM] snowdamn#2414
wouldn't 2x the lag be enough?

[15-Oct-18 11:51 AM] snowdamn#2414
or even lag+1

[15-Oct-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn That's why after much talk, richie dropped the # on trex

[15-Oct-18 11:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
he dropped to 120?

[15-Oct-18 11:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[15-Oct-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to 20 or 30

[15-Oct-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I forget which

[15-Oct-18 11:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
oh ok, KMD die hard here, don't send my KMD to exchanges 🤓

[15-Oct-18 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`MinConfirmation    30`
👆🏼 trex

[15-Oct-18 11:53 AM] snowdamn#2414
sounds like 2x the lag, which is ok

[15-Oct-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
we are testing a version that will make it much much better
