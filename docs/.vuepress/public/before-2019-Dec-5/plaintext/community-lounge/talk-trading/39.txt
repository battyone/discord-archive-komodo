Maybe CG wants to point some of his new equipment to it :troll:

"Is anyone even mining it?"
Eventually, at least a few of us will be

[02-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Looking at the richlist

[02-Jul-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's on the list of assets in my Solo Asset Mining Stratum (SAMS)

[02-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No one dumped

[02-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Guess they figured what good is it?

[02-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Jazzy#0001
If all of them received it at no cost basis then you have to consider that

[02-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Jazzy#0001
I haven't seen an update to this figure, but a few months after they forked off something in the range of 75% of bcash UTXOs hadn't been moved since.

[02-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Jazzy#0001
A lot of people just don't care if there was no skin in the game to get started

[02-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Jazzy#0001
Oh cool I found an updated source for this https://forks.network/dashboard/db/index?orgId=1

[02-Jul-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
shexy, craptopia on has 20 confirms for WLC; deposit should be live in a month üòÉ

[02-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
On demand blocks right?

[02-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Keep some dust around to send 20 different times

[02-Jul-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at 10 sats, 30k is "dust" üòõ

[02-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fair enough

[02-Jul-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If only I could dump 20k KMD and only effect the price by 1 sat.....

_waits for some jackwagon to fork to KomodoLiteCashPlatinum_

[02-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump it into @jl777c on barterdex

[02-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doesn‚Äôt he still have 10btc left for KMD

[02-Jul-18 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
His was a one time need for revshares, I was meaning on a semi-regular basis

[02-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[02-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You operate as an SP?

[02-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie

[02-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is mining just an add on to another business you have

[02-Jul-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sp?

[02-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sole proprietorship

[02-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vs LLC/Corp

[02-Jul-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ahh, yes, an sp for now in the process of incorporating

[02-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why go Corp?

[02-Jul-18 03:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just curious

[02-Jul-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
taxes

[02-Jul-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as a sp, in the US, you're personally "on the hook" for taxes on every trade you make

[02-Jul-18 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd much rather loose the business if taxes get feked than loose my home

[02-Jul-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
IRS doesn't care about market liquidity being low when they want payments üò¶

[02-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Your hodling your mining rewards?

[02-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôd have to dump most at first

[02-Jul-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1-20% of mining eventually goes into cold storage, depending on the coin

[02-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mine, dump Zec, pay for shit/taxes

[02-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
what does transfer of assets from yourself to your Corp look like on paper

[02-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
<system> file bitcoin_revived.mov too big to download (1519200 > allowed size: 1000000)

[slack] <lumberscout> @lumberscout uploaded a file: https://komodo-platform.slack.com/files/U8H4F0XRD/FBHBC8FRA/bitcoin_revived.mov

[02-Jul-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is the Corp buying the mining equipment from you and making payments to you?

[02-Jul-18 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm keeping ~1/2 of the equip (mostly the GPU stuff) and the business will own the rest (servers, ASICs, etc)

[02-Jul-18 03:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Does the Corp just flash into existence already owning these assets?  Never dealt with any of it, why I got 20 questions

[02-Jul-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not "just flash into existence", I started doing PC repair and M$Ft partnership ~ 11 years ago

[02-Jul-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ComputerGenie has been registered with the state since 2007

[02-Jul-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I meant legally and tax purposes, you own all this stuff, does the Corp receive it as a donation, does it buy the equipment off you?

[02-Jul-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt know if corps start at zero

[02-Jul-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
legally, as a sp, both - pretty much a sp is just a way for you to breakdown personal income - you are the sp and the sp is you

[02-Jul-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as far as the inc, that's all up to the lawyer to sort out

[02-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gotcha

[02-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll just start as SP

[02-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
make sure I cash out rewards for taxes with a safe margin

[02-Jul-18 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Make a separate bank account for that

[02-Jul-18 03:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as an sp, you're personally responsible for **all** trades, not just cash out but CoinX/CoinY too

[02-Jul-18 03:57 PM] Jazzy#0001
That doesn't change if you register as a corp does it?

[02-Jul-18 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs not a problem

[02-Jul-18 03:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Trex sends that shit to the IRS anyway

[02-Jul-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No getting away from that

[02-Jul-18 03:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
I assume so as well

[02-Jul-18 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
In the US, you're not personally responsible for business taxes unless provable malfeasance

[02-Jul-18 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
generally speaking

[02-Jul-18 03:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
So the corp is just a shell incase taxes are so high you need to declare it bankrupt?

[02-Jul-18 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Government is guilty of malfeasance by fuckin wit mah chedda

[02-Jul-18 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, the corp is because 100 different reasons including negotiating elec pricing with local coop

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02-Jul-18 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as a sp/dba you'll likely have no leverage with any electric co

[02-Jul-18 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_uses more electric than everyone else in 1/2 mile combined and the electric coop is like "yeah, so?"_

[02-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôve never heard of anyone negotiating electric rates, ‚Äúda price is da price‚Äù

[02-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That and since this will be in my basement, I assume LE will be circling like buzzards waiting for me to bring trash bags full of marijuana out of the house

[02-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúWhat do you mean those aren‚Äôt grow lights eating all that power?‚Äù

[02-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúCripo-what? Mining z-cash?  Sounds illegal, we better arrest you just to be sure‚Äù

[02-Jul-18 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I was really shocked the 1st winter that we were mining that the doughnut eaters didn't crash down our doors

[02-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd give them a heads up

[02-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But there‚Äôs a tried and true saying

[02-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[02-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
good luck with it

[02-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably a dumb question but do you drive your miners with a UPS?  @ComputerGenie

[02-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Power spikes/sags an issue of they aren‚Äôt?

[02-Jul-18 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is too poor to afford a UPS for that much draw at 240v_

[02-Jul-18 06:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Hollowman9000 , you do know that there's a #talk-mining right?

I have a problem with authority

[02-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But you answered my question

[02-Jul-18 06:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe when I‚Äôm rich, but for now dirty power will suffice

[02-Jul-18 06:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
