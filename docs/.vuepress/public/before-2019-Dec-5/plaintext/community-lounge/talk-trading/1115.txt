@Caglio it's up to you, knees are useful for walking

[05-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Caglio#3337
@dukeleto only mobile wallets work for đe

>but I should give back 10000$
 If you need to give this money back to someone, I'd suggest you not use it with cryptocurrency at all.

[05-Sep-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
Agreed.

[05-Sep-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio buying $50 or $100 of Hush is probably reasonable, prices have never been better! This is not financial advice.

[05-Sep-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio if you need a mobile wallet, i think maybe one of the KMD mobile wallets supports us, like Chameleon? Otherwise, gotta wait a bit

[05-Sep-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
AtomicDEX support for HUSH is coming too

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
@dukeleto i have chameleon

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
ill buy some hush

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
50-100$ is fine

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] dan.#2473
each kmd is worth about 1500 satoshi at the moment per the BTC holdings.

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio we should be there, and i think atomicdex next release should have hush bugs fixed. They had our old chain info

[05-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
where can i get ir?

https://graviex.net/markets/hushbtc

[05-Sep-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
they do confs=5, it's the fastest exchange for Hush

[05-Sep-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
often deposit/withdraw is confirmed in ~10 mins

[05-Sep-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate is also on Graviex, convenient!

[05-Sep-19 02:06 PM] dan.#2473
using 20 percent of its innate actual physical value (the BTC)  to notarize with seems a bit odd, I dont have an alternative though

[05-Sep-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dan. KMD world believes BTC should be used and hodl'ed, i guess. Just hodl'ing is pretty boring

[05-Sep-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
putting data in OP_RETURN costs Bitcoin.

[05-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dan.#2473
thats fine i get it.

[05-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dan.#2473
if btc doubles and kmd halves again, it'll be 100 percent.

[05-Sep-19 02:08 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[05-Sep-19 02:16 PM] dan.#2473
crypto and dex aren't included in that, which should boost it a decent amount

[05-Sep-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@dan. i think your calculation is pretty close

[05-Sep-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
1800 BTC for 115 million KMD, so that is indeed around 1500 sats

[05-Sep-19 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
so that alone, indeed, is something to consider, when looking at kmd current satoshi prices

[05-Sep-19 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
when they are this low

[05-Sep-19 02:19 PM] dan.#2473
@jl777c have you considered doing CRYPTO payouts when x amount of crypto is achieved rather than in USD. for more consistent payouts

[05-Sep-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem that 1500 sats could be some sort of fundamental book value

[05-Sep-19 02:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
and then all was good in the world

[05-Sep-19 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Caglio i think their latest release has a bug where they use old-style Hush addresses, and it's fixed and waiting on a new release. Does it show `t1` address for Hush? It should be `R...`

[05-Sep-19 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
they supported our old Hush chain and just updated stuff

[05-Sep-19 03:38 PM] Caglio#3337

Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array. 2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
Genesis 9:12-16

    12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: 13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. 16 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”
