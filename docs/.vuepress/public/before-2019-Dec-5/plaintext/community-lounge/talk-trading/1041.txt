12 million

[07-Aug-19 05:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Funds were returned to users

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
of all the people who had agama wallets, some died, some lost private keys...

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
those peoples funds were collected too but obviously not returned

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
the attrition rate on coins in general is high

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
James forked out 1 million of his own

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
so it was said

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] Daiyox#2701
That wallet bug , I thought it was awesome in how the Blockchain side of the house, the KMD side jumped into action and just destroyed the hackers plans...But I'm entertained in funny ways, it's early crypto, stuff like that for now is history in the making lol

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am asking how much got netted that were not returned

[07-Aug-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
and like i said, i am not convinced that there was a hack

[07-Aug-19 05:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
i saw no one bitching about getting hacked in discord

[07-Aug-19 05:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
my coins were not taken

[07-Aug-19 05:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
a cynical person might say that it was a PR stunt

[07-Aug-19 05:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That makes sense ... not

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
and a profitable one at that... because like i said, they surely netted a lot of KMD from derelict wallets

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
i left coins in my compromised agama wallet for weeeeeeks

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
why were they not taken?

[07-Aug-19 05:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The exploit was only around for a month and required you entering your key during that timeframe with a specific wallet version

Exactly, you likely where never exposed @meatspoon

[07-Aug-19 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
i will ask again, how many coins were netted and not returned?  because the wallet owner did not make contact?

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] infotech-al#5583
If just talking trading please google TA vs FA - you will have your answer.

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] c2k#4915
fair question...why not post in #ask-jl777

[07-Aug-19 05:43 PM] phideas#8309
guys, no need to atack each other, pls. 
be nice, discuss without name calling.
we can blame bear market for this negative emotions.
truth is it's not gonna help, time will cure all wounds.

[07-Aug-19 05:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
i would not be surprised if 20% of swept coins never made it back to the "owners" for a variety of reasons

[07-Aug-19 05:45 PM] SHossain#0007
well, you are wrong. almost 98% of the funds been returned

[07-Aug-19 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
so you read my question 3 times and just now decided to answer with 98%?

[07-Aug-19 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
kinda reminds me of "98% of all quoted statistics are made up on the spot"  heh

[07-Aug-19 05:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Take a look at the sweep address

[07-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Oszy#5734
Dont, now hes gonna say they sent a lot to themselves lol

[07-Aug-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@meatspoon history says you will believe what you want to believe

[07-Aug-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
we even refunded about 732k KMD stolen by the hacker/thief which James put from his own pocket

[07-Aug-19 05:49 PM] SHossain#0007
the biggest one was DP with over 400k KMD

[07-Aug-19 05:49 PM] SHossain#0007
everyone that came forward with a valid claim were refunded

[07-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Going too far I think

[07-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Now we are having doubts of the team ?

[07-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Geez it goes a long way from roasting the price to roasting the team

[07-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Calm yourselves

[07-Aug-19 06:02 PM] phideas#8309
@SHossain can you track down the stolen funds? any info if they were dumped already?

[07-Aug-19 06:04 PM] SHossain#0007
they were tracked initially. but, James reimbursed all from his personal funds.

[07-Aug-19 06:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
So to be clear, you are saying with certainty that between 97% and 98% of the swept funds were returned?

[07-Aug-19 06:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
KMD owners must be remarkably healthy and adept at storing their private keys.

[07-Aug-19 06:12 PM] phideas#8309
I know, just curious if funds still in possession of the hacker

This story have a finish when a big guy finally got this smaller guy

[07-Aug-19 06:16 PM] Caglio#3337
But you have to search on a liveleak üòÑ

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
@SHossain just want to reference my clarification above if you didn‚Äôt see it. Looking for confirmation on the 98% figure. And is that 98% of KMD swept was returned or 98% of KMD reclaim forms were processed?  Big difference between the two.

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] SHossain#0007
you can ask in #ask-jl777 channel and James himself can answer you

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] SHossain#0007
that will be the most accurate answer

[07-Aug-19 06:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
You claimed 98% as if you know for sure. Just asking you to clarify and stand behind your comment.

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
I don‚Äôt care if you are off by a percent or two

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
`almost 98% of the funds been returned`
that's what i said

[07-Aug-19 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
you can check the post where i posted

[07-Aug-19 06:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ok. 98% of swept funds or 98% of claim forms processed?

You went from telling me how it was‚Äîsetting me straight‚Äîto this.

[07-Aug-19 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
about 98% of the swept funds were returned

[07-Aug-19 06:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You don‚Äôt want to look at the evidence

[07-Aug-19 06:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not our problem

meatspoon why not post your question into #ask-jl777 as suggested? you'll get the most reliable answer

[07-Aug-19 06:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
I want to know Hossain‚Äôs claim and understand it.

about 98% of the swept funds were returned

[07-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Bitboy#7242
question has been deployed in #ask-jl777

[07-Aug-19 06:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
I will look into it. 98% is highly unlikely given mortality rates of humans and seed keys

[07-Aug-19 06:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol 2% of users died in a month

[07-Aug-19 06:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Unlikely

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Daiyox#2701
Look into it, if 97.8% it's .2% more drama power bonus for ya

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] allbits#5898
Mortality rate in a two month period is how much exactly? What an idiot!

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
How many people put KMD in a wallet and left it for a long time?  They didn‚Äôt have to die in that month

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
How many people lost their seed keys?

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
This shit happens all the time in crypto

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If they didn‚Äôt enter their seed in that period then it was t compromised

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] allbits#5898
Yes they did. You don't even know the hack worked

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] hastrup#8742
@polycryptoblog thank you!

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Alexfrog#1338
meatspoon, only people who had accessed the newer version of the wallet were effected

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] SHossain#0007
if people left their funds in Agama for a very long time, most likely it wasn't even swept

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`98% is highly unlikely given mortality rates of humans and seed keys` lol are you serious with this argument ...

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
98% people != 98% funds

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Alexfrog#1338
meatspoon you really need to go read about what the exploit was, then it will make more sense

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
Man, really irritated the KMD clergy with this
