`so no progress has been made
you need to learn about markets kid`
Yes, what a silly fool I am for being up 200%, cashing out my full initial investment, and *not* seeing 15% gains per month as a push
dafuq was I thinking? everybody knows that profits don't mean gains...

[14-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Likewise#6767
yeah yeah sure kid

[14-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Likewise#6767
funny seems you all are set for life yet spend your days on here lol

[14-Feb-19 11:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you've traded through the last 60 days and *not* hit *at least* 2x, then you *have not* traded through the last 60 days
because, math

[14-Feb-19 11:14 PM] Likewise#6767
not saying that I didnt, just saying that bul lrun wise we are not making any progress at all

[14-Feb-19 11:15 PM] Likewise#6767
we needed to break that 31 dec high if not it wasnt more then another oridinary pump. not something that instill confidence in higher end investors

[14-Feb-19 11:16 PM] Likewise#6767
trading wise this stuff is a childs game I was jus thinking htat u tech guys wold like to see a sustained run on your pet proejcts? Guess I must be mistaken, hence why real money still stays on the sidelines

[14-Feb-19 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, because the ultimate goal of any currency is speculators and not utility

`tech guys cannot trade`
I seem to do fine with making 230% in 60 days during a bear market
care to sell me some secrets on how to better my position (since I'm so clueless)?

[14-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Likewise#6767
good to make some money on but not good to pull in new money

good mroning and off to the beach here.

[14-Feb-19 11:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, that's all wrong; you're supposed to teach us since we can't read a chart and we don't see upward slopes as null

[14-Feb-19 11:25 PM] NNoperator#3835

I switched when we left slack.  And used this name to make fun of the folks over on unSAFE discord

[14-Feb-19 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Likewise so, when are you going to hold this class on how to read upward slopes as null movement?
I really need to learn this stuff, I want to buy a 🏎 and some 👯 with my $6

[15-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Likewise#6767
so according to you when an asset goes from price A to B then back to price A high without breaking that price. Is that a bull run for ya? U need to read up on trading.

[15-Feb-19 03:04 AM] rob#8269

oki lets put it thsi way, according to you we have now started a sustained bull run right? not talking accumulatiuon but bnul lrun??

[15-Feb-19 03:31 AM] Likewise#6767

[15-Feb-19 03:31 AM] Likewise#6767

[15-Feb-19 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`according to you we have now started a sustained bull run right`
no, that's not wtf I said, not even close
not once did I say "bull"; I said **progress**
not all progress = bull
not all regress = bear
I do like that you finally realized you're wrong and start to throw up some false dichotomy that I never said though, that's a cute tactic to attempt to soothe your own ego

@NNoperator hi Tks for the link but as mentioned, any “biz plan “ and rd map tht isrelated to biz and use of the coin instead of technical only like wallet, how Gd your blockchain tech?

no bad dreams I hope

[15-Feb-19 05:11 AM] Likewise#6767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ok, so tell me about that progress, price wise, not the project itself. 31 dec we made a high at 0.0002509 today we are at 0.00021.... we haven't broken that high. Where is the progress? Not asking about trading. pumps/dumps are not progress. A steady uptrend would be progress.

[15-Feb-19 05:13 AM] Likewise#6767
we could be starting a steady uptrend but I very much doubt that.

[15-Feb-19 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK
1) I like how you say I can't use a wick, but you're delusionally stuck on one
2) comparing day x "high" to day y low? feken really?
3) if you can't see the progress from 13.2 to 21, then you're beyond being able to comprehend grade 3 math and I am not properly certified in special ed counseling

[15-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Likewise#6767
ok u still have many hours of charting to do before u'll get it. goodluck son

[15-Feb-19 05:15 AM] actionslacks#4072

By @Likewise "logic", I hereby randomly pick 5-21-2018 out of my ass and claim that there is no progress until we peak higher than 41k sats

[15-Feb-19 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'13.2k to 40k isn't progress because it doesn't break 5-21-2018'
