low liquidity, bots having control

[20-Jul-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
dont need to say more

[20-Jul-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`low liquidity`
add some

[20-Jul-19 12:09 PM] Markus#5464
im not a bank

[20-Jul-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one needs to be a bank in order to purchase KMD? 🤔

[20-Jul-19 12:09 PM] Markus#5464
to move price yes

[20-Jul-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
be a buyer and not a dumper

[20-Jul-19 12:10 PM] Tek#5253
Well well

[20-Jul-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
i dont dump

[20-Jul-19 12:10 PM] Tek#5253
If it isn't computergenelet

[20-Jul-19 12:11 PM] Markus#5464
i wonder how many of those 64 notary nodes sell their kmd to cover costs

[20-Jul-19 12:11 PM] richardt#2807
Too many weak hands

[20-Jul-19 12:12 PM] Markus#5464
Im not sure rebrand did spread the word at all more then having a dex honestly

[20-Jul-19 12:12 PM] Markus#5464
when coinex listed kmd they stated kmd being a privacy coin....even after rebrand

[20-Jul-19 12:12 PM] richardt#2807
Also too many people wondering why hold KMD and what is its use case.  Same people who buy other shitcoins... go figure

[20-Jul-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why hold BTC and what is its use case....

[20-Jul-19 12:13 PM] richardt#2807
For some reason, KMD is held at a much higher standard than other coins

[20-Jul-19 12:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think the use case of KMD is being able to bitch about 1/tech in this discord channel.  Seems to be primary use case.

[20-Jul-19 12:13 PM] Markus#5464
enough that its the coin with most liquidity and price moves constantly

[20-Jul-19 12:14 PM] Markus#5464
gains/losses non stop

[20-Jul-19 12:14 PM] Markus#5464
kmd last weeks is like a stable coin

[20-Jul-19 12:14 PM] Markus#5464
11-12k

[20-Jul-19 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yet you hang around, anyway, meatspin 🤷🏽

[20-Jul-19 12:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yup. Like a stubborn dingle berry

[20-Jul-19 12:15 PM] Tek#5253
Selling kmd after the hack was the best decision of my life ( not really but still good)

[20-Jul-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```kmd last weeks is like a stable coin
11-12k```
tbh, that is the exact real problem
"stable" value compared to BTC in terms of BTC
you cannot have the mentality of BTC being the base comparison and attempting to break away from BTC

[20-Jul-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
even if u compare against usd then its still down

[20-Jul-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
alot

[20-Jul-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
from 1.7 to 1.2

[20-Jul-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
in no time

[20-Jul-19 12:18 PM] richardt#2807
people selling the news

[20-Jul-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`even if u compare against usd then its still down`
KMD was 81 cents on Jan 1, so $1.20 is up not down

[20-Jul-19 12:19 PM] Markus#5464
so thats 50% gain, and btc?

[20-Jul-19 12:20 PM] Markus#5464
either way suffering will keep going from what i can see

btc dominance found support around 67.5%

[20-Jul-19 12:20 PM] Markus#5464
70% inc

[20-Jul-19 12:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
Genie is gonna say something super profound here. I can feel it.

[20-Jul-19 12:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
It’s like just before a nearby lightning strike. And the hair on the back of your neck stands up...

[20-Jul-19 12:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
And your scrotum contracts a little

[20-Jul-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and btc?`
fek btc, you can't expect to explain stand-alone utility and stability and depend on comparison of cross-over value while ignoring buying power

[20-Jul-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>this apple is better than that orange because grapes aren't bananas

[20-Jul-19 12:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
And there it is. The lightning bolt of brilliance. Grapes aren’t bananas.

[20-Jul-19 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you want your currency of interest to stand alone (be it KMD or anything else), you have to change your mindset to one of it standing alone and not one of BTC being "king"
>this apple is better than that orange because oranges have pith

[20-Jul-19 12:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think we are stuck with the current king for a while.

[20-Jul-19 12:26 PM] designer#4893
In order to understand Bitcoin, non-technical competence in humanities, religious studies and sociology is essential.

[20-Jul-19 12:27 PM] designer#4893
Don't be childish, Bitcoin is a serious phenomenon.

[20-Jul-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
i remember someone saying a couple of months ago that shitcoins will need to die before a real bullrun will begin.....i feel this person was sort of right

[20-Jul-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
thats literally whats happening now

[20-Jul-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Don't be childish, Bitcoin is a serious phenomenon.`
@designer You truly surprised me this week, not shilling Bitcoin (which, by the way BTC isn't) until today 😣

[20-Jul-19 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that shitcoins will need to die before a real bullrun will begin`
yes, once BTC dies, the real fun will begin

[20-Jul-19 12:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
Don’t hold your breath

[20-Jul-19 12:29 PM] richardt#2807
... Once KMD no longer needs to notarize to BTC

[20-Jul-19 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`... Once KMD no longer needs to notarize to BTC`
that already happened when notarizations started

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD never **needed** to notarize to BTC

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a __choice__ due to hashrate

[20-Jul-19 12:30 PM] richardt#2807
doesn't seem like much of a choice

[20-Jul-19 12:31 PM] richardt#2807
for as long as BTC still has highest hashrate

[20-Jul-19 12:31 PM] designer#4893
please don't talk nonsense and prove it. 
when are you gonna prove it?@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[20-Jul-19 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`for as long as BTC still has highest hashrate`
♻ and round the carousel we go

[20-Jul-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when are you gonna prove it?`
in 2009 when the Bitcoin whitepaper was written

[20-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
Dont see any other coin ever exceeding bitcoins hashrate

[20-Jul-19 12:32 PM] richardt#2807
lol... isn't that how all conversations you're involved in goes?

[20-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
by then PoW wont be a thing anymore

[20-Jul-19 12:32 PM] richardt#2807
It's fun

[20-Jul-19 12:33 PM] designer#4893
there is never coin to beat Bitcoin's neutrality.

[20-Jul-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC holds the hash because folks hold the mentality that it's "king"
if you can't even shake fanboys in a specific non-BTC discord of that mentality, how do you expect that "normal" folks are going to shake it?

[20-Jul-19 12:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Bitcoin's neutrality`
@designer dafuq are you on about?

[20-Jul-19 12:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
When that awful Agama wallet vulnerability was discovered I moved my KMD to a CEX since a CEX was safer than the recommended wallet for the highest tech project in existence (breath in the irony). When I moved my KMD back to a clean versus wallet, I sent 20 KMD at first just to test. For shits and giggles I checked my position on the rich list with 20 KMD and saw that there are less than 20,000 people who own KMD. KMD is a tiny, tiny creature next to BTC.

[20-Jul-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`KMD is a tiny, tiny creature...`
and the rest of that sentence is moot

[20-Jul-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only a tiny portion of the population are involved in crypto
only a tiny portion of that population are involved in any specific crypto

[20-Jul-19 12:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
Not really. KMD is like a happy chihuahua all loud and cocky next to a T-Rex.

[20-Jul-19 12:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
How many people own btc?

[20-Jul-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
usefully? not as many as you'd think

[20-Jul-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
holding $100 with at $10k isn't useful when tx fees are $20

keep your opinions about BTC to yourselves! Jesus Christ

[20-Jul-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or at least base them in reality 😛

[20-Jul-19 12:41 PM] designer#4893
bitcoin imperialism began. we have to admit it now.
It entered a new order after World War II. because of Bitcoin.

[20-Jul-19 12:41 PM] richardt#2807
It's funny you say that.  I don't think you're quite living in the same reality as most people

[20-Jul-19 12:41 PM] richardt#2807
haa

[20-Jul-19 12:41 PM] Markus#5464
btc will always be king doesnt rly matter what ppl think or do about it....like it or not doesnt change much

[20-Jul-19 12:41 PM] richardt#2807

`I don't think you're quite living in the same reality as most people`
true, I don't believe that 🦄s shit 🌈s

[20-Jul-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seriously, other than something that would give Ponzi a wet dream, explain the in-reality notion of BTC ever hitting $20k absent the financial collapse of the USD....

[20-Jul-19 12:44 PM] designer#4893
please i don't want the Komodo platform to become a playground for immature anarchist.

[20-Jul-19 12:44 PM] richardt#2807
I wish I lived in your reality where KMD has a higher market cap than BTC.... man I would love that reality

[20-Jul-19 12:44 PM] designer#4893
Decentralization is never possible.

🤔 

[20-Jul-19 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a playground for immature anarchist`
decentralization is the bedrock of Bitcoin (yet another reason why BTC isn't Bitcoin)

[20-Jul-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I wish I lived in your reality where KMD has a higher market cap than BTC....`
Market cap is a silly metric

[20-Jul-19 12:46 PM] Markus#5464
im not sure ppl rly give a shit about decentralization

[20-Jul-19 12:46 PM] Markus#5464
i think majority of ppl dont

[20-Jul-19 12:47 PM] p.#1126
lol the delusional pleb nerd is at it again

[20-Jul-19 12:47 PM] p.#1126
dont bother

[20-Jul-19 12:48 PM] richardt#2807
Market cap, hashrate, number of users, etc... whatever it is that you'd like to measure

[20-Jul-19 12:48 PM] richardt#2807
whatever that reality is... send me there!

[20-Jul-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`im not sure ppl rly give a shit about decentralization ...i think majority of ppl dont`
That people welcome institutions utilizing BTC and building layer3 apps to do the exact same as those institutions already do with fiat would suggest that you're right

[20-Jul-19 12:49 PM] designer#4893
while you're mired in a decentralized ideology, In order not to miss this opportunity, which has been around 20 years since the Internet revolution, global companies are secretly preparing for war.

[20-Jul-19 12:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
Has Genie ever convinced anyone?... like, ever?  He is kinda like a wild-eyed bearded dude wearing a billboard, ringing a hand bell, proselytizing about KMD’s superiority. I wanna give him some quarters for a cup of coffee.
