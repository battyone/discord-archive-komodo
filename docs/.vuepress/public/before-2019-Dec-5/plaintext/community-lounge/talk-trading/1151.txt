Strange things happening.  Upbit  delist  Dash , Pivx  and others, but leaves Zcoin (XZC) , DigitalNote (XDN) ?

[21-Sep-19 01:08 PM] sœÜldat#8733
maybe they paid to stay on the list for a while üôÇ

The self-proclaimed privacy  Verge (XVG)  is still out there, too. :abusedsmily:

It's obvious they will ban privacy coins

of course they will, I am a little surprised at the worldwide capitulation though. I guess the entire planet has no right to privacy any longer.

If we don't have the right, let's take the left.

[21-Sep-19 02:06 PM] Markus#5464
privacy coins on a exchange with KYC means nothing they know who u are anyway

[21-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Markus#5464
so in my eyes privacy coins are not very useful as long as u only can trade them on a centralized exchange with KYC now with the new FAFT rule

[21-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Markus#5464
not very private

[21-Sep-19 02:10 PM] Markus#5464
when MM2 allow privacy swaps then its a whole different story

It's no secret that #Ethereum $ETH has been on the rise, and SanBase/SanGraphs reveal that this past week has been no fluke. ETH gas used has reached an all-time high, and we saw a rapid growth of ETH % total supply in whales' bags, among other indicators! https://t.co/u0t...

Can some one in the complete layman terms explain pls , npsv and private swaps

[21-Sep-19 09:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why is it unique to kmd

[21-Sep-19 10:11 PM] Priva99#5191
nSPV Fast simple payment verification

[21-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Priva99#5191
Builds on SPV, which allowed u to not have to download a full node, but instead all block headers

[21-Sep-19 10:15 PM] Priva99#5191
nSPV, reduces that amount and makes it less you have to download, and that results in it being a lot faster ....

[21-Sep-19 10:16 PM] Priva99#5191
JL777 did this, that's why it is unique to KMD

[21-Sep-19 10:16 PM] Priva99#5191
Private Swaps, I don't know

[21-Sep-19 10:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
And nSPV does not utilize javascript to perform operations so it also vastly more secure than anything currently used in mobile crypto applications.

[21-Sep-19 11:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thank you very much for this

[22-Sep-19 01:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
it uses notarizations which is why it is unique to kmd

[22-Sep-19 02:00 AM] yorklab#7270
@mrtzmp3 Someone may correct me, but I do believe that private swaps is a trade between just you and me. The bid and ask is not broadcasted to the world, only you and I can see it. This way you don't need someone to escrow the trade for you.

[22-Sep-19 04:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@mrtzmp3  regnar posted a good explanation for private swaps in #ask-jl777 .  How that benefits kmd is through Dex usage ( which generates fees which is used to purchase kmd )

Quantum supremacy may have been achieved. Google‚Äôs quantum computing project claims they've gotten a quantum computer to perform a task no classical computer could reasonably hope to complete.

Looks like the worst kept secret in quantum technology has finally leaked into the mainstream press ahead of publication. While this is a milestone, it is *very* far from being a quantum computer that can compute anything useful. https://t.co/TB9idrIyI4

@allbits , so dilithium signatures  make komodo quantum resistant already, wow, another amazing achievement for jl777, this Google announcement will present a great marketing opportunity ...

[22-Sep-19 12:21 PM] Markus#5464
kmd never took such advantages of marketing cause they "dont want to create hype"

[22-Sep-19 12:23 PM] Markus#5464
i have tried to hold myself from being negative for very long time even tho price plummeted hardcore but seeing the team refuse to try to take any action to make the situation any better is pretty disappointing

[22-Sep-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you imagine could have made much difference during BTC dominance going to 70%?

[22-Sep-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
a tweet storm?

[22-Sep-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
spending large sums on paid placements, that seems to be what people consider "marketing"

[22-Sep-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and short of spending large sums on paid placements, there isnt any controllable way to get massive coverage

[22-Sep-19 12:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
How about a website that explains how the tech would be used in an actual real life scenario instead of a buzzword salad?

[22-Sep-19 12:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
This criticism isn‚Äôt specific to Komodo... many projects can benefit from it.

[22-Sep-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810

People in here bitch about the world not recognizing KMD‚Äôs potential, but it‚Äôs no surprise when the website is a generic pile of buzzwords without any simple example of what can be done with the technology.

[22-Sep-19 12:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
People come in here and ask for a layman‚Äôs explanation of KMD or certain aspects of it and they get a bunch of technical mambo-Jambo slung at them.

[22-Sep-19 12:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
People‚Äôs first thought after reading the main page needs to be, ‚ÄúI get it!‚Äù  Their second thought needs to be, ‚ÄúI totally get how my business can benefit from using this.‚Äù

[22-Sep-19 12:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
There needs to be a handful of simple examples of how KMD can add value or lower costs. An example for shipping/logistics, a banking/finance example, a retail example, etc.

[22-Sep-19 12:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
Not trying to bust balls, but it‚Äôs amazing that this hasn‚Äôt been done. It‚Äôs amazing that Ideas by Nature couldn‚Äôt figure this out.

KMD do not seem to have any intention to get listed on exchanges, after discussion in #komodo-team its like u assume that listing have to cost "3-5 btc", it does not have to be that way if u manage to create partnerships and relations with the exchanges, they might even later on be interested in integrating atomic dex API as an alternative way of trading on their CEX.

[22-Sep-19 12:44 PM] Markus#5464
the more exchanges kmd get listed on the larger the market becomes and the larger the volume overall gets
