thats what i have noticed

[18-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
low liquidity, big bank = u control price cause nobody will fight u

[18-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
same when price went down from 28k, there was small orders pushing it step by step

[18-Jul-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
nobody fought back

[18-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
i wouldnt be surprised if it was whalebro doing this on purpose to accumulate more kmd after realising that after he pump price everyone just dumps into it

[18-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
if there actually was follow up we would be way higher

imo for being in a altcoin bearmarket (alt/btc) i think KMD is really standing strong. Many altcoins keep gowing lower while kmd stays around at 12k support.

[18-Jul-19 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@DugiOtok when alts peaked in 2018, there were many many alts above us. Most are no where now.

[18-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
Komodo is Zcash fork, focusing on privacy

[18-Jul-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
i quess ppl still dont get it

[18-Jul-19 12:33 PM] Neko#5830
its odd

[18-Jul-19 12:33 PM] Neko#5830
a simple visit to the website would prove komodo is much more

[18-Jul-19 12:47 PM] yorklab#7270
Is it a coincidence that right after those sellers dumped their KMD that Bitcoin went down $300? Anyway looks like the buyers absorbed those KMD pretty well.

[18-Jul-19 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Is coinex a good exchange?

@yorklab the 50k seller dump?

[18-Jul-19 12:50 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes and there were a couple of 20,000 that are gone now also.

[18-Jul-19 12:51 PM] yorklab#7270
But don't know if those other two sold or took it off.

The more I look at KMD, I just can't stop buying this at current levels. Both charts KMDUSD & KMDBTC looking primed to go on a good run very soon. Read up on some FA on it as well, everything looks good.
