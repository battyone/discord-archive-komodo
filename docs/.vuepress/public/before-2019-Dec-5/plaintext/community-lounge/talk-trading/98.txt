Are these types ever gonna smarten up? Or you reckon theyll end up panic selling and leaving the crypto space for good LOL

For every 1 decent post I see where someones actually done even the slightest research, theres probably 30 shitposts before it who have no idea wtf theyre doing

[14-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

They‚Äôll either leave

[14-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or wander the wasteland until they find something worth believing in

Feels like 2015 all over again.  On altworld, you‚Äôll either exit entirely, or wander the wasteland until you find something worth believing in.  

Come join the revolution like I did so long ago (in cryptoyears)

[14-Aug-18 02:02 PM] harry.staal#3321
99,9% of all alts will die soon

[14-Aug-18 02:02 PM] harry.staal#3321
don't hope komodo is one of them

[14-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CHMEX for example, the price it shows for kmd now is 0,8795 EUR

[14-Aug-18 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But when you want to buy

[14-Aug-18 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it now gives me a price of 1KMD = 0,9060

[14-Aug-18 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
EUR

[14-Aug-18 02:04 PM] harry.staal#3321
Komodo will fall below $0.50

[14-Aug-18 02:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
strange looks ok for me:
Buy 1 KMD ‚âà 1.0208 CHF   Sell 1 KMD ‚âà 0.9739 CHF

[14-Aug-18 02:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
5% margin

[14-Aug-18 02:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
ah you went the other pair you get 0.8795 for one KMD you buy one KMD for 0.9060

[14-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Unless you‚Äôre OG ICO crew or miner/notary, you‚Äôre dumping at a loss

Harry, if you truly believe this, then you obviously don‚Äôt have a clue about kmd‚Äôs tech. In the end, the best tech rises to the top

[14-Aug-18 02:54 PM] harry.staal#3321
you need to make money with out an revenue model your best tech is worthless

[14-Aug-18 02:54 PM] harry.staal#3321
open source will not be used

[14-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-Aug-18 02:54 PM] harry.staal#3321
in the end

[14-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC seems to be used somewhat

[14-Aug-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
you lose all credibility when taking the position crypto must become corporate

ETH seems to be open source

[14-Aug-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
