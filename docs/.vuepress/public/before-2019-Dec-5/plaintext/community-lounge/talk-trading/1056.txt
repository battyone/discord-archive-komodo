i liked season 1 too

[09-Aug-19 07:39 PM] richardt#2807
Any real, working project building on Antara yet as far as anyone knows?

[09-Aug-19 07:39 PM] crumb#2550
season 2 actually had also its highlights. for example the money burning scene with Phil Collins song "Take me home" as background. epic, just epic

[09-Aug-19 07:41 PM] crumb#2550
or season 2 finale

"Tokens we are examining to ensure they meet our listing criteria for Binance US:" doesn't look like anything is set for sure yet.

[09-Aug-19 09:13 PM] JimD#9272
KMD should make it on there

[09-Aug-19 09:13 PM] JimD#9272
I have the faith

[09-Aug-19 09:17 PM] Lanii#8302
Not even bouncing off long term support

[09-Aug-19 09:17 PM] Lanii#8302
Looking good :troll_lol:

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] bit_chipper#6010
every alt is near all time llows, btc maximalist win, only one chain for the universe, all ideas and dreams crushed

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] Lanii#8302
thats incorrect

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] bit_chipper#6010
god forbid there EVER be an alternative

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] bit_chipper#6010
sarcasm dude

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] bit_chipper#6010
but that is the sentiment out there

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] Lanii#8302
Yeh I got that

[09-Aug-19 09:21 PM] Lanii#8302
but you said every alt is at atl

[09-Aug-19 09:24 PM] bit_chipper#6010
i am hoping this is just 2015 all over again, but idk

[09-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Lanii#8302
You were around in 2015?

[09-Aug-19 09:24 PM] bit_chipper#6010
yes

[09-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Lanii#8302
Nice

[09-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Lanii#8302
Were there many shitcoins at that time?

[09-Aug-19 09:25 PM] bit_chipper#6010
back then kmd was btcd/supernet i guess,  there were shitcoins and then legit alt projects

[09-Aug-19 09:25 PM] bit_chipper#6010
alot have been overshadowed by all the shit that came with ICO boom in 2017

[09-Aug-19 09:26 PM] bit_chipper#6010
i am just hoping that in time ppl will realize not all altcoins are not "shitcoins" and some actually do pose a better alternative to btc

[09-Aug-19 09:26 PM] bit_chipper#6010
sentiment now  is just that anything other than btc is worthless

[09-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Lanii#8302
mh

[09-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Lanii#8302
No doubt there will be another time when plebs start hating on btc cuz muh alts doing 10x

[09-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Lanii#8302
Important to remember to take profit however ^^

[09-Aug-19 09:28 PM] Lanii#8302
Thats hoping for another crazy alt season however atm Im struggling to understand how any of these projects are making a profit

[09-Aug-19 09:29 PM] Lanii#8302
/ where any revenue is coming from

[09-Aug-19 10:09 PM] p.#1126

[09-Aug-19 10:17 PM] Lanii#8302
Just provided liquidity for some people to keep unloading

[09-Aug-19 11:02 PM] p.#1126
Alts are rekt

[09-Aug-19 11:02 PM] p.#1126
Maybe another project by 777

[09-Aug-19 11:03 PM] p.#1126
Fk it unleash 5 more

[09-Aug-19 11:03 PM] p.#1126
Then disappear

[09-Aug-19 11:03 PM] p.#1126
Lets develop 19 coins in 3 years

[09-Aug-19 11:03 PM] p.#1126
Seems realllllllll

[09-Aug-19 11:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Obviously he hasnâ€™t disappeared and obviously development is being done .   Any other baseless FUD?

[09-Aug-19 11:05 PM] Neko#5830
nxt basically forced him to do over

[09-Aug-19 11:15 PM] Lanii#8302
@p. yeh, lets not bash JL777, dude keeps printing code

[09-Aug-19 11:23 PM] Neko#5830
I do however, lament the fate of boolberry

[09-Aug-19 11:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Boolberry wasnâ€™t jlâ€™s project however itâ€™s always sad to see a coin bow out

[09-Aug-19 11:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Fibre as well

[09-Aug-19 11:27 PM] Neko#5830
rip fibre as well was a good coin

[09-Aug-19 11:30 PM] richardt#2807
Seems like alot of projects that have been associated with KMD/SuperNET has failed or is failing.  Pretty discouraging

[09-Aug-19 11:31 PM] richardt#2807
But still the best tech though

[09-Aug-19 11:32 PM] Neko#5830
SuperNET has failed and is dead

[09-Aug-19 11:32 PM] Neko#5830
KMD is another story

[09-Aug-19 11:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Supernet still lives

[09-Aug-19 11:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not how it was originally planned but the tech and ethos behind it . Also the asset

[09-Aug-19 11:34 PM] richardt#2807
Maybe AtomicDEX and/or Antara may finally turn things around, but only time will tell

[09-Aug-19 11:34 PM] bishop#9773
Yeah, basically just treat it as a fund, a very illiquid fund

[09-Aug-19 11:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
May have more liquidity here with the new Dex soon enough

[09-Aug-19 11:36 PM] richardt#2807
Hopefully that will make up for all the past failures

[09-Aug-19 11:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What other projects have paid out over a million ?

[09-Aug-19 11:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Of fees collected not just airdropping some shitcoin or through mining/network rewards

[09-Aug-19 11:44 PM] richardt#2807
Yes, that is a positive.  But unfortunately, the one-time payout and 5% rewards have not offset the decrease in asset/coin value for SN and KMD, respectively

[09-Aug-19 11:44 PM] richardt#2807
It's all good, at least we're still in the top 100 ðŸ˜„

[09-Aug-19 11:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think the kmd project has stayed true to the founding principles of supernet. supernet still has value as an asset and you could still buy it if anyone was selling.

[09-Aug-19 11:52 PM] richardt#2807
that's definitely something everyone could agree with

[09-Aug-19 11:53 PM] richardt#2807
the hard part seems to be finally getting a project that really succeeds using KMD tech

[10-Aug-19 12:00 AM] Lumbi#8378
How many ERC20 'failures'... and yet ETH is well above one dolla. Network effect is real.

[10-Aug-19 12:02 AM] Lumbi#8378
a lot of coal around kmd, don't mean there won't be diamonds ðŸ’ 

[10-Aug-19 12:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
the crypto space is an unprecedented environment in which to launch any venture. competing with other crypto's is one thing but competing with banking cartels and their beholden govt's is something else entirely. Just being an investor feels dangerous these days.

[10-Aug-19 12:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
I used to kid about there being feds around but now it seems to be a foregone conclusion

[10-Aug-19 12:39 AM] Lumbi#8378
@actionslacks indeed a new frontier where some huckstas prefer selling shovelz. â›°

[10-Aug-19 12:46 AM] yorklab#7270
@richardt I think RFOX has a chance to succeed. Also, Utrum (OOT) is about to launch their long awaited web portal and could make some noise as well.

[10-Aug-19 12:55 AM] Lumbi#8378
not bullish on any of the upstarts except LUMBER... maybe LABS (or VRSC), would be nice to see some consolidation with team players

I hope they join with kmd to be kmds base information system

[10-Aug-19 01:58 AM] yorklab#7270
I think Utrum could surprise many.

[10-Aug-19 03:02 AM] tolken#2655
Iâ€™d be surprised, just not expecting much. No disrespect, I just donâ€™t know enough about it.
