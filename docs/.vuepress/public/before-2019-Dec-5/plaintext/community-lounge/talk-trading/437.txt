[24-Feb-19 12:54 AM] Sdunbar#5064
sound reasonable or am I getting hosed?

[24-Feb-19 12:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Im afraid my CC provider is gonna levy a fee as well haha

[24-Feb-19 12:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
it says thats a possibility on the coinbase website

[24-Feb-19 12:56 AM] meatspoon#7860
Sounds heavy to me. But I am in the US

[24-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Sdunbar#5064
it's close to 4% fee

[24-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i guess thats not too crazy

[24-Feb-19 12:57 AM] Sdunbar#5064
whats the network like now? will i have to spend a fortune to transfer this?

[24-Feb-19 01:00 AM] Sdunbar#5064
looks ass cheap from what i can tell

[24-Feb-19 01:00 AM] Sdunbar#5064
0.3 USD

[24-Feb-19 01:07 AM] tolken#2655
3.8% is ridiculous.

[24-Feb-19 01:07 AM] tolken#2655
Never bought in Canada though, maybe that‚Äôs normal.

[24-Feb-19 01:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
not only that, looks like VISA is gonna charge me 5% on top of that as they now consider crypto purchases "cash advances"

[24-Feb-19 01:09 AM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah i remember it always being pretty high

[24-Feb-19 01:09 AM] Sdunbar#5064
thats life in canada, everything is expensive

[24-Feb-19 01:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
not sure what my best options are here.. aggregate of 8.8% on the purchase is pretty ridic

[24-Feb-19 01:50 AM] Likewise#6767
just buy from somebody else and leave the scammy exchanges and cc's out, isnt that what crypto is supposed to be about??

[24-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Not much goin on for that here in Vancouver, most of the sellers seem to be in Toronto

[24-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064
several thousand kms away lol

[24-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I'd prefer to meet in person for that kind of transaction

[24-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ah ok

[24-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Sdunbar#5064
whats the best way to do it

[24-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Sdunbar#5064
e transfer?

[24-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
A few years ago i just used to use coinbase with a credit card

[24-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
super fast and easy

[24-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
a bit of a heavy fee but back then my CC provider didnt charge their own fee on top

[24-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Sdunbar#5064
credit card provider

[24-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Sdunbar#5064
visa in my case

[24-Feb-19 02:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Sdunbar   There is many voucher providers in your location

[24-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064

Really appreciate everyone's help here

[24-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I checked out gonetcoins but they charge 7.5% i think

[24-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
That was a few hours ago I checked it out. I'm not sure now lol. I've had a few drinks since then!

[24-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I'll have to take a look again tomorow

Nice volume. I always wonder how these things get started; is it just one person buying and it starts a chain reaction or a group that decides to buy in for whatever reason.

[24-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Markus#5464
no idea but we got some bigger walls at 30k and 32k

@Sdunbar  not sure about Canada license but opay channel in here should be of interest üòÉ

[24-Feb-19 04:39 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Fiat to KSB (stable coin backed by Komodo loan debt) has very low fees. And since it‚Äôs a stable coin ksb -> btc market should have a lot of liquidity once everything‚Äôs up and running perfect

[24-Feb-19 04:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Same as cash out, whatever coin -> ksb then they do fiat transfer to your bank as a ksb buyback üòÉ

[24-Feb-19 04:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Fab√ò  any plans for Canada? Or already doable with current licenses

$KMD Weekly TF

Look at volume over the last two weeks! More then when we were at All time highs. Komodo is going to go on an absolute tear soon, extremely strong Fundamental coin too but look that chart, just beautiful. Really does feel like 2017 today. $ALTS

For those of you traders that use proton too

[24-Feb-19 08:50 AM] LocoMB#8593
I use proton- need to read up on this ... I think the guy got his hands really dirty and proton is taking precautions- they certainly did not suspend the account _for no reason at all_  and the say they will hand back control to him when/if he the mattert is solved.
other than that, the only way to not be subject to such intervention is run your own email server

$KMD chart. This is probably one of the MOST bullish setups I can see right now. Yes, we are under weekly resistance, but this is one of the few coins I have seen that is overbought on the D3 and bouncing off of 60. Volume is also massive and upside potential is HUGE. I'm ...

$BTC update
The trend is short term bullish
And everyone is bulltarded on alts including me

[24-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jorian#4555
a block that didn't mine any transactions but the coinbase

[24-Feb-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
empty blocks are completely valid

[24-Feb-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you can mined blocks with no tx ... b7ut you missout on fees so its makes little sense to do so

[24-Feb-19 01:35 PM] Likewise#6767
2670 touched 3 times on 4 H, needs to push through

[24-Feb-19 01:35 PM] Likewise#6767
well touched and pierced through 4th time,

[24-Feb-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r but satoshi said it was ok. I guess he didn't have to pay his miners electricity bill every month

[24-Feb-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol ... How can you force a miner to mine tx tho ... dont see it possible tbh

[24-Feb-19 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you expend that much energy, why not get as much money as you can though.

[24-Feb-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
12.5BTC isn't enough?

[24-Feb-19 01:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
:troll_thuglife:

[24-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is risk that if you wait for tx fees, that you also lose the block, I think?

[24-Feb-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well if the mempool is empty yes

[24-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
better to lock in a block than maybe get 0.02 extra in fees

[24-Feb-19 01:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
fees per block are between 0.4 and 0.95 btc at the moment
but sure better cash in 12.5 than risk everything for a 5%

[24-Feb-19 02:09 PM] yorklab#7270
176,000 on the bid at 25.5k.

[24-Feb-19 02:10 PM] yorklab#7270
We'll see if it stays when the sellers start hitting it.

[24-Feb-19 02:13 PM] yorklab#7270
....and they are. I guess because Bitcoin is taking a small dump.
