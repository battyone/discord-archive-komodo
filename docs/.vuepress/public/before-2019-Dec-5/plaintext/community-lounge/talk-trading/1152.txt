You're doing the mobile stuff right?

[22-Sep-19 02:44 PM] Priva99#5191
Yup

[22-Sep-19 02:44 PM] allbits#5898
Looking forward to it!

[22-Sep-19 02:44 PM] Priva99#5191
A very practical and useful project

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Priva99#5191
We all use our phones

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Priva99#5191
Very much

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] allbits#5898
Silent Dragon on my android?

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Priva99#5191
That's right

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Priva99#5191
Pair it with a full node

[22-Sep-19 02:46 PM] Priva99#5191
3d printed Dragon

[22-Sep-19 02:46 PM] Priva99#5191
A more secured version of android

What do you mean when you say more secured version of android?

[22-Sep-19 06:40 PM] Priva99#5191
@Tek Everyone laugh, he's so hilarious..You remind me of an Ethereum dev...
As far as your comments, they couldn't be further from the truth. Only a real asshole says something like that. Don't put me in that K64 group

[22-Sep-19 06:43 PM] Priva99#5191
You are shit

[22-Sep-19 06:44 PM] Priva99#5191

in monkey-anity you mean

[22-Sep-19 06:46 PM] Priva99#5191
I mean, I really like working on Android phones. I've been messing with custom ROMs for 7-8 years. And I also care about privacy. So I happen to enjoy what I'm working on & I'm good at it

[22-Sep-19 06:46 PM] Priva99#5191
I don't need someone calling it a scam

[22-Sep-19 06:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Monkeygrab

[22-Sep-19 06:47 PM] Priva99#5191
I don't care if anyone uses it. It's fine. I'll still have instructions up for anybody to do it themselves.

[22-Sep-19 06:48 PM] Priva99#5191
Ok now you're shitposting

[22-Sep-19 06:48 PM] Priva99#5191
The deal is I block u & go about my business

[22-Sep-19 06:48 PM] Priva99#5191
You aren't drawing me any further into this lol

[22-Sep-19 06:49 PM] Priva99#5191
But you are wrong

[22-Sep-19 06:49 PM] Priva99#5191
I have no token man

[22-Sep-19 06:49 PM] Priva99#5191
This is simply a hardware setup

[22-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Priva99#5191
I'm hardening Android phones to make them as secure as possible

[22-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Priva99#5191
And I'm adding in Silent Dragon

[22-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Priva99#5191
So you can send zaddrs on mobile, if you have a full node to connect to

[22-Sep-19 06:50 PM] Priva99#5191
You can either manually do it with instructions

[22-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Priva99#5191
That's no cost

[22-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Priva99#5191
For that part nothing ....privacy is free

[22-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Priva99#5191
If u don't want to do it and need a phone, we can do it all

[22-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Priva99#5191
No token

[22-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Priva99#5191
Simply trying to make an Android, that can provide daily usability and a high level of privacy.

[22-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Priva99#5191
Our phones are what we use

[22-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Priva99#5191
And we will add the crypto part in there

[22-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Priva99#5191
That's our contribution

[22-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Priva99#5191
We will have a FDroid Repo

[22-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Priva99#5191
It's a stronger OS than normal

[22-Sep-19 06:54 PM] Priva99#5191
