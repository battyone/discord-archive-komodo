@blackjok3r  is it only for laptops?

[31-Jul-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure... libreboot is mostly for core2 thinkpads...

[31-Jul-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for anything reasonable you going to want one of those with a minimal linux

[31-Jul-18 02:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok thanks!

[31-Jul-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For servers, you can use Opteron quad CPU's

[31-Jul-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My Notary Node server was $1300 AUD... with no storage drives... cheap as chips 😂

[31-Jul-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_wishes his server only cost $1300 AUD, and he's not even 1/2 done building it 😦_

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha it was pure luck... I wrongly assumed this server was immue to Spectre + meltdown, turns out its immune to one of those, but not the other... But it does not have any hardware back door at all.

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think I spent that much on RAM alone 😛

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[31-Jul-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Lets run an ICO on CHIPS .... we can use Crypto Condidtions to make KMDCPU fund and fund it with 1 million CHIPS.. ICO to raise enough money to  buy AMD and make them remove back door. Inital putrchase 1 Million chips.

[31-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <3rdstryker> AMD?

[31-Jul-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ThreadRipper is the best CPU now ad AMD will be cheaper to purchase than Intel. 😄

So, you're another of those fukwits that's upset about BTC "only" being up 10x in the last 24 months?

[31-Jul-18 03:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You’re one of those perpetually butthurt about being alive shitheads that has some faggot comment for everything?

[31-Jul-18 03:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Piss off mate

[31-Jul-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
seems to me you need to look up the term "butthurt" and then realize it applies to you

[31-Jul-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And, also, what was the name of the trailer-park you were raised in? 🤔

[31-Jul-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Bitcoin Core hasn't advanced any feken tech in years and the fact that it *is* 10x over the last 24 months is a good thing, not something to be upset about because it's not **more**

[31-Jul-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Sucks for you that you bought on the bubble, but that's the risk you took

and also leftists wailing about impending BREXIT doom 👾

[31-Jul-18 04:09 PM] LocoMB#8593
but trading is not really a healthy occupation... and new ICOs aren't promising either..

[31-Jul-18 04:11 PM] LocoMB#8593
2015/16 were the years of the platform ICOs- many promising ones.. but that ship has sailed too by now, to assume that the 13th platform ICO would be so much better than the first 12 is unrealistic

`I haven’t bought BTC since ‘15 you dolt`
Then what dafuq could you **possibly** be on about when it's 7k+?
Your dumbass should be ecstatic, rather than sounding like some redneck trailer-trash who just had his welfare check stolen.

offtopic: what is the best block to claim interest before the fork?

[31-Jul-18 04:14 PM] LocoMB#8593
@ComputerGenie I think you miss the irony of the whole drama 🎭 🎭 🎭  ... we are not in a bitcointalk noob thread here

[31-Jul-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@LocoMB I'm just trying to understand the whole thought process of blaming "faggots" for BTC being moon and not feken Pluto

[31-Jul-18 04:16 PM] LocoMB#8593
it is called 'irony' .. it is not mandatory to understand that.

[31-Jul-18 04:19 PM] snowdamn#2414
does older interest get lost after the fork or will we have 1 month to claim everything (new and old)?

[31-Jul-18 04:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
any ANN about that? seems I missed iut

[31-Jul-18 04:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@snowdamn you can always claim, even a year from now, it just stop accruing more

[31-Jul-18 04:22 PM] snowdamn#2414

SHERIDAN, WY - July 31, 2018 - Today GLX is happy to announce that the NASDAQ Stock Market has granted us a one year extension on our reservation of the ticker symbol “GLX”.

GLX is currently in the process of completing our 2017 audits. We anticipate filing a Tier II Reg A+ crowdfund offering with the U.S. SEC within the next 60-days and expect that offering to be effective in late 2018 or early 2019. Shortly after the offering we expect to seek a listing on the NASDAQ.
