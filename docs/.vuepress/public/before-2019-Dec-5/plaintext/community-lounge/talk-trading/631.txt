Vrsc just took a ‘uuuuge dump

[11-May-19 10:46 AM] klein#5233
I'm not following what you are asking

[11-May-19 10:47 AM] klein#5233
no its about understanding where pools of liquidity are

[11-May-19 10:47 AM] klein#5233
people will place there stops above important highs and below significant lows

[11-May-19 10:48 AM] klein#5233
the market facilitates trade

[11-May-19 10:49 AM] klein#5233
if $6000 is seen as a big resistance level

[11-May-19 10:49 AM] klein#5233
people will short it

[11-May-19 10:49 AM] klein#5233
and place there stops above said swing highs like 6550 and 6800

[11-May-19 10:49 AM] klein#5233
plus bullish people will buy the breakout of these levels

He saw the writing on the wall

[11-May-19 12:29 PM] Markus#5464

[11-May-19 12:30 PM] Markus#5464
ofc he will never admit that

[11-May-19 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-May-19 12:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He just needs to post some more gaybro anime “we’re bitcoins little brother together family honor love” or some shit kind of meme

[11-May-19 12:34 PM] Markus#5464
Shouldnt forget that he tweeted that LTC would go to 20$, why would he not sell on 300$ knowing what will possibly happen

[11-May-19 01:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
Miners buy crypto--they just do it using time, effort and capital.  Lots of opportunity cost to mining.

I buy crypto and drugs

[11-May-19 01:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Sometimes I mine out drugs out of my nose if I havent snorted them properly

[11-May-19 01:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
Crypto and drugs... which is more addictive?

[11-May-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Interesting question, probably crypto tho

[11-May-19 01:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess they can be more fun also, if you hit a nice bull run

[11-May-19 01:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
i did feel pretty high all of December 2017.

[11-May-19 01:44 PM] Caglio#3337
But I still havent received any blowjobs in night club bathrooms from skunks due to my crypto investments, maybe one day.... drugs on the other hand....

[11-May-19 01:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
