The gullibility of  the joe sixpack crypto dude is the only thing keeping projects like EOS alive. As for "certain regulations", I have no idea how any of that benefits tech at all. The goal here is to obsolete regulatory frameworks imo

[22-Feb-19 10:57 AM] Likewise#6767
weird analysis lol

[22-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Likewise#6767
without regulations thsi show is never going mainstream

[22-Feb-19 10:59 AM] Likewise#6767
we were not really discussing tech were we?

hello. Does anyone know where are trading the barterdex tokens? or in what channel do I ask? Thks

[22-Feb-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@sassh there are no specific "barterdex tokens"; you trade the CoinA you have for the CoinB you want

[22-Feb-19 02:41 PM] sassh#5287
these are the DEX coins

[22-Feb-19 02:43 PM] sassh#5287
They were called INSTANDEX previously. Then I guess they became the tokens of Barterdex exchange

[22-Feb-19 02:44 PM] sassh#5287
there is no info on coinmrktcp

[22-Feb-19 02:44 PM] sassh#5287
They used to trade on Barterdex for KMD

[22-Feb-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
You *can* trade DEX on barterdex, but you do not **need** DEX *to* trade

[22-Feb-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
DEX is its own coin with its own chain, it's not a token

[22-Feb-19 02:48 PM] crumb#2550
DEX "owns" the 0.13% trading fees that BarterDEX engine makes

[22-Feb-19 02:49 PM] crumb#2550
and the fees are only for takers side

[22-Feb-19 02:50 PM] Acura#2748
@sassh on Barterdex/HyperDex you will get the DEX Asset and on coinexchange.io

[22-Feb-19 02:52 PM] crumb#2550
and if you need bigger amounts you'll probably need to ask here or on the #talk-general channel for an OTC deal

[22-Feb-19 02:53 PM] crumb#2550
sometimes there are people interested in selling. i remember seeing WTS offers for DEX occasionally

[22-Feb-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_is a DEX üê≥ with a whole 0.45508151_

[22-Feb-19 03:29 PM] sassh#5287
Thanks. I own some InstanDEX tokens, which must be DEX. Is it correct? The token that owns the fees that BarterDEX makes. So I am entitled to the part of the fee that BartterDEX makes?

[22-Feb-19 03:29 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[22-Feb-19 03:32 PM] sassh#5287
Do you know how do I claim that fee?

[22-Feb-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
it will be distributed when there is enough amount

[22-Feb-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
like airdropped to the address where you have DEX

[22-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
SHo, does mm2 include the same fee structure?

[22-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
0.15% from taker that is

[22-Feb-19 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[22-Feb-19 03:34 PM] sassh#5287
Thanks. So is it correct that InstanDEX (DEX) token owns BarterDEX exchange?

[22-Feb-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a legal ownership, but the revenues will be distributed proportionally

[22-Feb-19 03:38 PM] sassh#5287

Damn

[22-Feb-19 10:49 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
What does the Amazon thing mean? Is it somehow related to the coin?

[22-Feb-19 10:53 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Is the info already confirmed by Amazon?

Hahaha...all in. House, car, wifes soul, my soul...

[22-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Since when is the info out? And is there a relation to the coin or is it just good marketing.

[22-Feb-19 11:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been in progress for many months, i think it was on the site a few months ago. very few crypto projects have achieved this level. it is a combination of good marketing and good tech

[22-Feb-19 11:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
you should be in FOMO mode.

[22-Feb-19 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
many projects apply for standard membership and it is easy to get and they go all crazy over what is basically a free listing

[22-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if KMD doesn't succeed in the future which is unlikely , then all the hope in decentralization is lost along with the blockchain tech.

[22-Feb-19 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the platinum level is very special

[22-Feb-19 11:05 PM] Markus#5464
is platinum the highest level?

[22-Feb-19 11:05 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Good work! Nice to see real world adoption.

[22-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
So jl777c and bezos are best friends forever, confirmed!

How do we get some case studies up there?

[22-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Markus#5464
cant find anything about partnership levels

[22-Feb-19 11:16 PM] Markus#5464
doubt that info will ever become public, ofc there is some ppl who know but dont see why they would reveal it

[22-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Markus#5464
great example would be the street artist "banksy" ppl dont know who he/she is but ofc some ppl do but why would they reveal it üòÑ

[22-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
I like that there are people around with multiple identities.

[22-Feb-19 11:22 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
It's like in the good stories: batman, Jesus, zorro

[22-Feb-19 11:25 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
Will Amazon also use pirate as a payment method, ARRR.

[22-Feb-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not get carried away. this is AWS, not Amazon the main company
