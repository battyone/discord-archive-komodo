history repeats itself in crypto markets as long as buttcoin is dominant

[25-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 09:12 PM] dan.#2473

[25-Jun-19 09:12 PM] dan.#2473

[25-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Im just taking this opportunity to scoop up cheap ecosystem coins on the KMD pair, people exiting positions to take advantage of cheap KMD/BTC but I feel one step ahead :labs: :pirate: :Hush:

☝ (2) 👍 (2) Komodo 

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
bruh the btc run hasn't even started yet

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
everything isgonna get a lot more cheaper even

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] dan.#2473
ive been around since btcd days. something about this feels different than before (cough libra)

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
the run actually only starts when btc is at 20k

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
this is just the bottom being bought up

[25-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I have no more btc on reserve for scooping up alts, balls deep already

[25-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
gotta trade kmd pairs at this point

[25-Jun-19 09:16 PM] dan.#2473
everyone bitches about btc fees, but thats probably what will trigger alt season ironically

[25-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
corecoin is trying to change public opinon

[25-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
they want to make it so that you see it as digital gold, IE you don't use it

[25-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
you just hold it

[25-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
but as we all know, networks derive value from usage

[25-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
so they r shootin themselves in the foot

[25-Jun-19 09:18 PM] dan.#2473
$50 fees force alts to go up. definitely an impetus in alt season

[25-Jun-19 09:18 PM] dan.#2473
might even be crazier this time

[25-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
it will be crazier, havent you heard? its their whole model to make the fees expensive

[25-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Tek#5253
its the plan

[25-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
its how they see it now

[25-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
extremely high fees

[25-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
thats what they want

[25-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
some core devs even wanted to DECREASE  the block size further

[25-Jun-19 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
this is good news for all alts though

[25-Jun-19 09:21 PM] dan.#2473
could be a while tho (well weeks)

[25-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
im thinking its gonna take months

[25-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Malti#3948
Couldn’t resist these prices

[25-Jun-19 10:05 PM] Tek#5253
should have sold for btc

[25-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Volumes don’t match pump

[25-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Malti#3948
Maybe but I don’t wanna actively trade on the waves in the btc/Alts

[25-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Malti#3948

[25-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The tards haven’t even begun to come back into crypto

[25-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Malti#3948
Still have half my BNB stack left and it has been doing pretty good against btc

[25-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But crypto hodlgang is abandoning altship

[25-Jun-19 10:07 PM] Malti#3948
I’ll sell that stack when kmd hits 8k sats as well

[25-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

It’s almost impossible to buy K64 tho

[25-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Oszy#5734
there's plenty on DP

[25-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Oszy#5734

[25-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Malti#3948
Yes but no price base imo

[25-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Malti#3948
It would be buying in the dark

[25-Jun-19 10:11 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah well either that or wait for expo

[25-Jun-19 10:12 PM] Malti#3948
Did something already get announced?

[25-Jun-19 10:12 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea could get out of control after the expo

[25-Jun-19 10:12 PM] Oszy#5734
