is it possible that bitcoin rally so much last weeks cause of the trade war between us and china?

[28-May-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It could be

[28-May-19 08:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But the amount of money us-china represents

[28-May-19 08:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Volume should be a lot higher

[28-May-19 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think we would see these kinds of moves with capital restrictions rather than tradewar per se

[28-May-19 08:15 PM] Markus#5464
ye possible

[28-May-19 08:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so when BTC goes up and it tanks alts....if KMD goes up now will it tank Pirate?

[28-May-19 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe in KMD

[28-May-19 08:30 PM] Sherdogz#6731

[28-May-19 08:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can’t dump anymore if there’s none available :troll:

[28-May-19 08:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if you have more money than the market cap of the coin, that works 😄

[28-May-19 08:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
maybe hard to sell it all though

[28-May-19 09:20 PM] Tek#5253
whalebrooo

[28-May-19 09:26 PM] Tek#5253

[28-May-19 09:26 PM] Tek#5253
wew

[28-May-19 09:28 PM] Alexfrog#1338
he sends them all to DP, buys pirate, and then the dumpers send the KMD back to binacne, and he buys them again.

[28-May-19 09:28 PM] Tek#5253
dp?

[28-May-19 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a lot of guessing and a lot of drugs :troll:

[28-May-19 09:42 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[28-May-19 09:45 PM] Tek#5253
i know what happens when whaleburuh appears

[28-May-19 09:45 PM] Tek#5253
time to profit

[28-May-19 09:49 PM] tolken#2655
I wonder if the 0.0003 price will become the new KmD norm again. Still relatively low compared to 2017. Feels very low priced right now.

[28-May-19 09:59 PM] Alexfrog#1338
how about 100k sats becoming the new norm 😛

[28-May-19 10:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so kmd, is doing well, therefore BTC will go to 10k and murder it

[28-May-19 10:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
jsut as happens every time KMD even thinks about rising

[28-May-19 10:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it must be stopped by btc mooning

[28-May-19 10:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
also how can i mute that fucking gif

[28-May-19 10:24 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[28-May-19 10:24 PM] Tek#5253
some huge support for kmd buys

[28-May-19 10:26 PM] Tek#5253
should I sell

[28-May-19 10:27 PM] p.#1126
Should i buy back :troll_rage: :troll_compadre:

[28-May-19 10:28 PM] modereck#4269
lot of big buy orders, seems like bots are placing those orders

[28-May-19 10:29 PM] Tek#5253
im putting some rediculous sell orders around 19 and 20k

[28-May-19 10:29 PM] Tek#5253

[28-May-19 10:29 PM] modereck#4269

[28-May-19 10:57 PM] Tek#5253
is the market gonna dump?

[28-May-19 11:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im sure we'll have btc 10k and kmd under 13k sats by tomorrow 😛

[28-May-19 11:52 PM] Tek#5253
i picked some kmd up at 14k and 15k and just sold for the impeding btc to 10k moon

[28-May-19 11:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
0.00017193 = greater profit from 15k than 10k BTC

[28-May-19 11:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, math

[28-May-19 11:56 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[29-May-19 12:02 AM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 12:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by having more than pleb level of coinage and trading multiple coins against other things?

[29-May-19 12:46 AM] Tek#5253
rude 😮

[29-May-19 12:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Which part was rude?
pointing out that you're a hypocrite or pointing out that you're a broke hypocrite?
I need to be sure for next time....

I am surprised the face tats didn't cost him the popular vote.

No need to win the popular vote when the Electoral College votes in your favor

[29-May-19 01:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
well, its a college.   so they are super smart, right?

[29-May-19 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think so

[29-May-19 01:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
they probably have those square hats with tassles

[29-May-19 01:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
which means... stuff

[29-May-19 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Fact remains that there are many that can make my entire portfolio look like loose couch change, but if you have to go all in on a single trade to make a few bucks, you aren't one of them and shouldn't get all buttthurt when the guy you repeatedly call a pleb points out that you're one too.
If you're looking for someone to roll over and take shit without dishing it back, I ain't the one.

[29-May-19 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-May-19 05:38 AM] BlockTech#6895
I have a noob question (as the noob i am.) 

This is the Binance KMD address. Is this the coins of Binance only, or the coin of everybody stocked on the exchange ? 

https://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RFaYXUJUE7CziS73EE6gvaqFduVo9KWjXT

[29-May-19 05:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe that is their hotwallet. It used to have 1.5-2.2m KMD.
I imagine there is some coldstore with more KMD.

[29-May-19 05:43 AM] CHMEX#0686
They probaly don't store all users kmd fund in the same wallet.

[29-May-19 05:43 AM] BlockTech#6895
Oh yeah make sense, since sell side have more than those 160k KMD.

[29-May-19 06:35 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
pamp it kmd
