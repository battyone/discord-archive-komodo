[05-Aug-19 09:04 PM] Caglio#3337

Well you know what to do

[05-Aug-19 09:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD just really wanted to be a $1 stablecoin.  It decided to stop being a $1.50 stablecoin so it could be a stablecoin at $1 instead.

[05-Aug-19 09:12 PM] Caglio#3337
Fair, but now we look as tether

[05-Aug-19 09:12 PM] Caglio#3337
we should go down on 0.75

[05-Aug-19 09:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
only after the next btc dump

@allbits as far a I am aware those circumstances are playing out as we speak.

[05-Aug-19 09:57 PM] digital bullion#8223
"In a cashless world, there would be no lower bound on interest rates. A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession. The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds. Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy."

The Australian parliment is introducing legislation that make it illegal to transact in cash above $10000, maximum penalty will be up to $25000 fine and two years in jail.

I dont believe that people will tolerate negative 4 percent interest and they will seek alternatives.

[05-Aug-19 10:03 PM] digital bullion#8223
It is ridiculous.

I‚Äôve had buy order in for a couple months at 0.00008, maybe I‚Äôll get lucky today.

[05-Aug-19 10:13 PM] allbits#5898
Yes that's the blog article you mischaracterized

[05-Aug-19 10:21 PM] allbits#5898
In your few words on the topic, you twice used the word "recommended". It's just not true if you read the source material.  It's quite typical of this channel for people to post misleading characterizations like you've done.  The Gillette one from a couple of days ago by someone else was a blatantly misleading clickbait headline.  And people take it as good coin, and use it to build their inaccurate maps of reality.

Having said that, I think the article you referenced is interesting and I thank you for posting it.  As well as the unrelated Australia news.

[05-Aug-19 10:32 PM] NNoperator#3835
@digital bullion   Ruchir Agarwal and Signe Krogstrup don't seem to realize that after 1 year the 3% hit on holding cash would be done,  just continue holding cash.  I think people would still  hold cash over e-money.   Good luck with that crap.

[05-Aug-19 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I personally will never consider the 5% as done until handled by all cold wallets.

[05-Aug-19 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
natively

[05-Aug-19 10:35 PM] NNoperator#3835
If my bank started charging negative interest rates, I'll pull cash and walk to the next room over and put it into the safety deposit box.  F*** that noise...

[05-Aug-19 10:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
not possible to be seen serious providing 5% interest not natively claim"able" on one of the  most used hardware wallet. the atomiclabs is cool, but native is the real way to promote 5% APR

[05-Aug-19 10:38 PM] NNoperator#3835
Pretty sure I natively claim my 5% on a monthy basis for the past two years...

[05-Aug-19 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
on a ledger ?

[05-Aug-19 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
without any app ?

I also like claiming with both chameleon and atomicdex now too.

[05-Aug-19 10:52 PM] NNoperator#3835
To move to a cashless society they would need to stop printing cash.   You can't do that without totally gutting the entire cash infrastructure.  Don't think that will fly in many nations (especially not Japan with 18% of GDP worth of cash in circulation).   As you get closer to negative interest rates you will get more people pulling cash out and using it,  not surprising.

[05-Aug-19 10:55 PM] NNoperator#3835
But do keep using those debit cards for all your transactions if that is where you want to go.  What could go wrong with it??

[05-Aug-19 10:56 PM] allbits#5898
Perhaps sometime in the future we'll be free from the tyranny of having our money and interest rates controlled by cabals instead of algorithms.
