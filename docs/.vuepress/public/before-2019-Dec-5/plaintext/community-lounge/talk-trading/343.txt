z'd them and then t'd them, still number 1

[15-Dec-18 12:46 AM] bishop#9773
Why even Z them if you are going to dump them all into an obvious taddr

[15-Dec-18 12:47 AM] bishop#9773
Actually, never went to a zaddr

[15-Dec-18 12:48 AM] ph03nix#3115
yes true, i misread it

[15-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Last I saw, he sent them to two different addresses.

[15-Dec-18 12:49 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Three if you count that address with 30k in it.

[15-Dec-18 12:49 AM] jspook16#3059
30k ....pocket change i suppose

[15-Dec-18 12:50 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
a few days of reward for him.

[15-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Stocking up on Komodo right now would be so boss. Five percent reward per year for such little money. No bank could beat it but that depends on if komodo actually gains value it deserves.

[15-Dec-18 01:53 AM] jspook16#3059
We'll find out in the next two years

[15-Dec-18 04:19 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it‚Äôs 4 months away.  For KMD.  $2

[15-Dec-18 04:36 AM] tolken#2655

[15-Dec-18 04:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Short Term probably down

[15-Dec-18 04:48 AM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt understand why, but sure. Down it is. /me shrugs

Everything is going down, btc moves first, all it means isbtc will rise first

[15-Dec-18 05:23 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Dollar cost averaging back into BTC at these prices!

[15-Dec-18 05:24 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Love these cheap prices we will probably have 6-12 months to accumulate

[15-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@jspook16 if you follow the funds from 73Pi he claimed the intrest and then transferred to a fresh cold wallet

damn that is a lot of KMD

[15-Dec-18 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wish that that address makes a transaction and it's rewards end up in one of my mined blocks. :abusedsmily: üòÅ

Yeah, some exchanges doing that I think

[15-Dec-18 12:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
could that be an exchange?

Interesting week for stablecoins. 

Recently BitShares bitUSD went into "global settlement," meaning that users can no longer borrow bitUSD from the chain, but they can convert it into collateral (BTS) at the global settlement price, currently about $0.70.

[15-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe if BTC breaks 3k

[15-Dec-18 05:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why would people hodling now

[15-Dec-18 05:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362

This bear is almost exactly like the last, almost exact same trends and behavior. Human nature doesn't change. Bitcoin all about speculation/human nature. Good to see sentiment finally more negative. Bottom I think should be January-Febuary. Slow recovery, maybe bull 2020-2021

[15-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
so bottom 3k or 2k? whats most likely?

[15-Dec-18 07:10 PM] jspook16#3059
If we don't see something by end of 2020 it may be a long winter

[15-Dec-18 07:10 PM] jspook16#3059
I think 800 is bottom.

[15-Dec-18 07:13 PM] cah5896#7669
I called 2-3k several months ago and I think I still stand by that. I said 0.40-0.70 for KMD when it was still 1.50

[15-Dec-18 07:13 PM] cah5896#7669
Using past retracements I don't think it's ever been that severe as 20,000--->800 but you never know I guess

[15-Dec-18 07:23 PM] cah5896#7669
That would be below the ATH back in 2013 of $1100ish

[15-Dec-18 07:27 PM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt care if the overal market goes down, just that KMD takes its share. If ETH drop in half to $40 and kmd goes to a measly $10, I‚Äôm fine with that üòõ

[15-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Markus#5464
fine? it would be heaven

[15-Dec-18 07:29 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, I‚Äôm not ok with KMD not being adopted and recognized in due time. Price will reflect that once that happens.

[15-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sure we will see 10$ one day but it will require alot of patience

[15-Dec-18 07:30 PM] Markus#5464
considering the amount of updates being done on the platform its almost impossible to ignore the recognition from others

[15-Dec-18 07:31 PM] tolken#2655
Yep, but patience doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean forever. Things can change very rapidly. It‚Äôs a good sign that people have cooled off, but it can‚Äôt last forever, that would ignore the amazing strides in tech through the industry.

[15-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Markus#5464
i mean look at Eth end of 2017 what technology they had, the price and compare it to kmd

[15-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Markus#5464
and its just begin

[15-Dec-18 07:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
really curious to see which push will keep going ü§ì

[15-Dec-18 07:32 PM] Markus#5464
i would be surprised if kmd wont hit top 25 next run
