well, yes, that

[13-Apr-19 12:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
money, that's better if you buy and hodl

[13-Apr-19 12:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
less efforts

[13-Apr-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm a guppie and I make more on trades than an "average"" NN would make if all were even

I had to start hitting the gym. Working on komodo got me from 175lb to 196lb

agree on that too 😄

[13-Apr-19 12:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only managed to lose 5 kg since 22 jan this year 😛

[13-Apr-19 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im back to 178 at least

[13-Apr-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But yeah, if you dont notice or not take care you end up gaining weight like crazy

[13-Apr-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not counting the many operators that had to get treatment for stomach related issues

[13-Apr-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not that its directly related, but it adds up

[13-Apr-19 12:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there should be Notary Nodes AMA held on reddit, where Notary Nodes operators of previous year can answer questions

@FishyGuts didn't knew that fact. sad mate. 😐

[13-Apr-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Sounds funny but with last year bear market and a bit of other things, being a NN operator might actually be painful

[13-Apr-19 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On the other hand, if kmd goes to $10, that would be a different story

[13-Apr-19 12:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm guessing this season notary nodes will be happy. because it's not bear market like previous

[13-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Still needs confirmation

[13-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But yeah.

[13-Apr-19 12:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for notary nodes, the real test is who still gives best when it's bear market and when there isn't much incentive to run a node.

[13-Apr-19 12:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
on top of it if you don't have much savings and no other reliable earning source, it's hard, very hard.

[13-Apr-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For NN operator to pay the full linux admin job yearly salary of around $150k a year, kmd needs to be at about $8.00

[13-Apr-19 12:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🙂

[13-Apr-19 12:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are other expenses too.

[13-Apr-19 12:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
server costs, hosting costs, living costs

[13-Apr-19 12:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if sharing revenue with team of N, then that

[13-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Markus#5464
so far KMD price is quite disappointing considering how much is being made on the platform and everything what is going on, meanwhile other projects like BNB make like 300% for basically no reason

[13-Apr-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bnb is a binance profit washing machine

[13-Apr-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the market is not thoughtful mate.

[13-Apr-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not yet

[13-Apr-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I really liked the words of James sometime ago,
"running on shoe lace budget" 😅

[13-Apr-19 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo really runs on shoe lace budget

[13-Apr-19 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and delivers more

[13-Apr-19 12:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imo, with the fact that most notary admins were operating with practically no profit, many thing were done

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Markus#5464
but if kmd get the recognition it deserves coming year or 2 then im quite confident believing price can easily make 100x from this point

[13-Apr-19 12:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At least we at chainmakers are proud of what we achieved with practically 0 financing

@grewalsatinder `I'd very highly recommend the new notary node operators to be Totally commit yourself to Notary Nodes.
Else DO NOT RUN in the elections.`
have i mentioned i quit my job for this? 🤞 we get elected
`making customized daemons for wallet optimizations and how to not break it when you do` that's fine, i have gdb on speed dial 😎 
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 could've posted the 24hr stat from testnet, counting from after i ran the bt on iguana :troll:

[13-Apr-19 12:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
i can assure you it's plug&play .. ./m_notary_testnet and you can go down the beach.. easy money :troll: 

disclaimer: it isn't, better hve $$ prepared for living costs.. i've spent $300+ just testing things in testnet so far

[13-Apr-19 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@mrlynch nope, you haven't mentioned, or may be I didn't came across your mention, but I read that from @FishyGuts 😉 👍

[13-Apr-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I wouldnt quit my day job hoping nn operation will make a living for me

[13-Apr-19 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At least in my case its impossible

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you live with your parents and have no kids and no debt then yeah, you may think about it.

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
i didn't do it either.. i (somewhat) planned for it.. will not rely on NN rewards for living costs

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
lol, i'm a bit too old to live with my parents 😂

[13-Apr-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`NN rewards for living costs`
that's what those aluminum tubes are for 😎

[13-Apr-19 01:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
everything's gonna be alright :abusedsmily:

all in all, i fekkin love this 😎

[13-Apr-19 01:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure that if i look for a job on a blockchain related company and i have "notary node administrator for komodo platform from 2018-present" i would definitively get much better consideration though

they wanted Ethereum, or Corda person?

[13-Apr-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
most people want ETH junk, and I would rather die in a ditch than code that stuff

that is cool

a reply should be, "When you have some real blockchain job, please contact back". 😄

I have a lot of details to add to the whitepaper regarding Cryptopia, that will happen soon

Additionally, I must warn any trader from using ZEL products, as they want to follow the old legacy HUSH chain

[13-Apr-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Do not store HUSH in any ZEL wallet, it's closed source and unsuppported and they don't want to support our new chain without charging us money, lol

[13-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems like that is a 0.5% arb possibility on kmd/usd - kmd/btc on bittrex

[13-Apr-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought marketmaker bots traded that shit for a living?

[13-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Isn’t 0.5% the tx fee on Trex

[13-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No profit

[13-Apr-19 02:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
marketmakers dont pay fees iirc

[13-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btw bittrex kmd withdrawals are confirmed after 1 confirmation

[13-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Did they implement check dPoW?

[13-Apr-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
1conf is not dpow

[13-Apr-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
withdraw or deposit

[13-Apr-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
withdraw

[13-Apr-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that is generated based on their exchange balances

[13-Apr-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
not about double spends

[13-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha got it

[13-Apr-19 03:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@grewalsatinder - I was making a joke.   I did not lose my job, go BK or divorce from running a NN... but I could see it happening somewhere in the world sometime in the history of KMD.
