If price dumps after all deposits open then we know party is over 😄

[13-Nov-19 06:44 PM] jeffjam#9765
7 kmd sell orders on atomicdex does seem like a low number

[13-Nov-19 06:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
deposits open, price to new lows...

[13-Nov-19 06:48 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Nah

[13-Nov-19 06:48 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Party ain't over

[13-Nov-19 06:49 PM] Privatoshi#9487
You guys need to be looking at KMD/ETH

[13-Nov-19 06:50 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Its 0.005331 ETH

[13-Nov-19 06:51 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Not bc its ETH, its bc ETH is #2

[13-Nov-19 06:53 PM] Privatoshi#9487
11 months ago BNB was 0.037 ETH, now its 0.117 ETH..

[13-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Privatoshi#9487
KMD getting to 0.01 ETH would be very good

[13-Nov-19 06:57 PM] jeezy#3408
if btc pumps here from this bull flag we could retrace quiet a bit

[13-Nov-19 06:57 PM] jeezy#3408
which would be healthy I guess

[13-Nov-19 07:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586

Fair price tbh

[13-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
15k supply at those prices

[13-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Neko#5830
i'm happy kmd is finally getting some recognition

[13-Nov-19 10:15 PM] tolken#2655
Hopefully, easy to feel that way as price appreciates, but still seems like we have a way to go before it gets the deserved recognition.

[13-Nov-19 10:16 PM] tolken#2655
Chinese reports were interesting, but how much it matters gets a little lost in translation.

[14-Nov-19 03:41 AM] tolken#2655
Sad. On a positive note, clears the room for someone else to legitimately make some more blockchain games, they kinda sucked the air out of the room with all the empty promises.

[14-Nov-19 04:25 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I disagree.
It's over and done with.
Promises only end up in a favorable light,  if they are fulfilled. It's better to let the daily work on a new project speak, for what promise it offers. 
K64 is over. Life isnt perfect,  mistakes are made. Komodo and the Komodo Ecosystem remain in tact, and it'll stay that way.

[14-Nov-19 05:33 AM] richardt#2807
The saddest part is losing the community members who got very misled and vouched for them

[14-Nov-19 05:38 AM] Privatoshi#9487
If they recognized their own shortcomings, do you think they should be welcomed back?

[14-Nov-19 05:57 AM] richardt#2807
Sure, why not? As long as they were truly misled and didn't have bad intentions

Each & every person in this discord, at one point in their life, was blinded to reality and probably hurt others.

[14-Nov-19 07:08 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I hope to see the few guys that left here, eventually come back.

[14-Nov-19 07:30 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Nice to see someone else do well

[14-Nov-19 07:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes ,  let’s see how well they do with the Eth taxation model

[14-Nov-19 07:31 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Well they figured a way to get very very low fees

[14-Nov-19 07:31 AM] Privatoshi#9487
But it could fail as a project

[14-Nov-19 07:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
The peg is good till it isnt

[14-Nov-19 07:33 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I like projects like KMD that rely on tech

[14-Nov-19 07:34 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@polycryptoblog you're right. 
No Layer 2 solution, and they're screwed

[14-Nov-19 07:35 AM] Privatoshi#9487

[14-Nov-19 11:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
We litterally did 100% btcwise, pullback to create new support should be good

[14-Nov-19 11:35 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
10k sats is looking like the new support , so it's good

[14-Nov-19 11:37 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
we'll have to see what will happen after the deposit/withdrawal opens

[14-Nov-19 12:03 PM] saturday#4156
@Gordon Komodo do you know when it will be opens?

so height of the flagpole is the potential upwards if the pattern breaks out upwards?

[14-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So a little under 12k target?

[14-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll take it ;p

[14-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Nov-19 04:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540
KMD clawing its way back up to 11K sats at the moment, only 23K KMD sell orders up to 11K

[14-Nov-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
lets reach 20k sats by end of month :treasure:

[14-Nov-19 04:30 PM] CoinKing88#1540
The psychology is so weird, 20K sats would be awesome, but we had 20K sats last june and nobody was really thrilled back then

[14-Nov-19 04:31 PM] Markus#5464
Well depends on what ur buy in price is 😬

Silver will be the first element in the periodic table to become extinct. ... The U.S. Geological Society said just a couple years ago that silver would be the first element in the periodic table that would become extinct. It's incredibly bullish. The USGS said that would happen by 2020

Silver is never going to be extinct.... We may deplete the earth from it, but it stays in the ecosystem, if not out in the wild, it'll stay available in human 'captivity'.

[14-Nov-19 04:56 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
