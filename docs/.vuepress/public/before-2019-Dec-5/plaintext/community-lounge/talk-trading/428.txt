yeah, was just wondering the same

[19-Feb-19 08:10 AM] jorian#4555
on digiprice, against kmd it is down a lot though..

[19-Feb-19 08:10 AM] jorian#4555
over the last couple of days

[19-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
gee, maybe since KMD is up a lot. so if BTC price is the same KMD price is down.

[19-Feb-19 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Vrsc is like a coin u can't even buy in volume so how is it dumping?

[19-Feb-19 08:45 AM] ph03nix#3115
it's not dumping

@jl777c @jorian in BTC terms it's also dropping?

[19-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It was like trading around 4k a month ago

[19-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
OOPS my bad

[19-Feb-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
got the timing on the chart completely wrong

[19-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Trading around 3k sats for a while now I see

[19-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
my blockfolio must be acting up

[19-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Someone dumped mini volume at 0.08kmd

✅ 

[19-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
which is skewing results

[19-Feb-19 09:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
next sell order is at 0.17kmd, so huuuuge spread

[19-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jorian#4555
yes. and judging coinpaprika, digiprice is where the action should be happening

i guess your candles are 1h

[19-Feb-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
some pixels in a fast moving average crossed, its over. sell

[19-Feb-19 12:11 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
lol

[19-Feb-19 12:11 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
actually 30mins

[19-Feb-19 12:12 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
will admit the 4hr looks better

[19-Feb-19 12:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in this breakthrough places its better to look at higher timeframes

[19-Feb-19 12:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then it makes more sense to see where the consolidations should happen.

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example this daily chart presents a very bullish picture but the 200sma will take longer to curve up and become the floor for further prices rise.

[19-Feb-19 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So it will make sense for the price to consolidate for a bit more until we get longer period moving averages to curve

[19-Feb-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On the weekly scale , if you take volume as a sole indicator, the picture is overall bullish but it does seem like it will not be so easy to break above 41ema without a longer fight.

[19-Feb-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo, now a range consolidation around these levels makes sense

[19-Feb-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
what? the price wont double everyday forever?

[19-Feb-19 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also it would make a lot of sense to build a strong support at $1 so that it becomes a long term floor

[19-Feb-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we really want to see KMD shinning we will take a couple of years on rise/consolidate/rise/consolidate pattern.

[19-Feb-19 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and on the first waves of a bull market, the rises tend to be smaller and the consolidations longer

[19-Feb-19 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then after the realization of full bull market sets in, the pattern is for more extreme rises and more deep and short period corrections.

[19-Feb-19 12:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the first corrections are sideways, flat, slow and boring, since the motive is uncertaint and accumulation

[19-Feb-19 12:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the corrections later on a bull trend are deep and fast because the motivations are profit taking and fear of topping.

[19-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so you mean the price wont go up everyday in a straight line?

[19-Feb-19 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if it does it will happen like it has in KMD before

[19-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
many will be disappointed

[19-Feb-19 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
moonshot, then a year of ded

[19-Feb-19 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
many here have been holding for a year or more on loses

[19-Feb-19 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why such a hurry when the market is finally showing signs of turning?

[19-Feb-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure, i see people complain it pulls back from the recent highs. they want it to go up all day, everyday

[19-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I am filing complaint

[19-Feb-19 01:38 PM] jorian#4555
it went up when you were gone..

_runs_

[19-Feb-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
what I see is some impatient hodlers taking profits at the first chance they can get, perhaps miners who need to pay monthly bills and hw bills. I am not a trader, but this KMD graph looks very nice, still

[19-Feb-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what I see is some impatient hodlers taking profits at the first chance they can get`
Or they knew a dip was coming and dumped to buy more

[19-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jorian#4555
well i did a payment for the notary node

[19-Feb-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that is why i stick to coding and mining and trade as little as possible 😃

[19-Feb-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
always bet on a dip coming after a parabolic rise 😉

[19-Feb-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
40% parabola over 3 days!

[19-Feb-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I remember when it wasnt a parabola until 500% gain

[19-Feb-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[19-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1200% polo pumps

[19-Feb-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as KMD goes, I'd like to see a nice dip every 10% or so
I think that'd give a nice stable base

[19-Feb-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Those were the days

[19-Feb-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you mock polo pumps, but the pump of FLDC is just about 99% of every reason I'm in all of this 😛

[19-Feb-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that 1 random pump of people buying shit just because it had letters lead to my main mining start

[19-Feb-19 02:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why are the $340 and $250 coupons more expensive than the $160?

[19-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can multiple coupons be used on one order?

[19-Feb-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because I like round numbers and no

[19-Feb-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, I will entertain reasonable counteroffers

[19-Feb-19 02:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some extra KMD to import z9 under computer genie credentials?

[19-Feb-19 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, they aren't going to make any more so I've moved on to A9+s

[19-Feb-19 02:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh damn, really?

[19-Feb-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was waiting for BM to come out with an A9+ competitor, seems instead they are going back to just sha256

[19-Feb-19 02:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do they have a US office?

[19-Feb-19 02:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or are you still fiddling with importation BS

[19-Feb-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_never experienced "importation BS" except from UPS_

[19-Feb-19 02:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never imported anything

[19-Feb-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
