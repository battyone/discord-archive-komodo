@Vertigo Jesus tell me about it

[22-Apr-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
is cosmos a permissioned system?

[22-Apr-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
how are blocks staked?

[22-Apr-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so they are not just notaries

[22-Apr-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is more the EOS block producers?

[22-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is not decentralized at all

[22-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
registered companies as the only block producers

[22-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but probably it is a real blockchain

[22-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and yes EOS is basically just a DB that is updated by the blockproducers

```
Tendermint is a partially synchronous BFT consensus protocol derived from the DLS consensus algorithm [20]. Tendermint is notable for its simplicity, performance, and fork-accountability. The protocol requires a fixed known set of validators, where each validator is identified by their public key. 
```
it is dpos, with a relative high number of validators
```
On genesis day, the maximum number of validators will be set to 100, and this number will increase at a rate of 13% for 10 years, and settle at 300 validators.

Year 0: 100
Year 1: 113
Year 2: 127
Year 3: 144
Year 4: 163
Year 5: 184
Year 6: 208
Year 7: 235
Year 8: 265
Year 9: 300
Year 10: 300
```

[22-Apr-19 09:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Tendermint is Cosmos consensus name btw

```‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no direct merchant integration. However we‚Äôre integrating with the Visa and Mastercard network and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.‚Äù ```
AKA: Just like Bitpay, you're really not paying the merchant of your choice with BTC.

We‚Äôve tested it like 3 or 4 times now. Seems like good support! Butttttt isn‚Äôt it true that the more it gets tested the weaker it becomes? Or did I make that up?

[23-Apr-19 03:54 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

What will be the **use** of BNB? Is it actually planned to become a currency?

[23-Apr-19 05:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
no, I think BNB is more like a share in the Binance company, like AAPL or AMZN
