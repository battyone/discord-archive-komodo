KMD logo not worthy of a top 50 market cap apparently üòõ

[19-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338
only 50 best logos get top 50 market cap

Waves Ann on signal

[19-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump it

[19-Jul-19 01:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
@Alexfrog filter by coins only and it's 33

I heard polkadot will bury KMD

RIP @jl777c

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You tried

[19-Jul-19 02:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But you‚Äôre no match for a white paper and ultra expensive tokens

[19-Jul-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, people love that they need ETH to swap ERC20 tokens. it makes things so much easier to have failed swaps if you dont have ETH to trade any of them

[19-Jul-19 02:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
people really love paying big fees, its their favorite thing

[19-Jul-19 02:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
thats why bitcoin is #1 crypto and ethereum is #2 crypto

[19-Jul-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the bigger the fee the more purpose for that token, much lockin

[19-Jul-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore that all companies decide to fork ETH instead of just using it due to the fees

[19-Jul-19 02:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Imagine, the more usage, the higher the price, when each transaction costs $1000 my miner will make me rich!

[19-Jul-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
google searches, cost just a few pennies each. they would have been so much more popular than yahoo search that way, right?

[19-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if only they cost dollars each, would be even more popular

[19-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
bitcoin was never more expensive than when it cost $100 per transaction

[19-Jul-19 02:11 PM] Alexfrog#1338
clearly fees are just awesome and komodo is wrong to be free and not charge people big fees to use it! üòÑ

[19-Jul-19 02:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's called adding value. it's why the $5 bottled water you buy at the concert tastes so good.

Talked to my wife..she needs to knoe how to use crypto or its all lost

[19-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea definitely a good idea to walk her though how it all works and maybe leave written instructions on how to retrieve funds in such a scenario. That‚Äôs what I did

[19-Jul-19 03:31 PM] alen#3721
Yes thats what i mean..never actually thought much about it. But know its worth something and would be shame if it goes to nothing. Need to write it down all for her.

@alen  If you are in reasonable health, you can get a life insurance policy with a $2 mil payout for about a thousand a year...  I think you also ought to walk her through the crypto stuff, but if I croak my wife is walking with 2 mil even if she cant figure out my trail of crypto bread crumbs.

Looks like you have a revolution on your hands down there

[19-Jul-19 09:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wonder how many ARs and AKs are buried in those mountains of yours getting dug up as we speak

[19-Jul-19 09:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
now's the chance for siu to start the crypto insurrection

[19-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wonder if it‚Äôs a proper revolution or just street screeching

[19-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aka, is a group planning a hit on armories

[19-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@Hollowman9000 so sasha is building waves 2.0

If waves 1.0 was web 3.0 does this mean he is building web 6.0?

[19-Jul-19 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Will he have an ICO and token swap

[19-Jul-19 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They do proxy DEX only

[19-Jul-19 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Hollowman9000 dont think so?

[19-Jul-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs how he got rid of most of his assets the first time, he wrapped them up into waves

[19-Jul-19 09:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
then skipped paying out üòÑ

[19-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You weren‚Äôt supposed to hold onto the coinomat assets

[19-Jul-19 09:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I would exchange the waves if he offers that option

[19-Jul-19 09:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt make the same mistake twice

[19-Jul-19 10:05 PM] nael55#5863

[19-Jul-19 10:06 PM] nael55#5863

I think you actually asked this very same question, possibly with the exact wording/acronym "wtf is our?" a few weeks ago

[20-Jul-19 01:13 AM] meatspoon#7860
but as a fellow old fart, I empathize with your lack of short/medium term memory.  Or perhaps my very fallible short/medium term memory is as incorrect as I am claiming yours to be...  Dunno.

[20-Jul-19 01:43 AM] meatspoon#7860
maybe it was Zexo, now that i am thinking about it
