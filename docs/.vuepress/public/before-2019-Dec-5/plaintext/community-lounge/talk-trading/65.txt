Me and a mate are working on a game to blow crypto kitties out of the water...

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] FundazuSafu#1169
crypto whales?

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Instead of stupid cats you have onchain upgradable weapons

[24-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I want nukes

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to be perfectly able to be made aswell without a heap of effort, at least the back end can be done with CC

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I want a black hole bomb

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... the idea was that a knife can be upgraded to e just as powerful as a machine gun. With some clever balancing

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Makes the items really important

[24-Jul-18 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so they have heaps of value

[24-Jul-18 02:37 AM] FundazuSafu#1169

@blackjok3r  let us know a day before game release üòÇ

[24-Jul-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol its got a long way to go... Still just planning it.

[24-Jul-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the idea is solid though, its free to play and you could make real money out of it with enough time put in

[24-Jul-18 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Should do really well

[24-Jul-18 02:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
On ETH?

[24-Jul-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no It will use its own chain, based on Komodo CC

[24-Jul-18 02:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[24-Jul-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the tech that allows it is being built right now.

[24-Jul-18 02:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn‚Äôt know if you meant crypto conditions or colored coins

[24-Jul-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
both

[24-Jul-18 02:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But one allows for the other

What the fuck

[24-Jul-18 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC dominance approaching 50%, it is across the board, alts losing ground to BTC

[24-Jul-18 06:34 AM] Meyse#0952
I hope we touch 10k sat, I'm gonna fill my bags

[24-Jul-18 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if BTC dominance gets back to 65%, anything is possible

[24-Jul-18 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
sure feels like the bull market price action, where rational thought goes out the window and everyone just buys BTC at the cost of everything else

[24-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If kmd goes to 10k I‚Äôm selling my house

[24-Jul-18 06:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think that's a bad idea

[24-Jul-18 07:30 AM] jansako#3330
Only because it would have rebounded by the time the sale goes through and you have the dough ready -)

[24-Jul-18 07:41 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Kmd to 10k sats would be ... bad..

[24-Jul-18 08:08 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
bad for holders good for enters

[24-Jul-18 08:09 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[24-Jul-18 08:10 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Going further down isnt always good ... if you want a growth of value..

[24-Jul-18 08:13 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

[24-Jul-18 08:24 AM] snowdamn#2414
existing fiat/alt holdings can buy you only so many BTCs

[24-Jul-18 08:24 AM] snowdamn#2414

Wasn‚Äôt 8200 some kind of TA barrier?

[24-Jul-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
7777 to 8125 was the resistance I heard. There was a lot of sell volume there a few days ago.

Painful watching KMD against BTC... we haven't been at 182 Sats since Dec 17 and May 17.

[24-Jul-18 12:49 PM] RAE#3178
RSI at 22
