A currency lockable by central authorities with revocable transactions, a currency requiring KYC

sorry wrong discord, not EOS or Tezos

destroying the 'perception' that a curreny can maintain or increase value through a variety of means (miner inflation being one of them) is an old banker game.

[11-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Lumbi#8378
accumulate.. and dump etc.

[11-Jul-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`A currency without the possibility to just print some billions because a central bank approves it. A currency that has no debts to it. A currency that isnt controlled by banks. A currency peer to peer .. excluding the hand of the middle man.`
Dafuq kind of delusions do you suffer from that you feel mining has anything to do with any of that?

[11-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Lumbi#8378
bank panic of 1819 or continential currency, anyone?

Nowadays our bankaccounts are limited in withdraw amount.. in times of financial crisis.. they can lock your account undefinit. All out of our hands..

@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies there's no reason for you to go, just that you should know better than to come into this crowd with some random position parroted from didntreddit and/or twatter
If you have a position, support your claim

@Poloniex u serious? It's 6 months since last #BTCD -> #KMD swap window expired. #BTCD is a zombie coin with too low staking to function properly & no developers left. You still list #BTCD and not #KMD. Is this an oversight? A willful spite? A meta-joke on crypto insanity?...

Bank is just a service over product of money. Must be central. If you want take a loan or make deposit and use public/trusted/insured 3rd-party. Probably banking will be more fuzzy after crypto will take over the market (more small banking-like serivces/companies)

[12-Jul-18 10:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah a decentralized bank is a contradictio in terminis
