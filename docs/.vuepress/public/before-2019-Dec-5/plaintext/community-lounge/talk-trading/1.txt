[11-Jun-18 05:12 PM] CHMEX#0686

[11-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[12-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Mylo#8306

Adaptive cruise control that nearly drives itself

[12-Jun-18 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Gives you some comfort in being able to check whatever, usually just listen to podcasts or whatever though

[12-Jun-18 03:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Better not to be too distracted 😄

Komodo Dragon coffee at Starbucks this morning.

[13-Jun-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that BTC selloff was pretty good, but i think we need a bigger panic sell to end the bull

[13-Jun-18 12:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't smell enough desperation yet, many say the bottom is 3k/btc

[13-Jun-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
then we need to get to $2K

[13-Jun-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
usually above the previous cycle's high which would be $1400 or so

[13-Jun-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-Jun-18 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> *Thus one unintended and welcome consequence of these attacks will likely be the greater interoperability of different blockchains, as more projects launch tokens on established chains and more networks use each other to validate the integrity of their own blockchains.*
