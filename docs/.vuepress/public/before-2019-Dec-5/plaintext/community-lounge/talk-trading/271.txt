Faketoshi is the extreme figurehead, but all bills are paid by Calvin Ayre. It seems he saved his ass from bankruptcy in exchange for playing the fake Satoshi

[13-Nov-18 09:13 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Vin Armani theory is that Calvin is an irrational actor, a gambling industry billionaire that enjoys taking control of Bch like it was a poker game. But the real motives are anyone guess...

[13-Nov-18 09:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the lessons from all this will be interesting

New tokens include Mossland (MOC), Pundi X (NPXS), Zilliqa (ZIL), MediBloc (MEDX), and Simple Token (OST). Look for a steady drumbeat of new tokens for the Bittrex International platform based on Bittrex International‚Äôs streamlined token listing process.
