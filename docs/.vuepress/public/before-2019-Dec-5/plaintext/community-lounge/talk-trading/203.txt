@Geocold51 again thanks for showing up, if you hang around you may notice we‚Äôre pretty much on the leading edge of crypto tech

[14-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You‚Äôll always be welcome here

[14-Oct-18 12:43 AM] PTYX#6840
I guess a 51% attack could be considered a hack and only ethical if the attacker has permission from the victim. that's probably why you got shut down.

[14-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
By me at least :abusedsmily:

[14-Oct-18 12:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúEthical‚Äù it‚Äôs a cold brutal world, protect yourself or die

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] 0x03#8822
it may also help to be prepared enough to NOT leak IPs to the world

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shit happens

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
Eh

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nobody did anything with that

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
sent a few get req

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
s

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
I did set a local DNS record in my /etc/hosts

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
for logging in and protecitng my IPs then

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[14-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
But slipped up with the nicehash page

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@CHMEX

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Alright

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] 0x03#8822
wait a second. first you did show your console log window which gave off your pools IP address, shortly whichafter your pools webinterface didnt work

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Deleted User

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] 0x03#8822
THEN you went on some strange website to get info about the IP that sent HTTP to your stratum port

[14-Oct-18 12:46 AM] 0x03#8822
which revealed your location btw

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
nope

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] 0x03#8822
...instead of just typing `whois`

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
oh yes

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
I mean

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Geocold51 DM me if you want to run off, I don‚Äôt expect you will though

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm not really trying to be anonymous

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
you leaked your real IP

[14-Oct-18 12:47 AM] 0x03#8822
you're not trying to be smart either

[14-Oct-18 12:48 AM] 0x03#8822
ü§£

[14-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm in a university

[14-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Geocold51#6462
we have a fat old pipe

[14-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Geocold51#6462
go for it

[14-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Geocold51#6462
idc

[14-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Alright#0419
going to do another stream?

[14-Oct-18 12:50 AM] 0x03#8822
please

[14-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Geocold51#6462
Yes

[14-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Geocold51#6462
I was so close, it was a lil sad

[14-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Geocold51#6462
I had a longer chain

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Geocold51#6462
Had a transaction in that chain

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
you need to make sure you send the right UTXO on both chains

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
wouldn't recommend using sendtoaddress unless there's only a single UTXO in the wallet

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] 0x03#8822
is that like before when people in the stream.me chat hinted him on what to do next?

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] 0x03#8822
:trollface:

[14-Oct-18 12:51 AM] Geocold51#6462
There is only a single wallet

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
Waht did they hint me to do?

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
I wasn't reading chat

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
well

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
i mean ofc a keypool of 100

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
but

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Geocold51#6462
Only one with funds

[14-Oct-18 12:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
At least you caught my Pirate ($ARRR) offer :trollface:

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
my point is that you need to verify that you're spending the same UTXO on both chains

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
Yes

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm aware

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
That's why I checked transactions to the wallet

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
also at the beginning you said, something like it matters which one happens first

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
to check that there was only one address with funds

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
what?

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
No I didn't

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] 0x03#8822
you did

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c wake up

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Geocold51#6462
you need to send the one on the private chain first

[14-Oct-18 12:53 AM] Alright#0419
no doesn't matter

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] 0x03#8822
üçø

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Alright#0419
seems like it would, but it doesn't

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Geocold51#6462
ohhh

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Geocold51#6462
sure

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] PTYX#6840
I think we were all just expecting something a little more professional.

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Geocold51#6462
why?

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Alright#0419
lol give him a break

[14-Oct-18 12:54 AM] Alright#0419
üòÇ

[14-Oct-18 12:55 AM] Alright#0419
did you remove the `is not connected` prints from the daemon before compiling?

[14-Oct-18 12:55 AM] Alright#0419
or do you just let the stratum get spammed with those prints

[14-Oct-18 12:55 AM] Geocold51#6462
The fuck do I care if it does?

[14-Oct-18 12:55 AM] Geocold51#6462
I care if it works

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] 0x03#8822
mate

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm using the coin for an hour or so

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
chill man :/

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] 0x03#8822
3 hours into your so called 'attack' and all you managed was to get a NH-order up against BTCP

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] 0x03#8822
:trollface:

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nah

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
not trying to troll you or anything üòï

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] 0x03#8822
hard af

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
I had an offline chain with a conflicitng transactio

[14-Oct-18 12:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
and

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
a higher block height

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
did you broadcast it?

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
yup

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
oh

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
no

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
the transaction

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nah, the stream died right then

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
Was about to

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Alright#0419
no the longer chain

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
