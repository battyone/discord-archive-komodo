OK, enjoying the rest of my Friday afternoon sitting my fat ass in front of the 📺 with my wife
Anyone needing 10k-45k PIRATE at 0.095 (or whatever the highest current selling price is) DM me and I'll check in every hr or so

[28-Sep-18 09:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm considering this as possible but low probability scenario where before stock market crash whales with good connections switch to BTC / alts and to take good position they could make some good FUD. Then they would initialize some exit pumpts as after stock market collapse crypto will follow sooner or later, but if someone with power and connection used it properly he could exit well from stock , move through crypto / BTC and make 10x or so before the long comming crisis that will last some years...

[28-Sep-18 09:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
low probability as many factors must meet and in reality some events happen chaotically / nobody controll 100%

[28-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
What happens hypothetically to people who get caught by police and have crypto? Asking for a mate 😂 (Australia)

[28-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is the crypto taken and considered illegally made money?

[28-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or only if there is a direct link between crypto / crime are they allowed to take it?

[28-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just saw the news too some guy got done for 500k crypto and darknetmarkets, but if they weren’t on the dnm would their crypto have been taken too?

[28-Sep-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Is the crypto taken and considered illegally made money?`
Only if you carry your privkey around with you and/or give them your SPV passphrase

[28-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know for aus they have some stupid law where you gotta give up the password for a blackberry or face 10 years jail or someshit like that

[28-Sep-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they can't take what they have no access to

[28-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Would it be similar?

[28-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
10 years jail or keep crypto 🤔🤔🤔

[28-Sep-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you really want to have fun, literally, use a passphrase like "Go fek yourself in the arse officer"
Then when they try to say you didn't comply, you show the judge that you factually did 😉

@Deleted User  how will they prove it's yours? your gf could install some app on your telephone, or you could give your telephone to your kids to play some games, so you can tell the police you dont know wht were they doing and how you really got it

[28-Sep-18 09:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
btw how crypto can be illagal? is it illegal anywhere ?

[28-Sep-18 09:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
why?

[28-Sep-18 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`btw how crypto can be illagal?`
Same way there's a movement to ban "unwashed" poppy seeds; spread enough propaganda....

[28-Sep-18 09:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to make sth illegal even dumb people need to pay for that (with their time and effort to prepare new law) and it's resonable to assume they should have some reason to put such effort

[28-Sep-18 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`resonable to assume ` A phrase that can never be used in any conversation concerning lawmakers

[28-Sep-18 09:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well in some countries poppy seed were popular drug 20 years ago, now you can get it from a doctor

[28-Sep-18 09:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

Wait until you're friends with one and he and his buddies think it's a "fun idea" to beat on your door at 2 am in riot gear
