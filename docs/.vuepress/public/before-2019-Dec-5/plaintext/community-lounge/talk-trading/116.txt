so my guess whales are not manipulating BTC price, more chance exchanges or cmc could do that succesfully

how hard ?

[27-Aug-18 11:24 AM] jorian#4555
If it rockets, bear market will last longer. I'd rather see sharp dip and utter fear + capitulation

Why exactly are people so anti-komodo in those places?

own kid is always beautiful than others.

[27-Aug-18 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are few ppl who open mind to innovation.

[27-Aug-18 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what you witness is usual mass on reddit.

@Hollowman9000 "That comment is missing"

[27-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably karma requirements

[27-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Stupid bullshit

[27-Aug-18 12:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes you must have at least 100 karma

[27-Aug-18 01:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
@grewalsatinder did you just say that crypto enthusiasts dont have open minds to innovation?  Its gotta be the most open minded subset of humanity.

[27-Aug-18 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm saying all people are not same.

[27-Aug-18 01:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if someone has a bag of something, and hodled for long, they find it hard to listen against it.

[27-Aug-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
since many projects eventually hope to achieve some subset of what KMD has or is currently testing, then it seems dangerous to even talk about KMD

BTC and ETH.
such crowd is more than others.

[27-Aug-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and KMD is not only doing what both these do, but even more others.

[27-Aug-18 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the algo's on internet are made they way that the more commented, liked, viewed things gets more attention.
more controversial stuff gets more hits.

[27-Aug-18 01:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if only single thing, that gets downvotes.

[27-Aug-18 01:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you post 4 coins comparing it's merits, demerits, that might survive downvotes

[27-Aug-18 01:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
reddit, youtube, twitter, facebook, linkedin.... almost every social media, is manipulative. thanks to these algos.

[27-Aug-18 01:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

1/ Plenty of coins & ICOs are now down -90%. Hopefully the people who'll never be receptive the following commentary have left crypto twitter by now, but they'll surely be back for the next bull run. Making this thread to use as a reminder for when the idiocy returns üëá
