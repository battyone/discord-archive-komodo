i honestly thought alts would take their own path after the end of 2017 events

[08-Sep-18 06:20 PM] snowdamn#2414
i was wrong, obviously

[08-Sep-18 06:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
what got me the most optimistic that alts were on their own was the late pump early-2018 of XRP

[08-Sep-18 06:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
which was after BTC had already dumped a lot

[08-Sep-18 06:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
