[19-Jun-19 10:24 PM] Tek#5253
i forgot the name üò¶

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Markus#5464
KMD should get a pump from this point unless btc decides to go to moon

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Tek#5253
i agre

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Markus#5464
KMD retraced to 0.768 fib point

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Markus#5464
16,4 ish

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Tek#5253
whats the next level down?

[19-Jun-19 10:35 PM] Tek#5253
14k ish?

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Markus#5464
didnt check that far

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Tek#5253
if btc pulls a moon past 10k i really think kmd will tank to 14k

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Markus#5464
very possible

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Markus#5464
well btc might keep pumping until 13.5k

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Tek#5253
I bought back half my stack

[19-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Markus#5464
13.5k is 0,618 fib from ATH

[19-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Tek#5253
I have orders in all ranges down from here to 13k

[19-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Markus#5464
problem for me is i cant keep kmd for long cause i know it will dump

[19-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Tek#5253
lmao yeah I had to learn this

[19-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Tek#5253
holding kmd is not a good idea ( for now )

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Markus#5464
i always traded it and took profits whenever i saw opportunities

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Tek#5253
i lost quite some sats holding kmd. did go up in usd tho..

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Markus#5464
it does not seem to keep having a strong upwards trend

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Markus#5464
pretty sad

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Tek#5253
you could go as far as to say that without whalebro it wouldn't even have bounced back

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Tek#5253
at all

[19-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Tek#5253
he drove all the recent increases

[19-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Markus#5464
it would of been nice if the pump from 16k up to 29k held atleast 26k and then slowly started going upwards

[19-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Markus#5464
this dump to below 20k was bad

[19-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Tek#5253
yea

[19-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Tek#5253
new exchange next month tho

[19-Jun-19 10:40 PM] Tek#5253
kmd should maybe try to get itself listed at more places

[19-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Tek#5253
it doesn't have a lot of markets at all

[19-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Markus#5464
too many shitty exchanges tho

[19-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Tek#5253
shit like LTC pumps hard bc you can get it everywhere

[19-Jun-19 10:41 PM] Tek#5253
hell TRX is probably gonna pump hard cause you can get iit everywhere

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
TRX pumps cause its used in 1 billion gambling smart contracts

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
if you check out markets, it also has one of the most market pairs

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
on binanec for example

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
it even has xrp/trx pair

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Markus#5464
KMD really need a USD pair, thats why it is so low also

[19-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Tek#5253
trx has 8 pairs on binacne!

[19-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Markus#5464
need USDT and USDC pair

[19-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
just hoping kmd can stay in the top 100

[19-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Markus#5464

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
I think trx is gonna make a massive moon

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
everyone thinks its shit

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
but it does have wide market coverage

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Markus#5464
big community behind it

[19-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
yeah.

[19-Jun-19 10:45 PM] Markus#5464
did RFox start operating?

[19-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Tek#5253
seems like it was a btc fake out

[19-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Markus#5464
wait for it

[19-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Markus#5464
i think it will go to 9700

[19-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Markus#5464
then retrace for abit

[19-Jun-19 10:47 PM] Tek#5253
shit man

[19-Jun-19 10:47 PM] Tek#5253
i can see kmd tanking past  14k actually

[19-Jun-19 10:47 PM] Tek#5253
it happened to many other assets

[19-Jun-19 10:48 PM] Tek#5253
they all found new lows recently

[19-Jun-19 10:48 PM] Markus#5464
might also just go to 9500 and then we will see if it break the upper roof
