somethings seems strange with that data. how could volumes have dropped 95% between jan and feb 2017?

[26-Nov-18 10:02 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Came from here - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e&t=b

[26-Nov-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is accurate, something very strange happened feb 2017

[26-Nov-18 10:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I wonder if its anything to do with the korean trading not being included?

[26-Nov-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if the data set has two different data sources, it cant be used to compare different time periods

[26-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought korea volume stopped being included when the KRW premium was getting too big?

[26-Nov-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless the entire dataset needs to be the same, ie. with/without korea volumes (or exchanges without commissions)

[26-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Malti#3948
I read something about Holochain, what is up with that

market manipulation is possible but also dangerous and requires to have significant amounts to influence markets + really know what you are doing not to shoot yourself

[26-Nov-18 11:47 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and if it is "cartel" = group of people this requires them to be in very good sync (which can be hard)

[26-Nov-18 11:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
conspiracy theories have all common weakness = forgetting about human weaknesses = if there is group of people secretly co-operating sooner or later it will be visible. If there is truelly a cartel then we should see a direct proof soon (some bosses of cartel fighting like in drugs cartel - it happens). If not - it's unlikely.

[26-Nov-18 11:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
IF there is at least slight decentralization (group of people) there is some probability of some of them breaking off, cheating ... which will lead to market decentralizxation also
