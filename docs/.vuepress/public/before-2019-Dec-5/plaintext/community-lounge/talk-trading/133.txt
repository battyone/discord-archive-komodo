[04-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Deleted User#0000

[04-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
so he managed to pickup like 150k today? or did he just lower some of his wall

[04-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
what a patient whale

[04-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Nah he moved it up completely

[04-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Was at 18k then at 20k now 21.5k

[04-Sep-18 10:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The positive thing about this wall going up in price is that it let us know there is not much more people willing to sell at these prices.

[04-Sep-18 10:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not much sellers left

[04-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
indeed

[04-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Good for this whale that @Deleted User didnt win the lottery

[04-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000

[04-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I was market buying off bittrex for the past year

[04-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
i didnt know binance had much higher liquidity

[04-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
may have lost several percentages by doing so

[04-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Market buy a small bit on bittrex, let the arbitrage bot between trex and binance do it's job

[04-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
rinse and repeat

[04-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
binance volume is like 4x bittrex volume nowadays

[04-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
and yes, for the record, if I ever do win one of these goddamn lotteries, lightning link pokies machines, or rsl art unions

[04-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Tek#5253
people keep frontrunning

[04-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Tek#5253
maybe i shud pick up an extra few hundred too incase kmd ever becomes $100 a pop

[04-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
$100 a kmd would put us at 8b marketcap

[04-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I get the itch every day to buy more ðŸ˜¦

[04-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Deleted User#0000

[04-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Tek#5253

[04-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Tek#5253

[04-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[04-Sep-18 11:15 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
How long would it take to crack a 18-22 letter password on komodo wallet with some capitals, some numbers and some symbols

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
hypothetically

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
not sure if i should make it like 50 letters long

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
or if im sweet for now LOL

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I use a 24 word passphrase

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean i doubt im gonna get infected, they find I have komodo, they find my komodo encrypted wallet, then try brute force it

[04-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean litemode

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That should take years and years to crack

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
i used the encrypt option

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shorts getting liquidated

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Called it

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
doesnt encrypt just encrypt it locally on your machine @Deleted User

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
so its not that safe? LOL

[04-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So as long as the hacker doesnt get in posession of your pc you should be good?

[04-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
ah safu

[04-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think?

[04-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to ask in #dev-security

[04-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
medium sized komodo fundazu safu

[04-Sep-18 11:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
to be safe

[04-Sep-18 11:19 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I think so, the private key is the key to access your fund, whether your wallet is encrypted  or not

[04-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah as long as i dont store the priv key on my pc

[04-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
just paper it + encrypt locally

[04-Sep-18 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
