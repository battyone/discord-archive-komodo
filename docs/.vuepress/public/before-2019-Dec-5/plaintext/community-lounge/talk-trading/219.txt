Feel like an ugly chick on instagram

[16-Oct-18 05:53 PM] cascrypto#8206
go to the safespace the puppie are waiting for you to give support

[16-Oct-18 05:53 PM] BlockTech#6895
the üê≥ is playing with 20 BTC it's interesting to look at for a noob like me ^^.

[16-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Lumbi#8378
lots of BTC whales out there Japan side.

[16-Oct-18 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
2 million buy wall gone?

[16-Oct-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
lowered

[16-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
He is playing this market so hard. Wouldn't surprise me if some of those small buy orders between 0.1 - 0.2 btc is his. Place the large wall up high while also placing those smaller buy orders under it, lower wall and watch the bots sell into them. Rinse and repeat.

[16-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That or he is selling and playing everyone a fool. Kind of hard to tell except for the wall is slowly being eaten and he hasn't stopped.

[16-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jorian#4555
wall now at 17k

[16-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jorian#4555
also a couple of miniwalls at 18k

[16-Oct-18 09:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Kitchen Table they seem to be acting in a way to draw in seller/seller bots

[16-Oct-18 09:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also whilst making sure not to go above 20k which is the 20sma

[16-Oct-18 09:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
By going from 19k to 17k, eventually the price would go down then it seems he bought up the asks to 19k by market buying.

[16-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if there is someone to marketbuy it above 20k?

[16-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wouldnt that trigger the bots in thinking it‚Äôs a breakout?

[16-Oct-18 09:30 PM] Hermes#6934
maybe he wants to buy some Pirate :pirate:

[16-Oct-18 09:31 PM] Vertigo#0439
Is pump all done?

[16-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nah we are still well above prices of the weekend üòÉ

[16-Oct-18 10:13 PM] crumb#2550
what is this pump talk nonsense. it was just a minor upside blimp. nothing to really write home about.

[16-Oct-18 10:13 PM] crumb#2550
don't get carried away too easily

[16-Oct-18 11:10 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
pumpn't & dumpn't

[16-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Vertigo#0439
Ok so I'm 50/50 DGB And KMD will it be dumb to go 100% Kmd?

[16-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Vertigo#0439
Everything says diversify

[16-Oct-18 11:57 PM] jspook16#3059
If you want to go pseudo all-in, kmd verus pirate. CC implementation is going fast and ideas are flowing. Verus has POS solutions and pirate is, well it's pirate.

[17-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Vertigo#0439
Noon here what is pirate?

[17-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Vertigo#0439
Noob"

[17-Oct-18 12:12 AM] Vertigo#0439
Asset chain just found it

[17-Oct-18 12:26 AM] Llama#1330

doh looks like our friend is gone üò¶

[17-Oct-18 12:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe waiting for the prices to go back to buy back up

[17-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Vertigo#0439
Me?

[17-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Llama#1330
there was someone with a 350 BTC buy wall on komodo

[17-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh

[17-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Vertigo#0439
Damn

[17-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Vertigo#0439
Not me for sure

[17-Oct-18 12:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What is the mining cost of PIRATE right now if i were to rent hash/day?

[17-Oct-18 12:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ got any ideas?

[17-Oct-18 01:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Whale is back. Probably went out for lunch haha

[17-Oct-18 01:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Seems to have split bids now

[17-Oct-18 01:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
with the main lot at 17k

[17-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jspook16#3059
Geez 1.42M ..

[17-Oct-18 05:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah back at 19k

[17-Oct-18 05:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone get your hopium ready

[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Mark81#4505
Whale is just playing.

[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Mark81#4505
He doesnt want to drive price up while accumulating.

[17-Oct-18 06:45 AM] Keytothegate#8453
So he wants to actually accumulate and not manipulate, which is good.

[17-Oct-18 06:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
They are driving volume up quite a bit. nothing wrong with that.

[17-Oct-18 06:55 AM] Mark81#4505
First volume up! After that break sma20 on weekly chart. After that moon hard! All according TA!

[17-Oct-18 07:02 AM] jorian#4555
TA is so useless ~~in this low volume market~~

[17-Oct-18 07:03 AM] jorian#4555
1 whale messes up all TA

[17-Oct-18 07:03 AM] dokrates#8987
move up and down and remove his big wall is smart, because forces weaks to sell

[17-Oct-18 07:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well whale has purchased about 500,000KMD in the last 3 days

[17-Oct-18 07:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Wants another 1.3M

[17-Oct-18 07:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jorian TA is useless in all markets. If it did work everyone would be rich and someone will counter trade it

[17-Oct-18 07:08 AM] jorian#4555
it's a self fulfilling prophecy, yes. but useless? if you know how to play it, not really

[17-Oct-18 07:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It gives you a indication of what the whales want you to see.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[17-Oct-18 07:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If say TA tells you everything is indicating it will go up, if there is a whale with deep enough wallets he can manipulate it to get to that point before dumping on everyone

[17-Oct-18 07:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is all a numbers game and whatever the whales want, they get. We are all just along for the ride.

[17-Oct-18 07:10 AM] jorian#4555
i guess you're right

[17-Oct-18 07:11 AM] dokrates#8987
@hyperDEX I don't think whale purchased only 500.000 maybe bought more when he removed and put again the wall

[17-Oct-18 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Last i saw he had 260BTC, meaning he spent 90

[17-Oct-18 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
90/0.00018ish is just under 500k

[17-Oct-18 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
now it's gone

[17-Oct-18 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it was gone for most of the day too.

[17-Oct-18 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a new strategy, get the bots to dump market lower, put up asks then BAM he eats them all

[17-Oct-18 07:14 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, but it doesn't mean he purchased only that amount

[17-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Mark81#4505
Now whale wants price come down and after that eat all up to 19000sat

[17-Oct-18 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Otherwise he is not getting enough sellers and seems the bots may have exhausted their inventory

[17-Oct-18 07:15 AM] dokrates#8987
yes

[17-Oct-18 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@dokrates it may not but he has been putting up the same amount time and time again, i would tend to believe he funded his account with 350 for this purpose

[17-Oct-18 07:15 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, but could have more accounts even bots

[17-Oct-18 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure, but if he did he wouldnt put up a 350BTC wall to be sold into

[17-Oct-18 07:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He could just buy it at 16k but there is little inventory

[17-Oct-18 07:16 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, but put always 350btc even buying a lot. Will mean to everybody hold stronger

[17-Oct-18 07:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not the bots that are forcing the price down

[17-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Mark81#4505
I think he has bots in use when driving price down. All those 0.1kmd sells comes from whale.

[17-Oct-18 07:16 AM] dokrates#8987
@Mark81 yes

[17-Oct-18 07:17 AM] dokrates#8987
i think he has also bots, the wall to drive price up and down, and also more btcs to accumulate

[17-Oct-18 07:17 AM] dokrates#8987
otherwise its nonsense to put 1.5 millions to buy

[17-Oct-18 07:17 AM] dokrates#8987
what expects? someone selling 1.5 millions? XD

[17-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Mark81#4505
Yeah...
