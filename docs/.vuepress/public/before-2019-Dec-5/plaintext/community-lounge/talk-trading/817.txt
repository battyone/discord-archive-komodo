3% of coins on market, with 7k USD in volume +70%

[22-Jun-19 11:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
182M market cap now is that better than KMD?

[22-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
:troll_lol:

[22-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
Possible that u can buy 100k kmd at 12k

[22-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
try putting up such order on binance

[22-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
might get filled who knows 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Flint#6435
very strong oversold

[22-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
btc going for that 11k now

[22-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
final push

[22-Jun-19 12:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[22-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464

[22-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
1 cent rejected :troll_lol:

[22-Jun-19 12:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
wake me up at $12k usd

[22-Jun-19 12:09 PM] kaks#6612
11k

[22-Jun-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX if you are night owl like me. may be won't need to 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is depressing watching KMD bleed, will go to bed and probably wake up to sub 10k sat 😛

[22-Jun-19 12:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Better use of time to work on CHIPS and get that ready to be used

[22-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Flint#6435
long ago we did not fall

[22-Jun-19 12:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
huh?

[22-Jun-19 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX here's a trick to cheer you up:
- Make a portfolio excel,
- total your total portfolio value in BTC
- also total your portfolio value in KMD
Be happy what you see there 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes its starting to hurt im down  over 2btc 😏

[22-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Flint#6435
@hyperDEX  "Buy when the streets are bleeding......."😉

[22-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Markus#5464
i thought i caught bottom buying 14k and 15k finds out 2 days later that was not it 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Flint out of BTC to buy 😃

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
convert your shitty coins to KMD then 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's possible

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If it continues this way even 10k isnt the bottom

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or whatever, not an investment advice 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Na im good, i know how these games are played, just need to fast forward till when we pump

[22-Jun-19 12:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont have many other coins basically KMD is my bag 😃

[22-Jun-19 12:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
All or nothing kind of bet

[22-Jun-19 12:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
:troll_thuglife:

[22-Jun-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's dangerous game 🙂

[22-Jun-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I like to diversify risks

[22-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Flint#6435
@hyperDEX  after such dumps a green pamp will always follow! But bitcoin volumes start to fall and bitcoins will start flowing back to KMD - we have already done this!)

[22-Jun-19 12:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will take some actual profit this time around and use it for the next bear

@Flint  im not worried at all, i have been here for many years, i have good hodl skills

[22-Jun-19 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
11139.0

[22-Jun-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
these ups and downs are really brutal I see 😄

[22-Jun-19 12:18 PM] Markus#5464
watch bitfinex getting a cease and desist and bitcoin falling like a stone

[22-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Flint#6435
we should not forget that HODL on kpmodo gives us 5% of annual profits - this partly covers such falls in the long term!

[22-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Alexfrog#1338
5% more coins when they go down 50% doesnt help much

[22-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Flint#6435
I would be happy to once again go to the price of $ 3500 But if you live in the real world and not the world of dreams, then lower than $ 6000 we are unlikely to fall! And soon we will go to the $ 9k correction!

[22-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Flint#6435
@Alexfrog  from now were not going to fall by 50%! Only if we also grow quickly by 50% - then it is possible! But at least $ 2 Komodo will reach in the foreseeable future - most likely this year! LEAST! The komodo-ecosystem is very good so that this does not happen - it will happen!

[22-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Kmd is bleeding indeed

[22-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Alexfrog#1338
too late though, i already lost 50% 😛

[22-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380
11 k sats who would thought we could see this price in sats

[22-Jun-19 12:28 PM] dxer666#8963
buy kmd under 1$

[22-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s very unlikely that it will go under 1$

[22-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Because of btc

[22-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Flint#6435
I do not understand who sells such large orders in orders at such a low price  - 0.0001181btc ??? What did they buy then if they sell so low?

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD was $1.60 at btc like 8k  BTC goes up by 3k and KMD drops 30 cents, makes no sense

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Idk you tell me

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s because of dollar value

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Alexfrog#1338
hacker dumping maybe, who knows

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Btc goes up in dollar value so goes kmd but it drops in sats value

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Markus#5464
if u look at binance orderbook u can see that there is someone pushing price down and that is triggering bots to sell

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Might be the hacker indeed

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Who knows

[22-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Markus#5464
2 days ago there was a 12k sell order and 1-2k orders below it

[22-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Markus#5464
and they kept lowering price minute by minute

[22-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Markus#5464
and bots kept triggering stop losses

[22-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Flint#6435
14 000kmd for 11k satoshi - is it a mad bot or something?))

[22-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Flint#6435
someone wants to buy at the very minimum of coins - I do not see another explanation for such a dump

[22-Jun-19 12:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
price only hurts if you planned to just sell today, if not - not a problem for today 😛

{Reactions}
👌 

[22-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Alexfrog#1338
no it hurts no matter what

[22-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Must be

[22-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It hurts the eyes ahah

[22-Jun-19 12:36 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
This is super disheartening

[22-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Flint#6435
but in spite of all bots and dumpers I continue to buy KMD! because I dreamed of returning the price to 14k satoshi when the price was 28k satoshi - and now the price is 11k satoshi and a sin not to buy - I will buy until the dump ends!

[22-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Flint#6435
finally I saw green color growth at least on the 15 minute timeframe - my eyes are happy against the background of such pain! 😀

[22-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hope* we had the worst for now

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Will see we never know

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
happy who got BTC right now and can afford some KMD

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Markus#5464
it all depend on bitcoin....if it will keep mooning well then see u at 5k sats

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Flint#6435
30 minute timeframe sales and buyers caught up with the binance and buyers seem to start bouncing off the bottom - for the time being, quite uncertainly - but I don’t think that we will fall to 10k Satoshi! Probably the bottom we groped!

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed profits from btc flowing into kmd would be great

[22-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
But if btc keeps going up kmd will bleed more

[22-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Definitely

[22-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Flint#6435
@Buddz1993  do you think bitcoin will go beyond 11k?

[22-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Markus#5464
on my own indicator i made for tradingview komodo have never been this oversold ever since it was listed on Binance

[22-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Flint#6435
Profit taking is already starting! maximum false breakdown to 11600k to shave longists

[22-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Well you never know

[22-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Flint#6435
but someone still presses the price down - wants to panic sales and further - this is an occasion to think about who needs it - probably to those who want to buy this way at the bottom of what we have not seen and then this someone knows that the price will start to go up sharply!

[22-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
The market sentiment can change  very quickly

[22-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Flint#6435
I am glad that komodo doesnt need much growth back - I expect that after btcoin correction - these same bitcoins will return to komodo

[22-Jun-19 12:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD is #6 lossing price at the moment, but among those loosing value one thing is different - smaller volume on dumpage

you can see it clearly since it started volumes are lower then on growth

[22-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Markus#5464
thats big difference

[22-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Flint#6435
few buyers now - but the price rebounded from the bottom a bit

[22-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Flint#6435
maybe soon someone will manage to boast for the last time that he bought KMD at 11k satoshi!) At least I took a chance and will soon recognize this lottery!))
