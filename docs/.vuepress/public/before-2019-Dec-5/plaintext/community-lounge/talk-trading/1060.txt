Sound on

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you say that article, right?

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this is just the third tier variant

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Markus#5464
saw that one 😄

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
many exchanges have built in deals with market makers

[10-Aug-19 03:39 PM] Caglio#3337
happy vitalik

[10-Aug-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but some wallstreet types have setup shop in crypto to make giant killings by manipulating prices, to get the TA patterns as all the TA believers like to see, then when there is enough liquidity to sell their upfronted stake...

[10-Aug-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you know the rest. BTT seems a good example

[10-Aug-19 03:41 PM] Markus#5464
Whales definitely made a killing on BTT

[10-Aug-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the market maker made the most, other than the insiders

[10-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Markus#5464
Not sure how sats value of BTT will ever rise, considering they have regular airdrops like every month or so?

[10-Aug-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is what is really going on with some (not all) coins

[10-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
keep this in mind as you assess how KMD is doing

[10-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
with all altcoins sharing 30% of crypto marketcap, all prices are compressed

[10-Aug-19 03:44 PM] Markus#5464
Well im not worried at all when it comes to KMD, sure its a rough time to see this prices but if u check overall market then were atleast not performing the worst  i would say somewhere in the middle

[10-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
a few BTC can push KMD price in either direction, it is more volatile than most the other top coins

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Imagine when Kmd becomes a multi million dollar asset to hold , if you can imagine that you can also thank me later

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
😄

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
what do i get to do to you if it keeps going down?  😉

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
Ofc it can go down but why think short term

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
think a few years ahead

[10-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Well as JL said blame the marketmakers

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Andersen#8337
Excellent explanation of the current market situation. Thanks to JL777. It's all better to read  @coingirl87   :abusedsmily:

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but now in all seriousness

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Flint#6435
and if bitcoin continues its volatile growth up to $ 20,000 right up to halving, then we will also fall all this time

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
we can go down even further but you have to think long term exactly,

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is up to BTC now

[10-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
DCA will protect to a large degree from this type of volatility

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
when btc was at his peak the btc dominance was like what

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
60 %?

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Markus#5464
more

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
85%

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] Markus#5464
peak u mean with now or last bull cycle?

[10-Aug-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
80% and higher, it was madness

[10-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
when btc reached its peak , kmd was trading at 4,67 $

[10-Aug-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it dropped from 85% to 40% in 3 months, between march and june of 2018

[10-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so value in usd dollars will most likely be completly different from now

[10-Aug-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but the ATL BTC dominance was 80% at the time

[10-Aug-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
with stable coins and ETH and other large caps it is hard to see it getting back to 85%, the market is different this cycle

[10-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yea exactly

[10-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I doubt it will go further than 70-75%

[10-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
will see.

[10-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
each extra % will become harder and harder to achieve

[10-Aug-19 03:51 PM] Markus#5464
btc dominance atm 70,79% according to tradingview

[10-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
with ETH at multiyear lows, we are still in BTC dominance rising

[10-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the first to recover will be the large alts like ETH, XRP

[10-Aug-19 03:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
shows 69.4 % in CMC

[10-Aug-19 03:53 PM] Markus#5464
i think tradingview have less "shit coins" listed thats why higher %

[10-Aug-19 03:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
there you go

[10-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is actually higher

[10-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
adjust by all the stablecoins

[10-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
probably goes up another few percent

[10-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Andersen#8337
73  %          https://coinlib.io/global-crypto-charts

[10-Aug-19 04:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@jl777c so how to beat the marketmakers while trading , find manipulated coin and counter trade the obvious chart patterns ???

[10-Aug-19 04:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
And who says kmd doesn't have market makers , maybe not employed by you guys but private ones it's possible

[10-Aug-19 04:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Looking at whalebro

[10-Aug-19 04:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
😂

[10-Aug-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the ones i talk about need significant percentage of coinsupply, a private one wouldnt have anywhere near the coins needed

[10-Aug-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
these coins will follow the standard TA pattern, until there is enough fomo to liquidate the holdings at nice profits

[10-Aug-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no way to know when they will stop the TA matching

[10-Aug-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
they have 20 years of trained neural nets and supercomputers that know how to squeeze as much out of the normal traders as possible

[10-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Markus#5464
how do u know all of this JL?

[10-Aug-19 04:30 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx nice info

[10-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why vast majority of traders lose money and hodl being a decent strategy, though i think a DCA to acquire coins and DCA to divest is a better way than hodl till it doubles and selling half

[10-Aug-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i happen to know a lot of things

😎 

[10-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Markus#5464
So what is your take on the current market situation?

[10-Aug-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
90%+ depends on BTC dominance

[10-Aug-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the rest doesnt really matter until it stops going up like an escalator

[10-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Markus#5464
Are they doing this on purpose to then buy up the cheap alts or what is the reason behind all of this

[10-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Markus#5464
this sites btc dominance is same as tradingview

[10-Aug-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
these sort of marketmakers take little to no risk, but if they do their job (manipulating the TA up and up to get the volumes), they can make a killing

[10-Aug-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
what other reason do they need?

[10-Aug-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
they also need cheap inventory as the cheaper their inventory, the more profits they make, so of course they push the prices down when they can

[10-Aug-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the way the crypto prices move is just not logical at all

[10-Aug-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
why are there fiat pegs for many coins that dont have any large fiat gateways?

[10-Aug-19 04:37 PM] Markus#5464
Who are the ppl behind marketmaking?

[10-Aug-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an artificial justification for pushing the price lower. probably this BTC dominance surge made them change their gameplan to a create despair and buy at ATL

[10-Aug-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some from former wall street tradings, many started with crypto, a lot based in china

[10-Aug-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but not all in china, this "take advantage of the normal traders" is a global pastime

[10-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
The btc drop from 6k to 3k was this also made by those ppl?

[10-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Neko#5830
and normal traders are panicking and selling at ATL, I see some of them of this channel, they are also loud

[10-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Caglio#3337
