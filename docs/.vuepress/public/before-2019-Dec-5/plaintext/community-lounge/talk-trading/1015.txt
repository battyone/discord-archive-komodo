@Tek  itâ€™s available via 2000+ ATMs and can use vouchers available at 200k + locations to redeem for Komodo .   Coinpayments has hundreds of stores you can use kmd at

[05-Aug-19 06:14 PM] Tek#5253
i have not seen an atm that sells kmd

[05-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
and theres only a few exchange markets for kmd

[05-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
no retailer accepts kmd

[05-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
as payment

[05-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253
they accept BCH, DASH , I was going to say BTC but they usually don't

[05-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Aug-19 06:17 PM] Lanii#8302
Obviously if you never done TA it its hard at first but give it some time ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Aug-19 06:17 PM] phm87#7395

[05-Aug-19 06:18 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Tek#5253

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Markus#5464
u painted a curve below 9k then up

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
I got filled

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
not the second as I suggested the pattern

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Tek#5253
there's shops that have actual "BCH / DASH  accepted here " stickers and you can go in and pay them directly.

[05-Aug-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
the curve is SL

[05-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Tek#5253
without any third party processor

[05-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Tek#5253
in between

[05-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Tek#5253
kmd isn't a payment coin anyway so i don't care about htis

[05-Aug-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302

[05-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Markus#5464
ye i know

[05-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
not absolute patterns as in wedges, flags or so

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
All my curves on my charts are possible scenarios that I play

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
I short tops and buy bottoms, I try to at least

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Mark81#4505
Did anyone notice that waves is among those 8 digital assets that are explored to be added to coinbase?

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
I neveer go full bias in one direction

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Tek#5253
Eh I already have eonugh Proof of stake coins

[05-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Tek#5253
proof of stake sucks

[05-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Tek#5253
Proof of stake === you can only buy in and only howmuch you have matters. Rich get richer Fiat 2.0

[05-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Tek#5253
Proof of work === if you can deliver the work you can play.

[05-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii so whats ur prediction from here

[05-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464
up or down

[05-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Tek#5253
up to 40k by EOY obviously

[05-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Mark81#4505
@Tek  same used to work on your savings account and nobody criticised that?

[05-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus I don't really predict I only long proper spot and short proper spots

[05-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Lanii#8302
Since i have a long and it worked out pretty decent

[05-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Lanii#8302
Im only looking for shorts now

[05-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
There is absolutely no reason to long up here

[05-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
so Im looking to chort 12100

[05-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Tek#5253
@Mark81 what do you mean fren?

[05-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
Looking to chort 12070 ish SL around 12200

[05-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Mark81#4505
In bank accounts when we had interest rates.

[05-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
times change my fren.

[05-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Tek#5253
interest rates were still too shitty

[05-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Markus#5464
Bank with interest, sounds like bitconnect :troll_king:

[05-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Mark81#4505
Wait and see negative interest rates to come in town. I think it will happen in Europe first when regular man gets negative interest rate on his/hers bank account.

[05-Aug-19 06:46 PM] jansako#3330
No way, that would be a single term government that introduces that & they know it too!

[05-Aug-19 07:04 PM] digital bullion#8223
International monetary fund is reccomending  "deeply negative" interest rates to all countries who will lend a sympathetic ear. Their paper on the matter reccomends negative 3 - 5 % interest. 

They are projecting a run to cash assets so are also restricting ability to trade large amounts to under $10000 per transaction in Australia, currently the legislation is being drafted and made reality in Australia.

[05-Aug-19 07:08 PM] jansako#3330
Will I get negative interest on any owed taxes then too? Sounds good to me!

[05-Aug-19 07:12 PM] Markus#5464
nah they will make it confusing

[05-Aug-19 07:12 PM] Markus#5464
u will get negative interest

[05-Aug-19 07:12 PM] Markus#5464
but u will pay it back in taxes

[05-Aug-19 07:13 PM] Markus#5464
washing their own money ðŸ˜„

[05-Aug-19 07:14 PM] Caglio#3337
so @Markus how much do we bet ( :

[05-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
u didnt tell me ur bet yet

[05-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Well under 3$

[05-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Caglio#3337
even under 2

[05-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
u gotta tell a number and whoever is closest from todays price ðŸ˜„

[05-Aug-19 07:15 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought I just need to take ur bet that it wont be 3

[05-Aug-19 07:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh

[05-Aug-19 07:16 PM] Markus#5464
we can say todays price is 1$ to make it easy

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but guessing a number sucks ðŸ˜„

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Markus#5464
well idk if it will be 3$ i just said something what could make sense considering current situation

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Markus#5464
so i quess its possible

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean I can say

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Its gonna be 2.97$

[05-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Caglio#3337
and beat you easily

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
cos its not gonna get to 3

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
And I will be closer to anything below

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats why it sucks

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
what if we get a december rally like last year?

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
then u lost

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
You mean 2017 ?

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
2018 had a rally also

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
kmd went up quite alot

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont really remember it rofl

[05-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Caglio#3337
but I doubt it went from 1 to 3

[05-Aug-19 07:19 PM] Caglio#3337
which is three times bigger

[05-Aug-19 07:19 PM] Markus#5464
price was around 16k
