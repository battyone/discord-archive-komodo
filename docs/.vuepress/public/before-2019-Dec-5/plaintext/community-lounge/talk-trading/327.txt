So the solution to VTC attack is to tell exchanges to give different confirmation times depending on size of the tx and nichehash price to double spend it. Not less than 300 confirmations though 😂 😂 😂

[03-Dec-18 11:11 PM] actionslacks#4072

The last words were thst the dev said something along the lines that if vtc dies, he will be happy to know it happened without compromising decentralization

[03-Dec-18 11:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which i said that is kind of irresponsible from him to say but that i respect that he prefers to let it die with "honors"
