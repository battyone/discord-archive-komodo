sorry, i've never seen something hilarious like that

[14-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
he has a lot more than the typical student

[14-Oct-18 08:31 AM] 0x03#8822
if you say so. i've witnessed something different tonight

[14-Oct-18 08:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In the end satinder and siu gave him some info

[14-Oct-18 08:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Alright was constructive as well

[14-Oct-18 08:33 AM] 0x03#8822
i wonder why

[14-Oct-18 08:33 AM] 0x03#8822
especially after he went mad on us

[14-Oct-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
after broadly promising a 51% attack on a coin despite his unability to even setup a pool for it

[14-Oct-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
because he realizes after 9, 10hours his system time is off

[14-Oct-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
james, i dont know

[14-Oct-18 08:34 AM] 0x03#8822
skills?

[14-Oct-18 08:36 AM] jorian#4555
well there's telling him he is noob and there's ranting for hours about how noob he is

[14-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jorian#4555
he asked good questions, but answers got lost

[14-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jorian#4555
don't forget KMD is (as this proves again) quite unknown to the outside world

[14-Oct-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
he seems like someone that could contribute to the community, given a bit of training. not sure lambasting him for hours does any good

[14-Oct-18 08:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
👆 💯

[14-Oct-18 08:40 AM] snowdamn#2414
is it confirmed he's gone?  must have missed it
i'd say he took it well overall and didn't sound like a guy that would not look further into the Komodo tech because of trolling

[14-Oct-18 08:54 AM] 0x03#8822
@Geocold51 they say i was a bit personal with you, sorry about that, i want you to know it was nothing personal at all.

[14-Oct-18 08:55 AM] snowdamn#2414
everything has its place, i wouldn't worry about it 😃

[14-Oct-18 08:56 AM] 0x03#8822
oh well, wanna make sure he's not misunderstanding it

[14-Oct-18 08:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
geocold could go crazy testing attack scenarios with Komodo assetchains, he would be stupid to not take advantage

[14-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
show him a way for scaling test

[14-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😂

[14-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
we need more people for that testing

[14-Oct-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and he can use his skills at right place

[14-Oct-18 09:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make a uni project around that subject if like 😄

[14-Oct-18 10:20 AM] SHossain#0007
You guys shouldn't have attacked him that way. Hollowman invited him here and that makes him our guest.

[14-Oct-18 10:20 AM] SHossain#0007
@Geocold51 don't mind them please.

[14-Oct-18 01:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember people trolling just because he used nano

[14-Oct-18 01:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
come on guys...

[14-Oct-18 01:19 PM] SHossain#0007
i use nano everyday

[14-Oct-18 01:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
me too

[14-Oct-18 01:19 PM] SHossain#0007
can't use vim, i find that hard

[14-Oct-18 01:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
except for large files where nano gets stuck... then i use vim

[14-Oct-18 01:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
anyway, judging and trolling just because of the tools he used kind of make us look like fools

[14-Oct-18 01:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
As kmd community we should have encouraged him and even help him since what we wanted was for him to test our tech. Which had great positive implications if we proved it worked.

I have said this before, but there is a bit of a community relations issue in this discord/community.  A few large, loud personalities dominate the tone of these discussions.  These loud personalities often talk down to people, tell people they are wrong or imply that they are stupid for having the opinions they do.  Its a bad look for new people who come in here, especially because the mods/devs don't really do anything about it, they just shrug as their project's culture is defined (rather negatively) by a small number of KMD Armchair Commandos.

@siu - Chainmakers I agree with your position, but to call a spade a 'spade', I don't see as he was (or even could have been) the one. There may have been things I missed, but from the 40 mins I saw there was no indication of him having any level knowledge of the tech that would rise to the label of "testing".

[14-Oct-18 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't say this in a degrading way, but as a comparison that is visual:
If a 10 year old kicks a building and it doesn't implode, does that make it structurally sound?

[14-Oct-18 02:00 PM] yorklab#7270
Then it should be explained why his approach is not sound without making him look foolish in the process.

[14-Oct-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
let us try to nurture new people in the community and help them learn

[14-Oct-18 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have been in other communities before and abandoned them because of the circle jerking and the unableness to take criticism. Please, lets not become those communities.

the guy took his time to visit our discord, we should have at least give him a good welcome

[14-Oct-18 02:08 PM] SHossain#0007
Exactly.

[14-Oct-18 02:08 PM] SHossain#0007
when i feel i'm not welcome at any place, i stay away.

[14-Oct-18 02:09 PM] SHossain#0007
and those places will never find out how i could contribute

[14-Oct-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, but to be fair...
Coming in with a certain attitude requires a certain level of "thick skin". One can't really expect to "I'm going to blow up your network on a live stream!....Be my friend?"

[14-Oct-18 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that was the whole purpose

[14-Oct-18 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he announced beforehand and as a team we had gotten the notary network ready for the attack

[14-Oct-18 02:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so it was something we were expecting

[14-Oct-18 02:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I did tell him this place was like the bar from star wars

[14-Oct-18 02:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Wretched hive of scum and villainy

[14-Oct-18 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so it was something we were expecting`
True-ish... I may be misinformed, but wasn't dPoW a "last minute" addition (days after he initially announced)?

[14-Oct-18 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no... it was coincidential

[14-Oct-18 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we had added emc2 to the network like a week before the announcement

[14-Oct-18 02:14 PM] SHossain#0007
EMC2 dPoW was added before his announcement

[14-Oct-18 02:15 PM] SHossain#0007
but, EMC2 code wasn't showing the notarization data that time

[14-Oct-18 02:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we did suspect it was an experiment brought up by someone within our community or emc2 community to put our tech to test, but i dont think that was the case anymore

[14-Oct-18 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
once he found out that EMC2 uses Komodo dPoW, he also mentioned it that it may not work and he changed the coin to perform his demonstration

[14-Oct-18 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
emc2 community approached him afterwards to ask him to actually try to attack emc2 anyway so that we could test the tech

[14-Oct-18 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he then agreed to try anyway

[14-Oct-18 02:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Geocold51 you still around?

[14-Oct-18 02:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he might be sleeping.

[14-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From what I saw, both in the vid and on here, it seems as most folks were unaware of all kinds of things and many of us just made assumptions based on x, y, and z info

[14-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Could have been good but trading turned into fucking Perry Mason because certain tards couldn’t let the legal bullshit go

[14-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Yassin#3685
what happen here? Big welcome @Geocold51 :yassinkomodo:

[14-Oct-18 02:19 PM] snowdamn#2414
if geocold has a reason to come back, he will
i doubt yesterday's interaction will prevent him from pursuing things further
abandoning efforts will not be related

[14-Oct-18 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not sure where he is located, but i talked to him like at 2am eastern time

[14-Oct-18 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if he is in the US, he most likely still sleeping.

[14-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Lawwwwwlololll ur going prisonjail dat wiz illegally”

[14-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Awfully NPC

[14-Oct-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn That was kinda my thought, I can't see someone that would do it in the 1st place being shallow enough to be in their feelz

[14-Oct-18 02:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not actually illegal if there was some type of deal between the parties

[14-Oct-18 02:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
at least with emc2 there was communication with the community, not sure about BTCP though

[14-Oct-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, did he do anything to BTCP?

[14-Oct-18 02:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont think he got the feelz actually, just the overall reaction was kind of overly sentimental from our part.

[14-Oct-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not sure, i went to sleep yesterday like at 7pm and woke up at 1am thinking it was 7am of the other day lol

[14-Oct-18 02:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
much needed sleep

[14-Oct-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders what this "sleep" thing is that you folks keep talking about 🤔_

[14-Oct-18 02:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, when he got annoyed he expressed it but, to me, it didn't sound like it was a deal breaker
but i do believe he would have been more interested in details about how it wouldn't work
too bad i stepped out after he delayed the stream the second time, was planning to drop jl777's comments all along 🤓

[14-Oct-18 02:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when i woke up i read everything and tried to do my part, he answered to me and ended up asking for the link to the SuperNET repo and said he would take a look at it. So i dont think its that bad.

[14-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah it was also right before he went to sleep I think as he went pretty much silent after that

[14-Oct-18 02:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@grewalsatinder @siu - Chainmakers and @Alright were giving useful info/insights and he responded interested so I dont think it's all bad 😃

no, but please guys... lets not get sentimental defending our tech

[14-Oct-18 02:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if it works, it should convince on itself.

💯 

[14-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I actually think a highly publicized attack would be usefull/great marketing if proven unsuccesful

[14-Oct-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no tech is 100% perfect, that's a fact

[14-Oct-18 02:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he did had a legitimate doubt about how decentralize or not NN network was and everyone was so into the rambling about im not sure what of his noobness that no one actually took time to answer his questions.

[14-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So tbh we should help people trying to do so

[14-Oct-18 02:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is where i noticed that the community was overly sentimental about all this episode

[14-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In the sense of let them try, let them fail, let's encourage them to fail and do some great marketing about it

[14-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On the other hand if they are trying to be smartasses and not listen to useful info given to them by the community, we shouldn't just roll over either 😃

[14-Oct-18 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, that was the point on this one, but everything went down the drain lol

[14-Oct-18 02:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, but i didnt feel like he was being a smartass

[14-Oct-18 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that is where i noticed that the community was overly sentimental about all this episode`
Do you think it might have been different if the preplanned and slightly known things you mentioned before were known by more folks? Or was it just an overall bashing? (I missed most of the convos)

[14-Oct-18 02:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe we should have announced this publicly yes
