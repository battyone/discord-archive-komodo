weaponising space might be lucrative tho

[19-Jun-18 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lucrative for whom?

[19-Jun-18 12:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

hollywood plants the seed

[19-Jun-18 01:02 PM] RAE#3178
agreed, hopefully that seed is not an egg ... a crab-like alien egg

Build a wall on the ground, and only let through those that defend the wall in orbit.

[19-Jun-18 01:09 PM] RAE#3178
that's one intense citizenship test and would thoroughly weed out the bad actors - gallant space record required üòÉ

Orbital customs officers, to enfore tarrifs on Martian trinkets

Back to trading ... I know this is Verus, but KMD is showing weak atm, touching 31 RSI and well below the 15 day MA.

[19-Jun-18 01:11 PM] RAE#3178
What would you tariff from Mars do you reckon?

[19-Jun-18 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Electric cars, soybeans and whiskey.

[19-Jun-18 01:13 PM] RAE#3178
Wait. Just wait a minute. I'm not on Verus! I'm in KMD ... just realised I've been making an idiot of myself.

[19-Jun-18 01:13 PM] RAE#3178
Wrong channel, wrong planet as well.

KMD is such a convincing buy I overbought

[19-Jun-18 01:14 PM] RAE#3178
Yes KMD is tempting at these levels

[19-Jun-18 01:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this week its beans for breakfast, water for lunch, and swell up for dinner.

[19-Jun-18 01:15 PM] RAE#3178
One day we will all be able to afford chorizo with KMD, but until then we must eat the bean.

[19-Jun-18 01:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
havent bought anything for a couple months, seemed now was a good time

[19-Jun-18 01:18 PM] RAE#3178
Yeah I reckon now is a good time, KMD and BTC levels have been back and forth 3 waves now ... whole market has really between 275 - 291 billion total marketcap.

[19-Jun-18 01:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
chorizo?

[19-Jun-18 01:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the BIS report was the final signal for me

[19-Jun-18 01:18 PM] RAE#3178
Chorizo is a spiced Spanish sausage

[19-Jun-18 01:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

love how they imply it's not worth continuing and remain ignorant of how quick tech adapts

[19-Jun-18 01:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
these secret society dudes are all mr burns. no idea. used to manipulating slowly, plans spanning generations. tech moves quick enough to slip out of their control

"Its as if theyre describing exactly what komodo fixes
... price fluctuations, pow electricity wastage..."
True story: KMD hasn't fluctuated -85% from Dec. 21 and I don't have a $2k USD electric bill...

[19-Jun-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I love Komodo as much or more than the next guy; but, let's not all line up in a circle just yet

cant control market fluctuations. Energy use is relative.

I venture cryptomining collectivley is on par or less than traditional banking

"cant control market fluctuations" that was my point üòú

nice haul

[19-Jun-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Bitpanda is a good start, but until KMD has a retail market or generalized fiat exchanges, we're still tied to the same insane fluctuations of BTC

itll keep influencing the market in general as long as it is dominant. Sick as I am hearing about bcash vs bcoin, Id like to see a rebalance of market share for the benefit of crypto in general

[19-Jun-18 02:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Etc etc. I didnt mean kmd will be the currency of the future, just that komodo fixes most of the problems they were talking about in the article üòÇ

[19-Jun-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
dPoW **adds** electricity

[19-Jun-18 02:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the efficiency gain far outweighs the additional energy consumption

[19-Jun-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that depends on scale; the larger it becomes, the more that is true

[19-Jun-18 02:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well in a sense it can secure another blockchain with bitcoins hashrate, without using all the electricity from mining bitcoin? Recycling?Idk üêß

@Deleted User never forget that the BTC hash is just a now thing; going on @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 's claim, if a more efficient, more secure chain came into the lead then the savings would be exponentially greater

[19-Jun-18 02:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
flexibility to adapt is great advantage for evolving
