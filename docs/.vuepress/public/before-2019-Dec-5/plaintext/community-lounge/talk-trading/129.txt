I can see wannabe whales and newcomers trying to put fake walls and the likes getting absolutely wrecked back to shrimp status

[03-Sep-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there some handbook or guide LOL 🤭

[03-Sep-18 11:04 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
The whale in question was from silk road, so he could've been selling "products" when BTC was <$1

[03-Sep-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously he was 😂 wish I’d ordered a few things back then. The leftover change alone would’ve been worth thousands haha. But I mean the ones who trade on the markets

[03-Sep-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fake walls, manipulation etc

I know you can hustle til you hit whale specs but how does one maintain or grow their whale 😮

It does seem like there is a new giant whale in town. gulping down 300,000+ KMD from binance, regularly

accumulated it during the bear market, so pretty good job of buying without raising price

[04-Sep-18 12:10 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah great prices too

[04-Sep-18 12:11 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
Jesus, 5m KMD

[04-Sep-18 12:11 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
That's probably CZ himself

[04-Sep-18 12:12 AM] jspook16#3059
lol it could be anyone. I know of at least one person with deep pockets that was unaware of kmd until a conference last fall....but seemed really interested afterwards.

[04-Sep-18 12:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
My pockets are shallow but they’re always emptying into kmd every time they’re half full 🤗

[04-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I noticed the accumulation for some time with KMD. The last few weeks was a given the pump was coming seeing how the coin stayed down while others were going up. Even the last few days pointed to a increase that will last a while.

[04-Sep-18 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
before you all get too excited, just look at the weekly chart. it is barely off the very bottom, not even anywhere close to getting back to the long term average, let alone significantly above it as any actual pump would make it

[04-Sep-18 12:18 AM] jspook16#3059
but its good to see new entities stashing up KMD

[04-Sep-18 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is clearly a new entity in the recent months. also significant is that hashrate doubled

[04-Sep-18 12:20 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe the dragon will blossom after the rebrand and upcoming updates

[04-Sep-18 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the dragon has been evolving and growing up quickly, regarless of the market price it has traded at

[04-Sep-18 12:21 AM] jspook16#3059
very good point. I meant the dragon price...lol. Yes kmd is outstanding!

[04-Sep-18 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
recent month, it is not uncommon for KMD to be at the top gainers of the day against all the other top coins

[04-Sep-18 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a full 10 ranks gained and seems another new wanna be giant whale has entered the waters

[04-Sep-18 12:24 AM] jspook16#3059
you and the team are doing great. It will be fun to see how the year closes out

[04-Sep-18 12:26 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
The price is at the wall - about to test it

sad that BTCD is still so alive

[04-Sep-18 12:26 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
WTH did it pump

[04-Sep-18 12:27 AM] jspook16#3059
BTCD istill kicking just means that KMD will never die

[04-Sep-18 12:27 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
Im surprised KMD isn't pumping with that support

[04-Sep-18 12:31 AM] jspook16#3059
patient whale it seems....he can probably fill his order in a few days anyway

[04-Sep-18 12:31 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
he's probably not even paying attention

while the entire market loses their shit

[04-Sep-18 12:32 AM] jspook16#3059
lol yeah we're watching his order closer than he is........probably paying for it just from rewards too

[04-Sep-18 12:35 AM] jspook16#3059
i wonder if the guy buying up kmd these last few months is really planning on keeping it all in one address. I dont have anything close to that much and I split mine up. Unless this is his chump change wallet..

[04-Sep-18 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact he was able to accumulate so much without being noticed,means it is likely some pro-outfit/pro trader

[04-Sep-18 12:40 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
And he did it without increasing the volume by a lot. He has so much he isn't really too worried on if that buy order gets filled.

[04-Sep-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i think this patient whale is different from the stealth whale that accumulated

[04-Sep-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody really noticed such a large accumulation until recently via richlst

[04-Sep-18 12:41 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
Are you guys sure the wallet with 5m KMD is the same as the one on binance?

[04-Sep-18 12:41 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
ah

[04-Sep-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the 5m wallet is getting funds from the binance wallet

also, wasnt the buy wall at different price earlier?

That is some serious talent

[04-Sep-18 12:42 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
I think it was originally 1800

that's what I read at least

seems a bit of fomo going on...

[04-Sep-18 12:42 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I do find it crazy he would keep it in one wallet. If you really want to hide it then you spread it out.

i dont think he wants to hide it....im just saying in case one wallet gets compromised, he should split it

[04-Sep-18 12:45 AM] jspook16#3059
@hollowman would never KYC

[04-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
How would you ensure a wallet doesn’t get compromised? I should split mine up but I’m not sure if it’s worth the effort. Would making all the wallets on the same pc negate the whole point?

[04-Sep-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it would negate it if on the same pc

[04-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I agree with that. It is why I keep coins in multiple wallets regardless how small they are. Just use one as a hot wallet.

[04-Sep-18 12:47 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah dont keep the on the same PC.... you could encrypt you wallet.dat file and keep it in cold storage

[04-Sep-18 12:47 AM] shak3nbak3#2279

Who would put a buy order behind that 84btc wall?

[04-Sep-18 12:48 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
maybe they haven't realized there's a huge wall?

now have to debug it, but it turned out to be one of the simpler ones, even though it allows people to create a market for data

[04-Sep-18 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the main purpose for it is to get offchain things into an onchain data so other contracts can use it as input

[04-Sep-18 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810

from polo:     BTCD is currently under maintenance or experiencing wallet issues. Deposits and withdrawals will remain disabled as we work to find, test, and audit a solution. Thank you for your patience in the meantime.

[04-Sep-18 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt stop a 3x pump. or maybe due to it being purely an internal token, allows the pump
