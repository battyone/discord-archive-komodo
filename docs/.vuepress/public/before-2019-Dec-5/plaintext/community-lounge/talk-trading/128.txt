Does binance KYC?

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i think only for small amounts like 2BTC, it avoids KYC. Unless you had hundreds of small accounts, it is not usable for any large amounts

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Yassin#3685
right

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Yassin#3685
limit is 2btc

[03-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Yassin#3685
unverified

[03-Sep-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
someone would have to make a bunch of small deposits into different accounts

[03-Sep-18 08:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

any reason why KMD is pumping?

[03-Sep-18 08:42 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
news or something?

[03-Sep-18 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just like Trex

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Drug whale is using KYC verified account on binance to launder BTC into Komodo and monero

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Wow KYC

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
they acutally did it

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve gathered from the banter here in #talk-trading

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Might want to get a second opinion though

[03-Sep-18 08:43 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Everyone guessed XMR, but KMD is a surprise

[03-Sep-18 08:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

now the guy with the keys wants to get this clean

[03-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Tek#5253
and will probably use XMR to anonymise the value, with probably KMD and maybe another privacy coin

he'll probably spread it out over the privacy coins and pull out bitcoin again at the other end

[03-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Tek#5253
I do think he'll keep parts of it in XMR / KMD / Other privacy coin

[03-Sep-18 09:34 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
