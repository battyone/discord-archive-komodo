I've met Andreas A. I've looked him right in the eyes and asked why he keeps telling people Bitcoin is anonymous. That man is a piece of shit. There is nothing in that head except poo.

@widz because there was a huge sell wall at 16950 and it's taking a long time to eat through that.

[19-Jun-19 05:41 PM] widz#4328

[19-Jun-19 05:43 PM] widz#4328

[19-Jun-19 05:44 PM] Tek#5253

Fun story, it was at Symbiosis, a crunchy techno fest in So Cal. After a long day hanging out on floaties , spraying down topless women with a supersoaker (who were also swimming) and a head full of LSD. I ran into that cocksucker AA. He had some fans hanging on his every word. So I listened till he actually told people that Bitcoin was anonymous.

[19-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
did he block you afterwards?

[19-Jun-19 05:48 PM] joe2x4#5987
No, he wouldn't listen to reason. Then I got really distracted by the toplessness going by and walked off
