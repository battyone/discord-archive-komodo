once they are elected then we have the 64 spots and dealing with it is something that we deal with, not really an election worthy aspect

[30-Aug-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
changing a set of 64 pubkeys of notary nodes is a subject to network ugprade, or in other words needing hardfork of chains who are notarising using dPoW tech.

[30-Aug-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
single pubkey change because a node wants to sell, that means if needing to replace it with the one new pubkey from the candidate who didn't make it, and adding that candidate

[30-Aug-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
candidate's key to the set of notarising keys, means hardfork.

[30-Aug-19 02:13 PM] hastrup#8742
this will not be the last time a "bad actor" there most be a better solution then just made nn do nothing. but i can see that i need to do more research to understand this more

[30-Aug-19 02:14 PM] hastrup#8742
@grewalsatinder oh its that bad. hmm ok thx for the info

[30-Aug-19 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no problem. just trying to explain the tech facts

[30-Aug-19 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and the complexity of things needing changes

[30-Aug-19 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can't say exactly if it's "bad" 🤔

[30-Aug-19 02:16 PM] hastrup#8742
its bad in the way that all keys need to change if one need to change

[30-Aug-19 02:16 PM] hastrup#8742
or maybe i misunderstand things again haha

[30-Aug-19 02:17 PM] hastrup#8742
🙂

[30-Aug-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not all changes, 1 is removed, 1 is added. or whatever is removed, whatever is added.
just wanted to explain that it doesn't matter if 1 or 2 or few doesn't even notarise to the notary node network.

[30-Aug-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if they don't, they just dont.

[30-Aug-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the network still keeps going.

[30-Aug-19 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the end result is the network securing the dPoWed chains.

[30-Aug-19 02:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it just shows that the network is flexible enough to keep going and can sustain a hit like these miner setbacks if even happens.

[30-Aug-19 02:18 PM] hastrup#8742
but you need a hard fork to do it? but you can if one chooses that 1 or x keys to change all of them dont need to changer in a hard fork?

[30-Aug-19 02:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
why hardfork to add a new node, 1 or 2 or even 5 nodes, when the network can keep going....

[30-Aug-19 02:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't think there's any such emergency

[30-Aug-19 02:20 PM] hastrup#8742
im not saying you shuld but its the only way to change 1 nn to a new one right?

this is indeed a cool thread

[30-Aug-19 02:26 PM] hastrup#8742
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠  that is not the point if there is redundancy built in, dont get me wrong its great that its there. but the piont is what to do whit a "bad actor" when one arrives and what to do whit the nn left. is it ok for anyone to buy should it be voted for again. who decide who is a bad actor or not. that is my point im making. not if the network can handle one rouge nn.

[30-Aug-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you juist ban it from notarizing.

[30-Aug-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and let them mine

[30-Aug-19 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
only last 1 year and the key changes...

[30-Aug-19 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because nobody woulkd elect a bad node?

[30-Aug-19 02:30 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I understand your point. As long as we're human, we will (unfortunately) always have bad actors among us.

[30-Aug-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and i repeat, the current system has redundancies to be able to handle such cases

[30-Aug-19 02:30 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
My point was that the protocol has consensus rules that invalidate bad actors. (So the consensus among the 64 NN's determine that).

[30-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
why make a big deal about something that isnt a big deal?

[30-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not hard for the NN as a group to determine if any single NN is become a bad actor

centralisation is an issue, NN act as guardians and protect the network, here they not only do that but act also like a private council making decisions, and by them, approve what decisions are taken. The reason I left was because I strongly disagreed with recent decisions, and don t want to be affiliated to those

[30-Aug-19 02:40 PM] hastrup#8742
im sorry if its sounds like im trying to blow something up. that is not my intent. i wantet to learn more becuse in my head its sounds bad that one could buy a nn, but what @blackjok3r  told me that is not that pratical to buy one becuse that you would have two that knows the same key.

[30-Aug-19 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
until governance is fixed, this is an endless talk

[30-Aug-19 02:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. exactly. And a bad actiung node its detected very easily with new code I have written/ported to LABS iguana.

[30-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
you do know that the central point of failure is NN, and whatever you try, tech can be bypassed,the pros and cons of keeping things public.
Once upon a time I proposed to lock down the notary network, but that s too centralised, yet this, atm, is one of the few ways to get it secure

[30-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
IP are public, just like the chains, bro

you cannot join the dpow iguana network without a private key,,, it *should* be fine to be public network

Also there are not many ways a node can act badly... and I have detectiuon for them all.. Yet to determine if i will remove region advantage allowing nodes to be anywhere

is there a bounty to this @blackjok3r ? ^^

[30-Aug-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea... I have some nodes on LABS that are lagging... but as I do not own them, I dont know what the problem is exactly.. 
On  testnet with my own 56 nodes it worked fine ... 
https://oracle.earth/labs_ntx_graph/
THere is celarly some nodes not notaring some chains, making the total count incorrect. It appears to work as intended

[30-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I meant bounties for PoC wrecking the network, so it can be refined

[30-Aug-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely LABS can do LABS boutnies.  That is what it si for

[30-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
it would be interesting if someone would make a interview with 10 pretty good blockchain devs who would compare developing on eth and kmd with pros and cons

[30-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
i think it could also possibly help with ideas what could possibly be missing what devs want but dont exist with kmd

@Deleted User what is the idea? 😄

[30-Aug-19 11:26 PM] designer#4893
Most offline merchants that started accepting crypto drop their support shortly after because no one uses it. 

It’s easy to convince restaurant owners as a customer and feel proud of spreading adoption. But in reality merchant onboarding is meaningless as it’s not sustainable.

Still even if ethereum isn't as innovative as it once was, it's far from abandonware.  It seems to just have gotten to political like bitcoin, turned into a business
