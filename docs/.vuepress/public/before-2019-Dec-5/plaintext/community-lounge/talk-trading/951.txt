Still looking to trade my LABS for K64 1:1, open to trading LABS for other ecosystem projects as well, DM or tag if interested.

[20-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just set some low buys

[20-Jul-19 05:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If k64 blows yet another set date you‚Äôll see some dumping

[20-Jul-19 05:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So 4 hours 40 minutes

[20-Jul-19 05:21 PM] cmiles7888#0621

[20-Jul-19 05:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
they also have a discord

[20-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
@Hollowman9000 I have no KMD atm, just LABS, hence the 1:1 offer

[20-Jul-19 05:24 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
and labs isnt currently valued/literally 0 liquidity so I feel if someone wants to dump they may consider another strong ecosystem project

[20-Jul-19 05:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
how many LABS do you sell?

[20-Jul-19 05:25 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
up to 5k maybe more depending on the ffer

[20-Jul-19 05:26 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I dont wanna sell but am looking to expand my holdings of other ecosystem projects :9756_AppJedi:

[20-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
only 1m in circulation atm I believe so you could get a good stack to start taking advantage of staking /pos64staker

[20-Jul-19 05:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
about 1m atm

[20-Jul-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
kmd playing with fire atm....drop below 11k and uptrend is broken

[20-Jul-19 05:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
