given our position, there are times where we get more reasonable listing offers, but it is still expensive

[18-Jan-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if binance disappeared tomorrow....

KMD exchange coverage would be about the 777th on the list of bad consequences for crypto

lol you are right!

[18-Jan-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
by the time the dust settles and there is a new top volume exchange, likely it will be one that KMD is on already

[18-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Strob#3417
I like your way of thinking. We can see you value more the quality of your tech that anything else and I like that!

I guess your position will just increase more and more and they willl one day pay you to get to list KMD!

[18-Jan-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt that will ever happen, but I am seeing more and more interest in just listing KMD without fees from the smaller to midsize infrastructure places

being constantly in the china top 10, it seems to motivate some to list us

[18-Jan-19 03:14 PM] Strob#3417
Ok yes KMD is third in the top China crypto! lol!

[18-Jan-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
only #8 on http://blocktivity.info/

[18-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
but that isnt counting the entire ecosystem activity as it arguably should, or at least a separate entry for KMD++

[18-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Strob#3417
Wow I didn't know that website! Very eye opening!

[18-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Strob#3417
I can see how KMD is undervalued!

if we look at macd it looks like were ending red trend

[19-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
so we could break 19.7 and head towards 23.5

[20-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Will it be a main goal in 2019 to try and get people to migrate or new projects to use kmd to make their blockchain?
