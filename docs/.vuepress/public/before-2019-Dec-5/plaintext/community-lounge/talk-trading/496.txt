alright

[29-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
so like with kmd last times it pump haha....someone puts a 20k buy and it gets rekt each time

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I am still not sure should I collect KDM

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Caglio#3337
or MTG

[29-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Markus#5464
i would wait and see what bitcoin gonna do, if it will pump then alts will suffer

[29-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Markus#5464
cause ppl would probably sell alts to fomo into btc if it pump

[29-Mar-19 04:18 PM] kremer#4440
wts 100 DEX @ 22 KMD ea, dm if interested

[29-Mar-19 05:13 PM] NNoperator#3835
@kremer  someone was offering 50KMD not long ago.  I think you will get a buyer quickly at that price.  Oh nevermind  it was  @CoinKing88   who WTB 2 DEX for 50KMD

[29-Mar-19 05:37 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Markus won't alts suffer if bit coin dumps as well?

[29-Mar-19 05:43 PM] kremer#4440
i've seen acura offer some DEX for 50. but also saw a bit more interest in the 20s, so that seems like a fair price at this time

[29-Mar-19 05:46 PM] Markus#5464
@Sherdogz alts are quite difficult cause some will pump when btc pump meanwhile other will dump when btc pump, then when btc dump some will hold value quite well meanwhile others will just dump harder then btc it all depends of holders of specific alts and market behaviour

[29-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
but atm btc is in a critical zon, we could finally break above 4.1k resistance then we could possibly get a small pump possibly or we just retrace another time üòÑ

[29-Mar-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Solid break over 4.1-4.2 and it could mean 5k+ next... break below 3.9 is bad news

[29-Mar-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464
think we will get a squeeze to atleast 4120 ish then possibly retrace to test trend line

[29-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Markus#5464
at around 3950

[29-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Markus#5464
not enough volume to push 5k

[29-Mar-19 06:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Agreed, might even see a long squeeze and drop below 3900

[29-Mar-19 06:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
To finally complete wave 5 to 3k üòâ

[29-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Caglio#3337
If I wake up one day

[29-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Caglio#3337
And see KMD at 10 or 15$

[29-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Markus#5464
it will one day most likely

[29-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I am totally gonna feel fine

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
it was like 15$ last bullrun

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember that

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
i personally think if kmd get the attention it deserves i would say 25-50$ next bullrun when it reaches its top

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
but we will see

[29-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I am sad that I didnt accumulate more of them tho

[29-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Caglio#3337
Should have invested everything when ltc hit 300

[29-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Caglio#3337
I was like, sell it or not

[29-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Caglio#3337
If I did, and bought kmd, I would be so fucking good

[29-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
my biggest regret is to not buy bitcoin when it was 250$ when i first time discovered it üòÑ

[29-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean I would be still in the minus cos KMD was expensive then, but I would have much more of em ( :

[29-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Wow lol

[29-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Sorry bro ( :

[29-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Markus#5464
its fine üòÑ

[29-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Caglio#3337
I just need to find a way to accumulate more KMD

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I was thinking armed robberies for a while

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Caglio#3337
But thats not that bright idea tho

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Markus#5464
trade between kmd/btc

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Markus#5464
i tripled my kmd holdings in few months

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Caglio#3337
I am shit trader ( :

[29-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh damn really ?

[29-Mar-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
Yes and im not good at trading, i started learning like 5 months ago

[29-Mar-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
but doing quite well

[29-Mar-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
still learning i want to be more accurate and be able to predict market based on TA and see better results

[29-Mar-19 06:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I wish I could predict roulette table ( :

[29-Mar-19 06:55 PM] Markus#5464
dont gamble, better learn trading it will guarantee u way more profit and less potential of loosing it all in RNG

[29-Mar-19 06:56 PM] Markus#5464
theres alot of catches when it comes to crypto aswell.

[29-Mar-19 06:56 PM] Markus#5464
icos, investing dapps and so on, dont get fooled

[29-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Lol i saw a documentary about bitcoin in 2014 and I didn't do nothing with it. Was to busy trading stocksüò£

[29-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Markus#5464
interesting time watching btc atm, approaching major resistance

[29-Mar-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
looks like btc printing a bull flag on 4h chart again

[29-Mar-19 07:22 PM] Caglio#3337
@Markus ur right bro

[29-Mar-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
The biggest trick to learning to trade is to not believe all the bullshit "if it goes up it goes up more, and if it goes down it goes down more" TA.

[29-Mar-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
That is all made to trick noobs into buying after a rise and selling after a drop.

[29-Mar-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Instead, sell the rise and buy the drop

[29-Mar-19 07:48 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Also dont daytrade.

[29-Mar-19 07:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
Hindsight in crypto is self mutilation. I was shilling btc to friends at parties when it was $110. I only owned a few at the time.

[29-Mar-19 07:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I wish I had bought at $10 when i heard of it

[29-Mar-19 07:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
instead I bought at 800 in early 2014 lol.

[29-Mar-19 07:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
It‚Äôs really easy to chart a path to crypto riches when looking backwards. Doing it forwards is the tricky part.

[29-Mar-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks so fucking true

[29-Mar-19 07:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah if only i sold late 2017 and bought recently

[29-Mar-19 08:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Just curious, has any of you participated in binance launchpad IEO? It seems very profitable

[29-Mar-19 08:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
So thats why BNB is pumping so hard

[29-Mar-19 08:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
I have some on binance but I haven‚Äôt even logged in since they started kyc.

[29-Mar-19 08:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, every IEO since early this year is at least 2-3X

[29-Mar-19 08:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
that‚Äôs hilarious. I had no idea.

[29-Mar-19 08:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[29-Mar-19 08:13 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont even know what that is

[29-Mar-19 08:13 PM] Caglio#3337
But sounds interesting

[29-Mar-19 08:14 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
should skim profit of this and put it into KMD üòÑ

[29-Mar-19 08:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I haven't participated in any of these, but might try the next one

[29-Mar-19 08:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
The link i followed said it was a lottery based on how much bnb you owned. All you had to do was hold a bnb balance to have a shot.

[29-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, that is the latest rule

[29-Mar-19 08:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
meaning for the next IEO and onwards

[29-Mar-19 08:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I have already hodl some BNBs

[29-Mar-19 08:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
If they flag my ip I wonder if they claw back any winnings

[29-Mar-19 08:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
Says no ussa

[29-Mar-19 08:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
Guess its vpn time

[29-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tezos keeps going up

[29-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it going full ETH or what?

[29-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yup, vpn is your best friend, but you need to do kyc to particiapte though

[29-Mar-19 08:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah binance has me on lock til they get their chickens

[29-Mar-19 08:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
First person that acts who lives in a Wild West jurisdiction is going to make a mint acting as a proxy to bypass all of this doorkicker suggestion box shit

[29-Mar-19 08:21 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that's why I hesitated to apply for citizenship üòÑ

[29-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
though it doesn't hurt to have dual/more citizenships

[29-Mar-19 08:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
My body is ready. If i didnt have kids I‚Äôd be in the wild west right now. I think wyoming has some interesting new laws if you act as a business though.

[29-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
US is cucked in that respect

[29-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think caymans or something

[29-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Somewhere they truly don‚Äôt give a fuck

[29-Mar-19 08:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
What about puerto rico?

[29-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just payoff the local chieftain or whatever

Tfw when your considering renouncing citizenship for crypto freedom.

[29-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Too many are dependent on the web of bullshit we have constructed in the US

[29-Mar-19 08:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
IRS abolished and VAT or something like that utilized
