why is it limited to 15 kmd?

[26-Sep-18 03:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
That's my point 😛

[26-Sep-18 03:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Nothing about crypto

[26-Sep-18 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why is it limited to 15 kmd?`
For the same reason you ignored my math question:
"because"

[26-Sep-18 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And for not much more per, you can strike OTC deals for pretty much however much KMD you can afford to spend

[26-Sep-18 03:54 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Deleted User Well makes sense, still funny for now though ^^

Separately, @bpkdasbaum, I'm still waiting on you to acknowledge that your math over-inflates the  cost of a miner by 2.1x and under-calculates hash by almost 7%

@cascrypto that goes back to some article he posted about the break even price of BTC mining where he doubled the cost

[27-Sep-18 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
i see, PIRATE as highly undervalued coin, given the potential.

unlike CHIPS, PIRATE is complete

[27-Sep-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
unlike CHIPS, PIRATE will get marketed, as it is complete

[27-Sep-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is a very limited usecase coin, just useful for the "offshore savings" market

[27-Sep-18 01:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
what does that have to do with anything?
talking about the hype by those that mined early
been too long in crypto...
