[26-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
its been a while

[26-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
time to get serious about this

[26-Jun-19 12:20 PM] designer#4893
Bitcoin surpassed $10,000.
It took two years and six months to get from $1,000 to $10,000.
It took more than three years to break the $100-$1,000 mark, but the $1,000-$10,000 mark was faster.
It is important to understand the characteristics of bitcoin prices that increase with log scale.

[26-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Caglio#3337
also we hit this years high

[26-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
tbh if things keep going like this I buy a complete new laptop

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What program will you use to encrypt?

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
with AMD chip

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
I don't trust intel

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Time to upstream you bro

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
not sure yet, probably the build in encryption option in this linux distro

[26-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
or TrueCrypt

[26-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Tek#5253
The previous state of my opsec was pretty shitty. if you just could take my phone and get logged in to that you could acces emails and exchange accounts

[26-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Tek#5253
thats not possible anymore now

[26-Jun-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I used a powerMAC from like 2001 for my wallet machine. Manged to compile iguana on it to generate keys 😄

I want an AMD chip god damin

[26-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Tek#5253
not jew intel spy chip

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
both are much the same I think. You have to use pretty old hardware or a IBM power9 system to get around the hardware backdoors

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
yeah but you have the intel management stuff

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
amd don't have that

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it does its just called something else

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
I'm done with intel in general I always wanted to try an AMD chip

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
yeah but the intel one goes very far

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
management console

[26-Jun-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have 2700X here with a massiv aair cooler, its very good with lots of fast RAM.

[26-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Tek#5253
hmm myabe i should check second hand markets for a safe machine

[26-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Tek#5253
safe older machine

[26-Jun-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
meme ones are BIM thinkpads with core2 duo, couldnt fine any in austalia tho lol, so just used an old powerbook I had laying around.

[26-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
hmm

[26-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
rather have an old amd chip

[26-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Tek#5253
I just don't trust intel

[26-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeeee

[26-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Tek#5253
im getting go long signals again on btc

[26-Jun-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats what I have in my server, 4x 12 core A64

[26-Jun-19 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its getting rather slow even with stupid amounts of cores, anything single thread is painful, but it does the job

[26-Jun-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
instead of getting a purism laptop I'll suggest you to get an old Thinkpad laptop, any Thinkpad laptop, flash the secure BIOS on it, and then install your favourite linux.
and only use it for your cryptocurrency wallets, and nothing else. also compile all your cryptocurrency wallets yourself without downloading pre-compiled binaries.
it will all cost you from $200-$600 USD depending on what old Thinkpad laptop you get.

[26-Jun-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
much cheaper than purism.

[26-Jun-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you still like purism, just go for it.

[26-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Tek#5253
thanks good tip

[26-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
i'll probably do that

[26-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
Thinkpads come wih amd chips right?

[26-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
I just wanna get an AMD chip next, i'v been using intel chips all my life I want somthing diff

[26-Jun-19 01:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't see much of a significant change in ARRR price drop.... 🤔

[26-Jun-19 01:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I guess when KMD will boom, then ARRR price will drop..... or may be not.... 🤔 
feel too dumb for trading analysis... :abusedsmily: 
@Hollowman9000 can better chart and stuff than me :abusedsmily:

[26-Jun-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c any insights about upcoming listings to more liquid exchanges for other KMD assets (like DEX, coinexchange.io has no volume mainly because of the lack of supply). Or are there options available allready that i dont know of. I got DEX listed in my Delta app and it keeps changing with 20-25% while there is no volume on coinexchange, dont like that 😃

[26-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
So, when bitcoin goes down

[26-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
We would be able to buy kmd for 10 cents ?

[26-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Tahts amazing

[26-Jun-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i would expect a lot more DEX liquidity via atomicDEX

[26-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Caglio#3337
I expect capitulation

[26-Jun-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
all assets from KMD ecosystem will have far better liquidity on AtomicDEX than any centralised exchanges

[26-Jun-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The next mm2.0 is multiple X superior than mm1.0

[26-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder probably cos half of them wont even be on normal exchanges

[26-Jun-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that too

[26-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Then we agree ( :

[26-Jun-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't think we'll see much of the capitulation, if that was the case, we could have seen those in mm1.0 time too

[26-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont know, I doubt we are regaining out better days again

[26-Jun-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ones who are holding these SueprNET times assets from NXT days, they are pretty strong hands holding them.

[26-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean, I dont see kmd going back even double in value now

[26-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
let alone 5-6 times

[26-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Caglio#3337
