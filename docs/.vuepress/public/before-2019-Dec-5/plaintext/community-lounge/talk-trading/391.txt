[30-Jan-19 03:36 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not so sure many coins will come back

[30-Jan-19 03:36 PM] Tek#5253

[30-Jan-19 03:36 PM] Tek#5253
3th time

[30-Jan-19 03:36 PM] PTYX#6840
The blind excitement for coins with no real use cases is dying.

[30-Jan-19 03:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Mainly ERC20 stuffs and crappy forks i agree

[30-Jan-19 03:37 PM] Tek#5253
only ERC20's I'm holding are RLC and MANA

[30-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Tek#5253

[30-Jan-19 03:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
We laugh but i read a article about a guy who got rich from buying virtual land in a game i cannot remember which but he did alright out of it

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
probably Second Life

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
that's the only reason I'm interested in mana

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
May have been second life actually Tek

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
it turned into a huge industry

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Tek#5253
Second Life 2.0

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Tek#5253

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Tek#5253
I don't really like Virtual Reality... but I see it as a possible moon

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Tek#5253
there's a lot of people that don't care for the real world at all, they will buy my bags

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
No doubt virtual products are huge these days, Kids spends loads on skins etc

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 regarding the being your own boss thing

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that can suck as well

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I am my own boss but have 36 people working for me

[30-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Even though I'm the boss with my partner, it's not like I am *free*

[30-Jan-19 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fire them all and get a better job :troll:

[30-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Almost sold everything end of 2018

[30-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But offer wasnt good enough, so ended up buying another company

[30-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Plan on doing +30% for 2019 and see if the competitors come knocking because we are hurting them too much :p

[30-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Tek#5253
tfw not a boss yet 😦

[30-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
its a lot of stress tbh

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And a lot of hard work

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
learn to trade better :troll_king:

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the general public doesnt really realize what it takes to be 'an entrepreneur'

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they only see how much money they are making

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or the porsche they are driving

[30-Jan-19 03:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But dont see the sacrifices you need to make

[30-Jan-19 03:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and then I dont mean entrepreneur in the sense of every 12 in a dozen douchebag that has entrepreneur in their instagram bio

[30-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Tek#5253
lol

[30-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I've seen people working 140hours a week etc, keeping their heads down, sacrificing everything for their company

[30-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Tek#5253
if you have a really good company though you could just point a ceo for it and thensit at the back relaxing, just talking to the ceo every now and then

[30-Jan-19 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
real entrepreneurs don't have an Instagram account 😛

[30-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then you arent an entrepreneur @Tek

[30-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
merely a shareholder 😃

[30-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Tek#5253
if you brought it up and did the hard work until its big then leave it to someone else , why wouldn't you be the entrepreneur

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And we have 3 business units atm, plan for 2019 is to have someone manage them so my partner and I can take a step back and not have to deal with day to day ops

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Tek#5253
seeeeeeeee

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Tek#5253
le le

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Tek#5253
also, a lot of entrepreneurs have an instagram, but they usally only sell dreams

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Tek#5253
😄

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 truth

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Tek#5253
if your marketing agency isn't on facebook though your company is missing out on clients

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a b2b business

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a lot of entrepreneurs have an instagram, but they usally only sell dreams`
scamming people is not an entrepreneurial venture 🤦🏽

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Tek#5253
businesses are and contact over social media too

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
facebook not really that valuable

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Tek#5253
linkedin should be

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
linkedin is a different matter 😃

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if your marketing agency isn't on facebook though your company is missing out on clients`
Said every lemming that uses Windows, ever

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Tek#5253
I run ubuntu dude

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Tek#5253
I'm an ex DevOps, we don't do shitty winblows

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Tek#5253
> being in crypto on a windows machine

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Tek#5253
its like you wanna get your funds stolen

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] Tek#5253
tfw probably will have to use windows for my project management part of my next job

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] Tek#5253
😦

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
honestly

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
whatever gets the job done

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Facebook is an intentionally manipulated platform and you're only reaching those "missing" clients if you pay Facebook enough $ to decide that those clients are allowed to see you

[30-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Tek#5253
probably

[30-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(not using windows myself though before I get shot in the face by lord CG)

[30-Jan-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "probably", factually

[30-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Tek#5253
that's gonna require some proofs then

[30-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Tek#5253
😄

[30-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I did marketing for a clothing business while I was in UNI

[30-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and paid ads for FB did wonders

[30-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
spent something like 100€ a month on them, reached 100k+ specifically targeted people

[30-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
revenue went +80% in a year

[30-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and the cost was peanuts

[30-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if used correctly it's a powerful tool

[30-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and the people on facebook dont even notice they are manipulated into buying shit most of the time

[30-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is probably what CG was pointing out

[30-Jan-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that's gonna require some proofs then`
The proof is Zuckerburg's words
Everything you see on Facebook, outside of something you came to from an external source, is computationally designed to have Facebook monetize Facebook (in short: if there's no financial gain in it for them then your sphere is intentionally limited)

[30-Jan-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
This is no secret, in fact, he's proud of it

[30-Jan-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's all designed so you stay as long as possible lurking the facebook feed

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[30-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so they can blast you with paid ads basically making money off you watching fb

[30-Jan-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pretty clever tbh

[30-Jan-19 04:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and there are a gajillion "filters" to ensure that what you *do* see reinforces your existing beliefs, likes, tastes, etc

[30-Jan-19 04:05 PM] Tek#5253
my RLC bag is mooning

[30-Jan-19 04:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
people want to see what they believe in, if they are offended constantly you will not like the platform and not hang around as much @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[30-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's all just a ploy to keep you hooked

[30-Jan-19 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_isn't offended by anything on Farcebook, he just has better shit to waste his time with_

[30-Jan-19 04:12 PM] Tek#5253
how are the tokeconomics for KMD anyways?

[30-Jan-19 04:12 PM] Tek#5253
or coin economics

[30-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
buy hodl dont look back

[30-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Tek#5253
my RLC bag is really pumping

[30-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Tek#5253
it was undervalued for so long

[30-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Tek#5253
still is tbh

[30-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont know it

[30-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
shill it to me

[30-Jan-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
