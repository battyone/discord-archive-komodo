@USterle Atleast a bit lower than 8k but i expect alot more downside. But there is a chance that we might have a little pump left to play out before we actually going down

[26-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
we actually going down

[26-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[26-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[26-Jul-18 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

good news on the ETF more than likely come september

[26-Jul-18 12:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
rumors cropping up again, whispers ‚Äú..buy‚Äù

[26-Jul-18 12:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But forget all of that, a weird looking drop to $3k after all of the above is due

[26-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then again that guy closes shorts and longs within $100 price movements

[26-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So who knows, maybe he‚Äôs kvetching about the 1s price window movements

[26-Jul-18 12:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is that how bears die?  Moving to ever-shorter time frames to preserve their bear worldview?

I'm not clicking random links by random people

[26-Jul-18 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So for a scaling chain setup, would you just create a dummy masterchain to MoMoM to so you‚Äôre not paying 300kmd/yr X however many parallel chains you need to run?

@MarkHannaCrypto That or a cup and handle you‚Äôre zooming too far in on.

-3M: inverse H&S/triple bottom (whatever you want to call it) just completed

-6M: Adam and Eve pattern just completed

-1Y: ABCDE movement down from ATH just completed.

ETF Approval likely in Sept...

also, ZILLA, CHAIN, BTCH, COQUI and KMD

[26-Jul-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
each chain in a cluster needs to be notarized to KMD

[26-Jul-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is the "bulletin board" that has all the MoMoM info needed to make proofs

[26-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What prevents them from notarizing to a subchain which then notarizes to KMD?

[26-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c

[26-Jul-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents them, but if KMD chain doesnt have the info,it cant make the cross chain proofs

[26-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Otherwise a 6400 chain scale monster would need 38.4MM KMD to cover chain costs

[26-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
via interest anyway

[26-Jul-18 02:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[26-Jul-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
any entity that would need 6400 chains wouldnt have a problem with the costs and no need to buy 20 years worth, so a million KMD is an absorbable amount of liquidity

[26-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1.92MM KMD/yr to keep that going

[26-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Guess we‚Äôll cross that bridge if it ever gets built and we make it to said site of future bridge

[26-Jul-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
I think 1024 chains will have plenty of capacity for any initial deployment

[26-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anyone heard from that gaming company guy

[26-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They interested in KMD?

They are working on some sort of relaunch I read

[26-Jul-18 05:13 PM] ryman112#0068
Looking at my portfolio today and KMD is the only thing Im making money on.  Hope these flood gates open soon.  Getting bored lol

[26-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[26-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[26-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A 100x for kmd and I will name my firstborn son james lee

[26-Jul-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
Digitalprice will also start a KMD market

What are your speculations on price potential with kmd

[27-Jul-18 09:35 AM] wolfgang#3508
you think it could reach over $10?

[27-Jul-18 09:35 AM] wolfgang#3508
$50?

[27-Jul-18 09:35 AM] wolfgang#3508
$100?
