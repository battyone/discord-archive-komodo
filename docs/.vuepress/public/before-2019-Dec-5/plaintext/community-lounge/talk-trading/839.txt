[25-Jun-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
although, I must admit, the 1st year it did help to have chickens and cattle (I'm not sure I'd be where I am without them)

[25-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Keppie#5156

we breed them to sell to lazy milk farmers 😛

[25-Jun-19 12:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
Nice

[25-Jun-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the inverse is I'm too lazy to run a dairy farm 😛

[25-Jun-19 12:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
Almost like mining coins and sell it to the ones that are too lazy to mine

[25-Jun-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
kind of 😛

[25-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Keppie#5156
Perfect analogy 😄

@Keppie it's not like I just came in off the pasture and jumped straight into it 😛

[25-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Keppie#5156
Im joking. When I read the dev channels, I realise that im not the smart guy here 😄

[25-Jun-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, there's smart and there's educated; don't confuse the 2
there's a lot of educated folks in the world that think they are smarter than they actually are (and seem so to those who are not educated) 😉

[25-Jun-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we do have a good mix around here of folks that are both, though 😎

Other option is to buy a fucking castle

[25-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is also nice

[25-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[25-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Keppie#5156

[25-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
price on request says it all hahaha

[25-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I dont want other people in my property :p

[25-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And as I said, I don't think 5M asking price or whatever is the biggest hurdle. You are probably spending 3-500k yearly on staff and maintainance of the grounds

[25-Jun-19 01:13 PM] designer#4893
Bitcoin is similar to infectious diseases and religious phenomena.

[25-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Time to dump bitcoin

[25-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Why hollow?”

[25-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Cause plebs rushed the top

[25-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Crypto gods are not pleased

A blood sacrifice is required

[25-Jun-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
plebs are not buying yet, searches for bitcoin at 10% the level of last bull market high, we are only 6 months from bear market low

[25-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I speak of short term

[25-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everyone dumpstered their alts

Time for face whipping

[25-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’ll buy the mini altpump at the top too

[25-Jun-19 01:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then dump local alt lows for the top of the next BTC movement

[25-Jun-19 01:34 PM] kaks#6612
i'am waiting for a little dump to open an order 😅

[25-Jun-19 01:34 PM] kaks#6612

descending triangle need to breakout upwards or we go down to 10k

[25-Jun-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when BTC dominance is dominanting all price movements, wouldnt it make more sense to be charting the dominance?

[25-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Markus#5464
never charted that but maybe u have a point

[25-Jun-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of what the charts for all the altcoins say should happen, if BTC goes to 20k directly vs to $2k, that will totally dominate the price action

[25-Jun-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe as a secondary factor, within the dominance change, you can gain some probabilities from altcoin charts

[25-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
Interesting how Litecoin pretty much getting destroyed in satoshi value

[25-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Markus#5464
-35% in 14 days against btc

[25-Jun-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty typical

[25-Jun-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
across the board

[25-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
u would think litecoin would do somewhat well against it considering halvening is pretty close

[25-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
but clearly not 😄

[25-Jun-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
Average fomo buyers have no understanding of halvenings + supply/demand

[25-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
by definition, BTC dominance increasing means on average all alts are losing value denominated in BTC

💯 

[25-Jun-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is a good way to think about it

[25-Jun-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
with a 4x fiat price increase over 6 months, only very high growth coins, like PIRATE, is able to keep up

{Reactions}
👍 rum 

[25-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
but pirate is very young still and have something no other coin have

[25-Jun-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
indeed, people are still starting to realize that

[25-Jun-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate was even mentioned at MoneroKon

[25-Jun-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody called it an "idealized Zcash" in a talk or something

[25-Jun-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
So when XMR people want to think of "the worst competition Zcash world can give them", they look at Pirate

[25-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
KMD is insanely bullish if u look how much it dropped....easy 100% gain

[25-Jun-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
quite appropriate

[25-Jun-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@PTYX actually not joking, this is from radix42

[25-Jun-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
radix42 is at MoneroKon

[25-Jun-19 02:00 PM] PTYX#6840
i don't doubt it. personally it's been amazing to see pirate grow from a small channel idea to what it is now
