[14-Oct-18 12:58 AM] 0x03#8822
hey, i cant keep it back, was it you who found out after 9, or 10 hours that the reason 'all your coins' didnt work was a wrong system time?

[14-Oct-18 12:58 AM] Geocold51#6462
Yes

[14-Oct-18 12:58 AM] Geocold51#6462
Very odd that DO gave me a server with time all fucked up

Trading banter back and forth

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] PTYX#6840
If you feel threatened we have a #safespace

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] Japesmith#0609
I feel emboldened

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] Geocold51#6462
I don't really plan to bypass it. I was doing EMC2 there to showcase a defense

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm banned from #safespace FYI

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] bishop#9773
as you should be

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] PTYX#6840
With good reason probably hollow

[14-Oct-18 01:00 AM] PTYX#6840

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
Anyway, @Geocold51 lots of interesting development going on in the KMD space if you want to get involved

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Japesmith#0609
Alt-right shitlord

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Geocold51#6462
tell me about the exchange

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Geocold51#6462
it seems suspect

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
barterdex?

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Geocold51#6462
yes

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] PTYX#6840
@Geocold51 take our trolling as tough love. Keep learning and good luck with everything.

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
suspect?

[14-Oct-18 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
I can tell you how the swaps work

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
I understand atomic swaps

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
just

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Alright#0419
and the infrastructure supporting the network

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
this decentralized exchange seems odd

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
Like

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
is it operational?

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it works

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
They say it has many coins

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Needs liquidity though

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] 0x03#8822
usually before you fly to the mars you learn to walk.

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all coins, fuck all liquidity

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] Geocold51#6462
but by default it seems to have 3. I've not looked into configuring it much at all but it seems odd

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] 0x03#8822
i am sorry i cannot resist

[14-Oct-18 01:02 AM] PTYX#6840
Hmmm

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
what has 3 coins by default?

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
barterdex? you need to add coins to the config or whatever it's called

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
I'd recommend trying hyperdex or the cli itself

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
cli is powerful

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Geocold51#6462
Huh. Interesting

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
hyperdex easy

[14-Oct-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that new coins adding feature thing made it way to ohard to use

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Onto the offer, do you have pirate synced yet, @Geocold51 ?

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Geocold51#6462
No

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Geocold51#6462
Is it on any exchanges?

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
None

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm good

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
No z support

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] Japesmith#0609
Haha

[14-Oct-18 01:04 AM] 0x03#8822

Barterdex protocol in action

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Geocold51#6462
How does the exchange prevent 51% attacks?

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
wait for confs

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
like any other

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Geocold51#6462
How does it do "20 second" trades?

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
you can whitelist nodes that you trust, and swaps will be quicker

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
you can also do 0conf trades

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you scroll down to the pirate section of our discord, you‚Äôll see an #deleted-channel channel, if you don‚Äôt want pirate ($ARRR) I can send you the KMD equivalent @Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Alright#0419
with KMD

[14-Oct-18 01:05 AM] 0x03#8822
how comes you want to 'hack coins' (so says your twitter) - but have to ask questions like this?

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] 0x03#8822
come _ON_

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Geocold51#6462
ok

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Japesmith#0609
If he doesn't want his pirate coins, I'll take them üëç

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Geocold51#6462
@0x03 I mean, I'm not engaged in your little world on KMD. I don't consider it really interesting

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] Geocold51#6462
It's pretty centraliziing

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] 0x03#8822
this is not about KMD

[14-Oct-18 01:06 AM] 0x03#8822
i'm really only talking about your shit performance

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] PTYX#6840
Lol

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] PTYX#6840
Waow

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] 0x03#8822
this has nothing to do with KMD

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] 0x03#8822
üòÑ

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Geocold51#6462
You do it.

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Geocold51#6462
Stream it

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'll pay you $2,000

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
$2k for what?

[14-Oct-18 01:07 AM] Geocold51#6462
Double spend.

[14-Oct-18 01:08 AM] Geocold51#6462
