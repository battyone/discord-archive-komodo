better sell at july 2020 then

[30-May-19 12:55 PM] Markus#5464
I call bullshit....its very unlikely someone can predict prices like that and even what price in specific months

[30-May-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the time traveller

[30-May-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
not a prediction if it is history

[30-May-19 12:57 PM] Markus#5464
why would someone believe in that anyway

[30-May-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
first two parts seems spot on, we will find out about the third one by july

[30-May-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like TA, if enough people believe it, it will come true

[30-May-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464

[30-May-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464
if enough ppl believe in the TA whales will do opposite

[30-May-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464

[30-May-19 01:02 PM] klein#5233

[30-May-19 01:02 PM] klein#5233
herd get fucked then the move happens

[30-May-19 01:02 PM] Markus#5464
well yes

[30-May-19 01:03 PM] klein#5233
but I'd caution when a few too many personalities are out saying "I want a pull back"

[30-May-19 01:03 PM] klein#5233
like the last few months

[30-May-19 01:03 PM] klein#5233

[30-May-19 01:17 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

Talking about TA, seems like KMD is much more spot on vs. USD

[30-May-19 01:32 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Did tommy ever return to this place or slack?

[30-May-19 01:33 PM] Bittersweet#9376
or can it be safely assumed that he overdosed?

[30-May-19 01:33 PM] Markus#5464
tommy?

[30-May-19 01:33 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Yes, the legend

[30-May-19 01:33 PM] Markus#5464

[30-May-19 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will see tommy when we are topping, you'll see üòÇ

[30-May-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh look, XVG, a coin once in the top 15 is now below KMD marketcap

[30-May-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also STEEM

[30-May-19 01:56 PM] altcoinist#1501
Steem is already failed in my opinion

[30-May-19 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And Stratis

[30-May-19 01:59 PM] altcoinist#1501
And gochain

[30-May-19 02:00 PM] klein#5233

[30-May-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
well he got many good points, ofc alot of ppl will get pissed to hear the truth of what could happen...doesnt have to like he also explain but it would definitely be more healthy

[30-May-19 02:03 PM] klein#5233

[30-May-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464

üòÑ

[30-May-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
im not rly sure, but i would say possibly that he is 60% right cause alot of that make sense

[30-May-19 02:04 PM] klein#5233
I don't care if he is right or wrong

[30-May-19 02:04 PM] klein#5233
I know a retard when I see one

[30-May-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464

What are his conclusions, wanted to see a more of a consolidation and want a pulled back?

[30-May-19 02:12 PM] klein#5233
