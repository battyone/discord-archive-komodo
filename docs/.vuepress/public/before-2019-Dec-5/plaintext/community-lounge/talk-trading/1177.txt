well at least it's only the price of btc that's manipulated. there is no way they would ever do the same with alts, right?

[23-Oct-19 01:06 AM] allbits#5898
That story says nothing about manipulation. Are you referring to something else?

[23-Oct-19 02:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
The futures market was only allowed to open because of price action. That counts as manipulation in my view. Perhaps i am mistaken.

Interesting how some try to turn everything into "this is good for bitcoin".

Price pump = moon
Price crash = accumulate!l
ETF yes = herd is coming
ETF no = don't need them
Regulatory support = finally
Regulatory attacks = this is why bitcoin

@Crabby Paddy not All time low... But very, very low!

[23-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[23-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I thought still quite a bit lower

[23-Oct-19 01:35 PM] Bittersweet#9376
3500-4000‚Ç¨ range at some point

[23-Oct-19 01:37 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Or bump around and then something happens around 6000‚Ç¨

[23-Oct-19 01:37 PM] Bittersweet#9376
(probably closer to 4k)

[23-Oct-19 01:38 PM] Bittersweet#9376
It's all a bit depressing but necessary üôÖ

[23-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I doubt we will see 3-4k range

[23-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that range feels like the 1k range everyone was calling back in april

So if the 4chan prophecy is correct than you could 1.5X just by investing now

BTC is going to $16K

[23-Oct-19 07:38 PM] JimD#9272
What indicators have you guys had success using?

[23-Oct-19 10:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think the only indicator that would have any success is having a mole in the govt. anyone got a tl;dr for the latest zuckerberg hearing?

[24-Oct-19 12:02 AM] meatspoon#7860
Zuck‚Äôs speech was surprisingly libertarian. I suspect it was mostly lies. But nice to see someone lying in a way that is supportive of freedom and the unbanked.

[24-Oct-19 12:05 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i think support and resistance levels are the simplest most effective indicators. The rest are good for finding confluence to back up your speculations. Also a lot of algo bots use fib extensions so they become a self fulfilling prophecy to some degree. same with rsi and moving averages

[24-Oct-19 12:08 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
People have back tested most indicators and any of them used in isolation leads to rekkage

[24-Oct-19 01:11 AM] tolken#2655
@meatspoon I feel that way about Apple most of the time... may be lies (re: personal privacy) but they‚Äôre the right lies. I‚Äôd rather a company express those rights than outright dismiss them. At least when they do something contradictory, you can make an argument against their consistency (for example, apple‚Äôs recent pulling of apps from Hong Kong)

Google, Microsoft, Facebook all seem to, relatively speaking, publicly not give a shit about privacy.

I have a gut feeling we‚Äôre gonna go a lot lower

[24-Oct-19 02:18 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Anyone else think we‚Äôre gonna go down another 30-50% üò¶

[24-Oct-19 02:27 AM] richardt#2807
I said awhile ago I'd likely buy more KMD when it goes under $0.50...  This is tempting üòÑ

[24-Oct-19 02:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
i have a little trouble believing that BTC will drop another 30-50%.  But I dont know anything special.  If you believe that BTC will continue to do what it does, that suggests that we wont go lower than 5 or 6k so that we can keep setting higher lows on a monthly chart.

Libra, bringer of death.

[24-Oct-19 03:33 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'll take the truth & honesty any day of the week, over lies. Apple pays their tax in Ireland, right? If you trust Zuckerberg, you're a damn fool. When he speaks, just mute it, and watch the subtitles and his expressions.

[24-Oct-19 04:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
As far as Bitcoin goes, I think we are returning to $4.2k to $4.9k levels, until the market makes its run to the 2020 halvening, if it does make one.

For Komodo, as some politician once said, bad times might be upon us but they aren't here to stay..

[24-Oct-19 04:04 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Sell you KMD and rebuy lower, if you are confident it's going lower. Nobody will tell you that you're a bad CM. You're only trying to accumulate more KMD.

[24-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the next alts boom probably will depend on real use case and usage, not potential use case

[24-Oct-19 05:58 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Yup

[24-Oct-19 05:59 AM] Privatoshi#9487
We had the first round of cuts, this summer.

[24-Oct-19 06:00 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think we only need 200 or so projects

[24-Oct-19 06:00 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Maybe 150.

[24-Oct-19 06:29 AM] tolken#2655
Good thing Komodo has lots of use cases and new ones on the horizon.

[24-Oct-19 06:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Privatoshi not just apple that pays taxes in ireland, all of the faang companies do

[24-Oct-19 06:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Up to the govts to close backdoors

[24-Oct-19 06:45 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Up to the govt to close backdoors?

[24-Oct-19 06:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Or up to the companies to design their tech in more responsible way? 

To me, that means leave as little information as possible for your own company to misuse or the government to harvest.

[24-Oct-19 06:54 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol the government will not be making any privacy concessions, anytime soon.

[24-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean close backdoors tax-wise

[24-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Regarding your comment that they were paying taxes in ireland

[24-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Regarding the tech there shouldnt be any backdoors at all

[24-Oct-19 08:24 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It kills me to think how much Komodo I could have bought if I waited to these prices üò≠ kudos to those who get in at this price or lower.
