Binance's volume in the time of trex's $280k was over $2M

`I only have 1.3k Komodos`
There was a few times in the not too distant past that I had 0, so 1300 isn't a bad start

[18-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
Hey Genie do you think is worth it to stake that amount?

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] CombatWombat#0279
I got way less then 1k KMD lol but i still got more then 99 percent of people so im rich üòÑ

[18-Oct-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
It's not really "staking", but that aside, I think every amount is worth taking a "free" 5.1% yearly

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
There's a minimum amount where you need to have more than the tx fees, but other than that, you can withdraw if you choose, or wait until you maybe have more or maybe give to someone else in the future

[18-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

KMD staying at 20k for a while would be great but you just know that Bitcoin will bust in and do the helicopter to ruin the whole party.
