unlike other ecosystems where an ICO is conducted based on some copy paste whitepaper, most all our ecosystem projects are wanting to get something in place first

[02-Oct-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Oct-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
10,000 seemed enough

[02-Oct-18 10:37 AM] house#8741
I mean, details on mining 😉

[02-Oct-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh it has a blcok reward of 1 coin.

[02-Oct-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
difficulty seems low enough to CPU mine I think.

[02-Oct-18 10:38 AM] house#8741

BB whith of BTC is getting as tight as ever

[02-Oct-18 11:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
last time it was this tight it marked the bottom of the 2014-2015 bear

[02-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Noooo let me accumulate more

How long do you think before the next move up/down @siu - Chainmakers

[02-Oct-18 11:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i cant tell about specific time

[02-Oct-18 11:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i can only say it will get very boring before something happens

[02-Oct-18 11:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
volatility has been almost null for the last couple of weeks

[02-Oct-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe bitcoin died and nobody told us?

[02-Oct-18 11:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hashrate is the real heartbeat of btc and that one is going to ath constantly

[02-Oct-18 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I could say its not dead, but in shock for high pressure 😂

[02-Oct-18 01:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@siu - Chainmakers  hashrate growing = more entities competing on the mining market ? should price follow?

[02-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or one whale keeps buying more NH 🤣

[02-Oct-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and refusing to sell

[02-Oct-18 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"conventional wisdom" says that when mining increases the cost of mining increases and the price should go up to cover miners' costs

rum 

[02-Oct-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As a miner, I like that idea
As a realist, I look at BTC and am constantly saddened by the inflated numbers people keep coming up with by picking the most expensive, least efficient equipment they can find

[02-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Historically price has followed hashrate

[02-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Thos the biggest unpeg of price/hashrate in BTC history

[02-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
hashrate follows price

[02-Oct-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the two are unclearly causally related

[02-Oct-18 01:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

changing topic a bit to BTC Cash - anyone got some idea if Bitmain will somehow force the price up? they filed for IPO + bouth some BCH wallet or sth... seems they are pushing

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, I can easily see why BM picked BCH over BTC
the community
As a whole, the BTC community as simultaneously said "Bitmain, you suck and you're ripping us off" and "Bitmain, we love you and we'll only buy our equipment from you"
Personally I hope BM strikes some deal with some folks and BCH destroys BTC

[02-Oct-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hashrate/price correlation is egg and chicken problem, yes.

[02-Oct-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But they normally move together... why this time it has bern different... no idea.

[02-Oct-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC hashrate has doubled during the bear market

[02-Oct-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@siu - Chainmakers  how far under 0.1

[02-Oct-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[02-Oct-18 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
0.09? 0.08?

[02-Oct-18 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
0.07?? :trollface:

[02-Oct-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I already offered 0.085 and turned that down... how much are you after... once what I have is gone I cant really get more... I wot mine it at this price... seems stupid when i mined 250k for $50

[02-Oct-18 01:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm

[02-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Yassin#3685

_has the capacity, but not the willingness_ :trollface:

[02-Oct-18 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what is the current price consensus?

[02-Oct-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for non-dumpers: 0.1-0.125

[02-Oct-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've seen dumpers offer to go as low as 0.06, but no real volume to it

[02-Oct-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hard to buy at 0.09 now

[02-Oct-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
other than smallish volumes

[02-Oct-18 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, so 0.1 it is

[02-Oct-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
probably for now 0.1 can clear decent volumes

[02-Oct-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 7000 for sale for 0.1 ish

Regarding hashrate/price

[02-Oct-18 08:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@siu - Chainmakers maybe someone has deployed advanced ASICs of some sort

[02-Oct-18 08:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Same electricity cost, higher hashpower

[02-Oct-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
