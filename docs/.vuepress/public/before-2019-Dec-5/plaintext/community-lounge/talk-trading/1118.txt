push price down till you get people that want to sell above, then market buy when there is enough without moving the market too much

Dash is doing its own thing,  not really KMD’s sphere,  I just like busting your balls 😛

[06-Sep-19 03:03 PM] dan.#2473
@Tek are you shilling that Dash was added to the kmd Dex in the Dash discord?

[06-Sep-19 03:03 PM] dan.#2473

[06-Sep-19 04:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I like the coin but the constant shill reminds me of vechain

[06-Sep-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464
I would like to see some chain analyse of Dash data where funds are not transfered from/to exchanges

[06-Sep-19 04:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[06-Sep-19 04:19 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

@Tek

[06-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464

[06-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464

[06-Sep-19 04:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
