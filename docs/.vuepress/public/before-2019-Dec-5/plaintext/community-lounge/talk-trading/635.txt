Once they have pushed it up enough, they will 100x short and make money the other way

[11-May-19 11:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

What is komodo cryptocurrency?¬†¬†Well ¬†as its name suggests it's an online currency that allows users and websites to transfer funds between each other. ¬†The only difference is that the funds are not issued by any government but are instead created by the komodo dragon ¬†the giant fish in Japanese mythology that is known for its huge teeth. ¬†In fact that's how the currency works ‚Äì the dragon generates new tokens that become money and if they are all generated and used by the same komodo then komodo coins will be all set to be accepted and backed by the komodo dragon in turn. ¬†The komodo dragon is the only creature that can issue tokens and thus in order to issue komodo coins there must be one and only one dragon that is able to issue them. ¬†This means you can only issue komodo coins to one person ¬†of your choosing. ¬†And all of your komodo coins will be backed by the komodo dragon

@Deleted User Oh people will for sure be buying alts, but whether or not they buy KMD is another story

[12-May-19 01:57 AM] meatspoon#7860
I have a noobish question that I hope you all will forgive me for...  I understand and appreciate and agree with the idea that whales might be driving this rally.  I know I understand close to nothing and can be wrong about anything (and I probably am!).  But I have been watching charts a lot for many, many months.  This recent BTC parabolic move over the last day/week has really nice consolidation patterns of lower/high higer/low within multiple time frames (4-hour, 1-hour, 15-minute).  This would lead me to believe that if the charts were being "painted" by whales that they would be using highly detailed small brushes on the 15 minute intervals to create their masterpiece.  Conclusion: seems unlikely this BTC surge is manufactured.  But my TA and crystal ball predictions both suck, so...

[12-May-19 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not sure about KMD, but I think some corporate issued cryptocurrency varient will sure reach 1 BTC = <that currency token>, even if short bit of time

[12-May-19 02:34 AM] Vertigo#0439
That's great news ! Unless...     Bitcoin $1 KMD $1

[12-May-19 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hehe... that thought also came to my mind

[12-May-19 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

What if binance hack was an inside job to accumulate cheap alts during btc surge

[12-May-19 05:46 AM] Keppie#5156
The fact that deposits are suspended, is a big impact on a lot of alts bleeding right now. No one can buy the ‚Äòdip‚Äô on Binance

KMD market has not shown a lot of strength this year during these BTC runs, so not very surprising.   I'm just hoping the marketing team is ready by the time alts start to run!

how much will bitcoin be worth in one month from now?

In bitcoin prices we can only compare to the value to the US dollar and the value to Euro since it's hard to compare the two values.

The chart below gives a value to the money in a month.

Source: pricecharts.com

As you can see it's close between US$2,000 ‚Äì US$5,000 according to bitcoin. The difference, if any, between bitcoin and the US dollar and Euro are 0.005 dollars in every month.

[12-May-19 09:22 AM] Tek#5253
well if the predictions of 100k aare true it will have to go strong a lot of times I guess

[12-May-19 09:30 AM] Markus#5464
if we close above 7.5k ish then its possible that we no longer will see lower prices and that bullrun officially have started
