I wonder how the miners are there - are they mined at a loss in the hope of growth or sold to pay for electricity😅

The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. 2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake. 4 Even though I walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

There are tons of value in Komodo ecosystem, yet the market doesn't reflect this value in token price. It doesn't matter, Komodo ecosystem is like a puzzle and the pieces are coming together slowly but nicely. Bigger picture will be more visible, when all this tech will start to get real usage. 
- Ppl will use DEX, bc it will be easy to use and liquid, trustless and without KYC, atomic-dex will have the easiest onboarding ever. 
- Ppl will use PIRATE bc transacting with privacy makes much more sense then revealing my balance to other party. 
- Ppl will use KMD bc it will be one of the most liquid base pair in DEX. Look at the value of Litecoin, all of that comes from liquidity mostly.

also regarding atomicdex kmd might not be the most liquid pair cause other communities might see it attractive and move from CEX to atomicdex

even if KMD not be the most liquid pair, the fee from DEX will be converted to KMD, either way KMD demand will rise

@PTYX how much does it cost for chainzilla to onbord a coin on atomicdex compare to cryptobridge or waves?

[03-Sep-19 07:30 PM] PTYX#6840
The listing fee is exploratory for the first 100 listings. It's currently benchmarked at $6,500 for the integration and 2 spv (lite) servers. Afterwards there's a cost of $1000/annually for maintenance. As more providers and wallets add the DEX we will offer more advanced packages with multiple listings or more custom services. ChainZilla takes care of providing the project assistance in running their liquidity provider nodes and they can even outsource that to us.

As more features and payment options are added to the DEX, the price will likely go up.

yeah the dex is something unique to komodo, definitely not priced in yet

Extortion by RedFox labs

[04-Sep-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
```What exactly went wrong with Redfoxlabs?
```
Everything. And we are taking the necessary steps to protect ourselves and others. At the time, we thought we had a good partnership going on. I had almost daily conversations with their CEO. At the time of the partnership agreement, K64 was under a different company structure and mistakes were made on our side - which nearly cost our funding twice. RedFOX Labs was aware of the nature of these issues and we decided to keep the nature of the partnership under the radar. However, since RedFOX had an opportunity, we decided to back RedFOX with an official statement of our partnership agreement on our Twitter account. 

We (@Meyse and myself) had planned on the day on the live stream to finalize that deal. Out of nowhere, the CTO of RedFOX Labs called us an exit scam. I called the CEO regarding the nature of what was going on, and the response we got is that if we made the transfer all would go away in a second. Then - and I quote "a line is drawn in the sand". As Max was also already director, the both of us decided not to continue with the transfer at all. It didn't take long to see certain things being unfold. 

We offered RedFOX Labs to renew the terms of our partnership and since there was a DD planned were, time was of the essence, the CEO needed this to be dealt with before that time. That's why Max flew to Vietnam. However, they apparently weren't going to sign anything. Max who put everything aside, felt quite upset because of this. Eventually threats with lawsuits were made and an insinuation of that the CEO of RedFOX Labs was "worried about his safety" (speaking of Max). He called me a liar and Max my puppet. Not the solid base for any partnership.

Sadly, we had to review our situation and more rabbits came out of the hat.
(we will further disclose these rabbits soon)
(we have also already have consulted with our law firms and taken various legal steps)

[04-Sep-19 12:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
```
How is K64 team planning on integration of blockchain into gaming now that KMD and Rfox has withdrawn their support towards their project. How is K64 planning to train their team?
```
We can already build our Antara modules and have enough people on board with the right skills. We are currently doing sessions where team members train each other and are developing our own training materials. 

Regarding the integration of the blockchain, we assume that Komodo is truly decentralized - but assuming things have always worked out bad for us - so, we most likely continue as we are doing now. However, we are considering a fork or reaching out to Verus. However, that is a road that takes planning, time and resources.

```I won't say anything on the exact details of what happened between K64 and RedFox, all that will be soon elaborated by other sources and the entire facts will be exposed. I will only say the entire Komodo community is victim of incredible covert attacks, threats, lies and manipulations that have been going on for a long time. It's mainly been the inside job by a specific person who holds a very important team position (and possibly other insider accomplices). He's been abusing his powers for personal reasons on many occasions, in this case trying hard to kill a rival gaming project. He organized the mudslinging campaign, sabotaged all efforts to finalize the deal and abused all those who dared to question him.

Unfortunately the mountain of dirt being uncovered seems to go much deeper than the mere K64 story. There have been other abuses and serious threats to many people, including a bullet delivered by mail. I've heard that some people have known for a long time but have been too afraid to talk. Myself I'm not at ease since these people can know my address. And they know other sketchy people.```
