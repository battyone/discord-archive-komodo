It has not happened yet

[29-Dec-18 11:03 PM] digital bullion#8223
It was said to be a "joint press release" with the exchange and it would be anounced "this week" which is now two weeks ago.

It was Daniel Pigeon who mentioned it in the marketing channel.

[29-Dec-18 11:05 PM] ver_User#6608
I guess they decided to accumulate kmd for 2 weeks instead üòâ

[29-Dec-18 11:08 PM] digital bullion#8223
The original statement was December 11th

looks like alt rally is over for now... let's see what kmd does here, will it continue as black sheep?

[30-Dec-18 12:38 AM] tolken#2655

KMD/BTC: Looks a little bullish here, thinking a test of the first resistance zone in the red box may happen at some point soon, ideal entry is in/around the blue box, already broken out, not optimal to enter at this second https://imgur.com/a/GkVsSE5

I wont be back on that any time very soon, but my plan is to get a GUI working early next year.

[30-Dec-18 10:19 AM] Mylo#8306
web page gui ^^

[30-Dec-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no working version that I know of... but all the code is on git and it builds... needs to be checked and imporved a little bit.

[30-Dec-18 10:19 AM] Mylo#8306
ok.   fun for 2019

[30-Dec-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I got too much else on first ... thats not a priority, making that taught me everything I needed to know to get labs really working good, and fixing many long outstanding bugs, since all that my skills are much better and I will be able to make it work a heap better/easier than it was.

KMD seems to accumulate quite fast when staking

[30-Dec-18 12:59 PM] crumb#2550
KMD has no staking. KMD reward /= staking

[30-Dec-18 05:42 PM] ver_User#6608
momentum is really gaining now, what I'd like to know is if we end up with 7 days of pure fomo like the Dec run, I almost don't want to experience that in real time. I assumed that was a pump and dump, but most alts did pure fomo at that time didn't they? 

keep watching kmdeth for serious breakout potential - eth is at some major levels so may stall a little, but that too, if it breaks out, will be pretty powerful IMO

[30-Dec-18 05:52 PM] LocoMB#8593

[30-Dec-18 07:22 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Is this pump just because the rebrand is listed on coin market calendar for the 31st?

[30-Dec-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
since when is 7% a pump?

[30-Dec-18 07:24 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Ok not a pump...but this rise is most likely from coin market calendar saying rebrand finishes tomorrow.  When it sounds like that won‚Äôt be done until mid 2019 now right?

[30-Dec-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt many with deep pockets use such things to trade

[30-Dec-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810

in the meatime, there seems to be not much KMD for sale below 30k sats

[30-Dec-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
whales been munching on the 50 cents KMD for months

[30-Dec-18 08:18 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Whales been eating at KMD when it started dipping below 1 dollar, they just do it slowly over months. They expect a large amount of it is being locked away for rewards so easier to get those high returns.

[30-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
high returns on top of the expected price appreciation, buying during bear market lows is pretty low risk if you have patience

[30-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810

KMD is looking really good. It had a great inception year. Then had a correction that tested inception lows. Which held so far

Q for siu

[30-Dec-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i was looking at the weekly charts for many alts, and most all are still below the long term average

[30-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Back in 2001 I purchased a bank CD with 6% yearly interest, minimal was 1k dollars. I had no idea at the time that deal would never come up again.

[30-Dec-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD seems to be one of the few that is clearly broken above the long term weekly trend
