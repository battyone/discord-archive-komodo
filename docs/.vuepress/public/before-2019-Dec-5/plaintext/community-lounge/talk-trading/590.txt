So 0.6btc / 52000 ....

[30-Apr-19 05:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
1153

[30-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah that was his latest calc

[30-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
seems a lot of miners giving up

[30-Apr-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
different miners pay different prices. 5 to 10 BTC per day of selling pressure

[30-Apr-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
about 100 BTC/day of volumes

[30-Apr-19 05:57 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
They need ppl to need a reason to buy vbk otherwise its always gonna be sell off really.

[30-Apr-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
until they actually use the BTC tx, it is just $1mil+ per month for spam that raises BTC txfees for everybody else. until some other coin uses it, then it is just for VBK and they still dont explain how they can determine which PoP are from the attacker and which from non-attacker

apparently they say their whitepaper is out of date, so just need to look at their source code to figure it out. oh wait... its closed source

Ah 3 hours old, seems no one cares

[30-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But it is backed by 74% cash

[30-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the other 26% is backed by bitfinex shares

[30-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was 100% backed at first, but it had 850m ceised

[30-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so even if you value bitfinex at 0 usd, 1 usdt = 0,74 usd

@Hollowman9000 what irony level is that tweet asking that question? I feel like your meme pics are needed at this point

if detection is protection, what is wrong with "grep reorg debug.log"

[01-May-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
of course it would need to be more than a one line cron script and customized to the daemon, but still maybe 10 lines for a cron based 51% attack detector

[01-May-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
detection is most definitely not protection. detection is detection. also they never responded how they can tell which PoP miner is the attacker, so it is not clear to me how they can detect properly

[01-May-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we can give them a pass on implementation bugs, all chains have had those. But when the design is flawed, you cant actually fix it without redesigning it

[01-May-19 08:20 AM] Tek#5253
looks like buying BCH yesterday was the right decision

[01-May-19 09:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Going to sell that dead cat bounce or what?

[01-May-19 10:22 AM] Tek#5253
