Trying to get people to find it and then understand what it is and what its capabilities are have proved to be a giant hurdle.  Not to mention explaining it to someone takes a whole lotta dumbing down to get the average Joe to understand.

[05-Nov-18 11:09 PM] ryman112#0068
Anon but not google.  90 percent of people use Google unfortunately

[05-Nov-18 11:13 PM] ryman112#0068
I get food trucks a Island the wiki for the dragon a national park some language app etc.  Top of the second page is Komodo platdorm

[05-Nov-18 11:16 PM] ryman112#0068
Anyhow point is that you need to know exactly what you are looking for to do any research.

[05-Nov-18 11:17 PM] ryman112#0068
A national park in India isn't a good choice by Google for a guy from the Midwest U.S. lol

[05-Nov-18 11:41 PM] ryman112#0068
Could be but all I do is research crypto so I find it odd that it doesn't pop up sooner

[05-Nov-18 11:42 PM] ryman112#0068
Now if I Google Ethereum bam!  Top hit with news and everything

[06-Nov-18 12:00 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it's a slight correction

[06-Nov-18 12:00 AM] meatspoon#7860
Part of the search is the word.  Ethereum is a good choice in that it is a unique word, yes?  The choice of name is hugely important

[06-Nov-18 12:02 AM] meatspoon#7860
I know there are plenty of people in here who have no love for Ethereum, but the name itself was arguably a good choice.  Unique, kinda techy, Ether is also good, symbolic, maybe a bit ironic, catchy

[06-Nov-18 12:04 AM] meatspoon#7860
Komodo is a cool word phonetically, the animal is cool, but it isnt unique which will scramble search results a bit.  But I also agree with @bpkdasbaum because anyone searching for cryptos will be savvy enough to add "crypto" or "coin" to their search.

[06-Nov-18 12:05 AM] meatspoon#7860
One of the things Komodo has going for it is that it will turn up if people are researching privacy coins, passive income coins, smart contract/platform coins.  So there are many roads that lead to Komodo for people who are digging deeper than a shovel-full or two

[06-Nov-18 12:37 AM] ryman112#0068
And if you are only targeting crypto savy people you will have a small market.  Very very small.

[06-Nov-18 12:47 AM] meatspoon#7860
True.  My crystal ball is broken, but if I had to guess, the entire crypto space isn't going to attract a whole lot of new people/interest until we start seeing bullish price action.  When things start running up, you are going to have a whole new wave of people getting interested and starting their descent into the rabbit hole.  Then you don't have so small of a market.  Its just so hard to get most normies/NPC's to even see the potential in Bitcoin and even fewer see it in smart contracts or anything deeper down the hole.

[06-Nov-18 12:48 AM] ryman112#0068
Agree

[06-Nov-18 12:51 AM] ryman112#0068
I found out only because my cousin has been following this since before kmd.  It was pure luck I found out.  I hardly see that side of the family.  We are talking years between seeing or talking and he happened to be out of work and I got him working for me and one day at lunch he started on about Komodo.  Been hooked ever since.  Pure luck lol

[06-Nov-18 12:56 AM] meatspoon#7860
Good on you for being open minded and pursuing it.

[06-Nov-18 01:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
The killer app has yet to be implemented. Grandma proofing private key ownership, and just using the tech in general is another hurdle. But the use cases are there, and the implications are epic. We are still at the start of the marathon.

[06-Nov-18 03:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, everything hinges on BTC for now, it seems. But that isn’t really a bad thing, IMO. The giant dorito chip triangle is nearly complete. Lots of encouraging news around BTC from custody options to trading options to ETF’s and greater mainstream acceptance.  And historically Nov/Dec is strong for BTC. Its just a matter of time.

[06-Nov-18 03:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
In a sense KMD can benefit from more sideways time.  The next BTC run will bring a lot of interest and KMD will benefit most from that wave if it has its products as polished as can be when the runup happens.  It would be great if Ideas by Nature finished their makeover prior to the run up. It would also be nice if privacy transactions could be done without synching the whole chain. We will get some disappointed folks if we are advertising private transactions.... but you have to synch up for 13 hours prior to sending your private tx. Heh. This calm before the (hopeful) storm is an opportunity for the team to streamline everything from wallets to its presentation of what KMD is.

[06-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Still not very bad for kmd, only time will tell what the past weeks meant

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, no fundamentals have changed. This is just a bear market.  Its what project do during these times that set them up for how they do when the money starts flooding in again.

[06-Nov-18 03:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
I really hope KMD sorts out the wallet though. The wallet is sort of a first impression thing that will either be comforting or worrisome.  Anyone who buys kmd is gonna interface with Agama. The more simple and streamlined the better.

[06-Nov-18 04:00 PM] tolken#2655
My big hope is the mm2 team makes some huge dev gains soon and bdex becomes THE place to trade KMD. So want to see it working to it’s potential.

Ethereum is everything BTC is not. BTC is a legacy coin that works in ATMs and most have heard about it. That's about it. It's marketshare is being naturally erroded by upstarts that do more. However 'utility' is still a concept 'technically-minded ppl' think quite differently about than entrepreneurs or philosophers.
