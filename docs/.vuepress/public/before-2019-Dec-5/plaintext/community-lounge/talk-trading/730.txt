[04-Jun-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my support level now is... "wha dafuq was I thinking when I agreed to work on all of these things at once?"

[04-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Tek#5253
serves them right

[04-Jun-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A private company hacked != "Ripple hacked"

[04-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
ripple official website seems to == ripple

[04-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Tek#5253
oh boi

[04-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Tek#5253
O BOI

[04-Jun-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"Ripple hacked" = "someone hacked the protocol"
otherwise
someone hacking website X means "Bitcoin hacked"
🤦🏽

[04-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Tek#5253
if they hacked one of the 21 validators

[04-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Tek#5253
then they got hacked

[04-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Tek#5253
if they hacked the server website that holds the list of validators

[04-Jun-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So, Komodo was hacked when I got a worm that stole my wallet.dat?

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Tek#5253
serious question

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Malti#3948
lol tek

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`no you got hacked.`
exactly my feken point

[04-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Tek#5253
> I got a worm
> notary operator

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why r you even a notary operator`
Because you didn't run against me and get more votes than me?

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
🍿

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253
come to think of it

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253
if you can be a notary I can be one too

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253
I can prove certain skills.

[04-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 02:03 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

either I do my job or I don't; you running is moot to me

[04-Jun-19 02:07 PM] klein#5233
@Tek are you going to collect on a bounty?

[04-Jun-19 02:07 PM] Tek#5253
m trying to swing myself up with part of my stack

[04-Jun-19 02:08 PM] klein#5233
🤦

[04-Jun-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it takes you a year of calling people "pleb" while only banking 25k, then you have bigger issues

[04-Jun-19 02:09 PM] klein#5233

[04-Jun-19 02:10 PM] klein#5233
In my defense I was trying to be nice

[04-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Tek#5253

`Genie will help you with anything you need to run your node.`
That's actually true, my nausea created by some folks never stops me from helping them

[04-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Tek#5253
I wont take your help. I''ll take your notary position.

[04-Jun-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I wont take your help. I''ll take your notary position.`
The former is a mistake and the latter is likely impossible.

[04-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Tek#5253
its possible. I just need to let the kmd voters know you got hacked. Then I win.

[04-Jun-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can't *take* my position, it's mine to give away if I do poorly at my job

[04-Jun-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Voters only matter to me if I do a poor job

[04-Jun-19 02:15 PM] dan.#2473
epeen measuring ftw

[04-Jun-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
All being equal, there's a 50% chance I don't need to be elected again to retain my node

[04-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Tek#5253
HEAR YE HEAR YE.
This voting round you can vote for :
#! computergeenlet. ( he got hacked and hosted on windows before lmao )
#! Tek (the best at spotting whales and decent at linux)

[04-Jun-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the best at spotting whales`
And yet your broke self is still trading on pennies 🤷🏽

[04-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
I unironically made great trades

[04-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
lately

[04-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
my capital is lacking but not for long

[04-Jun-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you made 30 trades to make what 1 smart trade with the same amount would net

[04-Jun-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my capital is lacking but not for long`
I'm not talking about the size of your stack when I say "pennies", I mean that you're literally making pennies per trade because you are making micro-trades vs holding 1-2 more days and making 1 real trade

[04-Jun-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and your net gain is less

[04-Jun-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
like swapping to BTC hoping for 10k and passing on 15%

[04-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Tek#5253
blind man

[04-Jun-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
this blind man called that a bad trade when you said you did it and was proven right less than 72 hrs later 🤷🏽

[04-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Tek#5253
i didn't , you can't read

[04-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Tek#5253
you blind man
