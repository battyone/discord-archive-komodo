btc going back up would be bad for us now

[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Oszy#5734
just stay there

[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
sad part is we were like 15k or so when btc was 11k last time

[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
if it goes to 14k we will be somewhere under the ground

[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah kmd doesn't follow, it had it's own mind. only goes down when btc up

[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Yassin#3685
9200 SOON

[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Oszy#5734
we should be at 13-14k at least now considering btc fall

[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
ye

[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
KMD always innovating

[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
innovation clearly does not do shit to price

[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] yorklab#7270
There was an 82K sell wall at 15K. It is now at about half, I think that is who just sold. Better to get those sellers out of the way now.

[30-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Oszy#5734
considering we  were at $1.11 for a long time, btc does only affect us in a negative way üòÑ

[30-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
we were 1,7$ before btc started to go nut

[30-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Oszy#5734
yep

[30-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
fell to 1,1$

[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] FBTroy#9693
I never look at dollars, just sats. I believe BTC will trend up long term, so it is just about getting my KMD stack always higher.

[30-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
my target for kmd this year is 32k sats

[30-Jun-19 02:33 PM] yorklab#7270
I got in early and high, so my break even is in the mid 20K area now. Seems like a million miles away from this point though.

[30-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Oszy#5734
don't worry when btc goes to 3k we will be at 20k :troll:

[30-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Markus#5464
im not sure how kmd will perform this year....alot of btc action about to popup upcoming months, U got Fidelity and Bakkt about to launch around the corner

[30-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Markus#5464
this could slow down alts

[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
I'm expecting kmd will be in top 10 in the future and it's one of the main base currency being used globally üòÉ

Kmd devs built up great techs and still building cutting edge technology, I wouldnt be surprised if one day kmd will be the one of the first to surpass btc in ranking.

[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] jansako#3330
Come on, of course we would all love that but surprised? Of you course we would be... how about let's get into the top 10 first..

[30-Jun-19 04:31 PM] AkiraX#8269
Maybe someone took the money out of crypto and ran

[30-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Oszy#5734

[30-Jun-19 08:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@FBTroy Get the parents a ledger,  then tell them the first day of the month go to https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/, click claim click yes to export pub key, verify the address on the device is the same as website, done. 2 minute job every month on the 1st.

Can you short kmd on bitmex?

[30-Jun-19 08:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@bishop seems like it, my friend is going to be so pissed, swapped 35k verus to pirate 2 days ago LOL

[30-Jun-19 08:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@AkiraX no, market too small for it

[30-Jun-19 08:06 PM] bishop#9773
Well, both ARRR and VRSC have potential so while the short-term was poor timing, I think it will be fine in the long run

[30-Jun-19 08:09 PM] Markus#5464
how much is it up?

[30-Jun-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep, he did not have any pirate so wanted to balance it out, that has not changed

[30-Jun-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
hit 2x on low volume of pirate basically

[30-Jun-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
0.3KMD vs 0.15

[30-Jun-19 08:10 PM] Markus#5464
wops

[30-Jun-19 08:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He will get over it, but he did swap a big chunk of his Verus.....probably should not have suggested it to him üòÑ

[30-Jun-19 08:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
oh well

[30-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Markus#5464
hard to predict anything in this market....its so volatile anything can literally happen

[30-Jun-19 08:12 PM] bishop#9773
Verus is too attractive to swap here when the stakes are so good

[30-Jun-19 08:12 PM] bishop#9773
and with so many of the existing coin supply time locked, the amount staking is a small pool

[30-Jun-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep calculation is about 25% a year.....crazy

[30-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Markus#5464
thats alot

[30-Jun-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Did you get your fill bishop?

[30-Jun-19 08:13 PM] bishop#9773
Some, but not all

[30-Jun-19 08:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus yeah it is, good thing supernet is the biggest holder üòÑ

[30-Jun-19 08:14 PM] bishop#9773
yeah, i think supernet and mshark have like 2M+

[30-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Markus#5464
who is mshark btw

[30-Jun-19 08:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
mshark was like a hedge fund of sorts, it is another assetchain

[30-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Markus#5464
alright

[30-Jun-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@bishop james said the mshark holding is wrong on dexstats, the allocation is supernet i think

[30-Jun-19 08:15 PM] bishop#9773
oh

[30-Jun-19 08:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
it says msharkold or something

[30-Jun-19 08:16 PM] bishop#9773
either way, james is probably staking 10% of the available coins

7% i think
