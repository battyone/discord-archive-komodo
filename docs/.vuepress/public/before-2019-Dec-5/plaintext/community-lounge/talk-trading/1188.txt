Hold on. Might get left off Bittrex?

[28-Oct-19 04:54 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That would be major bs

[28-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Why not find a fiat onramp to DAI or USDC?

[28-Oct-19 04:55 PM] Privatoshi#9487

[28-Oct-19 04:59 PM] Markus#5464
ye for sure

[28-Oct-19 04:59 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I mean quick ways to purchase btc

[28-Oct-19 05:02 PM] Flint#6435
But ARRR pumped very high KMD next? But seriously, the trading volumes are incomparable, although at KMD they are still quite low, but soon the euphoria will end and the money will flow from those who are now pumping 30% into a real working project like Komodo

Pretty sure btc will test the 7k range again. We're not 9ut of the flag yet and a pump like we just had is very unhealthy... I wouldn't chase it.
Kmdbtc needs to pump to 70c soon or we make a bear div on the daily.

So with bitifinex on the cusp of shutting down and tether scam going away what do you guys think?

[29-Oct-19 12:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Apparently bitifinex has been connected to money laundering specifically drug money en masse

vitcim of fraud or not the money is going to seized for the impending investigation into crypto capital ü§∑

[29-Oct-19 02:26 AM] PTYX#6840
that money was seized in early 2018

[29-Oct-19 02:26 AM] PTYX#6840
it was over a half billion

[29-Oct-19 02:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they said it was 880m

[29-Oct-19 02:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Bitfinex has to continue to print Tether.
You know why? Their legal fees.
I'm serious, their legal fees must be an insane amount of money.
Bitfinex has been elusive and they'll continue to do so.

[29-Oct-19 02:55 AM] PTYX#6840
tether admits that usdt is not backed 1 to 1 with dollars

[29-Oct-19 02:55 AM] PTYX#6840
they now have a "basket" of things that aren't liquid

[29-Oct-19 03:06 AM] jspook16#3059
It was only a matter of time...

[29-Oct-19 03:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
tether from what CMC says its about 1/3 of all liquidity in crypto

[29-Oct-19 03:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think we could see a 30% drop with bitifinex disappears with tether

[29-Oct-19 03:21 AM] BlackJesus#6161
1/3 of all crypto volume moves through tether

[29-Oct-19 03:22 AM] bishop#9773
Perhaps coins get bid up as people exit worthless tether. ü§î

[29-Oct-19 03:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Possibly more, I truly believe circulation drives price for crypto and fiat alike.

[29-Oct-19 03:22 AM] bishop#9773
Think about it, if you are sitting on a bunch of tether on the exchanges, what are you going to do with it?

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
throw it away for something thats worth money

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
(assuming it comes to that)

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
But when the bills comes due they will have to cash out of whatever they're holding

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
correct, so you bid the hell out of whatever markets have asks

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
sending crypto down

[29-Oct-19 03:23 AM] bishop#9773
Bills comes due all the time

Could be but if they truly go under they will liquidate

[29-Oct-19 03:24 AM] bishop#9773
who will

[29-Oct-19 03:24 AM] BlackJesus#6161
bitifinex

[29-Oct-19 03:25 AM] bishop#9773
That's another issue all together

[29-Oct-19 03:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
it all comes down to whats in the basket. If it's just financial instruments it could already be worthless.

I thought bitfinex did the LEO ieo to fill the hole the seized funds left?

[29-Oct-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They raised a billion or so and now tether was backed 1:1 by usd again
