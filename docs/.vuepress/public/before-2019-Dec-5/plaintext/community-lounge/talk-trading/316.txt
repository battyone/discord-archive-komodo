I guess thats why drug delaers keep using it 🤷

[28-Nov-18 02:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
usually stupid mistakes give ppl away, they can use cash anon anyways

[28-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cash is safer, but requires you driving around with drugs on you ... which is the fastest way to get caught

[28-Nov-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I dont see USD failing... not anytime soon

[28-Nov-18 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Since 2009 usd value has actually been going up, not down

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That's a good point Siu, Mainly because at least 40 trillion has to be paid back in $ 🤣  they cant let it just disappear

[28-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah thats true ... but they printed more moeny in the last 10 years than in the entrie history of the dollar up to that point ,and it increased in value ... seems a lot like japan in the 80/90s ...

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
USD is not immune from big inflation

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact,the more debt there is the more incentive there is to inflateit away

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
That is why central banks claim that a certain percentage of inflation is "good".

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
its not good for you, me or any other consumer, its just good for the Keynesians who want to print money, create debt, and then service that debt with dollars of lesser value.  Its how they keep the scheme going...

[28-Nov-18 03:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
and its also why central banks claim that deflation is bad... as if its bad that your dollar buys more this year than last.  Deflation is great for the consumer, saver, prudent adult.  Deflation is awful for central banks and governments, because they can't run up spending and debt.

[28-Nov-18 03:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The problem is that its not inflation what is actually making usd more valuable, but deflation.

[28-Nov-18 03:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is why 48 trillion printed didnt actually have much effect in the overall value of usd

[28-Nov-18 03:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I thought that the $'s buying power had actually eroded like 90% of its value since inception?

[28-Nov-18 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes... but from 2009 and on those dynamics have changed.

[28-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Madzi#5769
Guys where can I sell my pirate

[28-Nov-18 03:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Madzi @ digital price .io if the deposits and withdrawls are open. they were down for maintenance last i heard

[28-Nov-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
More usd has been printed in the last 10 years than ever in history. Yet, it has maintained value

[28-Nov-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well didnt japan inflate it money supply by like 400% in the 80/90s (maybe even more) while ,anageing to keep its exchange rate and putrchase power the same? we all know how that ended

[28-Nov-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why wouls that be?

[28-Nov-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Nov-18 03:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe they printed all the money but didnt spend it ... but that doesnt really work, becaues japan did this exact thing... and they definatly spent the money

The other thing to consider si that most of the printed USD is just in the stock market...

[28-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and asnt really filtered down into the actual populace yet

[28-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and in a crash

[28-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will just be destroyed

[28-Nov-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and thus never really existed int he first place

[28-Nov-18 03:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to me it looks like $ is getting value only as better to other fiat, meaning, maybe $ is worth shit, but other fiat are even worse. It's simplification as it also is getting value to gold or maybe other assets. It may also be that USD is most common "intermediate moeny" like BTC is for alts, so if you like to cash out your alt first you buy BTC so it value should grow (if globally users cash out alts). So when in global economy ventures cash out USD could grow for a moment. Until financial guys realize that all fiat are overvalued and overall system collapses. Still it such case will be better to have USD/EUR then some funny money. But probably even better to own land and gold.

[28-Nov-18 03:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
It's not clear to ma how exactly it happens that fiat gets defeated - meaning nobody wants $ as there everyone owns so many of them that thay dont want any more and big inflation comes? This also means products are much more valuable then $. To make it happend banks should give away so many $ to everyone so that people dont want any more, idk... can't imagine the exact process scenario yet

Ah actually I confused deflation with inflation here. More I imagine inflation - meaning however bank prited so much money, market will still miss the money... quite strange situation

Greece I understand a bit - they are basically slaves of GErmany - so many loans from GErmany they will work on that till eol

[28-Nov-18 03:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
GErmany play nice here - they require EU to help "greece" so that the money in the end go do GErmany 😃

it seems it is zeros sum game

[28-Nov-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if banks lend money to people who do not give it back it seems when all collapses everyone stays with nothing ?

[28-Nov-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
meaning - because people didnt give money back - banks take money from all deposit accounts.. just from different people

[28-Nov-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so the problem here is actually some people play parasite role - take loan and "eat the money" while other work hard , collect money and loose them

[28-Nov-18 04:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
@siu - Chainmakers We have not seen the ill effects of inflation because the US exports their inflation by 1) the OPEC deal and 2) being a world reserve currency.  Because countries are forced to buy oil in USD and therefore forced to settle trade deficits in USD, our inflation is spread across the globe

{Reactions}
👌 

[28-Nov-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but this is like side efect, true problem is when financial crash hits supply chains - when destroyed hard to rebuild

[28-Nov-18 04:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
but when we lose reserve currency status or when oil is traded in non USD, all that inflation should rush back to the US creating a cluster-F of extreme proportions

[28-Nov-18 04:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
on global level looks to me like "reorganizxation of structures" - production and supply, delivery. When crash comes it destroys it, and rebuilding (reorg) take a lot of time. It takes a lot of time as it's hard to rebuild trust and also due to slow communication - human interface i slow.

[28-Nov-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Oil is already traded in non USD, just not enough to make a diffrence but that day will come.

[28-Nov-18 04:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Oil was traded (briefly) for other currencies by Sadam and Ghadafi. We saw how that turned out.

[28-Nov-18 04:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Maybe in time there will be some mechanisms to support faster reorg after crash to rebuild production and supply. WE have much better communication - internet and mobile phones and thanks to blockchains (security tokens, token based locked real products?) maybe more trust could be built into the system.

[28-Nov-18 04:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it is unlikely oil will be masively traded in other fiat, as other fiat have less trust. USD the strongest.

[28-Nov-18 04:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
There are also ways that the government fudges data on inflation. If you want a laugh, look up hedonic adjusted inflation and you can get an explanation as to why a $2000 flat screen is “cheaper” than a $600 CRT TV.

[28-Nov-18 04:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
So they fudge the numbers and create false deflation in certain sectors to try and artificially balance out the rampant inflation we all see with groceries, rent, utilities, etc

[28-Nov-18 04:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Hmm  if I udnerstand correctly the crash comes due to very big miss-trust of collected debt. Debt is created as promise. I promise you to deliver if you pay me now. You pay now, I just promise to deliver later, and there is the paper. Also is is chained. I deliver if other guys who promised me to deliver will do that later. Then in time some % of such deals comes to default. All good until those papers are not being traded - these debts can be hidden and stashed. A casino game, But in the end few or none players understand who got shited during the game. Sth like this I see. Here blockchain (public leadger) could help clarify where is the problematic debt maybe? Right now if understand problem is there are papers over papers, not so public and not easy to check - not digital. Does it make any sense what I wright? :pirate:

seems if people just allow themselve to be surveilled, all will be well and we can have wall street totally take over crypto

The real Problem was done hundreds years before, in theory capitalsim would only work with 3 key parameters, all of them were ignored from the beginng.... so lets keep the system running

[28-Nov-18 05:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
Capitalism is always there, under the surface. Capitalism (black market) is the only thing that has been keeping Venezuelans alive.

[28-Nov-18 05:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
And capitalist black markets are the only thing that allows socialist regimes to live as long as they do.

[28-Nov-18 05:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
After all, capitalism is just a lack of coercion. One party either decides to trade goods/services with another or not.

@meatspoon yes and thats why capitalism cant survive by definition, if its all about endless gain in an non endless world

[28-Nov-18 05:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
That isnt what its about

[28-Nov-18 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Capitalism is just trade without coercion. Some make good decisions and make money, some make poor decisions and their money flows away from them. Which is good. Capital should flow to those who make good choices.

[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
And, like i said, capitalism always survives because its natural and it will keep people alive when central planning takes over everything (like Ven, Cuba, the USSR back in the day)

[28-Nov-18 05:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
Now, i would say that the media and politicians have done a good job at obscuring what capitalism really is. They want us to believe that Crony Capitalism is Capitalism. It isnt tho.

[28-Nov-18 05:36 PM] blubbi#0643
only why we got not an better economic system at this time, doesnt mean capitalism is the only way

[28-Nov-18 05:37 PM] blubbi#0643
@Deleted User so tell me how u can gain endless if the resources are limited

[28-Nov-18 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860

People need to value what is produced tho to actually buy it.

[28-Nov-18 05:40 PM] blubbi#0643
so work is related to food and food got to produced and the field of production is limited by the earth
