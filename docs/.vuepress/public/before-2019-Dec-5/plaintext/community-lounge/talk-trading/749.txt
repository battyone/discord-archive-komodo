I think some credit is due to KMD marketing, stories like this don‚Äôt write themselves. Someone had to help get this news out; the type is all very similar across articles.

[06-Jun-19 03:46 PM] meatspoon#7860

Great spin on the events honestly

[06-Jun-19 03:51 PM] tolken#2655
well, marketing isn‚Äôt quite appropriate to describe this; but public relations/PR and how news and stories about Kmd are formed and distributed. I suspect KMD has had a hand in explaining what has happened.

Today, we recognized the generalized loss across lenders in the BTC margin lending pool. As a result, the principal of all active BTC loans as of 14:00 UTC today has been reduced by 16.202%. This impacted 0.4% of Polo users. Details: https://t.co/s7Ql6j2sw3

also this:

Dear Poloniex Customer,

We have taken steps to begin removing margin trading for BTS, CLAM, FCT, and MAID. Effective immediately, you will no longer be able to extend or increase your positions in these four markets, though they will remain available for spot trading. All open margin orders have been canceled, and only orders that reduce your open margin positions will be accepted going forward. On July 8th, we will begin shutting down these margin markets, so please close your margin positions as soon as possible.

Please note that we are taking these steps to protect our lenders and traders in these specific markets. For margin liquidations to process in an orderly manner, the market needs sufficient liquidity and these markets currently lack that liquidity. We will continue to monitor them and may reinstate margin trading in the future. While this may be frustrating as a margin trader, we are confident that this is the right choice to protect our customers.

As always, you can reach out to us at support@poloniex.freshdesk.com with any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your attention to this matter,

The Poloniex Team
