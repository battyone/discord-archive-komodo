why the fuck do they need to know where your money came from, I mean if you took the time and effort to use a fake id etc, it's really no effort at all to fake payment checks from employers etc

startin gonly in september '18 - buying for 4 BTC and selling with half a BTC loss or profit then ceasing bcs that game is nonsense anyway

[13-May-19 08:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
bought some NXS, sold again, b ought some Bittube, sold again, ... stupid game, so I quit
then i sold 10k WAVES, withdrew the 5 BTC and apparently their intern- coded AI went hysterical .. lol

[13-May-19 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe it had some flagged funds in them or so?

[13-May-19 08:28 PM] LocoMB#8593
totally small fry, 30 trades in 6 months jingling 4 or 5 BTC back and forth

[13-May-19 08:28 PM] LocoMB#8593
emaybe they were pissed that I withdrew it, I seem to rememeber that Vegas Casinos get weird on you when you do that too

[13-May-19 08:29 PM] LocoMB#8593

[13-May-19 08:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
nice excuse for the VBK bastards to suppress price discussion in their discord, citing some 'devs are not supposed to engage in financial discussions coz liability in Murica' mumbo jumbo

[13-May-19 08:34 PM] LocoMB#8593
havent seen any mention of Raven there - i THINK THE PRJECTS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT

[13-May-19 08:34 PM] LocoMB#8593
really? disappointing, I though Raven was a cool coin! surprising, what with Raven and all these GOU algo shuffling is so different from the java trash VBK uses

I was the one that questioned your logic about a pullback that was inevitable back down to $5100 or something. I said, it will keep going up, until they decide to stop doing that

[13-May-19 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They?

But it’s not a binary, it’s a bigger chance it goes one way or the other given any information, and in the end any scenario is still possible

rumour is that the OGs will pump BCH to $1000 now

[13-May-19 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Who would have thought we would pump from 3500 straight to 7k with the year we’ve just had?

[13-May-19 09:01 PM] phm87#7395
BCHABC or BCHSV or BCH legacy (dead I think) ?

[13-May-19 09:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pathetically thin

[13-May-19 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems mostly bots pushing price down to maintain peg and newbs panicking

[13-May-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
any significant order and it is back up to 18k+, but if people are willing to sell at lower and lower prices, the big guys will happily wait

Someone shoot me 5btc and I’ll buy up trex orderbooks ;p

[13-May-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i had a feeling BTC prices were artificially kept low for quite a while

[13-May-19 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is the case and they stopped suppressing prices, then maybe this is just BTC getting back to where it should have been all along

[13-May-19 09:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah the monthlong sideways action really had a ‘made’ feeling

[13-May-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
until the price reaches a (not very manipulated) equilibrium, i think we will just keep stair stepping up

[13-May-19 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
