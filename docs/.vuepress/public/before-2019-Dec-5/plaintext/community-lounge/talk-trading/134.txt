as long as your pc is not compromised, then there's nothing to worry about

[04-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I will probably hold untill 100$ and then all the way down again

'But what if it hits 1000$'

[04-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

I guarentee thats going to be me

[04-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I couldnt dump it at $20

[04-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If it is steady at 100 I might consider only selling the rewards

[04-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I was buying more at that point LOL.

[04-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But even then, I probably just keep accumulating

Weekly is stabbing the 8ema.

[04-Sep-18 11:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If this week manages to close above it, next stop should be weekly 20sma and afterwards the weekly 41ema

@siu - Chainmakers  what are the next levels of resistance üòÆ

[04-Sep-18 11:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
next levels are around 30k and then 40k

[04-Sep-18 11:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Deleted User my strategy is called the 8/41

[04-Sep-18 11:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
actually weekly 20sma is at 27550 sats.

[04-Sep-18 11:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is an important resistance.

[04-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd even handle a bullrun tbh. I‚Äôve forgotten what it feels like

[04-Sep-18 12:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I‚Äôll be so confused when to buy the dip, if there even is one, and expecting every reversal to last another year LOL. The December bullrun fucked up my logical thinking

[04-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I only just got rid of the habit of checking folio every hour or so

[04-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Please show us some green this December

[04-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I remember december you could check folio one minute, refresh and a minute later it was like 10% difference

[04-Sep-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181

How hungry are you, whale?

[04-Sep-18 01:24 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I'd say a substantial portion of that is also the whale, if he wants to buy

[04-Sep-18 02:44 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I think polo was already asked to replace btcd with KMD

[04-Sep-18 02:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but they changed owner recently? if they also changed stuff and had many tickets possible the mail is missing in action

[04-Sep-18 02:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe make sense to ask them once a wekk till they do

[04-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Is eth ded?

[04-Sep-18 02:48 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It will be

[04-Sep-18 02:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They take a year to verify users... i dont know how they will delist a coin

[04-Sep-18 02:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
when verifying users is something that bings them money

als bittrex is lower, Asian exchanges rules now

[04-Sep-18 03:14 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Is it a coincidence that btcd & kmd got pumped at the same time ? ü§î

[04-Sep-18 04:50 PM] ryman112#0068
It would be nice to see 2$ kmd here soon.  Are we seeing the beginnings of a upward trend in the market?  I sure hope so this has gone on long enough lol

[04-Sep-18 04:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seeing a lot of resistance for btc/usd at 7400

[04-Sep-18 04:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
we are knocking at those levels for the past few days

We was at $12?

[04-Sep-18 05:22 PM] pinkolin#9557
$2 is nothing

[04-Sep-18 05:24 PM] pinkolin#9557
But no usage, no potential

[04-Sep-18 05:25 PM] pinkolin#9557
50$ is my wet dream, but it‚Äôs look NOW impossible

[04-Sep-18 05:27 PM] pinkolin#9557
40$ will be very nice

Can it get anywhere near that when dicos/atomic swaps seem to have proven to be immensely  less popular than expected?

I‚Äôll take controlling my own coins vs sending IDs/home address/SSN/blood sample/stool sample/whatever for some bullshit exchange KYC than praying my withdraws get processed and the exchange doesn‚Äôt fold and run

[04-Sep-18 07:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But that‚Äôs just me

[04-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah there may be some market for it for more infrequent buyers

[04-Sep-18 07:30 PM] Sdunbar#5064
but day traders/frequent users need to ability to make near instantaneous trades

[04-Sep-18 07:31 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm guessing those users make up the lions share of the volume on centralized exchanges
