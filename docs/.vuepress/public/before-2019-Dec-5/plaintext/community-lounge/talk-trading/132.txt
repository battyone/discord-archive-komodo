blame @jorian he was impatient

[04-Sep-18 08:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the initial intention was exactly as to treat it like a developers experiment bunny.

[04-Sep-18 08:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then @jl777c comments made sense that it's just feature complete. and any further think if ever could be done on it as a feature will be just extra, if ever could be.

[04-Sep-18 08:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that sense, any product or service developed using PIRATE would make it an absolute anonymous product/service

[04-Sep-18 08:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I speculatively just bought the PIRATES others mined.

[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still do not advice anyone to buy it or say if it's either test coin or a complete one.
it is as real as BTC or KMD or ETH or ZEC etc. etc.

[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's live blockchain network

[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I put value on it

[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] jorian#4555
I was summoned

[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know about others

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
others may just discard it, and mine it and throw their wallet keys in trash bit üòÑ

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
forget it and don't look back

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I'm sure we'll have a use case of this  blockchain from a product or service

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that use case will make it valueable

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never discard coins

[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not the blockchain as is now itself

[04-Sep-18 08:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I'm learning core dev stuff, I can probably try making something around it

[04-Sep-18 08:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so why not get some while I could

[04-Sep-18 08:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I did

was he the bot who pushed the price down?

KMD still not good enough up üò¶

[04-Sep-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would appear who ever that person/people is/are, has been pushing price down an buying  it all yes.

[04-Sep-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a LOT of coins to send to one address, we can only guess its a paper wallet, will need to wait and see after block 1 million it they start moving it, or refuse to claim rewards

[04-Sep-18 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Goddamn that rewards bigger than my stack

[04-Sep-18 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
üò≠

[04-Sep-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only if they move the coins every 4 weeks to claim it

[04-Sep-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
with a stack that big, it woud be risky

[04-Sep-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe some kind of offline signer, and submit raw TX to claim ü§î

[04-Sep-18 08:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why risky?

[04-Sep-18 08:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never put that much money on any computer ever

[04-Sep-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or at least the private keys for that much money

[04-Sep-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181

If somehow I did get a virus. Do the crypto ones usually target all wallets, or they search for bitcoin wallets etc specifically

For my KMD paper wallets, I used a bunch of parts from old P4's and otehr random shit I found, and generated a bunch of paper wallets and print ed them off, prik keys are laminated in a gun safe not even on my properly. the guy who has them has no idea what they are.

[04-Sep-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not that there is much in those address yet  üò¶

[04-Sep-18 08:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
You‚Äôd need to log in with the priv key to claim interest though aye

[04-Sep-18 08:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
dot matrix ftw

[04-Sep-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly... I think you can do an offline sign but its not something I have looked into, as I never sent any KMD to them, only chips. My KMD is always getting used.

[04-Sep-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000

[04-Sep-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a PowerPC 750mhz here, been thinking to try and compile a TX signer on that, but might be far too hard

[04-Sep-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I know I would learn a lot, but it might be usless knowledge

Months of patiently accumulating make for a pretty sweet passive income. How long before other whales see the light? üê≥üí° $KMD @KomodoPlatform https://t.co/E3xwIRTuEv

Lets start spreading, that passive income alone should get some people interested
