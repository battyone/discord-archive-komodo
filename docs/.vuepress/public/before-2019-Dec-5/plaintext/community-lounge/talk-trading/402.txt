[07-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah, I never really believed in supplements,

[07-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Tek#5253

[07-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
@polycryptoblog I have heard magic mushrooms help for cluster headaches ;P

[07-Feb-19 06:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
@blackjok3r there's no sun here for a while longer, also, I don't think I'll get the same amounts even if there was sun

[07-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
I sit in the sun for an hour sometimes

[07-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253

[07-Feb-19 07:02 PM] Tek#5253
this system that takes CO2 from the air and makes gasoline from it, not actualy gasoline but a liquid  you can use to drive on just like gasoline

[07-Feb-19 07:02 PM] Tek#5253
it works for any combustion engine

[07-Feb-19 07:02 PM] Tek#5253
I wanted to buy shares for that company

[07-Feb-19 07:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like water does?

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Tek#5253
water? no it was these huge towers that suck air from the sky, take out co2 and they produce "gasoline" with hit

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Tek#5253
aussie tech

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that sound like a waste of time

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
u can just use water

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Tek#5253
water ones are dangerous, and no one has a water engine, everone has a combustion enigne

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
50k volts into water

[07-Feb-19 07:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Tek#5253
there's no cars that have this tech.

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Tek#5253
yes but they aren't commercially viable

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in geroldton WA

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Tek#5253
90% of the wordl drives with combustion engines

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Tek#5253
if some combany can make a liquid out of co2 that people can use for their combustion engine

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Tek#5253
that's a win

[07-Feb-19 07:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Tek#5253
you have to rebuild the engine, people are too poor for that

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Tek#5253
driving on water is a great idea, but no pleb at the bottom can afford it.

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I built my own engine... it uses petrol... sadly.... but it can easy use water aswell

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just reetired it to work on KMD

[07-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Tek#5253

[07-Feb-19 07:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
