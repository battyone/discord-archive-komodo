bullish divergence on btc daily

[30-Jul-19 04:40 PM] altcoinist#1501
When I buy btc it'll dump so I better wait it to reach 7-8k (maybe never will happen)

[30-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Markus#5464
9k support looking good so far

[30-Jul-19 05:06 PM] Neko#5830
fork btc when altszn

[30-Jul-19 05:43 PM] Neko#5830
so thats it, kmd will keep dropping forever until 0

[30-Jul-19 05:48 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
yep

[30-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Caglio#3337
But be sure to buy at 1$

[30-Jul-19 05:53 PM] Caglio#3337
its bargain

[30-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Fill your bags

[30-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Caglio#3337
On the way to 0

[30-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus TA was calling for a dump on the last pump to 17k pre news

[30-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Lanii#8302
text book rejection

[30-Jul-19 05:54 PM] Lanii#8302
Thats why you don't bother with funnymental news

[30-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Markus#5464
everything what happened was according to the TA

[30-Jul-19 05:56 PM] Neko#5830
what TA is saying now

[30-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
oversold on 4h so can get a bounce

[30-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
hidden bullish divergence on macd

[30-Jul-19 05:58 PM] Neko#5830
thanks.

[30-Jul-19 06:00 PM] Lanii#8302
Bounce here

[30-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
Last line of defense around 960

[30-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
If not well ggs lads

[30-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
btw there is no such thing as oversold or overbought

[30-Jul-19 06:01 PM] Lanii#8302
its just a meme

[30-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
For every sell there is a buyer and vice versa

[30-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Markus#5464
remember that its not kmd itself who looses value against btc other alts aswell

[30-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Lanii#8302
henca a shitcoin can never be one or the other

[30-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
but i think kmd is one of the few alts with most potential, the development of new tech is going on in a rapid speed, tell me one other platform u can compare it with

[30-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Lanii#8302
Agreed

[30-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Lanii#8302
But I can also tell you that kmd is the coin that got me rekt the most

[30-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Lanii#8302
All other shitcoins I trade according to TA and would never take a 80% draw down

[30-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Markus#5464
Yes it got rekt hard in sats value, still up in usd value tho since btc bottoming

[30-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Lanii#8302
mh

[30-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Lanii#8302
anyways I think there is a high probability we could go as low as 960 and bounce

[30-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Lanii#8302
Potential HL in play

[30-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Lanii#8302
btw I'd prefer it to just bounce here

[30-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Markus#5464
Yes possible but its fine, set some buy orders here and there later on this prices will never happen again

[30-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Lanii#8302
sure thing buddy

[30-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Lanii#8302
thats what people been saying since 2018

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
ðŸ˜„

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
"never this cheap again"

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
But it doesnt matter, I belive in kmd

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont really trade it here being greedy for another 10% lower

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Markus#5464
Good projects will rise, this is just the begin of the bull cycle

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Markus#5464
there is years ahead

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
there is no bull

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
until 11.5 is broken

[30-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Lanii#8302
and closes above it

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
for 2 weeks at least

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
Untill that happens this is just a rally in a bear market

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
Idk how something can be in a bull market without even reclaiming 50% of retracement

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Markus#5464
even if its a rally, then imagine bull market

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh

[30-Jul-19 06:08 PM] Lanii#8302
its unfortunate we couldnt hold 11.5

[30-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Lanii#8302
but you never know ðŸ˜ƒ

[30-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Markus#5464
i mean we rallied from 7k to 14k pretty much without any pullbacks

[30-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Markus#5464
so this was expected to happen

[30-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Markus#5464
it was going parabolic

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
just look how important that 11.5 was

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
pumped way above it but cant manage to get a close

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Markus#5464
True

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
I agree with pull backs

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
but

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
This is a bit iffy

[30-Jul-19 06:10 PM] Lanii#8302
If you trade market structure

[30-Jul-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302
We rejected the monthly

[30-Jul-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302
high from 2017

[30-Jul-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302
so Im thinking its not just a pullback, hopefully Im wrong

[30-Jul-19 06:11 PM] Lanii#8302
Will revaluate if 11.5 is reclaimed

[30-Jul-19 06:12 PM] Markus#5464
I dont know if u use Pivot indicator but on weekly u can see that we got rejected by first resistance line

[30-Jul-19 06:12 PM] Lanii#8302
I use no indicators

[30-Jul-19 06:12 PM] Lanii#8302
they just noise

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
I trade market structure

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
if you reverse the chart

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
upside down

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
This would be a buy

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
HL buy

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
but as its now

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
Its a fail to gain

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
rejected top range

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Markus#5464
if u look what i linked then u can see that we tested it 2 times

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh I see but I dont understand it

[30-Jul-19 06:13 PM] Lanii#8302
since I dont use pivots

[30-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Lanii#8302
but its the same as i posted Im guessing

[30-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Lanii#8302
It rejected the monthly by couple of dollars

[30-Jul-19 06:14 PM] Markus#5464
Yes

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Markus#5464
but on monthly u can clearly see

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Markus#5464
why it was unhealthy

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Markus#5464
like a flag pole

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Markus#5464
straight up

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Lanii#8302
but as I said

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Lanii#8302
I wanted pullback to 11.5

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Lanii#8302
that woulda been way prettier

[30-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Lanii#8302
But since that didnt hold its a bit iffy

[30-Jul-19 06:16 PM] Markus#5464
kinda forming a double bottom on daily if we get a bounce here

[30-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Lanii#8302
yes

[30-Jul-19 06:17 PM] Lanii#8302
daily doesnt look that horrible
