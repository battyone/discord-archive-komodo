I should make hated index

[04-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Tek#5253
Millennials didn't notice it yet while they're busy flipping their homes.
Boomers have still not noticed it yet while trading stocks and buying the top.
Zoomers and normies have still not noticed it yet while trading magic internet money.
/biz/ has still not noticed it yet while shilling their shitcoins and dreaming of lambo's.
The media is dead silent.
The rich are silently selling their stocks while covering up their ass with stock buybacks. 
The greatest depression of all time awaits us.
Start to prep before its too late. 
Deutsche is about to crash btw.

So price goes down and we are now talking about manipulation ðŸ™„

[04-Jun-19 10:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
of course ðŸ˜›

[04-Jun-19 10:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
can only go up

Somebody else is making money, must be a conspiracy

[04-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
I mean u can see it from different points of views....if someone intentionally dumps 25k btc and price drops 10% then u can see it as manipulation or u can just say that he wanted to sell his bitcoin just like any other person

[04-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Markus#5464
but since it looks like he took advantage of him having a large stack of bitcoin and dump the price to then buy it back cheaper he did it intentionally to gain on it

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
manipulation is great, unregulated markets are great. if we get regulations. it means only a select few top elites get to manipulate the prices

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
now everyone can do it

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
much more fair

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Markus#5464
Its like if komodo whale would drop 1 mil kmd market sell on binance and price goes to 0 and then put a buy order in the middle of the previous high ofc he would profit from it cause bots would go crazy

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
someone should do that

[04-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
fucking bots

[04-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Tek#5253
lets go bois. call your whale frens. we about to steal some bot cones

[04-Jun-19 11:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Wouldnt the contrary be exactly the same yet no one calls it manipulation?

[04-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Markus#5464
True

[04-Jun-19 11:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyway, im wondering why rfox and not kmd got added to liquid? https://mobile.twitter.com/liquid_global/status/1135833772518248449?s=21

[04-Jun-19 11:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But anyway, good news for the ecosystem

[04-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Markus#5464
I always said that the pump on btc from 4k to 5k was manipulated, it was not normal market behavior to increasse 1k in price in so short time

[04-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Markus#5464
but ppl kept saying it was expected

[04-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Tek#5253

is Liquid a legit exchange?

[04-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
i found 1 red flag

[04-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
"lend your crypto and earn interest"

[04-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Tek#5253
there's legit versions of that

[04-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Tek#5253
poloniex you can do it

[04-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Markus#5464
They also got margin trading interesting

[04-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Markus#5464
wonder if its only large cap coins like btc, eth etc or also other coins

[04-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Tek#5253
im not sure but theres various places where you can lend btc and other big caps like dash, for 4% or 5% yearly

[04-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Markus#5464
so like nothing, learn basics of trading and 5% is a piece of cake

[04-Jun-19 11:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Liquid exchange is a blockstream service?

[04-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
5% is good if you have a big capital

[04-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
oh that Liquid

[04-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
not gonna look at it then

[04-Jun-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810

[04-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this is the top rated exhange in japan

[04-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
totally legit

[04-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
all volumes real, and audited

[04-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810

BTC/USD 
24h Volume
2,419.80 BTC

[04-Jun-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
they add one at a time and RFOX needed another listing a lot more than KMD

[04-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
small volumes compared to the fake volume exchanges, but still respectable amounts as it is all real volumes

[04-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Markus#5464
what is Qash? i see Rfox got a pair with that

[04-Jun-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810

kind of amazing thread

[04-Jun-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have studied Warren Buffet a long time, it's very interesting to see his reactions to cryptocoins, "rat poison" and all that. But he comes from a time before computers, he has a healthy amount of distrust for a person protecting massive wealth

[04-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
massive centralized wealth. will soon be worth nothing

[04-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Tek#5253
thats y he's so scared

[04-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Tek#5253
if national currencies fail he's basically broke

[04-Jun-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
he has a lot of silver

[04-Jun-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
at least he used to

[04-Jun-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek you don't need paper money when you have managing control over most Fortune 500 companies

[04-Jun-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yeah, Warren probably has more gold+silver than most countries

[04-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Tek#5253
stocks and paper money are the same by now.
