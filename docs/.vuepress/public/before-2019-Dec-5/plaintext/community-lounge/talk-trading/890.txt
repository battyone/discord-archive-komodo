[05-Jul-19 07:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@alen soon

[05-Jul-19 07:07 AM] alen#3721
Cool tnx..cant wait, this is a gane changer. If peoplr recognise the meaning of it

[05-Jul-19 07:07 AM] dxer666#8963
btc down kmd down

[05-Jul-19 07:07 AM] alen#3721
Who cares

[05-Jul-19 07:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
btc down, kmd is up for a change

[05-Jul-19 07:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Until we do may thousand BTC worth of real volume, we will be in the hands of bots and whales

[05-Jul-19 07:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
if they can understand keeping their money in their pocket, they will recognize the meaning

[05-Jul-19 07:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Go with the flow, build stuff, release it, tell people about it

[05-Jul-19 07:09 AM] alen#3721
News like this should make other exchanges consider adding kmd for trading...guys are making some real shit here..no appreciation

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Ok now I am picking my options on my lambo

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
What option should I choose

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
There is a booster option

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] alen#3721
Yellow

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
the goal is to make the exchanges obsolete

[05-Jul-19 07:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Red as it is faster

[05-Jul-19 07:11 AM] alen#3721
@actionslacks there is room for both

[05-Jul-19 07:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I agree, the goal is to educate the masses what is actual tech and what a real DEX does. This is the first step

[05-Jul-19 07:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
for the pro traders exchanges will always serve a purpose, I agree. they should not be the gatekeepers though

[05-Jul-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Step 1. Educate people about difference between CEX / Proxy / DEX
Step 2. Have a monopoly on the DEX tech, build up network effects to bring in all the liquidity
Step 3. Reduce reliance on CEX
Step 4. Watch as govs try to stop it

[05-Jul-19 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are not even at step 1

[05-Jul-19 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
or completed step 1 i mean

[05-Jul-19 07:13 AM] alen#3721
Yes..thats why we need both options..they all serve a purpose

[05-Jul-19 07:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
yep, only at the beginning here. many lifetimes of work left to realize the full vision

[05-Jul-19 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Im pretty sure we will see the shift in our lifetime 10-20 years

I dont believe that governments are even aware of what is happening with crypto evolution...not taking it too seriusly..it will backfire ar them...amd when they finally realise they will panick and try to impose resctricitons...with no succes ofcourse.

They know about facebook and it scares them

[05-Jul-19 07:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
they dont see what is right in front of their eyes

[05-Jul-19 07:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
the shift will hopefully be sooner than later. but it's such a new concept. lifetimes in a plural sense as opposed to linear

[05-Jul-19 07:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
they'd prefer war to losing control unfortunately

[05-Jul-19 07:24 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@alen btc is IMO a creation of governments / military and I think most are well aware and in btc since a long time

[05-Jul-19 07:25 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's the prophesized one world currency

[05-Jul-19 07:25 AM] Tek#5253
yeah. they are all secretly hoarding / mining bitcoin already

[05-Jul-19 07:25 AM] Tek#5253
a lot of governments are known to own a few hundred thousand bitcoins

[05-Jul-19 07:26 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Exactly

its the only way the debts can ever be repaid

[05-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Tek#5253
its part of the plan

[05-Jul-19 07:26 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
In the same time FUD it

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Acura#2748
Finally #Binance will list #Dogecoin üêï

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Acura seriously?

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lmao

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Tek#5253
> list a coin that hasn't had any updates for years

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Tek#5253
why?

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Tek#5253
the code isn't even been maintained

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Tek#5253
or did that change recently?

[05-Jul-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Tek no FUD pls

[05-Jul-19 07:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why they list elrond token lmao

[05-Jul-19 07:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

For brigading? Seriously?

Nice volume

[05-Jul-19 07:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
If they're ignoring our exchanges and blocking our posts we must be doing something right.

[05-Jul-19 07:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, still makes me wonder.

[05-Jul-19 07:39 AM] actionslacks#4072

mod just needed an excuse to squash the thread before it blew up

[05-Jul-19 07:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I wrote to the mods and got answered that yes it's brigading, so deleted

[05-Jul-19 07:44 AM] Malti#3948
Is it because we accessed the article through direct link and upvoted?

[05-Jul-19 07:45 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
my old reddit account was banned for life when I asked to upvote in  komodo telegram

[05-Jul-19 07:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
but it's an open online community. except for you. you cant be here.

[05-Jul-19 07:49 AM] Malti#3948
Reddit just doesn‚Äôt want premium tech

[05-Jul-19 07:50 AM] Malti#3948
Or maybe they are aware of the 1/tech rule and they are huge bag holders

[05-Jul-19 07:50 AM] actionslacks#4072

Reddit sucks & Twitter is just a general hellhole

[05-Jul-19 07:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
fb is the hellhole, at least twitter has enough churn that the truth get's through occasionally

[05-Jul-19 07:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD develops custom consensus and atomic cross chain swaps, and releases antara, gets 22% gain.  Dogecoin gets article titled 'binance will dogecoin'.  Gets 23% gain. üòÑ

[05-Jul-19 07:54 AM] Malti#3948
Buh as soon as you say ‚ÄúI like this because of [insert good arguments such as tech]‚Äù then you are a fanboy

[05-Jul-19 07:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
I've had some success on reddit and on fb but it's honestly like fighting a forest fire of lies with a water hose of truth

[05-Jul-19 07:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
just giant waves of delusional bs everywhere

[05-Jul-19 07:58 AM] dxer666#8963
kmd should go to 1200$

[05-Jul-19 07:58 AM] Malti#3948
based on? @dxer666

[05-Jul-19 07:58 AM] dxer666#8963
ether

[05-Jul-19 07:59 AM] dxer666#8963
like ether

[05-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Malti#3948
based on ether I'd say a pricepoint of 250 dollars seems more reasonable

[05-Jul-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948
let's hope these big companies the team was talking about in the AMA really bite and become KMD tech partners

[05-Jul-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948
as soon as some news comes out that any big company is using KMD, then we good

[05-Jul-19 08:03 AM] Malti#3948
it's just so nice to see that we regained our top 50 cmc spot

[05-Jul-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
someone post the reddit post again

[05-Jul-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but now no direct links

[05-Jul-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and we just search for the thread?

[05-Jul-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
cant be brigading if you dont post direct links can it?

[05-Jul-19 08:22 AM] Malti#3948
true that cryptoon
