if someone can teach her the tech, it shouldnt be that "hard"

[05-Jul-19 11:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Intelligent / articulate  / nice face/body so we need those now 😄

[05-Jul-19 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyway, kmd has been in the top gainer or near the top gainer spot for quite some time now

[05-Jul-19 11:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
1/tech can have a not so good looking girl.  After all its all about the tech

[05-Jul-19 11:42 AM] crumb#2550
there was a girl, i think it was just after the brownsheet productions event, that looked like a model and there was an initial arrangement that she will start promoting KMD

[05-Jul-19 11:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
we get them in with the good looking girl, but they stay for the tech 😃

[05-Jul-19 11:42 AM] crumb#2550
looked like a model

[05-Jul-19 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah that was sad 😦

[05-Jul-19 11:43 AM] crumb#2550
someone i think even started teaching her about KMD

[05-Jul-19 11:43 AM] crumb#2550
what happened to it?

[05-Jul-19 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe she didnt get it

[05-Jul-19 11:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Or made some kmd wifes jealous before going public

Not sure if it's a coincidence but I've often posted Komodo articles there, never asked for upvotes here or in Telegram, and they get systematically downvoted to 0. Only a recent one about AtomicDEX and another a long time ago got a few upvotes

[05-Jul-19 11:45 AM] crumb#2550
yeah, my thought were along the same lines. not easy to "just teach about what KMD is and what it does"

[05-Jul-19 11:45 AM] crumb#2550
piece of cake :abusedsmily:

From the monthly kmdusd chart i can see that we should have a move to at least $2.20

[05-Jul-19 11:54 AM] blubbi#0643
hire a young eroticstar, give her an working website show, let her talk about kmd and let her do her show for some extra kmd donations, im pretty sure it will fit 😄

[05-Jul-19 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
2017 no?

[05-Jul-19 11:57 AM] blubbi#0643
could be a job for @Caglio 😄

[05-Jul-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
i have just a perfect girl for it

[05-Jul-19 11:57 AM] blubbi#0643
i knew ur the right man for it 😂

[05-Jul-19 11:57 AM] Caglio#3337
i wanted to put her on bongacams

😂 

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] Caglio#3337
but some ppl wanted her to fo her ass with a piece of corn

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] Caglio#3337
and her motto is: only vegetable that goes down there is cucumber

[05-Jul-19 11:58 AM] Caglio#3337
but yeah, pretty girls sell product

[05-Jul-19 11:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

2,2$ would be roughly 20k sats in current btc price

[05-Jul-19 12:19 PM] Markus#5464
sounds reasonable

[05-Jul-19 12:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes. Not out of the ordinary

[05-Jul-19 12:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Would be good to move pass that and go to 40k sats tho

[05-Jul-19 12:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:3040_kingpeepo:

[05-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
passing 28k and keep climing would be something, last time we were around 28k it was rly hard to pass that price without falling back down

[05-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Keppie#5156
2.18$ USD has been on my chart for months. KMDUSD chart is very bullish

[05-Jul-19 12:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yep

[05-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Keppie#5156
Makes me reconsidr my kmd ecosystem bags

[05-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Keppie#5156
VRSC, ARRR, K64 etc

[05-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Keppie#5156
but figured that the attention KMD will draw coming months will reflect into those smaller caps with great FA

[05-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Keppie#5156
ppl will notice eventually

[05-Jul-19 12:50 PM] Keppie#5156
New daily high? Lets go boiz

[05-Jul-19 12:57 PM] Markus#5464
Only bad thing is kmd rely on btc pair to gain in usd value

[05-Jul-19 12:57 PM] Markus#5464
since we dont have usd pairs

[05-Jul-19 12:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is a USDT on hit no?

[05-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Markus#5464
nobody uses hitbtc scam

usd pair

[05-Jul-19 01:00 PM] Markus#5464
well ye sure

[05-Jul-19 01:00 PM] Markus#5464
but how is liquidity there 💩

[05-Jul-19 01:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
KMD/KRW ?

[05-Jul-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"no liquidity" and "doesn't exist" are not interchangeable phrases

[05-Jul-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464
As long as binance dont have stable coin pairs u cant rely on those other exchanges usd pairs

[05-Jul-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464
so i dont count them

[05-Jul-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is so over the "I will not add to liquidity because there's no liquidity" argument_

[05-Jul-19 01:02 PM] Markus#5464
but considering AtomicDEX got usdc thats a good start

[05-Jul-19 01:03 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully there will be usdt aswell

[05-Jul-19 01:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
that runs on OMNI right? It's a different protocol not eth nor btc fork

[05-Jul-19 01:04 PM] Markus#5464
nothing is impossible right? 😄

[05-Jul-19 01:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes thats generally true

ahhh for USDT, I thought you meant totally

[05-Jul-19 01:23 PM] crumb#2550
context was there :abusedsmily:

[05-Jul-19 01:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
When stablecoin tech is ready we will have a decentralized kmd based stablecoin, so no need to worry for USDT

[05-Jul-19 01:27 PM] crumb#2550
as AtomicDEX supports ERC20 tokens, then you basically have a "USD pair" for those who want it

[05-Jul-19 01:27 PM] crumb#2550
math based more reliable alternative will be better of course siu

[05-Jul-19 01:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`then you basically have a "USD pair" for those who want it`
Until USDT crumbles :troll:

[05-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Mark81#4505
It's not about tech, ist just with USDT you few billion dollars less to worry with marketcap.

[05-Jul-19 01:34 PM] crumb#2550
*ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢: then you basically have a "USD pair" for those who want it
Until USDT crumbles :troll:*

hence the use of quotes and added for those who want it

[05-Jul-19 01:34 PM] crumb#2550
haven't used it myself. not once

[05-Jul-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've traded ledger balances of USDT, but never actually held any

[05-Jul-19 02:12 PM] Markus#5464
quite alot of selling pressure around this price range

[05-Jul-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lots of folks wanting that big $4 gain

[05-Jul-19 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
$4 what?

[05-Jul-19 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
$4 KMD?

@CHMEX  where  i can find the CRYPTO Overview? You posted a screenshot today in the morning

[05-Jul-19 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$4 what?`
$4 total more than what they bought/mined for
