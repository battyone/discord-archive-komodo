[24-Apr-19 02:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
There is komodoninja_EU  which last year had a proposal I connect this ninja coin to kolo and kolo to komodoninja but thats just my interpretation...

[24-Apr-19 02:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its was a team acording to github kolo /rnr

[24-Apr-19 02:52 PM] CHMEX#0686

On top of the 300M a few days ago or that's just slow?

[24-Apr-19 07:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tx says 28 mins ago

[24-Apr-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I meant is that the 300M they announced the other day or is it an additional 300M?

[24-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
An additional is what I meant with my comment sorry :p

[24-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
New tx for 300m created, so I assume it’s just an extra 300m?

Decline in #EURUSD will cause #DXY to rally in strong wave up. Consolidation has lasted longer than expected but this only talks to the power of coming rally. LT-target 107-109 - pot. higher! Do not stand in the way of coming USD-rally due to talks of dedollarization #HZup...

[24-Apr-19 09:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
hey im curious what kind of strategies you guys use on kmd chart?

[24-Apr-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
i only use 3 strategies really

[24-Apr-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
none of which involve any TA and none of which are very applicable to kmd chart

[24-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Malti#3948
So what are your strategies then?

[24-Apr-19 09:40 PM] nocturnal#2177
first one is to just layer buys and sells upwards and downwards in zones and play both ends of the market

[24-Apr-19 09:40 PM] nocturnal#2177
but kmd not volatile enough for this

[24-Apr-19 09:41 PM] nocturnal#2177
second is to just keep playing the margin

[24-Apr-19 09:41 PM] nocturnal#2177
but kmd spread is not big enough for this

[24-Apr-19 09:41 PM] nocturnal#2177
third is to put buys in below support and wait for it too break

[24-Apr-19 09:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
but thats really boring

[24-Apr-19 09:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
cos youre mostly just waiting forever

[24-Apr-19 09:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
what do you komodores do?

[24-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

komodelorians?

[24-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I keep it in my address

Sometimes I remember to claim interest

That’s my strategy

[24-Apr-19 09:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
meh too slow

[24-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Good strat

[24-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Mine as well @Hollowman9000

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sometimes trade some kmd for arrr

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And vice versa

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thats about it

Wonder if the OCEAN IEO sells out in 5 seconds after a performance like this.

it also can be so fast to get rekt. even a full winning mode during monthes can end up as a total loss on one bad move

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Must refrain from making inappropriate comments

[24-Apr-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The guy was shilling that ieo onto his followers now making these kinds of remarks after people prolly lost money

[24-Apr-19 09:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
@Deleted User i havent found that with either strat 1 or 2. if you pick the right charts its quite difficult to lose

[24-Apr-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
so there is some TA in picking the right charts i spose

[24-Apr-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
anyways thought the trading room might have some tips for me 😃

[24-Apr-19 09:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
maybe another time!

[25-Apr-19 12:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
how many were there originally

[25-Apr-19 12:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
$1 is shit.  With BTC in the mid 5000s KMD should be $2 already.

[25-Apr-19 12:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
(but really KMD should be $100 or course)

[25-Apr-19 12:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I mean, KMD at $100 would have lower market cap than shitcoin ripple.  Clearly $100 would be a bargain.

[25-Apr-19 01:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I guess it should be $166 to pass ETH

[25-Apr-19 01:08 AM] PTYX#6840
Down pressure?

[25-Apr-19 01:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
always terrible volume for KMD

[25-Apr-19 01:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
one of the worst of the top 100 consistently

Any volume on Binance SV yet?

[25-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD has lots of true hodlers collecting 5%, not just traders holding on exchange (aka not actually holding their crypto)

[25-Apr-19 03:26 AM] richardt#2807
I think it's because most of KMD tech is still way over most people's heads.  Not a lot of people appreciate its significance, so not a lot of market interest when compared to some other projects

[25-Apr-19 03:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
What i find strange is that i never find FUD about komodo , neither real nor fabricated
