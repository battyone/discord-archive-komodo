I think almost all of the Altcoin will doom. but the surviving Altcoin will survive, which will somehow have a close connection with bitcoin. I don't think there are any powerful Altcoin who can beat the financial power and the government system.

They will just print money out of thin air to buy up crypto assets

[03-Jul-19 01:19 PM] JimD#9272
luckily crypto can just spin up new coins out of thin air and fuck up their investment

It is necessary the idea of ensuring the value of the ecosystem rather than guaranteeing the value of the token. If an ecosystem has value, it can collect a variety of resources through the token without changing the token to money or guaranteeing its value. It is not the mileage coupons that the valuable ecosystem meets with the blockchain, but the currency, so the government can not prevent it from the traditional legal category.

I used to love the original leisure suit larry. Let's see, you hand to go get a rubber from the convenience store, get a bribe for the pimp, then when you made sweet Lovins to the hooker all you got was a black censored square moving up and down. Kings quest engine I believe.

@Markus 
```
OK, I got it guys. Screw D1 for now, daemonising its code is basically impoossible. 
This is my proposal for the first fungible LABS chain. 
-- LottoCC!
--- Someone (anyone) crates a lotto game that expires at some X block height. 
---- Anyone can register to this game only once with some amount of LABS coin. 
---- The total amount received to this "game" is the payout to the winner 
---> The winner is decideded by the first notarized MoMoM hash.,  after the blockheight specified at game creation

this means that no miner can take over the chain and spoof the block hash, because it takes MoM hashes from multiple chains then hashes them to find the winner.1```
