[17-Oct-18 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i did lose a lot of KMD when i stupidly deleted my wallet.....still hurts

[17-Oct-18 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and then didnt realize it until a year later

[17-Oct-18 11:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and dont know which drive it was on

[17-Oct-18 11:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
:trollface: holding out hope in 10 years there will be software than can recover lol

:abusedsmily:

[17-Oct-18 11:46 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
if it isn't overwritten it's possible to recover now

[17-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As long as nothing was written to it

[17-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yup

[17-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúDeleting‚Äù is just removing the entry on the file allocation table, or whatever it‚Äôs called now

[17-Oct-18 11:47 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
have you made a try? GetDataBack is one of the best software for recovery

[17-Oct-18 11:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
1 year full of data, on a encrypted drive that may have been wiped...

[17-Oct-18 11:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
HAHA so chances are close to 0

[17-Oct-18 11:48 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ops

[17-Oct-18 11:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Lets just say that it was a decent % of my total......dont know how i missed it tbh

[17-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Gazza#1311
anyone know what's happening with KMD

[17-Oct-18 11:51 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Yassin it should have already started, it's 7:52 according to Eastern Time

[17-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So the 51% attack should have started 34 minutes ago

[17-Oct-18 11:51 AM] BlockTech#6895
If you're talkind about the price, sure, whale buying slowly 2,5M @Gazza

[17-Oct-18 11:52 AM] Yassin#3685
haaaa ok i am bad with time!! :trollface:

[17-Oct-18 11:52 AM] Gazza#1311
buying and selling same time

[17-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Gazza#1311
i saw 275 buy wall

[17-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Gazza#1311
130 BTC sell wall

[17-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Gazza#1311
next to next on Bianace

[17-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Bittersweet#9376
This whale has bought a good amount

[17-Oct-18 11:54 AM] Gazza#1311
do you know at what price this whale started buying?

[17-Oct-18 11:54 AM] BlockTech#6895
@Gazza Yes he started with a buy wall of 2,5M ( 17k sat)

[17-Oct-18 11:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
there's a pirate correlation there somewhere....

[17-Oct-18 11:54 AM] BlockTech#6895
And got up to 19k, and let the price drop again to 17k, and now got up to 20k.

[17-Oct-18 11:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
boating... gold...

[17-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Gazza#1311
seems like preparation of some big pump

[17-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Gazza#1311
last 4 days up 32.87 with strong volume

[17-Oct-18 11:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@actionslacks are you calling me a liar......i hit a wave and it went overboard honestly

[17-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Gazza#1311
yeah and whale is still there with 189 BTC order in queue

[17-Oct-18 11:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
he really wants to buy

[17-Oct-18 11:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Got tired of waiting and went a bit crazy but calmed down and back to buying

[17-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Gazza#1311
buy and sell as well?

[17-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Gazza#1311
when price started going up another order of 126 BTC came up, i believe from same whale

[17-Oct-18 11:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
she was a wave the likes of which... eh. where the fuck is @blackbeard. miss that guy

[17-Oct-18 11:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
and his pox ridden gerbils

[17-Oct-18 12:00 PM] Gazza#1311
anything new happenign with KMD that whale buying before the event?

[17-Oct-18 12:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Nope

[17-Oct-18 12:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Started 3 days ago

[17-Oct-18 12:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
350BTC at 17k

[17-Oct-18 12:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
you mean besides 2 new coins that are gonna moon?

[17-Oct-18 12:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think he used the previously bought KMD to force people to sell into his buy order

[17-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Gazza#1311
gosh! we gotta find this whale and hunt him down lol

[17-Oct-18 12:01 PM] BlockTech#6895
He is probably in for some time, maybe just waiting for rebranding, or just for the Pump when masses will discover komodo.

[17-Oct-18 12:01 PM] BlockTech#6895
(he has been buying komodo since december)

[17-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gazza#1311
since march? I thought whale showed up 3 days ago with 350 BTC

[17-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Gazza#1311
so it that whale always around in buy or sell orders?

[17-Oct-18 12:03 PM] BlockTech#6895
He is probably this address : http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RD7SZpgtfrLXB32bRcckYaVmre2ByL73Pi

[17-Oct-18 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@BlockTech that address with 7.2M started in DEC 2017

[17-Oct-18 12:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
the whale has a very sophisticated trading strategy aimed at accumulation,

[17-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So this 51% attack, I guess the only ‚Äúattack‚Äù would be disrupting chain operations, privately mine the chain after each notarization then hit the main chain with it right before the next notarization, could be effective if there‚Äôs a pump on an exchange, hog the market to yourself while no one else can get coins on except the 51%er

[17-Oct-18 12:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It might be binance cold wallet, but we cant be 100% sure

[17-Oct-18 12:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
350 btc worth?

[17-Oct-18 12:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think so

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I also dont think binance is holding that much

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
confirmation times are too long on most exchanges to beat a notarization

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Gazza#1311
what whale planing 51% attack?

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But lets imagine it is CZ accumulating or someone of his stature

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] BlockTech#6895
@Gazza no it's another topic ^^

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If someone like that accumulates 10M KMD and then says

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hey I am ballz deep in kmd

[17-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Instant 500% return

[17-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then just chain disruption, but you can‚Äôt fund hate forever

[17-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What‚Äôs the point

[17-Oct-18 12:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
the point is academic as far as kmd dpow is concerned

[17-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Gazza#1311
Circulating Supply = 110,169,428 KMD, someone with 7210755 can't initiate 51% attack, they need 8 times more to do that

[17-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Emmm

[17-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd isnt PoS

[17-Oct-18 12:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
just a demonstration that is not profitable

[17-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So even holding 90% wont mean shit

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] BlockTech#6895
(you're talkind about 2 differents topic)

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Gazza#1311
can this wallet be from the team?

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Gazza#1311
generally they are the one who holds big accounts

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
its james

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Gazza no

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll fess up, it‚Äôs my wallet

[17-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
SuperNET and MShark are #2 and 3

[17-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I still have 87,932 btc left from early PC mining days

[17-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD is the best bet

[17-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So.. binance games

bitches

[17-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I actually had dinner with CZ last week, he can‚Äôt really hold his liquor all that well, he‚Äôs no mcafee to be sure

[17-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if

[17-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Gazza#1311
well crypto is wild west, no regulations and whales have full control

[17-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
