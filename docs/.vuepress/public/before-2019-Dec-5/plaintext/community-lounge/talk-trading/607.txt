Not mobile/lite

[06-May-19 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
that's not a GUI?

[06-May-19 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
that's certainly a "lite wallet"

[06-May-19 08:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And no. No desktop gui wallet for a long time.

[06-May-19 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
I know there was a desktop GUI wallet in 2016 as well

[06-May-19 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
was kind of shit, but there was one

[06-May-19 08:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
My monero was really shitty too and had bad rep if i remember correctly

[06-May-19 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
mymonero was *the* shit

[06-May-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
mymonero is one of the reasons it did so well IMO

[06-May-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
that and DNMs

[06-May-19 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
was easy to use and easy to buy drugs

[06-May-19 09:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember in 2015 i took a look at monero and it was the first purely command line wallet i installed since there was no gui

[06-May-19 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
if you look at the XMR chart, that first initial sky rocket pump was shortly after SR was shut down and the main DNM was Aurora

[06-May-19 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
they announced they would only support XMR

[06-May-19 09:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember mymonero had bad rep. There wad fud of it being a honeypot and some other stuff

[06-May-19 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
and it 5x'd overnight

[06-May-19 09:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, i remember that.

[06-May-19 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I remember wanting to buy xmr before this announcement but didnt because it wasnt listed in the exxhanges i used back then

[06-May-19 09:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Saw the rocket and was not so amused

[06-May-19 09:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is what i meant

[06-May-19 09:12 PM] Tek#5253
So I had some BTC.

[06-May-19 09:12 PM] Tek#5253
spent it all for KMD again

[06-May-19 09:12 PM] Tek#5253
hoping the whalebro is buying the bottom around here

[06-May-19 09:13 PM] Tek#5253
getting in around whalebro's price seems alrite

[06-May-19 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
anyone know anything about AETERNITY?

[06-May-19 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
AE

[06-May-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
About AETERNITY, I heard it is using cuckoo cycle as PoW (sorry it is not related to trading nor price)

[06-May-19 09:40 PM] Tek#5253
@phm87 know anything else about it?

[06-May-19 09:41 PM] Tek#5253
its pretty low low if not ATL right now

[06-May-19 09:42 PM] phm87#7395
AETERNITY was in the list of coins with BTC base and cuckoo as PoW (with Merit, BitCash before they switch to x16r)
Grin doesn't have a BTC base

[06-May-19 09:43 PM] phm87#7395
But apart from mining, I have no clues of what AETERNITY is about

[06-May-19 09:43 PM] Tek#5253
fug

[06-May-19 09:45 PM] Tek#5253
this is the short descrption of it on cmc

[06-May-19 09:45 PM] Tek#5253
Aeternity (AE) is a blockchain platform that focuses on high bandwidth transacting, purely-functional smart contracts, and decentralized oracles. It was founded in 2017, and seeks to eliminate inefficiencies in the crypto market by increasing scalability of smart contracts and dApps, sharding, and off-chain contract execution. The Turing-complete smart contracts on the Aeternity chain allow for transaction execution without third parties or intermediaries. Aeternity also has state channels to enable off-chain smart contract settlements which only touch the blockchain should a disagreement in the contract arise, acting as a self-arbitrating crypto court. The Aeternity blockchain is also built upon state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures which give rise to robust efficiency, strong security, and the elimination ‚Äúsingle point of failure‚Äù (SPOF) issues.

[06-May-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
well the last sentence can be written on many cryptos

[06-May-19 09:48 PM] phm87#7395
I have no clue if the features describes do exist now or are foreseen

[06-May-19 09:48 PM] Tek#5253
yeah m just gonna stick to what I know for now

[06-May-19 09:49 PM] phm87#7395
I think you know more than me

[06-May-19 09:49 PM] Tek#5253

I bought more KMD instead of AE

[06-May-19 09:50 PM] Tek#5253

[06-May-19 09:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

fidelity is about open a crypto exchange. maybe it's just traders stocking up for the fun.

[07-May-19 04:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
if it keeps going up they're gonna have to fast track the etf to keep it squashed.
