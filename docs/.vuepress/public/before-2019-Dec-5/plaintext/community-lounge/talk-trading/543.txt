guys why you think we were below 22k

[13-Apr-19 06:18 PM] dokrates#8987
honestly after several rise with HIGH volume

[13-Apr-19 06:19 PM] dokrates#8987
i didn't thought we were again below 24k

Somebody dumped a ton on KMD-USD on bittrex

[13-Apr-19 06:21 PM] dokrates#8987
when?

[13-Apr-19 06:21 PM] LeshAft9#0083

[13-Apr-19 06:21 PM] dokrates#8987

someone got 1681 KMD at $0.001 each

[13-Apr-19 06:22 PM] dokrates#8987
but not too much volume

[13-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
a "ton" must be a bit less than a BTC worth?

[13-Apr-19 06:22 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I retract that part üòõ

[13-Apr-19 06:23 PM] LeshAft9#0083
But they must have cleared the order book to hit $0.001

[13-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
they cleared the orderbook? seems like somebody is dumping hacked funds? did somebody lose a ton of KMD?

[13-Apr-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i heard the other day somebody sold 200k on binance, which is 40+ BTC

[13-Apr-19 06:25 PM] LeshAft9#0083
or drunk fat fingers

[13-Apr-19 06:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[13-Apr-19 06:42 PM] dokrates#8987

[13-Apr-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
dont trade if you are emotional

[13-Apr-19 06:43 PM] yaheardme#2938
average your buys homie, no one can always guess exact tops n bottoms its a game of %'s

[13-Apr-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
have specific buy/sell targets and stick to them

[13-Apr-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
or average in/out

[13-Apr-19 06:44 PM] yaheardme#2938
^

[13-Apr-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but selling at 22 to 24k is not any averaging, so likely you are trying to squeeze out more returns, but it is a danger game. the market does its best to confuse you

[13-Apr-19 06:44 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, that's what i did jl777

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
nah, i sold around 30k 28k

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
and rebought them

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
i'ts just a tiny percentage of my total holds

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
just 15%

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
heheh

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] dokrates#8987
im too much emotional with the projects i like

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is hard to trade without emotions when you know the fundamentals

[13-Apr-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but this market is dominated by TA types for now

[13-Apr-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and TA doesnt seem to care about anything else than price movement

[13-Apr-19 06:46 PM] dokrates#8987
yep

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
but yesterday when i saw price going below stratis i said myself, now is the moment!

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
hahaha

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] yaheardme#2938
you could try having a seperate short time frame trading account thats not emotionally connected to your full portfolio

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] yaheardme#2938
it can be good for practice

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
nah, it's just 15% of long holding

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
i don't be emotional

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
but anyway its my fault

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] dokrates#8987
i need to keep my emotions quiet

[13-Apr-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
then stick to your targets like a robot

[13-Apr-19 06:48 PM] dokrates#8987
exactly

[13-Apr-19 06:48 PM] dokrates#8987
that is the key!

[13-Apr-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and whatever happens, happens

[13-Apr-19 08:39 PM] richardt#2807
What's worked best for me is to have a plan for when I'm right and a plan for when I'm wrong.  For example:  selling a % during a pump to lock in profits in case it dumps, and holding a % in case in keeps going up.  Nobody is right 100% of the time.  Except for ComputerGenie, he's always right 100% of the time üòâ

Philip Fischer believed that what investors should trust and rely on is not an economic cycle or political variable, but a manager with a strong will to grow and action. To verify this, a tricky framework for analysis was put in place. Rather than looking at financial statements, sales, and stock price movements, they invest in a very small number of companies that can continue to grow with business models, research and development capabilities and outstanding management, and hold these shares for a long time.

He used to point out that the biggest loss in stock investment was selling a good company too early. If the company has long owned the company, it will generate phenomenal profits of tens to hundreds of times, but if the company sells it up by dozens of percent, it will be a loss in the long run. If you bought good company shares at a good price, you should make a sales decision based on fundamentals.

The stock that Fisher discovered by applying this principle was Motorola. Likewise, Texas Instruments, FMC, and Dow Chemical held their organs under such judgment. Motorola bought it in 1956 and held it for 35 years, and has been known to have posted a total profit of 2,488 times, with the number of shares jumping 144 times and share prices jumping 17 times.
