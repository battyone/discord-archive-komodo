Or is it no way around it?

amazing how resilient resilient Bitcoin is- each time some leeches try to coopt it with appliances rigged in someones favour, it sort of sheds its skin..
which always is sort of messy

@jl777c why you think it will start altseason? it could also start big btc dump and even bigger alts dump?

[04-Dec-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC dominance is at 70% or so because a lot of people dont consider anything but BTC can succeed. if BTC is clearly broken, it will force people to think about other coins. even if only 20% moves into altcoins, that will be a big effect

[04-Dec-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i have no idea if it will happen. probably it wont, but not guarantee that it wont

[04-Dec-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that it can happen at anytime in the future, all these segwit funds are stuck in anyonecan spend outputs

@hastrup , anonymint believes CSW will start dumping tulip trust Bitcoin just before the halving next year, at the same time he will attack Bitcoin chain to making it impossible for people to move their coins onto exchanges to dump. The theory is BSV is a red herring,  and TPTB intend to use the pre segwit Bitcoin that remains after this attack as the basis for a new global monetary system.  As jl777 said, the safe thing to do is store your Bitcoin in legacy addresses that start with a 1.
There's a thread on bitcointalk that discusses this theory in some detail, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5147618.0

[04-Dec-19 09:40 AM] Don King#8901
The tweet where CSW originally announced his 'advanced notice' was deleted when his Twitter account was removed, but there are screenshots in the thread I posted from BTT. The theory is because CSW intends to dump millions of Bitcoin he needs to give advanced warning to the market to comply with securities regulations. My thinking is segwit is an abomination anyway, so using legacy addresses is sensible no matter what, and while I doubt CSW is Satoshi,  he might have been involved with the Satoshi group, and might be the last one alive, and might actually get access to the tulip trust coins on Jan 1 2020. Either way, only a few weeks to wait before we know one way or the other.

[04-Dec-19 09:41 AM] Don King#8901
Better to stay safe and move all Bitcoin into legacy addresses

I think we didnt yet have a BTC crush that resulted in alts anti-crush , and most people I hear talking about crypto is talking about BTC which for them is alternative investment to banck account interest

I wonder by counts of people how big is BTC dominance, this could be like 99%

big players also follow small players, need to dump somwhere

fiat to crypto, btc is going to be very high like 95%+

BTC is risky, alts are 10x more risky

yes exactly, depends if cmc calculates BTC dominance correctly too üôÇ I bet they dont

[04-Dec-19 11:12 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if fake volumes of ETH and others were excluded we could have 95% BTC dominance already maybe ?

people are so much confused it's possible that broken btc will have even more value :abusedsmily:

BTC down 85% and most alts down 90% to 99%, that seems pretty extreme and has already happened. many alts have recovered from the deep bear market low, but it is a scattered thing and some are still at close to ATL

What is this world, I wake up and people are talking about anonymint. I have a couple of comments.  Has, as anonymint mentioned, the IRS set up a new attack on Bitcoin?
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5147618.200

Accordingly, an airdrop coin has taxes due once you receive it. Anonymint is speculating that CW drives up BTC core price, forks legacy off, stalls core chain, you now owe big taxes but can't move your coins . Price craters. You still owe big taxes, rekt

as always anonymint is just extremist in his views

[04-Dec-19 03:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
I like his trains of thought, but he usually fails to summarize them in tangible, succinct arguments, that unfortunately degrades it a bit into .. meandering ramblings .. would be a nice twist and increase impact if he would bother to give a few 'take home messages'

[04-Dec-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
extreme but with some very valid points. years before it started, he warned there would be a crackdown on ICO

[04-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c whats your current view on the market? U have previously been quite accurate

[04-Dec-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the BTC price seems to be priced at rock bottom, likely the larger players (miners, traders) trying to push out the smaller. halving is 6 months away, but still there is not much price action that correlates to that. how close to halving will it be before the bulls take over?

[04-Dec-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe this time around it really is different and halving wont have any noticeable effect

[04-Dec-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i lean toward the larger players trying to push out the smaller theory, but with all the derivatives on BTC now, it can be controlled with paper money, so it could be that the next high wont even reach the ATH. then again we could see $35k BTC and i wouldnt be surprised at all

[04-Dec-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr nobody knows and current price seems a slightly low but not unreasonable price. considering just several years ago the ATH was $1200 and it went down to $200 during the bear market, if $3000 was in fact the low this cycle, that means the prices are 10x.

[04-Dec-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i think last cycle at the peak, the price went to 10x mining costs. that would get us in the 50k range with current mining costs

[04-Dec-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but even a 3x to 4x mining costs at the peak gets us back to 20k, so there are a lot of things that will be clarified between now and a year from now.

@jl777c what about KMD ? You also see it rise in tandem with BTC or even outperform BTC ?

that all depends on BTC dominance. if it goes down, KMD will gain satoshis, this is clear. how much it will i cant predict

certainly if things go into million dollar BTC level, the dominance would have to be up at 90%+, which means all other coins would be down in sats, possibly by a crazy amount

[04-Dec-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a sudden rise to that level

[04-Dec-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a gradual rise to that level would likely keep current price relationships relatively intact

[04-Dec-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i keep saying BTC dominance is the dominant factor for KMD price, with occasional exceptions. and the BTC price in turn affects the KMD/USD price, ie. there seems to be a higher beta for the USD price changes and the movement in BTC (usually dominance change) is reflected in USD price.

[04-Dec-19 08:09 PM] richardt#2807
Yeah the dominance to KMD price chart looks almost perfectly symmetrical. Wonder why......

Still its very odds what happened yesterday, you would expect that someone or a group that is/are able to buy 200 btc worth of KMD are smarter than pumping the price like that and essentially overpaying a lot.

[04-Dec-19 08:22 PM] Neko#5830
maybe they know something we dont

[04-Dec-19 08:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Even then they would be able to buy substantial amounts in a short timespan without having to overpay like this

[04-Dec-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
probably there is no easy way to get 200 BTC at market price. i think the average paid was a 20% premium, maybe a bit less. if to buy slowly, the price could easily go up a lot more, that is 10x to 20x the normal daily volumes, ie. 2weeks to a months worth on binance during the low volume times. so what happens if the price is going up every day for 5 days in a row, we just saw the price double from below 6k sats

[04-Dec-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 20% premium was assessed as close to the best possible, though i would imagine it possible to have achieved it for 10% premium over 2 days, instead of all in an hour

[04-Dec-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
another theory is that two billionaires made a side bet that KMD price would go down the day deposits reopened and 200BTC was much smaller than their sidebet, or winning that bet was worth 40 BTC to whoever did it

[04-Dec-19 08:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
At least it means a serious player got hold of a big chunk of KMD which he or she will hold at these prices

[04-Dec-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i have been saying there has been a lot of KMD accumulation, a lot from china these last weeks

[04-Dec-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
OBV is at very high levels

[04-Dec-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is not a pump and dump, it is was a "pay a premium to accumulate"

[04-Dec-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i just noticed BTC price spiked 10% about 10 hours ago! didnt notice any change in KMD price to indicate that

[04-Dec-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810

also the near perfect inverse relationship to BTC dominance... it must mean something, but not sure what
