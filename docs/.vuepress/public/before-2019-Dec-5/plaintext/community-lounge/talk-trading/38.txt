With the news in mind

im keen to get at least 1 or 2 miners to try out

[02-Jul-18 03:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
raw hash-2-hash ZEC is slightly more profitable than KMD; by the time you factor in NNs' cut of blocks, most will choose to mine ZEC over KMD

[02-Jul-18 03:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the flip side of that is that the vast majority will do so on the short-sighted lack of realization the KMD can 4x far faster and far more easily than ZEC

man, that's some hardcore mini volume manipulation right there

10 trades/sec for almost two hours now

[02-Jul-18 04:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe coinbase is faking trade volume hoping to match coinex's fake volume?

[02-Jul-18 04:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Or maybe a 6 month old exchange did have a billion dollars worth of BTC/USDT trades in one day 🙄

1/ Update on my hack. We believe it was a hacker group going by the name "Lizard Squad." They've been behind numerous attacks on other people and companies in the crypto space. We've received intel the same hackers are responsible for hacking Bithumb exchange.

$BTC Major Trend Reversal in progress, turning from Lower Highs/Lower Lows into Higher Lows/Higher Highs. Trendline has been broken and is being retested from above. Double Bottom has been triggered at $6300, takeout of $6545 High would be the confirmation by definition

Here's my log chart, pay close attention to how we broke the trend-line only to continue riding it down from the other side. Want to know what the break on my chart and the break on his chart have in common? No volume to support the break https://www.tradingview.com/x/g2k2ndxp/

We continue to set lower highs and lower lows with no significant indicators we're preparing to flip.

If he called for a short term trend reversal I'd cut them some slack, but a major one

10 million dollars or contracts?

[02-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Jazzy#0001
Both

[02-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Jazzy#0001
1 contract = 1 dollar

[02-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Jazzy#0001
But 100x leverage is a thing on mex

[02-Jul-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, I thought it was for a big amount

[02-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Jazzy#0001
Well it still could be

[02-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Jazzy#0001
We don't know how much leverage it was using

[02-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Jazzy#0001
But odds are good it could have been 5-50x

[02-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Jazzy#0001
You'd could try and match the liquidation to a corresponding buy earlier for an educated guess

[02-Jul-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it was just the same as an exchange listing fee at on of the bigger exchanges

[02-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The number of “100” texticons or whatever you call that shit is the amount of leverage the liquidated was using

[02-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
53x in that case

[02-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
Oh shit really?

[02-Jul-18 01:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
I had no idea

the amount of sympathy to offer the rekt
