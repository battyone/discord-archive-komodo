i mean, the part where you need to set a public ip server and good internet connection.

[01-Dec-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just need a bob oriented GUI

[01-Dec-18 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this

[01-Dec-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
which nobody ever made (yet)

[01-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jorian#4555
because it is a tad harder to do so

[01-Dec-18 02:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i had a guy that got interested in doing it on his free time, but he got a new job and lost interest

[01-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jorian#4555
there is job and there is free time

[01-Dec-18 02:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and exchange would help on it imo

[01-Dec-18 02:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
get sever space to run mm nodes.

[01-Dec-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there's nothing "hard" about it really, but to do it right requires someone good at doing frontends **and** someone to do the backened

[01-Dec-18 02:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
containerized mm instances

[01-Dec-18 02:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then the exchange can offer the interface

[01-Dec-18 02:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example in dp, a section called "dex marketmakers" or something like that.

[01-Dec-18 02:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then have a easy to use interface where you send funds to and set pricing.

[01-Dec-18 02:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe some projects failing is freeing up some devs

[01-Dec-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
design the frontend (the seen bits) in a way that someone can make a backend (the connect to mm bit) in a non-confusing way (that's also intuitive for the user) and I'm sure that the rest will get done fairly "quickly"

[01-Dec-18 03:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
running the mm instance with `docker=1` parameter lets it get connected from a remote interface

[01-Dec-18 03:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so we could get it working similar to how masternodes work on other blockchains.

[01-Dec-18 03:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example i have seen CROWN community has set up sites where you just pay for the server space and it gets automatically deployed with all you need

[01-Dec-18 03:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then from the wallet you connect to that server and complete the masternode setup from your local pc

[01-Dec-18 03:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that could be done with mm nodes too

[01-Dec-18 04:13 PM] tolken#2655
@siu - Chainmakers  respectfully, marketmaker liquidy isn‚Äôt the main issue.  I have bobs configured, most combinations of all had at least a couple trades go through over the past 6 months, for many of the most common pairs and see virtually no buy requests from alices, particularly lately.  Ordermatching, for whatever reason, isn‚Äôt reliable. Most Alice buyers try and give up. A handful of times I‚Äôve seen people here say  ‚Äúwts bch‚Äù or something, I let them know it‚Äôs in bdex, then they just go fill their orders in a cex.  I agree we need to have an easier to setup marketmaker, but I don‚Äôt think that has much of anything to do with the lack of activity on bdex.

[01-Dec-18 04:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are definitively performance issues on current mm iteration.

[01-Dec-18 04:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but at the same time, the more orders available there are, the greater the possibility to diminish these issues

[01-Dec-18 04:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
mm2.0 will solve most of the performance issues, but at the end, if there is no liquidity, there is not much that can be done.

[01-Dec-18 04:17 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, I am really excited to see that. I told Santa that‚Äôs all I want for christmas.

[01-Dec-18 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example we are currently testing a new redesign of AtomicDEX

[01-Dec-18 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will work similar to shapeshift and dICO app

[01-Dec-18 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but much more responsive than dICO app

[01-Dec-18 04:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
user wont need to set price or utxo size, that will be handled in the background.

[01-Dec-18 04:20 PM] tolken#2655
Excellent. Does it Just split to optimal UTXOs based on dICO specified parameters?

[01-Dec-18 04:21 PM] tolken#2655
Or something more complex than that?

[01-Dec-18 04:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will autosplit on the first swap you try for a new address

[01-Dec-18 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
some work is being done on detecting if the utxo size needed is available if it not, create it, but that will be integrated in mm2.0

[01-Dec-18 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
right now its working on mm1.0 and its doing quite well.

cryptomiso is tracking the barterDEX repo for mm1, not even mm2. and not any of the actual komodo repo

[01-Dec-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and so does coincheckup

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/graphs/commit-activity i believe shows around 3000+ commits just to komodo and i think it only counts master branch so next time we update master the stats will increase a lot more

Larimer, during the conversation on the telegram group, said that crypto people will hate it. ‚ÄúHowever‚Ä¶ if you trust the creator and have confidence in the security‚Ä¶ then it will enable more decentralized version of bitcoin with no limits a tps,‚Äù he said. He indicated that once created the token will be fully decentralized ‚Äúmore so than any blockchain‚Äù.

This makes me cringe

Its sad that @jl777c gets so much hate because of the "he abandons projects" gossips when he has helped everyone from his previous projects move on to the new ones and has always been accountable for maintaining the value of the coins being migrated.

[01-Dec-18 05:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But Larimer completely abandons preivous projects, he has not helped holders of his previous coins to migrate to new ones but still he is praised.

@Vertigo Saw you post about your holdings several times now: you are making yourself a target, don't tell ppl how much crypto you have/bought/sell/own. Usually it's enough to say you are exposed a little bit, or give percantages of your portfolio, so ppl don't know if it's 100 dollars or 100k dollars.
