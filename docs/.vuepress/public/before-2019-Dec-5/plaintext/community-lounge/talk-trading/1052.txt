[08-Aug-19 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[08-Aug-19 02:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

even a whale is not needed, but enough that in China there is a flash mob for the purchase of 1 komodo and we fly to the moon with a billion capitalizationðŸ˜„

@siu - Chainmakers do we have resistance within this channel?

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is is not a channel in my chart

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is a ED formation

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
once it breaks the above line it should bounce hard.

[08-Aug-19 02:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Need confirmation tho

[08-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Flint#6435
what about low trading volumes?

[08-Aug-19 02:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but bullish divergence in daily RSI and diminishing volume on all this move down seems to indicate that a bottom will be found soon

[08-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Markus#5464
Flint rly

[08-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Markus#5464
ur still not understanding?

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
we talked about alts and kmd pretty much whole day yesterday and u ask about volume when it should be obvious at this point

[08-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Flint#6435
paired with bitcoin, its time to find the bottom! but in a pair to the dollar we can still fall

[08-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Flint#6435
I'm sorry, but I probably missed something

[08-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Markus#5464
so is kmd only alt dumping?

[08-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Markus#5464
what u think Flint

[08-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Flint#6435
I simply do not stop being confused by these low trading volumes without good green candles from a minimum of local

[08-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Markus#5464
there is no interest in alt coins so ofc it result in low volume and pretty much everyone selling will dump price cause theres nobody buying when everyone focus on bitcoin

[08-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Markus#5464
thats how the market work and have been working for a while

[08-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Markus#5464
first btc then alts when whales see bigger opportunity in alts

[08-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Flint#6435
its all the damn bitcoin dominance. need a certain bitcoin movement so that traders stop taking money from komodo for the sake of bitcoin

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] dan.#2473
@hyperDEX i know a lady who will do it

[08-Aug-19 02:58 PM] dan.#2473
is that a for real bounty?

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
ðŸ¤” if i stay longer at work shitposting

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus   yes you are absolutely right but there is definitely a group of traders who are waiting for a certain price good for themselves on komodo maybe 68k satoshi maybe another price - after all, we have already seen a powerful upward movement after local lows

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
I can go home earlier tomorrow ðŸ¤”

[08-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
stay an half hour longer shitposting on company time? ðŸ¤”

[08-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Markus#5464
30 min is nothing

[08-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Tek#5253
but the sun is shinin yo i want to fug off outta here

[08-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Flint#6435
but the current small price rebound inspires confidence that if we have not yet found the absolute bottom, then next to it - in any case, we also dont see large volumes for sales, and this is good when sales volumes do not exceed purchases several times â€” but buyers so far careful - maybe the whale is sitting and waiting for its reasonable price, which is close to the current one but still higher, otherwise we would have already seen a powerful pump

[08-Aug-19 03:05 PM] dan.#2473
@hyperDEX if you're serious DM me, I know a gorgeous lady. If not that's ok

[08-Aug-19 03:06 PM] Flint#6435
would gain a foothold above $ 1 and then at least the bottom had decided that we wont go lower but for now fortune-telling on coffee grounds

[08-Aug-19 03:45 PM] dxer666#8963
1 sat is bottom

[08-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Markus#5464
There is always this one person ðŸ˜‚

[08-Aug-19 04:16 PM] Oszy#5734
1 sat is not the end, the end is when there is no buy order at 1 sat ðŸ˜‚

[08-Aug-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
Some exchanges have price precision of 0.01 sat. And if there is no buyers at all, the "buy price" can be 0. For other coins, I saw one buyer at 1 sat : maybe he wanted to buy all of these coins

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Oszy#5734
oh yes there is 0

[08-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Oszy#5734
bitconneect

[08-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bcash requires 20 confirmations ffs

[08-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thought that was 5 confs only for CEX as well

[08-Aug-19 04:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
probably cex & payment service providers have different requirements

[08-Aug-19 05:16 PM] phm87#7395
@Oszy BCC scam/ponzi have a price on cmc and on coinpaprika but hopefully I found no exchange. I have no clues where these prices are coming from
https://coinpaprika.com/coin/bcc-bitconnect/
Warning for noobs: bcc is a well known ponzi (with jail maybe for its creators), do not buy that shit

Unfortunately bcc2.0 was launched recently on eth and it raised several btc in eth. Sad to see such new old scam

[08-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
the best was when they launched bitconnect X and felt so bad for ppl that they decided to accept their own coin worth 0 as payment

[08-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Oszy#5734
what? it raised money? wtf is wrong with people
