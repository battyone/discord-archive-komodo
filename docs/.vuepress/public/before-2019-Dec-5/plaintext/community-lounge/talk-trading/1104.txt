Komodo had its first meetup on the continent of Africa! 

It was organized by a group of students on the Kampala International University in Uganda.

I think there’s an AMA coming that should give more info... check K64 discord for that... as I said there: I reserve any judgement without tangible information.

[02-Sep-19 02:23 PM] Caglio#3337
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 im banned there, meanwhile they are drinking champagne on a plane :)

[02-Sep-19 02:24 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

[02-Sep-19 03:25 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Binance pays 5% kmd interest now? Oh, shit. That's bad.

[02-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
It's bad already with binance's safu propaganda.

[02-Sep-19 03:27 PM] Markus#5464
kmd already give u 5% interest

[02-Sep-19 03:28 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
binance just want that people keep their kmd in binance. That is the problem.

[02-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Flint#6435
but they have already abandoned anonymity - which used to be a problem for exchanges

[02-Sep-19 03:45 PM] grumpygoron#4320

[02-Sep-19 05:30 PM] tolken#2655
Lot of interesting data in that app

[02-Sep-19 05:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
@mrtzmp3 I had to visit K64's website to look at their CEO after I chuckled at your comment.  The whole group of them is begging for a game of adding captions.  "Natalie Wang while witnessing 2-girls-1-cup." and "Nik Ter Beek also watching 2-girls-1-cup."

[02-Sep-19 07:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
K64 drama still in Limbo? weird exercise in futility that

[02-Sep-19 07:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Notice how they all look to the side

[02-Sep-19 07:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@meatspoon

[02-Sep-19 07:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
As to suggest a approachability / being non confronting

[02-Sep-19 07:02 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's what a literally conman would do before he sells you any scam

[02-Sep-19 07:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or they simply can't look us in the eyes

[02-Sep-19 07:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
did anyone check their backgrounds?
like, all of those ten guys on the website, and really look for credentials?

[02-Sep-19 07:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lol ofc not

[02-Sep-19 07:04 PM] LocoMB#8593
to, me that is always a fun exercise

[02-Sep-19 07:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes maybe someone did

Someone said TP had a history of scamming

[02-Sep-19 07:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
always a great laugh when some ICO scammers on bitcointalk get exposed within 24 hours for pulling stock images from LinkedIn ..
it would surprise me if these guys were so totally fake

[02-Sep-19 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’re real enough

[02-Sep-19 07:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
look at the support staff- who is Karenina Mulder - and what has she done before?

[02-Sep-19 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[02-Sep-19 07:07 PM] LocoMB#8593
with this kind of setup, I'd have a hard time imagining that the whole team would be in on a pure scam#

[02-Sep-19 07:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I guess they will make some games

[02-Sep-19 07:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
But it will be pacman 2.0

[02-Sep-19 07:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
buuuut - posting pics from business class cabins does smell and look not good at all

[02-Sep-19 07:10 PM] LocoMB#8593
prly one of the main guys has some narcissistic personality disorder

[02-Sep-19 07:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Oh shit

[02-Sep-19 07:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
How you conclude this

[02-Sep-19 07:10 PM] LocoMB#8593
I worked with one such whacko for 9 months 20 years ago-

[02-Sep-19 07:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Do they have twatter

[02-Sep-19 07:11 PM] LocoMB#8593
this kind of over the top exultance reminds me of that - _total_ incomprehension of appropriate style

[02-Sep-19 07:12 PM] LocoMB#8593
just a guess though, but this kind of disconnect fits the bill

[02-Sep-19 07:12 PM] LocoMB#8593
favourite quotes:
'fake it until you make it'
and:
'either steal a company, or make one yourself if that doesnt work'

[02-Sep-19 07:13 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Haha I feel you I get similar vibes

[02-Sep-19 07:13 PM] LocoMB#8593
I was in that situtation that my boss spouted success reports that were totally not real

[02-Sep-19 07:13 PM] LocoMB#8593
kinda embarassing
