didn't the last parabolic come shortly before and the following year, rather than "a year before"?

[25-Mar-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but end of bear was year before

[25-Mar-19 05:14 PM] MyName#0491
what I mean is that 1 year before the last was fairly flat (especially when you count the prior decline)

[25-Mar-19 05:15 PM] MyName#0491
it was much closer, imo, to the halving than 1 year when any meaningful movement happened

[25-Mar-19 05:23 PM] MyName#0491
~ 7 months of meh between bear and bull (which was closer to 9-10 months back from the halving for the 2 month long 2x)

[25-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
btc flash crash but instantly bought back up

[25-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
went to 3960 on bitfinex from 4030

[25-Mar-19 05:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@jl777c i remember you saying we are still very much in a bear market one month or so ago , you have changed opinion

[25-Mar-19 05:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
?

[25-Mar-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the longer we go without retesting $3100, the more likely that becomes the bear market low

[25-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and as get closer to halving the odds reduce even more

[25-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if course, anything can happen but fundamentally the halving means half the coins for miners

[25-Mar-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and who is still holding BTC who hasnt sold, but will sell if the price goes down?

[25-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be a lot of resistance as the price climbs the wall of worry, until something happens and fomo sets in

[25-Mar-19 05:27 PM] Markus#5464
Ppl often talk about a quick capulation candle being needed, what u guys think of that

[25-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
we are nowhere close to the next fomo moment

[25-Mar-19 05:27 PM] MyName#0491
@Markus Wick aside, it was -0.34765334% (aka, not really worth mentioning)

[25-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
was $3100 the capitulation? only hindsight will know for sure

[25-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
thats the thing about TA, after the fact it is "so obvious" where the bottom was, but as the prices are being experienced there is no such sense of "so obvious". in reverse, when things were at $20,000 which was the "so obvious" top in hindsight, was it really that obvious as it pulled back to $17k and then rallied again>

[25-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
thats the thing, based on what actually happens,  it totally changes things

[25-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so anybody that has any confidence about near term price points is delusional or a big giant whale who can paint whatever chart they want, since they have 100,000+ BTC and a few billion in trading capital

[25-Mar-19 05:31 PM] MyName#0491
so, in other words, you "paint whatever chart you want" :troll:

[25-Mar-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
Haha

[25-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c Do u believe in market cycle strategy when it comes to btc? Do u think the parabolic curve will apply all the way or at some point break out of its repeating style?

[25-Mar-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the cycle comes out of the 4 year halving

[25-Mar-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the parabolic is a side effect of BTC starting at 0 and like a cork that is deep in the ocean, at first will rise parabolically

[25-Mar-19 05:44 PM] MyName#0491
I'm personally curious what will happen if/when media/TV/movies stop perpetuation the notion that crypto is mainly only used "by criminals"
It will be interesting to see the effect the shift in psychology has on BTC price specifically given the it is the main target of the demonization

[25-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
It will be interesting to see what will happen in the future with bitcoin when next halvenings happen, either price will sky rocket or miners and so on will turn towards another coin more profitable to mine

[25-Mar-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
Or maybe mining wont be a thing later on

[25-Mar-19 05:50 PM] MyName#0491
tbh, I don't see miners being a meaningful factor anymore
the last bubble created enough large farms that can afford the newest miners in bulk (and are in it for the long haul) that hobby miners could all go away and it wouldn't have more than a 2-4 week impact on anything

[25-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
Yes but imagine halvening coming after 2020 halvening, block reward will be 3.125 per 10 min

[25-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
thats not alot

[25-Mar-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no other SHA256 coin of any meaningful value

[25-Mar-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
miners will keep mining BTC until it doesnt pay for electricity

normal behaviour is for the price to never get too far from 8ema

right now, since we are on a new week, we are retesting the 8ema and at the same time confirming support at the 8/41 inflection point.

[25-Mar-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
well its behaving normally, so that is clearly the sign of the end

💯 ⤵ 

[25-Mar-19 05:56 PM] MyName#0491
for those large farms, the slice of the $7.2M a day now and $3.6M a day in 2020 will more than offset the 2024 of "only" $1.8M a day if it stays flat forever and donkeys don't keep pushing up the price of tx fees

[25-Mar-19 05:57 PM] MyName#0491
`miners will keep mining BTC until it doesnt pay for electricity`
Many go past that on prayers and spec of the next parabolic

[25-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
Is 8ema crossing 200ma a big deal?

[25-Mar-19 06:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
dumpppppp it

[25-Mar-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tested the same local low of 3/21

[25-Mar-19 06:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
testing*

[25-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Buddz1993#5380
some volatility is needed

I want to buy btc at 3k plzz

[25-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Will we break below is the question

[25-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Im either waiting for the last big drop

[25-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
or will there be more?

[25-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if we go below next stop is 3700-3600ish?

[25-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
who knows.

[25-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I guess.

so far its going to that maximine coin´

@Markus  wishful thinking

[25-Mar-19 06:52 PM] p.#1126
its called USDT

`I want to buy btc at 3k plzz`
You might could get that on a wick, but I think it will be a while before it drops back again as a real number
Current sentiment and the new 15-series miners, I don't see a floor below 3600

[25-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Buy high, sell dip

[25-Mar-19 08:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Load the dip, dont mind BTC dipping to 1K. Then i have a chance to get my hands on a full BTC to HODL (and some extra KMD which will be like 25 cents then)

[25-Mar-19 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`dont mind BTC dipping to 1K`
imo, if that happened and everything else didn't follow, it wouldn't ever recover to top 10

[25-Mar-19 08:43 PM] p.#1126
@CoinKing88 if that happens 75% of alts disappear

[25-Mar-19 08:44 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well 75% of alts will disappear no matter what

[25-Mar-19 08:44 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Question is how fast that will happen

[25-Mar-19 08:44 PM] MyName#0491
the use of the term "alts" is 99% of the problem 😣

"alts" is only a valid term if one subscribes to the belief that BTC is "the coin"

[25-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Tek#5253

review this in 2 years

[25-Mar-19 08:51 PM] MyName#0491
2 days, 2 months, 2 years, 2 decades, or 2 centuries and I'll still say that the space as a whole suffers by determining that every crypto is an "alternative" currency to BTC and that the term should only be used with the **inclusion** of BTC (whereby all crypto is an "alt" to fiat)

[25-Mar-19 08:52 PM] p.#1126
if they have USD pairs

`last time i checked BTC was still #1`
in market cap and similar metrics, yes, and that fact coupled with the fact that it's literally among the least innovative in the current sphere is **a bad thing**

gold bricks dont have usb ports

[25-Mar-19 08:55 PM] MyName#0491
`if they have USD pairs`
Because USD is the only fiat left in the world?

[25-Mar-19 08:56 PM] MyName#0491
it's sad the narrow thinking that exists within this space that is supposed to be "outside the box" 🤦

Yes and a Model-A Ford is a better, more valuable car than a 2019 'supercar', right?

It's actually more appropriate than one might think

[25-Mar-19 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the  main difference is I don't see fanboys saying daily how great a Model-A is

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] p.#1126
all well and good

[25-Mar-19 09:09 PM] p.#1126
but you buy KMD it moons, you sell to BTC

[25-Mar-19 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Actually, I don't; I get more value for exchange with or without BTC, because BTC isn't the only thing to pair to/with (which is the point of a currency)

[25-Mar-19 09:11 PM] p.#1126
i guess USD is also halvening in 2021

[25-Mar-19 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
again, why is your brain stuck on the myopic notion that BTC and USD are all that matter in the world?

[25-Mar-19 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if I told you that the vast majority of the people in the world have not only never used USD, they've never even seen it?
