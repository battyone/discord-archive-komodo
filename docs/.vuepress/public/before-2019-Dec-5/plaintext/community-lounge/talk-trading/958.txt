[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Caglio#3337
agama dude

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we did get rekt, by agama

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
(we got it back but it still sucked)

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Literally saved everyone's funds tho

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Caglio#3337
I never got my 36 kmd back

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Caglio#3337
I didnt felt like fulfilling forms

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Caglio#3337
but it fucked me up totally

[23-Jul-19 09:56 AM] Caglio#3337
changing two different set of keys

[23-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Caglio#3337
making them again

[23-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Caglio#3337
I dont need that bullshit

[23-Jul-19 09:58 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's the 01.04 of the year 2030 . Komodo price is now 2666dollars.  @Caglio - I was to lazy to fullfill the form + I just send 500 Komodo to wrong address. I am still looking for the key

[23-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Caglio#3337
36 kmd dude :/

[23-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Caglio#3337
if I lost this 500 then fuck it

[23-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Caglio#3337
if hacker is still checking them out

[23-Jul-19 10:00 AM] Caglio#3337
plus kmd 2030 = 3$ at most

[23-Jul-19 10:00 AM] Caglio#3337
3$ / 100 satoshies

[23-Jul-19 10:01 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You are beyond help my dude

[23-Jul-19 10:05 AM] Keppie#5156
for my understanding, holding in Agama will be as beneficial as holding on binance right ?

[23-Jul-19 10:05 AM] hastrup#8742
@Keppie you don't own your keys so no

[23-Jul-19 10:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
long term yes (and more beneficial since you hold keys)

[23-Jul-19 10:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but short term holding on binance from July 24 to Sept 1 will be more beneficial, since you get stake rewards AND part of the bonus reward

[23-Jul-19 10:06 AM] Keppie#5156
Not sure if worth

[23-Jul-19 10:06 AM] Keppie#5156
Dont like CEX

divide 250k by your portion of 2 million (plus new deposits), then ask yourself if you want to give someone else control of all your funds for that 3 cent return

[23-Jul-19 10:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
they had way more than 2M before

[23-Jul-19 10:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i believe the #2 address with over 8M is also a binance address

[23-Jul-19 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
was just an off the top of my head number, but the more they have is the more the per divisor is

[23-Jul-19 10:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i think they have more than 10M

[23-Jul-19 10:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so yeah

[23-Jul-19 10:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its not a huge amount more, but its something

[23-Jul-19 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
either way, the return is small compared to giving up custody

[23-Jul-19 10:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338
true

[23-Jul-19 10:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its nice that our trading positions can sit on binance and earn rewards now though

[23-Jul-19 10:10 AM] Alexfrog#1338
really nice

[23-Jul-19 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
for that, yes
but I'd advise against "extra" just for it

[23-Jul-19 10:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but, how will we lose all our money in a binance hack if we hold them ourselves instead of trusting a 3rd party

nice to see it boucning again from 12k

[23-Jul-19 10:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
instead of just full retracing

[23-Jul-19 10:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
to 11.4

[23-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Also, how funny is it:
Antara release, rebrand, etc: no price movement.
Binance enable getting rewards for hodling on exchange:  Pump instantly.

[23-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
tech: no one gives a fuck.
binance doing something = pump

[23-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Keppie#5156
money money money

[23-Jul-19 10:14 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
After XLM binance stake announcement it mooned but fully retraced . Then mooned again . And again fully retraced as of now. Make of this what you want :)

[23-Jul-19 10:15 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[23-Jul-19 10:27 AM] Caglio#3337
only thing that can happen is they go bankrupt

[23-Jul-19 10:27 AM] Caglio#3337
which wont happen

[23-Jul-19 10:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alexfrog no pricemovement for rebrand ? You must have missed the moon mission to 17 k ??

[23-Jul-19 10:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
And even before when all alts died kmd held strong

[23-Jul-19 10:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
1, that was before, 2, 17k isnt moon, its not even as high as it was in june

[23-Jul-19 10:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
From 880 it's moon my friend

[23-Jul-19 10:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
And obviously was before

[23-Jul-19 10:29 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
News was sold

[23-Jul-19 10:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Just get ready to buy when it retrace to 1125

[23-Jul-19 10:30 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Your welcome

[23-Jul-19 10:30 AM] Markus#5464
when moon

[23-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
referring to moves of less than 10x as 'moon'...

[23-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
100% moves are nothing, shit goes up 100% and back down 50% all the time

[23-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Markus#5464
so if a coin never goes up 10x it never mooned?

[23-Jul-19 10:36 AM] Markus#5464
interesting view

[23-Jul-19 10:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
1200% polo pumps

[23-Jul-19 10:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Those were the days

[23-Jul-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's figure of speech for a unordinary raise kk

[23-Jul-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Alexfrog

[23-Jul-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
üëç

[23-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
moon is when you can sell and have made enough to retire üòÑ

[23-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Markus#5464
good luck doing that in 1 trade

[23-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
of course, people with more money than you hit moon first, dump, and you get rekt

[23-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Markus#5464
doubt u will ever find 1 single coin to do so with anymore

[23-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
therefore moon is always an unattainable goal for us fish

[23-Jul-19 10:44 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Alts are just not in a good position for moon atm

[23-Jul-19 10:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
alts are in the depths of the abyss

[23-Jul-19 10:44 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
We probably entered accumulation phase for certain alts

[23-Jul-19 10:44 AM] Markus#5464
why would u want a 3x on kmd when u can sell top of pumps and buy back cheaper and in same time made 5-6x instead of 3x

[23-Jul-19 10:45 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
With possible altseason ( which might or might not happen at all ) end of 2019 . Early 2020

[23-Jul-19 10:45 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Imo

[23-Jul-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
predicting something just make u silly

[23-Jul-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
nobody knows

[23-Jul-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
and nobody will know

[23-Jul-19 10:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You can chart market cap of alts and btc dominance it can give estimation

[23-Jul-19 10:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
But y are partially right

[23-Jul-19 10:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Better than nothing

[23-Jul-19 10:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Though

[23-Jul-19 10:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can compare also those charts to prevoius circles

[23-Jul-19 10:47 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Which I did

[23-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Markus#5464
then charting btc dominance atm tells u that alts will suffer even more cause it sound support on 67.5%

[23-Jul-19 10:47 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Exactly
