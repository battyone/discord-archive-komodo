you just have to accept the truth that there are differences between groups of humans

[11-Sep-19 01:36 PM] Tek#5253
aka races

[11-Sep-19 01:37 PM] JimD#9272
Some cultures are capable of getting to the stars

[11-Sep-19 01:37 PM] denio#8067

[11-Sep-19 01:37 PM] JimD#9272

[11-Sep-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253
are all human breeds equal? no

[11-Sep-19 01:38 PM] JimD#9272
Well there is not a lot of evidence to support that all cultures will be able to achieve equal outcomes

[11-Sep-19 01:38 PM] denio#8067

[11-Sep-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253

A society has to be motivated to achieve great things

[11-Sep-19 01:39 PM] JimD#9272
they also have to have talent

I still have lot of Ron Paul coin. It was worth something like 15 btc in early-mid 2014. Holded it all to zero. carry on.

any society built out there will be superior because it will have to be a hard meritocracy

I think there has to be a balance in between love and war

Earth wont stay habitable forever fren.

[11-Sep-19 01:41 PM] JimD#9272
just because a group of people fucks more does not mean they inherit the earth

[11-Sep-19 01:41 PM] Tek#5253

Some places outlaw homeschooling

[11-Sep-19 01:54 PM] JimD#9272
Germany did iirc

[11-Sep-19 01:54 PM] JimD#9272
can't be thinking the wrong things

[11-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
when you have homeschooling, don't you need to participate in a central exam that controls you actually learned shit?

[11-Sep-19 01:55 PM] JimD#9272
Yup and most homeschooled kids outperform their public school counterparts

History

[11-Sep-19 01:57 PM] JimD#9272
playing instruments makes people smart AF

[11-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
According to non-leftists

[11-Sep-19 01:58 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, whoever writes the history books is the real question

[11-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think schooling is actually VERY important

[11-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also to learn people social behavior etc

[11-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you see that kids nowadays have bad manners etc, one can only hope they get somewhat raised at school so they arent a complete lost cause by 18

[11-Sep-19 02:03 PM] JimD#9272
They don't actually socialize much now though

[11-Sep-19 02:03 PM] JimD#9272

[11-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But maybe that's more a problem that some parents shouldnt have kids more than anything

[11-Sep-19 02:03 PM] JimD#9272
Its been perverted just like everything else

[11-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont blame the parents? what

[11-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Parents these days have ZERO control over their kids

[11-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if kids do anything wrong is everyones fault but their little devil of a kid they raised

[11-Sep-19 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So what? If I did something wrong in school and my parents heard about it I got in trouble even more

[11-Sep-19 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
nowadays parents lawyer up and sue the school because they think their kid is a fucking saint

[11-Sep-19 02:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Even though in reality their kid is a fucking demon in the flesh

[11-Sep-19 02:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My gf works in education and the stories she sometimes tell me makes me fear for the worst tbh

[11-Sep-19 02:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In 10-20 years we will have a completely retarded generation that thinks they can get away with anything and thinks they deserve the world without doing anything for it

[11-Sep-19 02:08 PM] denio#8067
so you want no school @Deleted User ?

[11-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you said earlier it was the job of the schools to raise kids @Deleted User and now you say it's in the hands of the parents?

[11-Sep-19 02:09 PM] denio#8067
or what is your solution

[11-Sep-19 02:10 PM] denio#8067
thats a wonderfull solution for countrys with too few teachers...but its not better then a good teacher

[11-Sep-19 02:10 PM] denio#8067
did you read what you post?

[11-Sep-19 02:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
self teaching ok, but that is purely to gain knowledge, it doesnt teach kids correct manners/social behavior

[11-Sep-19 02:11 PM] denio#8067
i work in education so i know this experiments....

[11-Sep-19 02:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and that is why schools also have a big reason of existence

[11-Sep-19 02:11 PM] denio#8067
all studys we have worldwide say that : "the teacher has the biggest impact"

[11-Sep-19 02:12 PM] denio#8067
so maybe we should care more about teachers and their training

you cannot learn experience tbh

[11-Sep-19 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's all fine and dandy if you are smart, but if you are moderately or below average intelligence self learnign might not be for you.

[11-Sep-19 02:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And still doesnt solve the fact that EQ is also a thing

[11-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you want/need a job 90% of the time you will be in contact with other people

[11-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so EQ is equally important as IQ

[11-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I didnt like math, but in the end it was the most important course for me in my later academic career

point I'm making, if you give kids a chance to have them select themselves what they 'want' to learn, they will follow stupid classes

[11-Sep-19 02:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they dont always know what is good for them

as someone pointed out above, math/physics/languages/gym and some interesting stuff like history are just needed

[11-Sep-19 02:16 PM] JimD#9272
I did IT because I was good at video games and it was high paying

[11-Sep-19 02:16 PM] JimD#9272
turned out ok for me

[11-Sep-19 02:19 PM] JimD#9272
Really depends

[11-Sep-19 02:19 PM] JimD#9272
Asian parents are tough on their kids and push them towards STEM
