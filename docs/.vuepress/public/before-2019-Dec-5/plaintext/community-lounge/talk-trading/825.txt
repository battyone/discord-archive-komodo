EOS made a billion dollars I don't see any marketing. Just Hype, Hype works better.

[22-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Vertigo#0439
Komodo should do the 1M transactions per second thing now.

[22-Jun-19 11:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Jl777  believes in reality

[22-Jun-19 11:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
No hype

[22-Jun-19 11:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I believe eventually he will be correct

[22-Jun-19 11:19 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It just sucks watching

[22-Jun-19 11:19 PM] Vertigo#0439
This wallet mess didn't help either

[22-Jun-19 11:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Vertigo hype = pump then dump, we dont have 4B worth of bag holders

[22-Jun-19 11:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We need the buy support from organic growth

[22-Jun-19 11:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Otherwise we will just fall down again

[22-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
But puts it on the spot for newbs coming for the Bitcoin during the Bitcoin hype

[22-Jun-19 11:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The wallet mess was proof they know what the fuck they are doing

[22-Jun-19 11:21 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Imagine the opposite

[22-Jun-19 11:21 PM] Vertigo#0439
Sorta

[22-Jun-19 11:22 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Just imagine it going the other direction

[22-Jun-19 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Looks ugly, no finish yet

[22-Jun-19 11:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No interest in sight

[22-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Vertigo#0439
It was good that they saved people's funds but shouldn't have happened in the first place.

[22-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Markus#5464
probably cause it looks like bitcoin is trying to pump again

[22-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Vertigo#0439
Freaking bitcoin can just stay stable for a day or two

[22-Jun-19 11:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It was a program

[22-Jun-19 11:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
User

[22-Jun-19 11:24 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Not created by Komodo

[22-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Vertigo#0439
So Agama wasn't created by the Komodo team?

[22-Jun-19 11:25 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Did you actually read?

[22-Jun-19 11:25 PM] Vertigo#0439
No

[22-Jun-19 11:25 PM] Markus#5464
There was a library or so that the agama wallet was using that had a bug or so

[22-Jun-19 11:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Let me think for 1 minute

[22-Jun-19 11:26 PM] Vertigo#0439
Oh well shut maybe shouldn't use 3rd party libraries lol.

[22-Jun-19 11:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It was part of the system build

[22-Jun-19 11:27 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Started with S

[22-Jun-19 11:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Vertigo everyone uses 3rd party libraries

Plot to steal cryptocurrency foiled by the npm security team
Yesterday, the npm, Inc. security team, in collaboration with Komodo, helped protect over $13 million USD in cryptocurrency assets as we found and responded to a malware threat targeting the users of...

It was a desktop notifications module

[22-Jun-19 11:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It was fine

[22-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Vertigo#0439
Well we can argue why did the chicken crossed the road all day  but what I said is it was not good.

[22-Jun-19 11:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Until the hacker changed the code in the repo

[22-Jun-19 11:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And did a version change on the easydex gui repo

[22-Jun-19 11:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The pull request was accepted

[22-Jun-19 11:30 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
N ....fuck....it started with a N not a S

[22-Jun-19 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But it was sneaky

[22-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Vertigo#0439
I had to move all my KMD from wallet to exchange fast. Do you know how many times I had to check the address before I clicked send?

[22-Jun-19 11:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The hacker had done changes to help with some gui bugs before

[22-Jun-19 11:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Why dont you have a ledger @Vertigo

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no reason at all not to spend $100 to secure many thousands

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] Vertigo#0439
Because I have and old offline laptop I used for my wallets lol

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So it was accepted and unless the team suspected something it was completely transparent

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Claiming can be done from the ledger without a fee

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The hack was over 3 weeks old....not sure if they even knew

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Offline wouldnt have sent the seed?

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It was npm who noticed the code change in the module's repo

[22-Jun-19 11:32 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Wasnt it 3 weeks old?

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Markus#5464
question is how come hacker didnt take funds

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Markus#5464
and waited 3 weeks

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He was harvesting seeds

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Waiting for more people to log in

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Markus#5464
ah ok

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Monitoring bigger balances

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Markus#5464
shit

[22-Jun-19 11:33 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm guessing it was just blind dumb

[22-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Markus#5464
but if JL managed to take around 13 mil in funds was the hacker not able to do so aswell?

[22-Jun-19 11:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
90 million or 9 million ?

[22-Jun-19 11:34 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
A shit pile of money wasnt stolen

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The hacker managed to keep about 1million kmd

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
700k

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Thank you Supernet

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, 700k

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The hacker needed to steal enough to not trigger people wanting to rollback the chain

[22-Jun-19 11:35 PM] Markus#5464
ow shit

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So it is a smart hacker

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
As soon as he noticed that npm banned his module's repo he started moving funds

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But james and the team were quick to hack his server and managed to get the keys before he moved them

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Did he get one dollar?

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Or she

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He got 700k kmd

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Import secure.random()#8925
some of us missed out on the refund process too after deleting HD suspecting malware only to find out went on.   Bad for the ecosystem.

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] Vertigo#0439
Or it

[22-Jun-19 11:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I know a hacker bitch

[22-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Vertigo#0439
So he is a millionaire now?

[22-Jun-19 11:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Oh

[22-Jun-19 11:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah 700k = over 1m

[22-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Markus#5464
oh wow they hacked hackers server....pretty clever

[22-Jun-19 11:37 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
