i cant decide if I just sell my whole stack now and buy back way cheaper later bc of this security issue

[05-Jun-19 02:17 AM] Tek#5253
or if I just buy now cause everyone is fearful

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
I wasn't going to touch my holding stack

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
for years

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064
judging by that cliff it seems someone(s) already sold their stack(s)

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
It was supposed to be fine and safe

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
@Sdunbar heh just wait till everyone hears about the issue

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
a lot of people have their coins stuck cause outdated wallets

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah true it probably is known very few so far

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] Tek#5253
it takes 200 confirmations before deposit on binance is "confirmed"

[05-Jun-19 02:19 AM] Tek#5253
some big holders might not like this and just dump instead

[05-Jun-19 02:19 AM] Tek#5253
I really can't sell my holding stack for satoshi profit right now

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] p.#1126
So much for daily close lmao

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
this too shall pass

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] p.#1126
This

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
everyone knows javascript is coding nightmare fuel and many in the know will not be shocked or terribly surprised at this.

[05-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Tek#5253
ah yes

[05-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Tek#5253
javascript

[05-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Tek#5253
never liked it

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
This is still minor compared to when KMD was hacked three times a few months after release. It recovered just fine.

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Tek#5253
uh

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Tek#5253
what about > muh great tech

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Tek#5253
this really isn't stuff I like to hear

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Do you guys remember the big red dildo when kmd just launched genesis

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
And got hacked

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Tek#5253
no,

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Tek#5253
i only started buying kmd in 2018

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Tek#5253
wtf I thought kmd was safu?

[05-Jun-19 02:33 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
From what I remember, the hacks happened because of some DEX beta code in the wallet.

[05-Jun-19 02:33 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Everyone warned me against KMD just because of this wallet. Theyâ€™re gonna rub this in my face for sure. And yes this will kill investor confidence, if the wallet canâ€™t be secured properly how can anything else be safe to use. I hope we recover from this quickly

[05-Jun-19 02:35 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
It's been more than fixed now. This kind of reminds me of the seed gen of some other coin wallets using only 32bit instead of 64bit. Making it easier to guess a seed. Not sure until they release what it is.

[05-Jun-19 02:36 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Just another day in cryptoland...

[05-Jun-19 02:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
today was a good day... for awhile

[05-Jun-19 02:41 AM] Vertigo#0439
I sold half as soon as I saw the Oh shit notice

[05-Jun-19 02:42 AM] Vertigo#0439
Now I'm not sure about the other half... Don't worry I'm poor I didn't even made a tiny blip in the order book

[05-Jun-19 02:43 AM] p.#1126
If this was a big issue we would have dropped more

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] p.#1126
Rebrand onna bitch

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i sold all that was on exchange as soon as i saw, before it tanked thankfully

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] Tek#5253
@ResoluteCrypto someone unirronically called the agama wallet shit a few days ago when I was shillin kmd

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
now just waiting on confirms

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] Vertigo#0439
I don't think many people knows about it ... Let's keep it that way

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] ryman112#0068
No matter what this is a big punch in the balls while in the midst of a rebrand and how secure kmd is etc.  This is a huge blemish that we did not need.  So now no matter what marketing does people will point to this and discredit everything.  Smh

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Price will drop more as news spreads Iâ€™m sure

[05-Jun-19 02:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i just hope my kmd confirms to binance before any whales

[05-Jun-19 02:45 AM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog same

[05-Jun-19 02:45 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
@Tek yea itâ€™s a very complicated and bulky wallet unfortunately. Steered a lot of my buddies away from investing

[05-Jun-19 02:45 AM] Vertigo#0439
Rule #1 of the KMD club we don't talk about Agama lite fail.

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Tek#5253
i don't think its complcated it looks good too, but others find it shitty

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and to think i liked agama

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and claiming my 5% with it

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Tek#5253
I almost lost my funds because I wanted to claim my 5%

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Tek#5253
the absolute state

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh crap I forgot about that .... Rewards

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Vertigo#0439
Damn it

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Tek#5253
Binance is gonna collect a lot more rewards now

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its great for a coin to get most of its supply off of exchanges.  when all the coins are on exchange, no one holds for long

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD had acheived that, now its all ruined

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog howmuch confs you got

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
if a ton of people got hacked lets get hysterical

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Tek#5253
im at 37/120

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] Tek#5253
for FUCKING HELL SAKE

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
if not then the team is exercising a preponderance of caution

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
for all we know someone is just trying to get cheap kmd

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
everyone is like: please remain calm until my coins confirm on binance ðŸ˜„

[05-Jun-19 02:49 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902

[05-Jun-19 02:51 AM] Vertigo#0439
Probably Roger Flashing that

[05-Jun-19 02:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
remember when Roger put the 10k btc buywall on polo for BCH at like .5 btc each?

[05-Jun-19 02:53 AM] Tek#5253
no.. never traded on polo

[05-Jun-19 02:53 AM] Tek#5253
: )

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
well its been 2.5 years since polo didnt suck

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
polo never sucked?

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it has sucked since 2017

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was great before that

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Tek#5253
holy moly

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] Tek#5253
I think he actually wants to buy

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Tek#5253
6k butts worth

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Tek#5253
of BCH

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ya

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Tek#5253
if KMD confirms I might just drop it for a while to ride the 7k bch push

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Tek#5253
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Tek#5253
km price not really that affected

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Tek#5253
the dump could have happened without the secrity issue news too

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's not that big a deal

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
im guessing the dump was probably because of the security alert

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
timing was right after

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Tek#5253
it has to be

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Tek#5253
if its not that big of a deal

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Tek#5253
then why aren't we given any information

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Tek#5253
they could have just said " yeah seed generation code wasn't that random"

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe some stop losses got triggered too
