or as hedge funds and institutional money starts to flood into certain high cap coins, it would behoove those entities to try and throw salt on smaller projects to ensure the success of their investments

[21-Oct-18 03:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
@snowdamn the short answer is because control freaks are just that.  They neeeeeed to control things.  That is why you see KYC popping up everywhere.  This is going to push more money into DEX's and allow users to really obfuscate their coin trails.  People will use them to trade into privacy coins and then do whatever with those.  It is going to freak them out that they cant control dex's as they see lots of money move into them and away from CEX's

[21-Oct-18 03:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
governments are not logical.

[21-Oct-18 03:33 PM] zatJUM#9924
@hastrup if you find nobody I can do it with usual fees (1% both side)

[21-Oct-18 03:33 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, they are control freaks, but you're giving them less credit than they deserve
the places you see KYC popping up on are not accidental

[21-Oct-18 03:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
governments historically have spent millions of dollars chasing down hundreds.  they do it all the time.  massive, month long investigations involving dozens of federales to track down some chump who committed $1000 of fraud.

[21-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and where is someone doing an atomic swap from if their node is in a different country?

[21-Oct-18 03:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats kind of assuming a lot.  that it becomes a successful project

[21-Oct-18 03:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
same, i buy your house with ARRR, they got me

[21-Oct-18 03:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
governments cooperate all the time, especially when the US bullies these other countries into compliance

[21-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so russia will cooperate with ussa?

[21-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
or some china friendly country?

[21-Oct-18 03:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
quite possibly, if it benefits both of their interests

[21-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
well then we are all doomed, lets just send in all our privkeys to the govt

crypto is kind of anti establishment.  so it shouldnt be a stretch of the imagination to think the establishment will cooperate with other establishment to battle crypto

[21-Oct-18 03:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
not saying that.  just pointing out it miiiight be beneficial to have a legal team get ahead of these issues.

[21-Oct-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we do have legal counsel

[21-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there are no laws that come close to being laws against atomic swaps

[21-Oct-18 03:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
right.  your language just sort of implied that they hadn't been looking at these things yet

[21-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if anything, p2p trading is getting an exception

[21-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
likely because they know they cant control it

[21-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
better to say it is legal than to declare it illegal and not be able to do anything about it

[21-Oct-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and this is all a total violation of personal rights, property ownership, freedom of speech

[21-Oct-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately an atomic swap is just sending numbers

[21-Oct-18 03:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
i agree about liberties and property rights.  and i agree that its just numbers being bounced back and forth.  but if there is profit being made, the government thinks it owns that.  and it will try to get its pound of flesh and it will be happy to throw node operators into rape cages if they think for even a second that this would "help" them in any way

[21-Oct-18 03:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
anyhow, i have said my peace.  sounds like it not something of concern for the team/project.

[21-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
I will make sure to stay far away from USSA, sounds like they are getting very desperate and dont care about rights of people at all

[21-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
I am able to post code to github?

[21-Oct-18 03:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
been that way for a long time

[21-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
or is that illegal in USSA now?

[21-Oct-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
what if someone in USSA downloads from my github repo, am I liable?

[21-Oct-18 03:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
you are speaking to me as if i have some say or influence in the insane workings of government

[21-Oct-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if so  i need to become anon ASAP!

you can make jokes all you like about the USSA (which i wont disagree with) but that doesn't really change anything we are talking about

[21-Oct-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but some people say my being anon is holding the project back

[21-Oct-18 03:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
the countries that meatspoon is referring to have created a tax obligations tracking system where it is preferable to report all earnings to begin with IMHO
you end up getting hit with less tax as opposed to when spending without having reported first IOW

[21-Oct-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
I have been anon since day 1 as I know how silly govt regs can be and how roughshod they trample over people

[21-Oct-18 03:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
oh i think it is.  you know that.  if vitalik insisted up not showing his face, being called VB7000 and whatnot, it would have slowed ETH's developemnt dramatically

[21-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I should step away

[21-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt want to hold the project back

[21-Oct-18 03:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am making a very, very simple statement.  You can take from it what you like.  If Vitalik didnt do face interviews, didnt share his background, went by an alias, etc, it would have significantly delayed the development of his project.  simple statemetn

[21-Oct-18 03:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
well I think it's much more then showing face

[21-Oct-18 03:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
are there benefits to anonymity?  of course.  i dont deny that

[21-Oct-18 03:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Blocknet dev showed his face and they are not top 10

[21-Oct-18 03:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
but there is a cost too

[21-Oct-18 03:49 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i am okay with crypto being gone if world goverments start to work with each other instead of fucking each other over lol

[21-Oct-18 03:49 PM] meatspoon#7860
if world governments start working together, believe me it will also be to the detriment of the people

[21-Oct-18 03:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if you got at least few BTC is better to be anon already - if they become worth about 1 mln $ your life or health may be in danger

[21-Oct-18 03:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
once again, i agree that there are benefits to anonymity for anyone and everyone.  for sure.  but when leading a project, it comes with some significant costs too.

[21-Oct-18 03:51 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
seeing the progress I cannot agree, but I believe you come to the time where you like to short KMD and the price is not so good... well many people got the same issue, but price and project success are not exact same thing here, however corelate a bit

[21-Oct-18 03:52 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I too regret I didnt short at 12$ and rebuyt today, btu what can I do now ? üòÉ

[21-Oct-18 03:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
this discussion isn't about price for me.  the price is gonna be what its gonna be and I hope everyone is able to take profit at some point.  This started as more of a question about having legal ducks in a row on BarterDex and what the legal ramifications might be if barterdex actually grows into something important and people start "selling" unregistered securities on it.  KMD is linked to BarterDex.  The repercussions might touch KMD

[21-Oct-18 03:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
no one has to worry about the feds being interested in BDex if it continues to have near-zero volume

[21-Oct-18 03:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
real world comes with KYC
it doesn't matter if you're spending crypto or fiat
you can protect your holdings (from everyone) up until you cross into the real world
you can't have a decent real world experience without crossing IMHO

[21-Oct-18 03:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
then JL made several facetious/joking comments, one about his anonymity, and then i responded to that

[21-Oct-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I apologize for holding the project back, but I will remain anon for the foreseeable future

there is no law regarding atomic swaps

making the case that your anonymity has helped KMD project seems nearly impossible.  Has it helped you?  definitely

[21-Oct-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
hence my apology

i am not blaming you or saying you should do anything differently

Kyc is a bullshit artifact of a corrupt system. The ultimate goal is to make kyc not just unnecessary but functionally impossible

@snowdamn but it does have other implications, that is my whole point.  adoption is harder when the team is anonymous.

[21-Oct-18 04:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
adoption by whom?

[21-Oct-18 04:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
uh, the world, bro

[21-Oct-18 04:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
as opposed to which projects?

[21-Oct-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
team is by and large NOT anon

[21-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
I am anon,but a lot of the others are not

[21-Oct-18 04:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
Kyc isn‚Äôt gonna matter for shit once the conventional financial systems are usurped by superior tech. These legacy systems and institutions are currently just a breath away from utter collapse. They should be ignored completely.

[21-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
how do you think they went to conferences, etc

[21-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
I do admit that if I am making presentations and people knew about by background, the KMD price would be a lot higher

Not sure I agree with the slowdown in dev.... KMD continues to be a leader in actual, working tech

[21-Oct-18 04:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
so right now the EEA has like a zillion corporations that are all on board.  think they would have been able to get that much "adoption" if Vitalik were VB7000 and refused to divulge any personal info about himself?  F no.

[21-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but still, we are ahead of basically all the other projects in the tech area

[21-Oct-18 04:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
but if there is no adoption, it doesnt matter if you have alien level tech

[21-Oct-18 04:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
one project in the very birthing days of crypto is not much to go by IMHO

[21-Oct-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you read the article about bitcoin 20yrs from now you will understand that we are not really even begun and what matters is tech

[21-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
adoption will take years, maybe decades

[21-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and in the end, my being anon or not wont affect it much at all

[21-Oct-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it does affect things when substance counts less than, well, whatever counts nowadays, perception, hype, etc

read that, it is pretty deep and well thought out

[21-Oct-18 04:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
that is your opinion, jl.  my opinion is different.  I dont say that I know anything, but I suspect your anonymity has held the project back quite a bit.  I have read lots of opinions and talked to lots of people that are very put off by it.  This is natural human behavior.  If humans cant see the face of another human, or cant see their pupils, distrust is natural whether we like it or not

[21-Oct-18 04:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
and i will stress again, adoption is what matters, not tech.  the craziest tech in the world isnt worth anything if people don't actually use it

[21-Oct-18 04:09 PM] bishop#9773
@meatspoon why can't KMD be a BTC-like situation? The founder is anon and later on, more devs with public identities took over (not saying I want JL to leave)

[21-Oct-18 04:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'll accept meatspoon's point as it relates to the possibility of having had a higher influx of devs
but i reject any suggestion that it's game over

[21-Oct-18 04:09 PM] bishop#9773
seems like BTC has done quite well absent the core/bch stuff

[21-Oct-18 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
with the ICO mania, there were no devs that we would have gotten anymore than we did. in any case my role is to code and not to be doing presentations
