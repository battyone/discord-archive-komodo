[31-Jul-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the resistance was that on the way up, if it can hold that... everything is fine. I'm serious its an actual fib line or whatever.

[31-Jul-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
38M?

[31-Jul-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats too much lol

tbh havent looked at any charts or anything in a long long time

[31-Jul-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think its 5-6M

[31-Jul-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but when I saw a youtube vid saying the 7777 level was critical.. I thaught id keep an eye on it today. Seems mor imporant that usual.

Why do so many people loose their shit when BTC "drops" to 2x rational üòï

[31-Jul-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because a 5k BTC means a sub $1 KMD and running a Notary Node gets hard

[31-Jul-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can't speak for anyone elses reasons

[31-Jul-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or folks could stop pegging KMD to BTC for value and accept that as a tech BTC sux ass....

[31-Jul-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
When you base your value on unstable and irrational, your value will be unstable and irrational

[31-Jul-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC is shit.... but the market is the market

[31-Jul-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You of all people know how stupid and irrational most people are.

indeed... I also think we are in the "first blowoff' phase of the bubble though

[31-Jul-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC should make 50k

[31-Jul-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure when though....

[31-Jul-18 01:43 PM] snowdamn#2414

Things are certainly desperate now

[31-Jul-18 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it hard to think the next lot of new money will come from the public

[31-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Go by the hollow gut index

[31-Jul-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
at some point, in order to set space value, the space must "break apart" and create value
Do one check their Apple stock and think, "OMFG, RJ Reynolds stock is down, so my Apple stocks has lost value"?

[31-Jul-18 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No....

[31-Jul-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thing is.... there must be either miners mining it for almost free.... or everyone mining it believes it will go up again lots. Because hash rate keeps rising

[31-Jul-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
was that wall pulled or dit it get dumped into?

[31-Jul-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
misse dit

[31-Jul-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hashrate != price atm

[31-Jul-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
summer 2016 - BTC = $760
summer 2018 - BTC = $7600
and the tech advance is akin to if apple did nothing for 2 years other than create a new wall charger for the iPhone 2

`hashrate != price atm`
actually it does, invested hash is the *only* thing keeping BTC in this insane godlike state

[31-Jul-18 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So they are using Tethers to pump it back to profitable every time it falls under $X ?

[31-Jul-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats totally possible IMO.... Chinese ppl are masters of scams :trollface:

[31-Jul-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and ffs, at any point will sheeple ever see this anti-China veil as what it really is: 'Muricans upset because **they** aren't in control?

[31-Jul-18 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was a joke

[31-Jul-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I am far more concerned about Israel designing all the hardware backdoors in every single Intel CPU built in the last 10 years.

[31-Jul-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
AMD seems to have followed that lead, but not sure where the backdoor was designed there.

[31-Jul-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, when Utah becomes an independent, recognized Mormon nation, then we can discuss my opinions on the Middle East :trollface:

[31-Jul-18 02:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
@blackjok3r  is there anything one can do about that?

[31-Jul-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@snowdamn yes, you can build a chip company in Switzerland

[31-Jul-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[31-Jul-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Kind of impractical... I managed to build my KMD notary node with the last AMD chips without the backdoor in them

[31-Jul-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it can just keep up

[31-Jul-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I had to do a shit tonne of software optimisations

Bulldozer an up has it, and on intel side its core2 and up, but core2 can have it disabled.

[31-Jul-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are ppl working on it... but they figured out how to do it too early on.... so intel improved the design so It litterally cannot function when the ME is turned off now.
