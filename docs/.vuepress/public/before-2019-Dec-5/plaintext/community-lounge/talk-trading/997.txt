i need to explore the paradigm of mm1 vs mm2

[01-Aug-19 08:44 PM] dan.#2473
i used to blast bobs as fast as i could with a range of predefined utxo and work down the utxo sizes

[01-Aug-19 08:44 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx for turning them on mate

[01-Aug-19 08:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
There is stopping volume

[01-Aug-19 08:45 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Pump time

[01-Aug-19 08:47 PM] allbits#5898
No utxos required anymore. It feels much more like a CEX, although still within a maker/taker paradigm - so very much like actual exchange clearing services on wall street

[01-Aug-19 08:51 PM] dan.#2473
thats good... although i looked at the utxo constraint as a competitive advantage before

Dont wory down again

Cheap prices = great opportunity to invest, not to mention the 5% gains.

[01-Aug-19 09:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
last month KMD bounced to 16000 sats at this price, let's see what will happen this time

[01-Aug-19 09:50 PM] Caglio#3337
@joe2x4 you troll !

[01-Aug-19 09:57 PM] joe2x4#5987
@Caglio I hope you are taking your 5% gains and buying Bitcoin. Then when moon, take profits and buy more KMD for more 5% gains.

...........moment..................üòÇ 
Ok, better advice. Take that sweet sweet 5% you are getting and buy CHIPS. You WILL be able to gamble with it really soon,or even host a table and make some dat rake. Either way, gambling should make you happy.

[01-Aug-19 10:14 PM] Caglio#3337
indeed

hosting a table oO

There was this sudden excitement and prices where going up a few weeks ago...then almost all coins' prices dropped  again and prices have been stuck there for weeks. What do you think could have caused this?

[02-Aug-19 07:38 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok maybe

[02-Aug-19 08:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
More probable is that it double bottomed here

[02-Aug-19 08:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

If btc will keep going we will have a new all time low pretty quick

[02-Aug-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464

[02-Aug-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
Cause there is 0 buy pressure on kmd lately

[02-Aug-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
and whenever there is ppl are rdy to push it back down

[02-Aug-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Agreed now

[02-Aug-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
But if 900 falls, ouch

[02-Aug-19 10:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
We could be seeing 600

[02-Aug-19 11:01 AM] nocturnal#2177

Well that a theory mate , I like it

[02-Aug-19 11:23 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Doesn't make sense though for me as I believe Bitcoin and many sideprojects themselfs being government/military offsprings

[02-Aug-19 11:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

Does Binance KMD staking automatically happen by holding it on Binance, or is there something you need to do to qualify?

[02-Aug-19 12:09 PM] p.#1126
Lose 15% of value is what you do to qualify

troll_king (2) 

[02-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
great, thats means we all qualify

[02-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
because we have all been rekt for at least 15%

[02-Aug-19 12:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[02-Aug-19 12:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
yeah whole industries have been subverted by gendernazi propagandists from the arts colleges- first they hire a few, then those hire increasingly more, then they end up going all in denigrating and insulting their own custoemr base because they believe that they have a political mission

[02-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
KMD looking pretty bullish on daily

[02-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Markus#5464
if we get a bounce we could reach 16k

[02-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Markus#5464
that bounce would also break the bearish trendline

[02-Aug-19 06:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It does look like double bottomed at 930.

[02-Aug-19 06:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[02-Aug-19 07:02 PM] Markus#5464
i can smell a alt rally, not necessary a alt season but a rally like we had from 16k to 28k last time

[02-Aug-19 07:02 PM] Caglio#3337
except we go from 9 to 11 this time ?( :

[02-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Markus#5464
well like i wrote before we have potential to go to 16k and then we already broke downtrend

[02-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Markus#5464
so this might be bottom
