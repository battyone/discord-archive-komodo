who else thinks this bear market is almost over?

[30-Jun-18 02:29 PM] jorian#4555
for alts?

[30-Jun-18 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd be depressed, too, if I bought on the bubble :troll:

[30-Jun-18 02:29 PM] jorian#4555
hehe

[30-Jun-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
As for over, I'll be feked if I have any clue; just when I think we're going one way we go the other (BTC to 6400 again üòñ )

[30-Jun-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I do know that I'm sick of dropping 25% vs pseudo USD every 2 weeks üò£

[30-Jun-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Do you know any other exchange with leverage and shorting except BitMex?

[30-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <olsas> Have we seen bottom of bear market or will it go lower?

[30-Jun-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

-$14, people will start paying others just to take their BTC away from them

more depression, then when you're really really poor with zero crypto at all.... moon.

_truly believes that binance moved a volume of 67,708.01 BTC worth of a 3 cent coin üôÑ_

[30-Jun-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I guess it *is* possible that 15,804,700,000 Selfkey (7.8x the entire "Circulating Supply") moved in one day ü§î

only BTC/fiat pairs should impact BTC price, otherwise prone to manipulation, I hope some better service will come to replace this one for avg price calculations

Binance lying?

[30-Jun-18 09:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
B..but my fundazu

Uh.. are they safu?

If it buys me more miners, binance can fake 4000000x supply for all I care üòõ

How long do you think equihash mining will remain profitable?

Until Fundza r not safu

"How long do you think equihash mining will remain profitable?"
That depends on the scale at which one mines, as well as which "equihash" one looks at and what the ASIC makers choose to put  out and/or invest in

[30-Jun-18 10:40 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
they are safe @Hollowman9000 for now

[01-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Limited run of ASICs

[01-Jul-18 04:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Nope

[01-Jul-18 04:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they pushed back all asic decisions until April 2019 per a community vote by elected trusted community members

[01-Jul-18 04:49 AM] BlackJesus#6161
But they are changing algorithms to be more thermodynamically friendly for all miners including asics.

Has Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Resurfaced?
Is it another case of surreptitious Satoshi Nakamoto fan-fiction, or the actual Bitcoin creator? That's the question the cryptoverse is once again mulling over after a website registration, a cryptogram, and an excerpt from a "literary work" have materialized from someone pur...

so what the TA wizards say? Will BTC start to rally from here or is it a trap?

I'm hard-pressed to find a TA that isn't emotionally influenced

If they're long on BTC, then yes it's going to rally
If they don't care for BTC, then it's dedded
