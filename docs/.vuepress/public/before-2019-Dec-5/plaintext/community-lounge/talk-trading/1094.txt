As I said, firstclass flights coke and hookers is all fine and dandy if you are raking in milions of revenue every day and everyone is happy, but in the current situation, it's just retarded to share shit like this

who remembers when there were such huge sales with one order?

[27-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dan.#2473
whoever dumped at 8k sats could be doing those walls. Clear the books down and then straddle the bid and asks right at 8k

[27-Aug-19 03:04 PM] dan.#2473
means 1) They want to make money and 2) they want their kmd back

the fact that someone gave up 40+ btc for kmd is pretty bullish imo

here's some dash news https://dashnews.org/dash-integrated-into-venezuelan-pharmacy-chain-farmarket-with-22-locations/

[27-Aug-19 04:47 PM] PTYX#6840
Yup, soon dash will also be added to the pundix device. It will be some competition for the xpay by panda exchange

[27-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@cascrypto I dont cry over anything, I just say it is bad form

[27-Aug-19 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I also still hope they pull things off, but given the scrutiny they are under they shouldnt be posting first class flights

[27-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Tek#5253

[27-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Tek#5253

[27-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362

how does kmd compare to fantom?

[27-Aug-19 07:47 PM] Tek#5253
Nothing compares to fantom in crypto currently.

Each dapp a bespoke mainnet net, each requiring FTM to secure and to pay tx fees.

Modular tech stacks at the base of which lays lachesis consensus. Meaning different blockchains can plug their VMs on top and develop dApps.with their own SDKs. Fantom also releasing their own FastVM.

Fully interoperable. Meaning a dapp developped on cosmos use lachesis to pull data from the ethereum chain. Creating the internet of blockchain.

New platform funding concept called ITO which are SEC compliant. These ITO are made to raise funds for decentralized organizations called Workchains. This is released by the guy who invented ICOs. He chose fantom as the platform for this.

Cross chain asset custody. Basically, you'll be able to send BTC under 1 second since FTM transaction can be custodian of.other blockchain assets (securely holding private keys and letting the receiver decrypt the key).

Fantom is working with many social media platforms and online banks in Asia on fantom based payment solutions plus their own called fantom pay.

They have also launched a white label stable coin issuance solution called Statheros which is already being adopted by a company.

Fantom will melt faces and reatrds who still dont get it will commit sudoku.

[27-Aug-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
^ fantom shill I found today

[27-Aug-19 07:48 PM] Tek#5253
I must be honest I bought because the Fantom logo has sacred geometry properties

[27-Aug-19 07:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It looks like another name for ETH then but based on DAG?

[27-Aug-19 07:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
requiring FTM fees to do everything

[27-Aug-19 08:02 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The last time I used DAG based project was IOTA, rumour has it that it is still trying to tangle even now ðŸ˜„

[27-Aug-19 08:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol coordicide they called it

[27-Aug-19 08:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Looks like a scam to me

[27-Aug-19 08:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just throw a bunch of buzzwords to bamboozle  people

[27-Aug-19 08:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It looks like a 'pumping' pamphlet to fool a lot of noobs

[27-Aug-19 08:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and it's working a few days now , was looking at the chart

[27-Aug-19 08:06 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
at least since yesterday 26th august

[27-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Tek#5253
doubt its a scam

[27-Aug-19 08:07 PM] Tek#5253
DAG tech is a nice adition to my digital asset portfolio

[27-Aug-19 08:10 PM] Tek#5253
@Gordon Komodo > requireing FTM fees to do everything

[27-Aug-19 08:10 PM] Tek#5253
yeah well uh, thats how you make sure the asset is needed

If you launch your own coin on FTM and still need to use FTM to send your own coin , hm.. then why launch your own coin?

[27-Aug-19 08:18 PM] Tek#5253
exactly, I hope no one makes shitcoins on FTM

[27-Aug-19 08:19 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I would rather launch my coin on ANTARA where I don't need KMD to send my coin, just use my own coin for TX fees

[27-Aug-19 08:19 PM] Tek#5253
I rather not everyone starts making its own shitcoin

[27-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The problem with everybody working on one coin example is BTC

[27-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it takes million of years to reach consensus on what to achieve ðŸ˜„

[27-Aug-19 08:21 PM] Tek#5253
Dash reaches consensus fast tho

[27-Aug-19 08:22 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
why can't a guy just launch his coin and do everything he thinks is the future

[27-Aug-19 08:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if a bunch of DASH masternode holders don't like your idea, but you believe that your idea will work, will you just give it up and work at Mcdonald? (Working at Mcdonald is cool btw, get free burger i heard)

[27-Aug-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
then you just fund your idea yourself

[27-Aug-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
instead of getting funds from the DAO for free

[27-Aug-19 08:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And if that idea requires hard fork changes?

[27-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Tek#5253
directly going to the extreme here are we

[27-Aug-19 08:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[27-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Tek#5253
you already know the answer

[27-Aug-19 08:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We hardfork once a year minimum

[27-Aug-19 08:26 PM] Tek#5253
if consensus is reached

[27-Aug-19 08:26 PM] Tek#5253
you hardfork

[27-Aug-19 08:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You see the problem donâ€™t you?   You have no external option if you have an idea contrary the herd.

[27-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Tek#5253
also, kmd asset chains aren't kmd

[27-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Tek#5253
you can't just make changes to the main chain either

[27-Aug-19 08:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Exactly.  Dash has no options beside the mainchain.

[27-Aug-19 08:29 PM] Tek#5253
yeah well dash isn't a build your own shitcoin platfor

[27-Aug-19 08:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In kmd you can spin your own

[27-Aug-19 08:30 PM] Tek#5253
i heard smart contracts are coming tho so , maybe soon

[27-Aug-19 08:30 PM] Tek#5253
well yeah great but no one needs to hold kmd

[27-Aug-19 08:30 PM] Tek#5253
so why exactly would I invest in it

[27-Aug-19 08:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
DPoW for one.

[27-Aug-19 08:31 PM] Tek#5253
projects that are worth it wont need DPow

[27-Aug-19 08:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol didnâ€™t ETC get 51% earlier this year,  top 20 coin might have been higher back then

[27-Aug-19 08:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Wouldnâ€™t have happened with DPoW

[27-Aug-19 08:33 PM] Tek#5253
it wouldn't have happened if it had a different algorithm than ETH.

[27-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
dPOW empowers a few dude in the garage that want to launch their coin , isn't that enough?

[27-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253
that's cool and all but lets just admit the few dudes in their garage are just building a scam / useles token

[27-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[27-Aug-19 08:35 PM] Tek#5253
times have changed tho. there was a small window of oportunity where being the few dudes in a garage was a way to launch a sucesful global digital asset

[27-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
google started by two dudes

[27-Aug-19 08:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Apple as well

[27-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Tek#5253
completely different ballgame and time

[27-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Tek#5253
so what are some good reasons to buy/hold KMD if you do not want to launch your own shitcoin

[27-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Tek#5253
to pay dpow

[27-Aug-19 08:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Module usage , better Dex rates
