BTC going down? Wasn't it just going straight to 20k?

it's a tricky zone, what's nice is it's decoupled from equities, for now, otherwise we'd be in the shit - maybe digital gold is here at last

2 days ago KMD stay near 105-110 in this chart,  today  50-60  .  Looks not bad.   Buy support                https://coinmarketbook.cc/

I honestly think that the bear market was caused by BItcoin SV

[22-Dec-18 02:44 AM] Vertigo#0439
I don't know about that but they sure showed how much power greed  and centralization they have.

[22-Dec-18 02:44 AM] Vertigo#0439
Too bad they have deep pockets to manipulate on their favor.

[22-Dec-18 02:45 AM] Vertigo#0439
They can pump and dump their own coin easy.

[22-Dec-18 03:10 AM] bishop#9773
sure, it didn't help, but bear markets are 20% declines from the highs so naturally the bear market started long before that drama

miner farms have taken over the coin... governance is a joke

[22-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Lumbi#8378
PoS is way better as long as it's a non-shitcoin like xrp

[22-Dec-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
144 * 12.5 = 1800 BTC per day from miners
daily trading volume: 1600000 BTC per day
circulating coins 17 million (maybe as little at 12 million)

if 1800/1.6 million or 1800/12 million is a takeover, then yes miners have taken over BTC
most other PoW coins will have similar percentages
miners are subject to hardfork attack, ie. XMR, SIA, etc

PoS is all about the initial distribution, which can be highly concentrated or just concentrated
PoW isnt better than PoS, PoS isnt better than PoW, it all depends on the details

the general assumption is that PoW is decentralized by default... but as the hashpower centralizes, the coin centralizes.

[22-Dec-18 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but as the hashpower centralizes, the coin centralizes`
That's only true if you accept the bizarre belief that only miners are nodes

[22-Dec-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Of note: that concept means that KMD is centralized

$KMD

Aside from being one of the strongest projects fundamentally, with a major catalyst ahead, the chart is a work of art imo. 

One of the few alts on the market with on balance volume (green) trending up for the whole year.

@actionslacks and what would the cause for removal be?

[22-Dec-18 10:24 PM] bishop#9773
removal because you disagree with policy isn't grounds for removal

[22-Dec-18 10:24 PM] bishop#9773
further, he's one of multiple voting members

[22-Dec-18 10:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Idk, I’m just saying it’s possible. And it would be glorius :trollface:

[22-Dec-18 10:27 PM] bishop#9773
Don't get me wrong, I have my own views on the fed and policy but I don't see any realistic probability this happens and should it, it will be political nightmare as it voids the "independence" of the fed (although that's another discussion altogether)

[22-Dec-18 10:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
Well if nothing else its opening a lot of eyes to the feds “independence”

[22-Dec-18 10:32 PM] bishop#9773
Policy error already has happened... hard to imagine unemployment going lower than levels it's currently at and they haven't generated sufficient inflation by the very metric they gauge inflation by.

[22-Dec-18 10:33 PM] bishop#9773
You have markets goosed because of QE, the exact opposite should occur with QT

[22-Dec-18 10:34 PM] bishop#9773
and rates are still relatively low by historical standards so the likelihood of being able to do something meaningful during the next recession is scary in itself. Every subsequent round of QE has less and less of an effect

[22-Dec-18 10:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
Employment numbers are bs anyway.  inflation numbers arent based on the price of what people actually need to live. The coming crash was baked into the cake long ago. The fed was out of bullets long ago

[22-Dec-18 10:39 PM] bishop#9773
I agree, I'm simply saying they are using U4 and PCE and U4 isn't going to go much lower and PCE hasn't been consistently above 2%

[22-Dec-18 10:40 PM] bishop#9773
if that's your dual mandate, you aren't achieving it

[22-Dec-18 10:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
Ignoring housing costs and food prices when calculating inflation is deceiving. Real inflation has been well over 2% for decades now.

[22-Dec-18 10:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
The feds only purpose is to gut the ussa. They have largely succeeded.

[22-Dec-18 10:55 PM] bishop#9773
`Ignoring housing costs and food prices when calculating inflation is deceiving. Real inflation has been well over 2% for decades now` duh, that's not the point though in which metric they use

[22-Dec-18 11:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
I’m not arguing the point, just pointing out the absurdity of the whole endeavor. CPI, PCE, etc. It’s all just lipstick on the communist pig that is central banking.

"KMD could go PoS/PoW verus and thereby put a dent in the coal smog in china"

Meh...  If you're talking environment, Merge mining is an overall better answer.  Keeps benefits of PoW and doesn't require any additional hashpower that doesn't already exist mining for other chains.

[23-Dec-18 02:49 PM] 🛡bstr156#5540
Also can provide incredible resistance to 51% attack.
