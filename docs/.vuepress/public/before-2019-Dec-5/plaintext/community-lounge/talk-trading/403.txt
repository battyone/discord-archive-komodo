That's not suprising, tbh.  Relative to ther coins, KMD has not had that much trading volume for awhile now.  Suprised they even added that market.  But maybe they know something most people don't

[07-Feb-19 09:37 PM] Alecandro#1179
perhaps. perhaps

[07-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Markus#5464

no one wants folks knowing their 🐔 but, imo, a thriving USD-KMD will do wonders for being able to remove the BTC stone from around our necks whilst trying to swim in the chummed up shark infested waters

the BTC stone lol.......think it is the other way around

[08-Feb-19 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, because I remember the time when when USD dropped to 16.84% of its former value and drug KMD from a pseudo $10 to a pseudo $0.56 🙄

Meth, ayahuasca

[08-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Caglio#3337
I miss a tooth tho, but it has nothing to do with drugs

[08-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Caglio#3337
However there are some toothless people here

[08-Feb-19 01:03 PM] Caglio#3337
That is a good idea emmanuel, but I need to wait summer for that

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Caglio#3337
And in the summer there is no problem, too many naive tourists

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh I am afraid of visitin asian countries

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Caglio#3337
they have strict laws about drugs

[08-Feb-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`stay there some months working at a restaurant`

I dont know really, all I do is live near sea

[08-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
And they come with their cruisers, and their money, and they want you to shag them, but you rarely do that, you can just let them perform a fellatio on you

[08-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Caglio#3337
They also pay you for booze and drugs, and ofc, those drugs they are paying to me, are mine already, and they overpaying for them, bahahaha, cant wait summer ( :

[08-Feb-19 01:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
hes basically just bought up all the sells again. Similar level 18400

[08-Feb-19 01:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Missed a good flip there tbh, I have sell set at 18885 would have been a nice little trade buying in again

[08-Feb-19 03:28 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
Has anyone experienced a issue on some exchanges where you select a offer and it tends to double the offer by 2X and when you withdraw it claims that it has to equal to 1 when you want to withdraw more than 1?

[08-Feb-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I haven't had that, but I tend to use mostly APIs

[08-Feb-19 03:29 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
I am currently experiencing it on a exchange outside of KMD

[08-Feb-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what exchange?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 this is on a little off end just because Komodo is not on this exchange but trade satoshi just wanting to trade strat to Bitcoin and using bitcoin to buy BRO

[08-Feb-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tradesatoshi is only marginally better than not having anything, imo, if it's that good 😛

[08-Feb-19 03:42 PM] WBIM-Devil#0734
yeah but i only have 0.2 strat but the exchange keeps thinking that i have 32 strat or 140 strat when i select a offer that's more than 1000 satoshi and is like 0.1 strat @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[08-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder

[08-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
marketbuying probably triggers some conditional sell orders

[08-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so marketbuying then dumping on a thin orderbook might make sense

[08-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as more conditional sells appear when you buy up a thin orderbook

[08-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and thus are able to dump more at higher prices?

[08-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
