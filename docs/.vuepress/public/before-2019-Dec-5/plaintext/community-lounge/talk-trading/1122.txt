[07-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Bittersweet#9376

[07-Sep-19 04:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Probably best to ignore this energy vampire

[07-Sep-19 04:08 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Doesn't take much energy to deal with him

[07-Sep-19 04:09 PM] Tek#5253
it does for debilman2, he gets angry. probably because he's a kid : )

[07-Sep-19 04:09 PM] Bittersweet#9376
At least he's not a retarded kid though
