Let that sink in

[20-Jul-18 03:34 PM] tolken#2655
@siu - Chainmakers sorry dude I‚Äôm too dumb

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dont worry

[20-Jul-18 03:36 PM] tolken#2655
waiting for the cheat sheet üòõ

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Think about creating your own chain with kmd where you can deploy your own smart contracts

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] tolken#2655
no seriously I see huge potential, but it took a while for me to read a little each day to learn bdex. Feel like that side of kmd is still an enigma.

[20-Jul-18 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Today eth can only offer you to be able to make a smart contract on their chain

[20-Jul-18 03:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The tokens created in eth are a smart contract by themselves so they cant actually deploy much more from within

[20-Jul-18 03:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is why most big projects are migrating to their own chains. because they cant really grow anywhere other than being the crapy erc20 contract they are

[20-Jul-18 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What is enigma on bdex?

[20-Jul-18 03:40 PM] tolken#2655
But what you‚Äôre taking about is something I‚Äôm researching for a startup company. They want to issue shares of stock, handle dividends though it etc. at this point with my limited knowledge, I don‚Äôt know if I should just leverage an existing platform or start a new KMD asset chain. I don‚Äôt yet know what the costs are to start and maintain a kmd chain - it might be prohibitively expensive or time consuming for what we need.

[20-Jul-18 03:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Talk to chainmakers for that üòÅ

[20-Jul-18 03:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes kmd is the answer for what they want

[20-Jul-18 03:42 PM] tolken#2655
No, sorry if that wasn‚Äôt clear - I know bdex fairly well and it‚Äôs documented reasonably well - aside from trying to debug why bobs/Alice‚Äôs don‚Äôt play well together at times. The enigma was in reference to kmd assetchains, creating new ones, costs, how to do it etc. just haven‚Äôt invested time yet to learn it.

[20-Jul-18 03:43 PM] tolken#2655
Definitely,  trying to gather specs from potential client.

[20-Jul-18 03:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you know your way into linux command line and understand blockchain in general you can get this running with virtually no cost other than vps hosting

[20-Jul-18 03:57 PM] tolken#2655
that‚Äôs news to me, I thought we‚Äôd have to pay notary fees and/or mining fees üòÉ

[20-Jul-18 03:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh well, yes, you pay notary funds if you use them

[20-Jul-18 03:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not an olbigation though its necessary

[20-Jul-18 04:01 PM] tolken#2655
The other unknown to me is security. Bouncing some funds around bdex and Agama using plaintext passphrases for personal/small amounts is fine , but it still spooks me. Multisig or ledger integration would be great here though.

[20-Jul-18 04:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its on the works

[20-Jul-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if that spooks you... more spooky is to have all your coins in myetherwallet or a non encrypted wallet somewhere on the internet.

[20-Jul-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so although it may be a security hazzard its not different from mostly all of the rest of the industry

[20-Jul-18 04:14 PM] tolken#2655
oh certainly, which is why I don‚Äôt do it üòõ

[20-Jul-18 04:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but you dont have to store your passphrases in plain text

[20-Jul-18 04:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you can just use gpg and encrypt the files

[20-Jul-18 04:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well that was a lot to read

[20-Jul-18 04:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I miss all the fun

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah its been quiet here for weeks

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and when the trolls finally get here

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hollow is not here

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fucking work and bills to pay

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt want to buy miners yet because all my alts are In  The toilet

But tubesteak was right

[20-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Price got shot in the head

[20-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

380k KMD changing hands

[20-Jul-18 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
Got pulled away earlier.  I got into it with someone on Reddit a while back saying how KMD has awesome tech and will be revolutionary and how if I only fully understood the project I would know it was the Future (capital F).  Great, I want to believe that since I own some.  But as I expressed my concerns, he let it slip that he only owned $100 worth.  Hah.  Thinking back on that exchange, it doesn't mean anything to me if a grown adult tells me something is going to change the world but he only owns $100 of it (while its on sale!!).  So my question for Siu (and if you wanna get in on this, Hollow), how much KMD do you own?  You know the project in and out, you are balls deep in its tech, you have supreme faith in JLGTQ777 and the team.... how much skin do you have in the game?

500 KMD here ... and now 501 KMD since rewards kicked in ...

damn it i just made a kmd meme and couldnt post it

[20-Jul-18 06:04 PM] dan.#2473
imagine dr evil with pinky in mouth `ONE MILLION KMD`

on a serious note i have 70 percent of my crypto net into kmd

[20-Jul-18 06:06 PM] dan.#2473
contemplating more at these sat levels but havent pulled the trigger

[20-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there are a lot of whales here, they are just observing

[20-Jul-18 06:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
Fine to just observe.  I personally have never heard from anyone who claims to own more than a couple hundred bucks worth.  djithbit is the highest claim I have yet to hear.  But it seems to always be the people who own very little that are the biggest evangelists.   I know most people go through life never putting their money where there mouth is, but I would certainly have more respect for people's technical praises of KMD and their absolute belief in its success if they responded with, "I was in on the ICO, I have been dollar cost average buying for months, I mine it on my home computer and when I get my paycheck at the end of this month, I am buying another 500 KMD to get me up to my target of 100,000 KMD.  I have resisted urges to dine out and to vacation so I can pack every extra dollar into this investment that I am so passionate and sure of."  I have yet to hear that response...

[20-Jul-18 06:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I was in before the ICO when it was btcd and nxt assets.  Years.  That's my faith in this project.

[20-Jul-18 06:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
right, poly, but how deep?  thats my point, you can be in early and still have only bought a steak's dinner worth

[20-Jul-18 06:17 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I do that. I was in before the ICO, back in BTCD and nxt asset days. I swapped my BTCD to KMD as well as bought more KMD in the ICO. I'm mining at my home. Running a notary node, and investing in all the other SuperNET assets

[20-Jul-18 06:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@meatspoon Komodo is ~90% of my crypto portfolio and I'm already living off the other 10%. I've been accumulating for 4 years and plan to continue so, putting other profits into it. Enough?

[20-Jul-18 06:19 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but don't put all your eggs in one basket.

[20-Jul-18 06:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Several of my assets individually are more in kmd than your target.

[20-Jul-18 06:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
There are other projects I like but nothing that I've yet found comes close to Komodo

makes no sense to sell alts before new BTC ATH

[20-Jul-18 06:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Point is yes there are plenty of people heavily invested into the success of the project

[20-Jul-18 06:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
@KomodoWorld  Then good for you!  You will deserve the credit for how it pans out.  If KMD goes to the moon you will rightfully be a multimillionaire or maybe billionaire and it will be all you.  That will be awesome and I will praise you.  That will also mean I will turn a nice little profit, not nearly yours, but I won't deserve nearly your profit.  But if it goes the other way, you will own that too.  I am rooting for both of us.  I hope to see you on the worlds richest list (sooner than later) because it will mean I too have made a bit of scratch.

[20-Jul-18 06:22 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so you are in  straight for the money

[20-Jul-18 06:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@meatspoon there are plenty of people like @KomodoWorld @polycryptoblog myself, etc etc etc. The list goes on. Hang out around here for a few days and you'll see how many people really are dedicated to this project

I don't think to use more 1 or 2% for personal use, I have other plans for the 99%

[20-Jul-18 06:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are plenty of people so dedicated to KMD that they are starting their own companies to provide services for KMD üòÉ

my bad I didn't cash out some in december, I could have reinvested more in Kmd ecosystem. I waited too long for the Monaize dICO moonshot

[20-Jul-18 06:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
next bull I'll do

[20-Jul-18 06:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
@xRobeSx  I may poke my head around a little, but there are people like y'all in every subreddit and discord channel for every coin in the top 100, be it a decent project or a shit coin--people who are true believer whales in projects that statistically will not survive.  What I, as an investor/speculator want to see is Komodo make good on some of what it needs to improve.  I am tired of hearing about how awesome it "will" be and I want to see a wallet with a good GUI, logical text strings and have it be more exciting to look at than a pile of potatoes.  I want to see a marketing team that can convince other projects that BTC notary is needed.  Frankly I want to  see any marketing at all.  I tried to mess with Barterdex for that Beer swap and it was essentially alpha testing without any clear idea of why or to what end.  These are reasonable things to want.

[20-Jul-18 06:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
BarterDEX has come a long way since Beer Stress test, and there is HyperDEX as well now too. I'm not disagreeing with you about marketing though.

[20-Jul-18 06:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not a marketer myself, so I contribute in all the other ways I can

[20-Jul-18 06:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes the ux needs improvements and it's overall lagging behind the backend tech, this is being worked upon. But how many other projects have the same level of backend tech?

[20-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have seen some adresses of people who ive been trading with

[20-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or have seen tx ids being posted here from people

[20-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And there are a lot of people with 10-100k+ kmd and other assets here

[20-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Most people just dont want to tell it here for various reason and rightfuly so

[20-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Be rich look poor.

[20-Jul-18 06:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and marketing guys are doing the job of onboarding real businesses, rather than spending money on ads. There are already coins using the notarization and this will be used for promotion after a due period of testing

[20-Jul-18 06:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
@xRobeSx Fair enough about barterdex coming a long way, but the takeaway here, since you guys seem community oriented, is that I wanted to be a bigger part of the community but that experience was a big turn off for me.  I used to mine KMD but the negative price action combined with the Beer/BarterDEX experience made me peace out.

[20-Jul-18 06:37 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@meatspoon I'm about to head out for now, but nice talk. All feedback is clearly welcome, or I would hope people would say it. I'm glad you came back though to give KMD a shot. Stick around, you'll see more people and maybe you can talk to some of the #komodo-team team as well

[20-Jul-18 06:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've a mix an experience with BarterDex myself, I'm not a command line guy, I understand it's not simple but there's a friendly guy coming and marketmakers. Having seen all this being built since its inception, the progress is awesome even if the ux takes time

[20-Jul-18 06:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
@KomodoWorld KMD evangelists always talk about this background tech and make the claim that it is so robust.  But I am not a tech guy, so how can I refute that?  But I get the feeling that KMD fans are basically like 1)it is a smart contract platform like ETH... but BETTER!  2) It is a secure value of transfer mechanism like BTC... but BETTER!  3) It can be anonymous like Monero... but BETTER!   So its like all other top projects but better and then they just tell me I need to better understand the tech and back end.  That isn't an argument, though.  It is a deflection.

[20-Jul-18 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
We can show you how to use each one of those technologies if you like

[20-Jul-18 06:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand your points, it's probably harder to understand what is sound if you haven't a long experience in following this sector and some understanding of the tech

[20-Jul-18 06:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it seems all the same from afar

[20-Jul-18 06:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
a lot of claims but nothing that seems simple to work

[20-Jul-18 06:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not a newcommer to blockchain.  But it is hard for me to wrap my mind around lots of aspects of it.  The more obscure functionalities of ETH, for instance, make me dizzy when I try to understand them.  But I tend to get skeptical when the #63 market cap coin claims to do what coins #1 #2 and #14 do, but better... while (drum roll) also being more decentralized!

[20-Jul-18 06:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
And frankly, I am much more tech savvy than most.  I build my own computers, swap out components, I have ghosted machines and installed foreign operating systems, worked at software companies, etc.  So like 90% of the public cant possibly understand what everyone claims is so great about KMD

[20-Jul-18 06:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I get it. But I suppose you agree that marketcaps and fundamentals are still world aparts. What will matter in the end are real world use cases (i.e. not just more ICO for creating more projects with potential use cases) and mass adoption.

[20-Jul-18 06:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it will take years

[20-Jul-18 06:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Ethereum has been 2nd place for a while and yet its scaling limits are already coming to roost

[20-Jul-18 06:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Here is how it's more decentralized:  Komodo has 64 nodes that do 75% of the mining.  Pools and solo miners account for the rest.  For simplicity sake I'll just call it 100.  Compare that to the percentage of hashrate that the major pools on btc eth ltc etc.  have  and you have less than a dozen controlling 90%+ of a coin

[20-Jul-18 06:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
KMD needs a marketing team that can explain what KMD does in a way that is engaging and can be understood by the average college graduate.  Not some hodge podge of crypto catch phrases and promises based on unexplained tech.

[20-Jul-18 06:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
And ETH got there first, it is furthest ahead, it has first mover advantage in the smart contract space.  It will attract more developers, more corporations, etc.  It won't be dethroned for years.

[20-Jul-18 06:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
first mover advantage doesn't matter if at the end it can't do the job properly

[20-Jul-18 06:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
either tech doesn't matter and Verge and any shitcoin do the job equally well and in 30 years Tron is world reserve currency or sound tech is important and then Komodo (and those other projects with sound tech) will be in  a better position

[20-Jul-18 06:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
But corporations have committed to ETH.  They are now vested in that
