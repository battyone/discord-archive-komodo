WoW; iota, kmd, and waves all came from former nxt developers? And isnt XEM also from nxt developer?

[08-Jul-18 12:02 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes

[08-Jul-18 12:56 AM] Mylo#8306
any good deals around?
I was just looking at golem price (because i like that project) - and it's 5.4k sats, which is 5GNT:1KMD.
On 1 April, it was 3k sat, which was 10GNT:1KMD.  Would have been an interesting market for BarterDEX.

There must be a bunch of these coins trading well against komodo whilst KMD is at 25k sat.

[08-Jul-18 02:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

The way ethereum is used is how I see Komodo. People hold ETH as a base in lieu of BTC/BCH I see KMD as a coin like that but greater in respects to ETH.

[08-Jul-18 07:33 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But rather less known than ETH

[08-Jul-18 07:34 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Also tradingvolume is poor

[08-Jul-18 07:36 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
So.. checking tradingvolumes daily to spot an early moon

[08-Jul-18 07:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It'll get there, because DEXs have an inherent use case "trading off grid", and ours is the best. People won't go silently when the state comes for their wealth.
