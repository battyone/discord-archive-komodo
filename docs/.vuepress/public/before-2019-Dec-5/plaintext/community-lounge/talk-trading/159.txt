My retirement is gone, why did I invest so much

It's not what you invested, or even how you invested, but rather **when** you invested.

how many times are we going to retest 6k?  Ugh, and how many times will it hold?

[17-Sep-18 04:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
i will be shitting bricks if it stops holding above $6k,  i'm not gonna lie

[17-Sep-18 04:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
really?  6k has held so many times.  why would it be more surprising if it didn't brake?  Not arguing, just curious about your thoughts

[17-Sep-18 04:02 PM] snowdamn#2414
because it will mean we're heading to $2.5k

[17-Sep-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still doesn't understand how it's above 4200_

[17-Sep-18 04:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
oh, sorry, i misread your comment

[17-Sep-18 04:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
i too will begin pantaloon defecation if we break, say, 5850

[17-Sep-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@5850 I'll still be happy with my 12.7x 😎

[17-Sep-18 04:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
so you are saying you think BTC is significantly over-valued right now?

💯 

[17-Sep-18 04:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
hard to tell what is back-patting and what is opinion.  😉

[17-Sep-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is as over-valued as any other name-brand that has long since been surpassed by its competition

[17-Sep-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
mining cost getting close to $6000 for many miners

[17-Sep-18 04:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Waiting for sub 5000 with impatience 🤞

[17-Sep-18 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In mechanical terms, BTC is the "slot-head" of screws

[17-Sep-18 04:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
Haiduc, I hear a lot of people in the crypto-sphere make these sort of comments.  But I think you are underestimating the slowness of which society can wrap their head around things.  They are still choking on the idea that crypto in general is not a scam.  BTC is just beginning to gain mainstream credibility.   People who are deep down the crypto rabbit hole understand its limitations and understand that better tech now exists... tech that has not been as thoroughly tested.

[17-Sep-18 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if mining is close to 6k$ then price sould not go lower until some hackers dump or kobayashi lawyer decide to sell again :trollface:

[17-Sep-18 04:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure, but when a screw is brand new, the slot/standard screws are going to be shipped all over the world

[17-Sep-18 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or some millionair shorting for some reasons

[17-Sep-18 04:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
people didnt move on to philips or star heads on drivers for a long, long, long time

[17-Sep-18 04:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
my next question would be, why do you hold any BTC at all if you firmly believe it to be overvalued by such a large margin?

[17-Sep-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`BTC is just beginning to gain mainstream credibility.`
I agree with the point you're making there, I just weep for tech that BTC is still the 'god' that's getting pushed forward to "normal people"

[17-Sep-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats pretty dramatic.  to go back to your screw analogy, not everyone needs a laser-guided sonic screwdriver that can manufacture its own screws on the fly.  most people are fine with flat heads

[17-Sep-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
i think that for retail investors, people looking to preserve wealth, there is a much better case for BTC than any of the more complicated assets that they wouldn't understand anyway.  BTC is nice and simple

[17-Sep-18 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not everyone needs a laser-guided sonic screwdriver that can manufacture its own screws on the fly.`
The point I was getting at is those screws suck, they strip out too easy, everyone knows this, and there are 1000 better designs

[17-Sep-18 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
corporations and businesses will drive the price action of the platform coins, as they have the greatest economic incentive to understand the techs and choose the best one.  but with people, meh, they are gonna go simple.  And BTC ownership is a global possibility with just the surface being scratched.

[17-Sep-18 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure.  but in 9/10 households in america, you are gonna find a flat head screwdriver

[17-Sep-18 04:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
probably 10/10.

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
in only, say, 3 out of 10 will you find star bits or hex bits

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sure. but in 9/10 households in america, you are gonna find a flat head screwdriver`
and 2 dozen stripped screws 😉

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
McDonalds sucks too, but its everywhere and everyone eats it

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
not arguing that.  they do suck

[17-Sep-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
but they get used.  and people can wax philisophically about standard screws sucking, but that wont change that they get used.

[17-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then you also have tamper proof torx screws, and you curse the engineer who selected it

[17-Sep-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and people can wax philisophically about standard screws sucking, but that wont change that they get used.`
"standard" is a relative term ... keeping the analogy going, good luck finding a "standard" deck-screw that's a slot-head 😉

[17-Sep-18 04:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
Two nights ago I got together with some friends from university.  We are all around 40 years old.  Among this group are some wildly wealthy individuals.  The kind of wealth that will make your butthole pucker if you saw their bank statements.  Not a single one owned BTC.  Few of them even really understood it.  But they will own BTC within 5 years, and they will sort of understand it.  They will not own obscure alts, platform coins or any of that.

[17-Sep-18 04:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
but people still use nails for decks too

[17-Sep-18 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` tamper proof torx screws` are a myth that is solved by a slot-head screwdriver 😜

[17-Sep-18 04:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
let me ask you this, are you mystified by people who stack gold and silver?

[17-Sep-18 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but people still use nails for decks too`
#BTC

[17-Sep-18 04:19 PM] meatspoon#7860

[17-Sep-18 04:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
BTC is getting used.  society has kinda half figured it out, in part because it is relatively simple

[17-Sep-18 04:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
BTC will go down in history for the thing that changed Finance

[17-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or those weird triangle head screws they used to use on NES game cartridges

[17-Sep-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My point isn't that BTC shouldn't be used, it's that it shouldn't be "allowed" to stay as the "standard"
We need to drag people (kicking and screaming, if need be) into valuing tech for tech, not for "name recognition"

[17-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD or the guillotine

[17-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Choose wisely

[17-Sep-18 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[17-Sep-18 04:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
I disagree about dragging kicking and screaming people.  That kind of shows you are wearing blinders.  The market is going to choose what it chooses, and because it is young and the rest of the world isnt rooting around the bottom of the rabbit hole with us, the market is going to choose the first mover, simple concept

[17-Sep-18 04:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
and it has chosen it and will likely continue to choose it as king for a number of years

[17-Sep-18 04:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
even KMD (perhaps your favorite coin?) is reliant on BTC for a good part of its value proposition

[17-Sep-18 04:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
directly and indirectly

[17-Sep-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The market doesn't "choose" anything. That's a naive expression of how the world works, do you also still use a mimeograph?

[17-Sep-18 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
#Xerox

[17-Sep-18 04:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
what is naive is imagining that you know best what the market should do and thinking you should drag it kicking and screaming into your little area of interest

[17-Sep-18 04:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
the market does choose.  it is an aggregate of micro-economics and people making individual decisions

[17-Sep-18 04:27 PM] snowdamn#2414
BTC $30k, KMD $50 - not long-term

[17-Sep-18 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` it is an aggregate of micro-economics and people making individual decisions`
The fact that you don't seem to realize how those decisions are (and can be) altered, swayed, guided, and even forced, leads me to believe that this convo will go nowhere. 🤷

[17-Sep-18 04:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
of course decisions can be influenced

[17-Sep-18 04:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
some can be forced, yes.  but i am no statist.  so i tend to buck against use of force

[17-Sep-18 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There are, literally, people that make a living ensuring that BTC stays in the forefront and that other tech gets pushed down in the public eye. 🤦

[17-Sep-18 04:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure, people make livings giving handies too

[17-Sep-18 04:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it will happen , when someone has to choose where to build a project on, KMD will be the first choice

[17-Sep-18 04:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
branding and shilling can't trump a calculator and practical reasons, in the long term

[17-Sep-18 04:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
(assuming this tech will scale and find practical uses)

[17-Sep-18 04:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
at least BTC over $6k still buys us handies 😂

{Reactions}
🤣 

[17-Sep-18 04:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats true

[17-Sep-18 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at this point, there's nothing "practical" about BTC 😖

[17-Sep-18 04:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
the entire world, for the moment, disagrees with you

[17-Sep-18 04:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the entire world`
Hyperbole much? 🤦

[17-Sep-18 04:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
the price is what it is, Haiduc.  they disagree.  they see value

[17-Sep-18 04:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
nothing is stopping you from mortgaging your home and shorting BTC

[17-Sep-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` they see value`
Because they were told to

[17-Sep-18 04:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
BTC has bet the house on LN that I'm very doubtful about. Thanks to the self-inflicted policy of never-hard-fork it's trying to achieve less than half of what other do in the longest possible time and in the most roundabout ways

[17-Sep-18 04:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
in 10 years time we'll see

[17-Sep-18 04:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Its all up in the air, for sure.  but as a store of value, i am not sure people care if the transaction is processed in 30 seconds or 4 minutes

[17-Sep-18 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
When people realize that LN is an enterprise solution that has minimal advantages for the "average" user, Core's chickens will finally come home to roost

[17-Sep-18 04:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
either one is a heck of a lot faster than someone can move 50 lbs of precious metals

[17-Sep-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as a "store of value", BTC is no better than 14 blades of grass out of your front lawn

[17-Sep-18 04:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
hyperbole much?

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
and you havent seen my lawn.  its a panty-dropper

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not hyperbole, I ask you to defend the position that it's any different...

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
can i sell 14 blades of grass from my front yard right now, this second for 6K?

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to the right idiot, yes

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just like BTC

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
that is not true

[17-Sep-18 04:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
idiots who will buy 14 blades of grass for 6k dont have any money at all

[17-Sep-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some idiot spent 14k on a feken piece of toast, because if you cock your head right and use your imagination really hard, it looks sorta like a painting of an imaginary person....

[17-Sep-18 04:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
so back to my question, if only idiots will buy BTC, why do you own BTC?

[17-Sep-18 04:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
that isnt an argument

[17-Sep-18 04:37 PM] snowdamn#2414
China miner centralization is bad for 🤓 like us, but can be very bullish tradewise
