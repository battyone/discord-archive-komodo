Made a post beginning of November about KMD bottoming around $0.50 when it was at $1.3 - it hit $0.49. If the price doesn't fall under that level, I see it going to at least $900 in 2 years time. My 2 cents.  https://trybe.one/komodo-technical-analysis-a-truly-decentralized-ecosystem/

I think verge will pass KMD first.... the wrong direction.

Looks like I was wrong... KMD was like FECK YOU and pushed right past it.

[13-Feb-19 08:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I will finish with one remark. What really intrigues me about Komodo? Its future projection. If the price movement ends up confirming this correction as a wave (2), we will then enter an impulsive wave (3) rally which will yield an end-to-end ROI in the range of 1500-1800x! That‚Äôs the highest potential gain I am seeing in all of the Top 25 cryptos by market cap at the moment. Stay tuned for more.

[13-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
interesting conclusion @Matthias

[13-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Matthias#2174
$900 if it holds $0.49 from here...I'm seeing big gains in many charts.

of course with mass market adoption, $100 billion is not really crazy at all

[13-Feb-19 08:16 PM] Matthias#2174
I think it's more mass "hysteria" than adoption that will push the crypto market to new highs. But adoption will definitely help.

[13-Feb-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
probably the real potential of mass market adoption that creates the hysteria. right now we are in the pets.com phase, thousands of coins and all sound about the same and with none of them having mass market adoption, they are all arguably very similar. Out of this chaos, some projects will rise above the rest

the first few that do will get pretty entrenched with all the usual advantages of being there first, but with the additional network effect that p2p systems have

[13-Feb-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is more like the early search engine days, where you could never really find what you were looking for unless you got lucky. 
then google solved it an you could actually get useful search results
marketing didnt matter much, if the user experience was total failure vs total success

looking for someone in the community to market the ROGUE chain, it will be a paid position. Since it combines an rpg which directly creates collectibles in addition to ingame gold become real ROGUE coins, it has a lot of unique aspects. It is a great proof of concept of blockchaining a deterministic random process, but it is also a pretty addictive game and could teach us more about how best to do such things
