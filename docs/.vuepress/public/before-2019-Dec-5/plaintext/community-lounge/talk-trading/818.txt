I forgot about that rebrand. Is it still a thing? It was announced a year ago.

[22-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Markus#5464

someone bought at 1460 👀

[22-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The entire DP volume is less than 10 bitcoins. That exchange doesn't matter.

Peter Brandt, a 72-year-old veteran technical trader that called last year’s cryptocurrency bear market, has recently noted he believes bitcoin’s price is looking to reach $100,000, and that in his 45 years of experience “no other market” went “parabolic on a log ch...

Gooooo btc

[22-Jun-19 01:23 PM] alen#3721
So happy i exchanged almost all of my stellar, eth and ada for btc

[22-Jun-19 01:27 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Glad to see we’re back to prices that make all progress meaningless

[22-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Keppie#5156
Sell side is a joke. Awesome 2nd half of 2019 inc

[22-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Markus#5464
Just one thing to remember

[22-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Markus#5464
we have now 2 cme future gaps

[22-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Markus#5464
1 from 8500 to 9000 and 2nd one 10k to 11k

[22-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Mark81#4505
Why would cme paper contract be meanigful?

[22-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
some ppl say gaps have to be filled but idk if thats true

[22-Jun-19 01:43 PM] bishop#9773
It's not

[22-Jun-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In normal markets that open and close it is normal

[22-Jun-19 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Btc is a new paradigm in that sense

[22-Jun-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
but isnt that cause of pre market?

[22-Jun-19 01:45 PM] bishop#9773
ALL gaps do not have to fill

[22-Jun-19 01:45 PM] bishop#9773
it's not some set rule

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] bishop#9773
hell pull up a lot of the tech companies that are still around listed on the US exchanges, and you'll see plenty of gaps at low levels

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] crumb#2550
there is no pre or post market when it comes to crypto

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] crumb#2550
it's all 24/7/365

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Markus#5464
meant traditional markets

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Markus#5464
isnt that why they have gaps

[22-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Markus#5464
cause of pre markets

[22-Jun-19 01:47 PM] bishop#9773
There is a high propensity for gaps to close, just like people expecting activity around the 50- and 200-DMAs, but there is nothing special about them... what makes a 50 better than a 49 or 51?  Because it's round?

[22-Jun-19 01:47 PM] crumb#2550
yes, so the same concept cannot be 100% transferred to crypto

[22-Jun-19 01:49 PM] crumb#2550
too many people try to fit crypto into known rulesets and fail to understand there are many unquantifiable qualities.

💯 

[22-Jun-19 01:50 PM] crumb#2550
new concepts are born and need to be understood by many, but realistically that will take years if not decades

[22-Jun-19 01:51 PM] crumb#2550
and most don't care to learn anything new anyways. so 🤷

[22-Jun-19 02:13 PM] designer#4893
bitcoin is something that has never existed in the world.
don't let any standards run into bitcoin.
bitcoin creates everything new.

[22-Jun-19 02:15 PM] designer#4893
bitcoin is an epidemic.

[22-Jun-19 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing about bitcoin that "never existed in the world" was a double-spend solution
that's the only thing "new" in it

[22-Jun-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that was a decade ago
There's 100 other coins/platforms that have newer and better things

[22-Jun-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is for fanboys and those that don't know any more than what they see on TV

[22-Jun-19 02:18 PM] designer#4893
I'm not talking about a technical approach.
bitcoin is strong and special, considering all things religious, humanities, philosophy, sociology, dynamics and collective intelligence.

[22-Jun-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bitcoin is useless, ridiculously over-priced, pointlessly expensive to transact on,  and quite non-special

[22-Jun-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
take a nap and wake up into 2019

[22-Jun-19 02:25 PM] allbits#5898
You're quite wrong about that one genie.  Largest buyers know a lot more than you do about how money works. I'm talking about serious hedge funds and the global risk management groups at large financial institutions.  BTC is what works for those peoples.  It crossed the bridge into being a must have asset.  Tech is only a small part of that equation

[22-Jun-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That wasn't even me getting into the tech side

[22-Jun-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
think of this, someone sends you $1M worth of BTC with a "low fee" (which is still overpriced for use value), you're happy and give them whatever institutional instrument in exchange (before waiting the up to 3 days that confirms can take)
now they close their wallet, zap it and send $2M to someone else with a higher fee and it gets put into the next block and you never get yours
will you still love BTC then?

[22-Jun-19 02:32 PM] p.#1126
What a special kind of stupidity

[22-Jun-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's 2019, there is 0 reason that any financial transaction shouldn't be wholly completed in under 5 minutes

[22-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Markus#5464
wow btc dump

[22-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Markus#5464
maybe?

[22-Jun-19 02:34 PM] allbits#5898
You're a smart guy and very helpful to people here. But you have no window into the long term decision making processes of institutions with billions of dollars in global assets to be managed. BTC started getting on their radar in second half 2017. From their point of view, many have been concluding that not having a small allocation to BTC is a huge mistake. What you're seeing here is institutional fomo, playing out over months, and being gamed by savvy traders. Just wait until the central bank bureaucracies conclude the same thing.  It's going to be beautiful

[22-Jun-19 02:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Bitcoin isn't that; if it becomes that, then it's not Bitcoin (maybe read the wp again?)

[22-Jun-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're conflating Bitcoin and BTC

[22-Jun-19 02:36 PM] kaks#6612
9MIL liq 👀

[22-Jun-19 02:36 PM] allbits#5898
Bitcoin doesn't belong to anybody and it doesn't care what you think it's supposed to be

[22-Jun-19 02:38 PM] allbits#5898
Yes I am conflating the two. I'm referring to the crytpocurrency traded under the ticker BTC, just to be clear

[22-Jun-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not about what I think, "what bitcoin **is**" is a documented thing not really up for debate or interpretation as it's quite literally spelled out what it *is* and what it's *meant* to do and be....
Deviation from that, in purpose or design, isn't Bitcoin
Because, words

[22-Jun-19 02:39 PM] allbits#5898
It's ok to admit you're wrong about this poetic appreciation being driven by fanboys and those that don't know what they see on TV.

[22-Jun-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online
payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a
financial institution.```

[22-Jun-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
read the last 6 words carefully

[22-Jun-19 02:40 PM] allbits#5898
You were talking about what's driving the price. Now you're changing the subject

[22-Jun-19 02:41 PM] allbits#5898
It's ok for you to admit you are wrong about that

[22-Jun-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
feel free to contrast any of my statements with the wp and point to where I'm wrong....

[22-Jun-19 02:43 PM] allbits#5898
It's ok to admit you're wrong about this price appreciation being driven by fanboys and those that don't know what they see on TV.

[22-Jun-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I didn't say "price appreciation", literally ever

[22-Jun-19 02:45 PM] allbits#5898
True. You said "btc is for fanboys". I said it's not. It's being used extensively for risk management by large institutions.

[22-Jun-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
whose driving the price and who will ever use it outside of a commodity aren't even in the same hemisphere of topice

[22-Jun-19 02:46 PM] allbits#5898
Then you started telling me to read the whitepaper and stuff. I read it in 2012

[22-Jun-19 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"btc is for fanboys"
is a factual statement
those "institutional" fanboys love it because they know they can make huge bank by dumping it on some sucker before the parabolic pops

[22-Jun-19 02:47 PM] allbits#5898
You're being deliberately obtuse now.

[22-Jun-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I'm being truthful and pulling back the veil
If you truly believe that institutional money goes into BTC for any other reason, I invite you to show me that use-case

[22-Jun-19 02:49 PM] allbits#5898
And that's a wrong characterization about institutional interest. I'm absolutely certain you have zero window into their decision making process

[22-Jun-19 02:49 PM] designer#4893
Scalability and transmission speed are not a problem for Bitcoin. You still haven't figured out the essence,

[22-Jun-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Scalability and transmission speed are not a problem for Bitcoin. `
__Literally__ the best joke I've heard all year

[22-Jun-19 02:50 PM] designer#4893
Very immature. You

[22-Jun-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Bitcoin has been past scale for a long time already
That's entirely the reason there's so much hate over antpool mining empty blocks

[22-Jun-19 02:51 PM] designer#4893
Bitcoin faces an opponent of government and politics.

[22-Jun-19 02:52 PM] designer#4893
Scalability? Transmission speed? Don't count on Bitcoin for such things.

[22-Jun-19 02:53 PM] allbits#5898
"Pulling back the veil".  Hahaha. You don't even know where the veil is or what it looks like. You know exactly nothing about that world.

[22-Jun-19 02:53 PM] designer#4893
It is a bitcoin that fights alone with the government and politics on the front line alone.

[22-Jun-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You're right, I'm just a broke-ass nobody who's never even been outside his trailer park

[22-Jun-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You caught me

[22-Jun-19 02:54 PM] allbits#5898
I don't think you're that. I think you're a very smart guy and I have a ton of respect for you

the flood of hacks recently, and clickbait spam, it is not a coincidence

[22-Jun-19 02:55 PM] allbits#5898
I just don't think institutional finance is your thing and its ok for you to admit that

[22-Jun-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i fear that we will continue to read about hacks against crypto

[22-Jun-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is unlikely that many will do anything to refund the people that get hacked

[22-Jun-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
from what i can tell, the way we handled the hack, made it mostly a non-event and not much of the recent selling is from that
