But on KMDICE betting plan you have quite good spread for experiments 😀

[26-Oct-18 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ignoring txfees, it does have 100% payout

[26-Oct-18 05:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
real-world odds and paper odds aren't always the same - once lost more than I'll ever admit betting against a chick who pointed back to back 4s and 10s 14 times 🙄

[26-Oct-18 05:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, gambling of dream. No edge, instant payouts

[26-Oct-18 05:54 AM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Sounds like a some apophenia

[26-Oct-18 05:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it may have bee 12 times (either way it was a shit night for me 😛 )

[26-Oct-18 05:55 AM] TonyL#3577
There is a interesting thing also that people concentrate on losses more / feel it more than on winnings

[26-Oct-18 05:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't even remember most of my losses, but nights like that are so odd and rare that you never forget seeing it happen (no matter which side of the line you're playing)

[26-Oct-18 05:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Haha, I like to gamble, see my happy face 😂

[26-Oct-18 05:59 AM] TonyL#3577
So if you think that Dice CC is not fair you can check is it in 3sigmas similar as in table which I've shared above

[26-Oct-18 05:59 AM] TonyL#3577
If it's not in 3sigmas it might be a reason to worry 😃

[26-Oct-18 06:00 AM] TonyL#3577
You been in Armenia, really?

[26-Oct-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I mean the "table face"

[26-Oct-18 06:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Haha, I see

[26-Oct-18 06:01 AM] TonyL#3577
😃 I thought maybe you was one of my opponents :trollface:

[26-Oct-18 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you played in Tunica any time from 2000-2014, it's possible

[26-Oct-18 06:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Played in Morocco, never been in Tunisia :/

[26-Oct-18 06:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've never been outside of the states

[26-Oct-18 06:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Haha, I've read Tunica as Tunisia. Where is my coffee?

anywho, now that I've got my node filling the KMDICE blocktemplate with transactions, it's time for a nap

[26-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Too many messages above regarding the price of vrsc/arrr/kmdice being similar, but people forget that these coins have different coin supplies. Which is why even though they might have the same price/coin, the value is completely different.

[26-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, its okay that a ‘shittier’ project’s coin is more expensive atm, 99% of the coins listed above kmd on cmc fall under that category

[26-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you perceive a coin as too expensive, dump it, if you think a coin is too cheap, buy it.

[26-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Mastercard merchant payment system having trouble scaling up without spending millions and millions of dollars 😂

[26-Oct-18 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
How do blockchain transactions and say mastercard ones work? Will there be a day in the future where it will be easy for them to say, use an already existing blockchain for the tx/s and easily merge the systems?

[26-Oct-18 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
or will they have to start from scratch

[26-Oct-18 07:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Mastercard tx are just tx on a centralized ledger

[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Stored on a centralized database, that is not a blockchain but sql or whatever

[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
(Im a tech noob, but that’s how I understand it)

[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, will they be able to somehow leverage a blockchain with all their existing systems still in place? 😮 Or do they have to like make everything from the ground up

[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Depends on where they start logging their tx

[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think for the frontend, for merchants and customers there isn’t that much that should/could change

[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But backend has to be ported to a blockchain

[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Given how long mastercard exists and the legacy systems they already have, simply porting will probably be impossible

[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So ground up is probably needed

```approved a draft anti-fraud law that``` <- still a draft, sounds like fud, but even if it goes through. This is the old system trying to fight for their life and keep the old ways, it's always bound to happen. Tax is a big issue with crypto, we are basically going back to the middle ages where you had to go collect in the villages. I believe it's gonna come down to taxing money directly from paychecks. I would like to see a system where tax or anything related to infrastructure is paid on a by need basis, government scale down dramatically, direct impact on what you pay for. you could make a crypto payment directlys for that pothole in your steet and make sure it only get's used for that, you'd have direct voting control over your money instead of giving money out randomly and hoping someone in a high castle does the right choice. utopic dream for now though >_> maybe in 50-100 years i am hopeful.

[26-Oct-18 11:27 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
roman empire worked with a tax of like 0.5%, nowdays states work with 30-50% taxes, that's ridiculous

[26-Oct-18 11:29 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
The powers of old, don't want the change, but it's coming. Laws like these will only make ppl flee more into currencies like monero/ARR and so on

[26-Oct-18 11:32 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Sometimes I wish we had a level 3 AI that could be fed with all the economic knowledge of the past 2000 years, add some genie flair to it, and then let it comment on government desicions in the now time. mocking their behaviour so they see their erroneous ways

Anyone else using that new blockfolio 2.0? Woke up today and my Kmd signal had triggered. ( set to 0.015 per kmd - yes one day lol) nealry quit my job 😂

mkay, did it just now, looks like ios now

[26-Oct-18 11:45 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
tbh i preferred the 1.0

[26-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it just said something like upgrade in the old

[26-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
clicked ok

[26-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and it updated to the new one

[26-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It's okay I guess, main advantage is that you can take average price over multiple exchanges if you want

[26-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
for eth or btc that can come in handy

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, i chose blockfolio over others because i prefer the blocky aestetic too in 1.0, sharpness, less clutter

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
but oh well

[26-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
main advantage seems the ability to create multiple portfolios

What's the argument for Zcash with sapling, and assuming mandatory privacy, over Grin? Kyle Samani from Multicoin Capital just tweeted this question.

I'd like to answer to that tweet as Kyle has not yet shown interest in Komodo. I think he has too many ETH related positions, but i can be wrong of course. Anyways he has a nice twitter following, so good chance to engage/spark conversation about Komodo tech.
@jl777c or if anyone else is knowledgeable to give a good thorough answer

[26-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What is grin

[26-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
