but no idea on when the first release will drop

[15-Jul-19 08:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Kool, Still early there then

[15-Jul-19 08:44 AM] Malti#3948
indeed and it also depends on east coast vs west coast üò¶

[15-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Markus#5464
so europe might get the rebrand tomorrow then if they wont do it in a reasonable time

[15-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Malti#3948

i'm looking forward to see the new logo

[15-Jul-19 09:22 AM] Malti#3948
it's the least substantial I know, but i just like nice graphics

[15-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
isnt the logo already revealed like long time ago?

[15-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
similar to now but black and white?

[15-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
unless they decided to change it

We hope that you all saved the date for tomorrow 15th July 2019! Besides the Antara Framework, we will also launch a new website, new visual identity, updated white paper, and partner network program.

[15-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Malti#3948
Markus, in the AMA they specified this

[15-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Malti#3948
Will there be a brand new Komodo logo?
Is the new logo the black and white version of the current logo? or a completely different logo (obviously this will be answered on the 15th, but looking for hints today ;))

There will be an entirely new logo being introduced.

[15-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Markus#5464
Alright cool

I will buy up to 2 mil $Waves from the open market in upcoming weeks. The funds  will eventually be used for Waves ecosystem development, and will be stored at 3P77ApKT9tWCr9WjT2JbzWuzEg2v39ixX1h

Dump the news incoming!?

[15-Jul-19 12:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
was there pump on rumor?

[15-Jul-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
pretty sure we have been dumping.....lol

[15-Jul-19 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
dump on rumor pump on news? üòÉ

[15-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Mark81#4505
This can run only with Amazon being board on antara with aws blockchain solutions.

[15-Jul-19 12:52 PM] Mark81#4505
By something huge news I mean.

[15-Jul-19 12:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But if it didnt pump on rumor you think it is likely to dump? I doubt it

[15-Jul-19 12:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Can only go sideways or up

[15-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Mark81#4505
You have been very positive towards Komodo after getting back on board! Nice way to go!

[15-Jul-19 12:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Had time to think, needed to zoom out and see the whole picture Mark

[15-Jul-19 01:02 PM] Mark81#4505
Well you have had long road from btcd times till here.

[15-Jul-19 01:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
üòÉ yep been a long time and things are coming together

[15-Jul-19 01:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I expect the next 6 months will be where market sentiment for KMD will shift

[15-Jul-19 01:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
DEX will ramp up and take over the space, with market makers making it the most liquid.

[15-Jul-19 01:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
nSPV will scale to millions and smart chains will be the new stand in "smart contracts"

[15-Jul-19 01:08 PM] Mark81#4505
Have you had chance to test AtomicDEX by that I mean do you have insight view on that?

[15-Jul-19 01:09 PM] Mark81#4505
I would suppose you would have chance for that.

[15-Jul-19 01:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I have not personally but been in channels where they have. I have a dev also porting the hyperDEX GUI over to use mm2.0 and he tells me it just works.

[15-Jul-19 01:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Every indication that the issues we have had previously with barterDEX and mm1.0 has been resolved to a large extent

[15-Jul-19 01:10 PM] Mark81#4505
To me most interesting thing is scaling since mm1.0 stress tests showed how proplematic it was.

[15-Jul-19 01:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep that was in large part due to the network issues, which seems to be fixed now.

[15-Jul-19 01:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Another part was due to the SPV servers, with nSPV we can have many many more users per server

[15-Jul-19 01:12 PM] Mark81#4505
Whole new world with its own tech! Unique!

[15-Jul-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also another big part of it was that there was no "hook". With mm2.0 and a easy market maker app, we will be basically allowing anyone to hook up to their API keys and make free money

[15-Jul-19 01:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
with no risk

[15-Jul-19 01:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What is interesting that the lucky testers will be apart of something totally new. Atomic swaps on a mobile device. Add that to your resume üöÄ

[15-Jul-19 01:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Say you set you want to make 5% on the price you can buy on a CEX but with more market makers under cutting each other, there will be a balance of a premium to trade on  a DEX and the amount of liquidity we will get. The more market makers the more users.
