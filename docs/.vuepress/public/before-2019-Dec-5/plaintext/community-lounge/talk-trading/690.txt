@NutellaLicka not sure, but it's easy to follow FR xtns on block explorers

[28-May-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, PIRATE has never looked better

[28-May-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
with these raw zxtns I am working on, you will be able to wear your tin foil hat in a faraday cage to make your shielded xtn, and then broadcast via a different machine. More secure than Davy Jones locker!

sounds reasonable

[28-May-19 02:39 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c how were those approximate 600 btc spent by kmd?

[28-May-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization fees for almost 3 years was a good chunk, salaries and overhead

[28-May-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[28-May-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
one quick question

[28-May-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
lets say btc will get massive adoption

[28-May-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
price will rise to 1 mil $

[28-May-19 02:43 PM] Markus#5464
what will happen to fees?

[28-May-19 02:44 PM] Markus#5464
In current state of btc without any additional improvements in the code

[28-May-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the price of BTC doesnt matter as we have the BTC

[28-May-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the number of tx per block that matters

[28-May-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
as BTC price goes up ,more and more usecases become nonviable and will move to other chains

[28-May-19 02:46 PM] Markus#5464
Do u see btc fees exceeding 100$ if price would be 100k+ ?

[28-May-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0005 * $100,000 = $50

[28-May-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but it could require 0.001 per tx

[28-May-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, it is possible

[28-May-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
Bitpay is already charging fees over $10 to load BTC onto their debit card

[28-May-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Markus $100 fees will come very soon

[28-May-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, i think we have shown to be able to make good decisions as the landscape changes, so we will continue doing that

[28-May-19 02:49 PM] Markus#5464
Wouldnt it scare ppl with a average paying job away who didnt invest in times like now before price and fees rise to such prices?

[28-May-19 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
and to clarify, i think consumers will be forced to pay massive fees by GUI apps much faster than we will see "real" network fees of $100

[28-May-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
average people wont use legacy coin

[28-May-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
legacy coin decided to just be a financial SOV

[28-May-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
which is fine, i guess something needs to do that

"legacy coin" = btc?

[28-May-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so people wont really use it, other than to trade it and maybe make largish monetary transfers

[28-May-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes BTC == legacy coin with legacy devs that deprecate the most used rpc calls to force everyone to update to their segwit scheme

[28-May-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i said segwit wouldnt solve scaling, i said that 2MB or even 4MB blocks are not a problem. I was right

[28-May-19 02:53 PM] Markus#5464
Well i think u are one of few selected who got such high knowledge when it comes to blockchain development considering what u have created in such short amount of time, other projects would need a large team to achieve that

[28-May-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
legacy devs politicize the technical stuff and basically do what politicians do, lie all the time

[28-May-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
they say they cant do a hardfork as it would break the installed base. yet they keep deprecating fundamental rpc like getinfo, signrawtransaction

[28-May-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and when the double spend bug was found they did a hardfork pretty fast

[28-May-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
I honestly believe core is undermined and was tasked with making BTC less useful from a trustlessness perspective and more useful to special interests

[28-May-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
2MB blocks are unsafe they say, yet with segwit it can end up at 2MB or even a bit bigger

[28-May-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
lies, lies, lies and more lies

[28-May-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
nothing they do makes sense

[28-May-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt take a dev at my level to understand this

full bull market stupidity is here

[28-May-19 03:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
People like the idea of 'free' money

[28-May-19 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
No exchanges have promised support, and YEC has promised not to pay, lol

[28-May-19 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
YEC is the only thing preventing ZEC from finding new ATL's right now, and it's just treading water

[28-May-19 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
safe.trade did :abusedsmily:

[28-May-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is not financial advice. Day traders might be able to make money on ZEC intra-day swings, but it seems very very dangerous to go long. Just my 2 satoshis

[28-May-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright oh shit, you right. They were the first

[28-May-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
flypool has pledged support as well. it only makes sense for the largest ZEC mining pool, they stand to get a lot of free money too

[28-May-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
I recall someone telling me that is it didn't settle around ~$5 YEC that the devs would abandon it

[28-May-19 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
without a minimum amount of price + liquidity, the FR cannot be used to fund development, it's illiquid and too cheap to sell to cover monthly operating expenses

[28-May-19 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is if there is even exchange support. And 51% attacks will be very concerning for YEC

[28-May-19 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
they will be forced to use hundreds of confirmations

[28-May-19 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
enjoy your 10hr deposit and withdraws

[28-May-19 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
but OTC is possible in the beginning. None of the above technical issues stopped ZCL or BTCP from briefly seeing insane valuations, either

[28-May-19 03:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Would be great if ZEC slso goes to it's ATH levels

[28-May-19 03:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can further sell a bit more of it

[28-May-19 03:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Already halved my holdings in it

[28-May-19 03:44 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its ATH was 3000 btc üòõ  thats never happening

[28-May-19 03:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That's silly.... ü§£ wasn't expecting that high

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
they had that super slow mining launch, hashpower was very high to get like 0.1 zec a block

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and the very first blocks sold at like 2000-3000 btc per üòÑ

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
What was last bull run ath

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
?

[28-May-19 03:45 PM] Alexfrog#1338
zec has never had a bull run üòÑ

[28-May-19 03:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i guess it went from .03 btc in early 2017 to .05 btc at the top

[28-May-19 03:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so around 800-1000 dollars a coin at the crypto peak

[28-May-19 03:46 PM] Alexfrog#1338
but the zec/btc chart is just eternal death

[28-May-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it went to 0.15 briefly

[28-May-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEC i think after some adoption news

[28-May-19 03:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
we at 15.7

[28-May-19 03:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
right now

[28-May-19 03:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
zec at .15 was in the long early fall from 3000 btc to 0.03

[28-May-19 03:56 PM] klein#5233
needs to break and hold above $1.55

[28-May-19 03:57 PM] Alecandro#1179

zec isn t a kmd fork ? :troll:

[28-May-19 04:47 PM] Alecandro#1179
Halving is in like 2 days

[28-May-19 04:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
youre buying the top if youre buying next week lol

[28-May-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if you think 50 cents is the top for the best privacy coin out there, it seems quite on the low side

[28-May-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it will be a few more halvings until the sell pressure from miners will be gone and it can decouple completely from mining costs
