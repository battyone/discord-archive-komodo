ps2h script has size limit

[20-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each item 576 bytes (I think)

[20-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
total size of 10kb or so

[20-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
to spend a p2sh output, you need to produce the full redeemscript, each and everytime

[20-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hard to come up with a more inefficient method

😆 😄 

[20-Sep-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is indeed possible to make a CC where you register a multisig set of pubkeys just once and then in the future sign it without repeatedly providing the list of all the pubkeys of the signers, but just the signatures

{Reactions}
🆒 ⤴ 

[20-Sep-18 01:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So is the redeem script secret?

[20-Sep-18 01:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because you’re just providing the hash of the redeem script, right?

[20-Sep-18 01:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is the whole redeem script in the transaction info

[20-Sep-18 01:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Original interest began with verus time-locked rewards in their p2sh addresses

[20-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And if it was possible to spoof a block height and prematurely gain access to time-locked rewards

[20-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rather manually generate a transaction with a higher blockheight, and how it actually gets verified

[20-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I.e. say you privately forked it, ran the block height arbitrarily high, generated the tx, then broadcast it on the main chain

[20-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“It’s an older code sir, but it checks out”

[20-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Like I said, need to read more

[20-Sep-18 01:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or if they’re simply time-locked, why the “b” address, couldn’t they have simply had the coins generated on a T address with a timelock, or was that done solely to obfuscate who mined what

I think I built a sandcastle of assumptions and I’m generating questions based off that

[20-Sep-18 01:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So they’ll also have the redeem script in hand and feed your inputs into it

[20-Sep-18 01:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So the whole redeem script is sent to and verified by the miners

[20-Sep-18 01:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’ll look into it

[20-Sep-18 01:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So if that whole redeem script isn’t on chain

[20-Sep-18 01:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it subject to size limitations

[20-Sep-18 01:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are there malicious scripts, say one coded to potentially crash whoever tries to verify

[20-Sep-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
usually until the first spend the p2sh script is secret

[20-Sep-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but with VRSC coinbase, the redeemscript is in the opreturn

{Reactions}
🤔 

[20-Sep-18 01:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Almost”

[20-Sep-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need a hash collision

[20-Sep-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if you could make a spendable redeemscript whose hash matches the p2sh hash, then you can spend it

[20-Sep-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
odds of this is remote

[20-Sep-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
a hard way to make 384 VRSC

[20-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Calculate 384^384384384

{Reactions}
🤔 

[20-Sep-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt

[20-Sep-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is designed so you cant overflow the stack

[20-Sep-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no recursion, not even looping, size limits to the script

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so max depth the stack can get is set to be smaller than the stack . that is allocated

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If I wrote some kind of redeem script like the above, what would the verifier do

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“Invalid script”

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If 384^384384384 was part of the script

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
hash has to match, if it doesnt it gives error and stops

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no exponentiation opcode

[20-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
ah

[20-Sep-18 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Divide by zero?

[20-Sep-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
you could try

[20-Sep-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it will generate some sort of error

[20-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Some ridiculous combination of commands

Program your node to ignore a particular contract, transmit to the network and jam all the other miners up

Solo mine until they clear
