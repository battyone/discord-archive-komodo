i have just heard that but never found any info regarding why they would get 5 mil? cause of collaboration?

If rfox actually received that funding then it‚Äôs a solid signal that the 70M wasn‚Äôt BS

Charts move in cycles, just like the emotions of most human beings. 
Cycles should be traded. 
Altcoins should be traded. 

Entries are popping up which should be bought. 

We are in the phase where people are going to say ‚Äòif I only bought here.‚Äô

Back in 2016 I was a BTC maximalist thinking that altcoins would die. A few months later; altseason. 

Now I see 2017/2018 folks make exactly the same mistake as I did in 2016. 

Altcoins dont die. Your confidence does.

[03-Aug-19 06:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
the biggest volume exchange's activity for kmd looks fake af. binance is incentivising customers not to trade it. pirate is getting sold below mining cost for some reason. it's a strange situation.

zawyToday at 15:38
It's possible @jl777c are close to completing it.    It's a tremendous advancement in DAs for 3 reasons.  First, I'm happy someone like JL was familar with my work on changing difficulty during the block. This idea goes back to a medium article by Andrew Stone (BTC Unlimited).   This was  the only way to unstick  1E6 hashrate increase problems.  1E6 required a lot more than a linear downward adjustment for long solvetimes. So JL was trying N^2.  But that decreases too quickly.  I knew to use 2^x aka e^x aka 3^x.   But like I was saying, things need to be symmetric which means we need to be able to rise as fast as we fall or a big attacker can get too many blocks way too quickly with persistent oscillations.  The 2^x function  can resolve enormous jumps in only 30 or so bocks.  I thought of small-window SMAs thought could do it without causing other problems.  I spent a lot of time in the past on these kind of increases  So we can rise and fall in response to any size hash attack in about 30 blocks, apparently being pretty symmetrica (30 blocks to rise, 30 blocks to fall) .  By any size I mean a 1 billion times increase in hashrate takes 50 blocks to fix whereas Zcash's default digishiled (that this still uses for normal hashrates) takes 500 blocks to address a 1000x increase.    It's nice working with JL because I didn't have to look at the code.

amazon is probably filing the patent as we speak.

[03-Aug-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it really is a significant breakthrough

plz dont ask how this helps KMD price

no idea what effect on price, its just nice to solve the previously unsolved problems, with blockchain proof that it was achieved

[03-Aug-19 07:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Will it be implemented next fork?

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Assuming successful testing

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is available now for new chains, existing chains will need to hardfork to activate this

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I mean KMD itself

[03-Aug-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810

a diff stranded chain needs that next block, else it is stuck

[03-Aug-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
adaptivePoW changes the diff during the current block, so no matter how bad the diff stranding a single CPU can rescue it

[03-Aug-19 07:49 PM] allbits#5898
One reason this is so good is that it's great for the coming multi chain world, right? Very insignificant chains can be dPOW without the concern of being really diff stranded

[03-Aug-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[03-Aug-19 07:58 PM] allbits#5898
It was also interesting in your discussions with zawy  when he seemed quite surprised that you were actually running versions of the code on a "live chain".  People still haven't turned on to the fact that with komodo, live chains can be spun up in moments with very little resources. This massively accelerates testing capability, experimentation, and innovation.  Slowly, people like zawy and zack are starting to see and appreciate this.

@JimD Emmanuel is completely right. Verushash 2 uses native processor functions at such a level that FPGAs don‚Äôt kill CPU mining. Our lead dev implied some time ago that further enhancements are possible in favor of CPUs, in case that becomes necessary in the future.

[03-Aug-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
diff stranding is a totally different problem. imagine one million times the normal hashrate boosts the difficulty to a million times normal, and then goes away

[03-Aug-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
how do you get the next block?

[03-Aug-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
mine for a million minutes?

[03-Aug-19 08:45 PM] joe2x4#5987
Is there such a thing as public chain with blocks on demand? Such as a block only gets added if there is a need for it. Maybe a scenario where records are keep on blockchain, but no real need to have chain always creating blocks. AdaptivePow use case?

[03-Aug-19 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodod -ac_name=JOE2X4 -ac_supply=10000000 -ac_public=1 &` would do your job. adaptivepow is for 100% minable coins

[03-Aug-19 08:48 PM] SHossain#0007
on demand chains doesn't have mining actually unless there is a tx in mempool
