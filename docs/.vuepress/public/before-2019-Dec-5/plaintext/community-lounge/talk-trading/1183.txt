we can make wrapped coins (tokens), so MBTC is also in the works. will be backed 1:1 with multisig BTC, but have 1 minute blocktime and 0.0001 txfees

@Privatoshi  #chips #cc-dice

[26-Oct-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with all the tech in place, finally others are able to see the complete vision of what is possible and what i have been working on since 2014

[26-Oct-19 07:38 AM] Privatoshi#9487
So we could create pairings for other sets of coins... NXT?

[26-Oct-19 07:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomicdex you can pair against any other coin

[26-Oct-19 07:38 AM] Flint#6435
@jl777c Is solidity language planned?

[26-Oct-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but without actual MBTC, USDK, GOLDK chains it is seems it is too abstract for most people, like without a GUI the core tech seems to be ignored

[26-Oct-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont believe that an interpreted language for the blockchain is the correct solution

[26-Oct-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i wont stop it, but i wont work toward it

[26-Oct-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to invoke existing functionality via rpc to achieve most anything you want to do

[26-Oct-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
for finite state machines, there are GUI that can generate the state machine description, so it would be possible to graphically "program" your state machine and deploy it onchain

[26-Oct-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
#cc-general has a discussion about FSM CC

[26-Oct-19 07:41 AM] Privatoshi#9487
When you talk about synthetic assets, people do get confused.

[26-Oct-19 07:42 AM] Privatoshi#9487
They can't grasp the idea

[26-Oct-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
@Flint copying a bad design that suceeded because it was first, wont help if you are not first

[26-Oct-19 07:43 AM] Privatoshi#9487
A lot of people got into DeFi this year, but they all haven't had a good experience

[26-Oct-19 07:44 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That falls on ETH

[26-Oct-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD model of defi will be toward the low cost of the spectrum. other than the lost rewards from locking the KMD and the 0.0001 txfees, there wont be much costs. for the cost of txfees and not collecting rewards, you can get an interest free loan of up to 80%. you can prevent it from being liquidated by adding more funds if it gets close to 90% threshold. it could be that as the price of KMD drops and peoples positions get closer to being liquidated, it will create a demand for KMD to be purchased so it wont be liquidated

[26-Oct-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if this liquidation prevention demand can be 50%+ of the liquidation sell pressure, that would actually create a net demand. when the price of KMD is going up, the simple fact that people can issue more stablecoins should create the demand

[26-Oct-19 07:48 AM] Privatoshi#9487
How about entering long or short positions?

[26-Oct-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and if price of KMD is going up, that isnt really any problem

[26-Oct-19 07:49 AM] Flint#6435
but the idea itself is worth a lot! itâ€™s like komodo a pioneer in atomic permutations, itâ€™s just as good to declare oneself more often as a pioneer in other areas, or at least followers of good ideas! For example, launching small-sized satellites from blockchain projects seems to be not the most urgent task today to solve problems in the blockchain world, but what a great marketing effect!

[26-Oct-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
prices CC can define all sorts of synthetic positions. long, short, even can track a basket of prices like market index

[26-Oct-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
@Flint if you can raise a few millions for us to launch sattelites, we will gladly accept the donation!

[26-Oct-19 07:50 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Well a third party could buy a lot of KMD, and provide a bot that doesnt let loans fall below the liquidation level, at a cost

[26-Oct-19 07:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Bc fluctuations in price occur

[26-Oct-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we plan to have an automated replenisher so people can fund it with X amount of KMD and it would be used to prevent liquidations

[26-Oct-19 07:51 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It would cost the borrower more

[26-Oct-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to centralize it. let each user fund and run their own

[26-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Privatoshi#9487
But better than being liquidated..
Sounds nice

[26-Oct-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the issuer of the stablecoin is the "borrower", there isnt any interest that you have to pay

[26-Oct-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody is loaning it out

[26-Oct-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
new coins are being created via the blockchain, based on each individual user decision. basically it decentralizes the central banking function of money creation

[26-Oct-19 07:53 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Correct.. the minting

[26-Oct-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is required to have this minting power

[26-Oct-19 07:54 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I like it

[26-Oct-19 07:54 AM] Flint#6435
but  can seek partnerships with other small satellite private launch projects! I will try to find exhaustive information on this issue. I have competent friends in this field. I will ask them.

[26-Oct-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can time the market, you can effectively trade against the blockchain by minting and redeeming at the right times

[26-Oct-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
where minting is a bit like selling short and redeeming is covering the short

[26-Oct-19 07:55 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Yeah you can do this with sETH & sUSD

[26-Oct-19 07:56 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Some very smart guys

[26-Oct-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, you can also make a 5% arbitrage by liquidating the accounts of the <10% equity

[26-Oct-19 07:56 AM] Privatoshi#9487
How would you liquidated them?

[26-Oct-19 07:56 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Short KMD

[26-Oct-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
by issuing a transaction that spends their remaining equity

[26-Oct-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
when an addresses equity goes below 10%, anybody will be able to spend their remaining equity if they pay back the amount borrowed.

[26-Oct-19 07:57 AM] Flint#6435
the position of exchanges on which the government has an influence is interesting when Komodo starts releasing stablecoins! After all, while liquidity is accumulated on our own exchange, listing on another ten exchanges for mass adoption will not stop us!

[26-Oct-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[26-Oct-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is a very critical part of the overall ecosystem

[26-Oct-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it enables the cross chain value transfer, which is the first proven mass market usage of crypto

[26-Oct-19 08:01 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Do we have all possible stablecoin pairings

[26-Oct-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
once USDK is enabled for mm2, it is immediately tradeable for any other supported coin

[26-Oct-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
whether a specific GUI supports a specific coin is up to the specific GUI

[26-Oct-19 08:02 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm curious. What makes a stablecoin lose its $1 stability?

[26-Oct-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
in the event there is a sudden and rapid loss of value that isnt recovered and there is no arbitrage profits to be made

[26-Oct-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
in this case, the loss in the peg will be socialized across all issues evenly, based on the value of the KMD that backs the issued stablecoins (for that specific chain)

[26-Oct-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
as the trading value of the pegged and not fully backed coin reduces, the arbitrage profits will reappear

[26-Oct-19 08:04 AM] Privatoshi#9487
And it will rebalance

[26-Oct-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will automatically rebalance, though it could be trading at a discount for a while, depending on the exact pricing level.

[26-Oct-19 08:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Fall down to 93-99 cents

[26-Oct-19 08:05 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Then back to $1

[26-Oct-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
considering we have stable coins that are backed by some murky centralized issuers, a blockchain backed pegged coin will be fully transparent as to how much KMD is backing it

[26-Oct-19 08:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
That's key

[26-Oct-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to predict the levels in the case of a breakdown in the peg, which might never even happen.

[26-Oct-19 08:07 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Btc pumped earlier and I asked someone, so they print Tethers. But who buys Tether, how does it get into the market? Lol

[26-Oct-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems that tether is fractionally backed, yet it still maintains its peg, so maybe if the backing falls below 110%, the USDK peg will hold also.

[26-Oct-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
as the price falls, the liquidation is constantly improving the overall system balance, so a gradual decline of even 90% will still maintain the peg

[26-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Privatoshi#9487
How do you know all of this?
The financial aspect of it

[26-Oct-19 08:10 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It's a good thing for KMD

[26-Oct-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it is only the sudden and very large and relatively long term drop that will cause the backing to fail, which could cause the peg to drop below the $1. in which case, all holders of the stablecoin would proportionally absorb the shortfall, ultimately if what you use to back something goes down in value massively, it cant support the price of an external thing. even the bank of england couldnt maintain the pound. so the key is to have things degrade gracefully

[26-Oct-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i know all of this as i thought through how it would work

[26-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Well that's bc Soros was shorting it lol

[26-Oct-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and in markets the prices tend to be cyclical, you cant have the price quickly dropping 15% per day, everyday until it goes to 0. at least not as long as the project remains viable

[26-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Privatoshi#9487
So absorb the windfall

[26-Oct-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
with current KMD price at about 3x the BTC it holds, it really should drop much more

[26-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Privatoshi#9487
And gently move back to where you were

[26-Oct-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there isnt any strong incentive for anybody to sell KMD to drop its price as there are no ways to short its price currently. maybe that will change, but without a high volume shorting mechanism, it seems the price declines would be relatively gradual

[26-Oct-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
of course in BTC terms the price can be very volatile, but that is more due to BTC, if to look at KMD price in terms of fiat, the drops are usually temporary or gradual. giving plenty of time for people to add more KMD to their account or liquidate, which keeps the peg in balance

[26-Oct-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, people can also pay down part of what they borrowed to improve their equity, so that will also help restore the balance

[26-Oct-19 08:17 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Having KMD being used in DeFi, would lower the availability..
That is true, drops in kmd/btc tend to hurt more than kmd/btc

[26-Oct-19 08:17 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Although KMD has been one of the most stable btc pairings, on the market the last year, maybe longer.

[26-Oct-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and its USD price is even more stable. today it is down a lot in BTC, but in USD terms up slightly

[26-Oct-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
as bad as a long term 50% drop is, this is no problem for the peg to handle

[26-Oct-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
we could use some easy to use GUI for the pegs CC and certainly the prices CC

[26-Oct-19 08:20 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I guess you just have to look at it from a different perspective

[26-Oct-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
as a system designer, i need to design a robust system, regardless of if the prices that happen make sense or no

[26-Oct-19 08:21 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think KMD has plenty of advantages for DeFi

[26-Oct-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and recent volumes have been quite low, so it seems more bots arbitraging the fiat price and some miners selling than any large scale selloff. though over time, it does deepen the sell side of the orderbook against BTC. i think a coin needs to create its own demand to be able to rise against BTC. otherwise as BTC goes, its price is determined

[26-Oct-19 08:23 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I agree. You dont want to depend on BTC , for your price

[26-Oct-19 08:25 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Bc when it comes down from its pumps and money has been traded back out of alts, which resulted in a significant drop, you might potentially another drop, in btc pairings

[26-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Ethereum doesnt seem like it has a lack of bots

Not only has #Bitcoin broken out of its bear flag pattern, projecting a move to $6K, but the head and shoulders pattern that I mention was forming over the weekend has now been confirmed as well.  If this pattern completes it projects a much larger decline, perhaps as low ...
