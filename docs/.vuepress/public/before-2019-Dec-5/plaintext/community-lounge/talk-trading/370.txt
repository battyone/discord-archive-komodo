I dunno, I just loaded up a random alt coin - cardano, for a sample size of 1. It retraced 90% from the all time high, and is now 40% above it's bear market low. KMD did retrace 90% from it's all time high, and then it's risen 90% from it's bear market low, and now it's at about 52% above the bear market low despite the sell off spike from 25k to 20k and cardano still rallying strong. (Percentages are a bit annoying to talk about as upside percentages are always larger than downside.... 90% correction is like 1000% upside in reverse, I'm sure you know this üòâ  )

Within the bear market other coins have had nice rallies though. KMD has had choppy upswings, seems more of a persistent downtrend, but the lows have also been carved out better (started to find bottom sooner), other coins only recently made lows so they may be "less stable" lows. Other coins are more tradable as they are more liquid, so downtrend has had nicer upward corrections to trade I guess.

@ver_User thanks for your insights. I think projects like Cardano that are flushed with cash, will have a large following and large volume so they trade differently than Komodo which trades more on potential. I also think the recent run on KMD was initiated by one whale (I think it was an insider which I guess would be considered a good sign), with other buyers coming in because of expectations when a whale starts buying. In the end that whale created enough excitement that KMD is now trading at 20k instead of 15K which is fine by me. I think until Komodo comes out with something that creates excitement again (or insider starts buying again before said excitement) it will follow Bitcoin/alt-coin markets (more or less). But it has to be said that I'm a horrible trader so take anything I state with a grain of salt.üòÅ

[06-Jan-19 05:40 PM] ver_User#6608
well, seems I was a day early with the "explode" comment. Thinking KMD is gonna take a little time to make it's move, but I'm guessing this was the floor and it's time to buy the dip before fomo. 

interesting ETH seems like it's not buying it, maybe rallied hard enough already. KMDETH, it's time to shine üòâ

I think DigitalPrice will pick up again soon. Especially still being the only exchange for ARRR and other KMD crafted coins, it remains a technically dominant single solution. For that reason alone I think it will get good marketing simply by word of mouth. Also, KMD is about to bounce from support, which used to be resistance. A golden cross may be forming soon :treasure:

[07-Jan-19 12:27 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
Komodo has a plethora of fundamental drivers, soon to be recognized by more than just us.

I find the volume spikes on kmdbtc binance fascinating

[07-Jan-19 01:00 AM] ver_User#6608
they are so confusing

[07-Jan-19 01:02 AM] ver_User#6608
normally you can read a breakout, or a reversal, KMD has weird spikes all over the place, low volume strong trends, high volume in many random places not just break out zones or pivots, generally alot in the middle of this range of the last 5 months

[07-Jan-19 01:02 AM] ver_User#6608
trying to read whether the higher volume we saw just below this level has a lot of meaning or not, which it should in theory

[07-Jan-19 01:02 AM] ver_User#6608
or whether it's just bots going silly and that sort of thing

[07-Jan-19 01:03 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
if you zoom out to the weekly timeframe and add a EMA/AMA 50/200 to the graph you can see that  on a longer timeframe KMD is about to make a MAJOR move.

[07-Jan-19 01:03 AM] ver_User#6608
for sure

[07-Jan-19 01:03 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I think this is why the waters seem to simmer such turmoil right now

[07-Jan-19 01:03 AM] Zanzarismo#6500

[07-Jan-19 01:04 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
ohhh, yeah

[07-Jan-19 01:04 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I see. so it's just an inverse graph

[07-Jan-19 01:04 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah

[07-Jan-19 01:05 AM] Zanzarismo#6500

üòâ

[07-Jan-19 01:05 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
Yeah, things are about to pick up again REAL SOON

[07-Jan-19 01:05 AM] ver_User#6608
typical bounce off support, now we need the failure to make new highs

[07-Jan-19 01:06 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I wonder what will happen during the hours bitfinex is under maintenance tomorrow

[07-Jan-19 01:06 AM] ver_User#6608
I'm less confident it will play out soon as I hoped, KMD seems a lumbering beast, but when it starts moving it should be strong....

[07-Jan-19 01:07 AM] ver_User#6608
don't quite trust this bull move yet

[07-Jan-19 01:07 AM] ver_User#6608
but looking at May 2017 as a possible model

[07-Jan-19 01:07 AM] ver_User#6608
we don't need BTC to go crazy, just to continue as it has

[07-Jan-19 01:08 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
yeah, but if BTC can close above 4200, that may trigger a further catalyst

[07-Jan-19 01:08 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
and craziness may soon follow suite

[07-Jan-19 01:08 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
IF

[07-Jan-19 01:08 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah, I'm more in favour of lots of ranging for BTC, for now

[07-Jan-19 01:09 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
that would be preferred by many

[07-Jan-19 01:09 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
but who knows how it will happen, nothing is yet confirmed

[07-Jan-19 01:10 AM] ver_User#6608
did have 5200 as a target, but it's behaving very differently to expected, plenty of range to mess everyone up, stop them out continually and then decide

[07-Jan-19 01:10 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I think if we see Price at 5200, we would soon see 7k then after

[07-Jan-19 01:11 AM] ver_User#6608
5200 is the underside of a long term trendline from the uptrend

[07-Jan-19 01:11 AM] ver_User#6608
support becomes resistance and all that

[07-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
yup, and if we closed at that level it could signal a reversal

[07-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
and confirm the bottom

[07-Jan-19 01:12 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah, I was thinking tag that and then find the final low

[07-Jan-19 01:12 AM] ver_User#6608
but continually reassessing

[07-Jan-19 01:13 AM] ver_User#6608
I guess the alt selling here is gonna put some pressure on btc

[07-Jan-19 01:13 AM] ver_User#6608

[07-Jan-19 01:13 AM] ver_User#6608

[07-Jan-19 02:10 AM] Likewise#6767
Tuur Demeester had a good analogy on twitter as in BTC right now is like Windows95. Id that's the case we still have lots of good opportunities coming our way.

[07-Jan-19 02:13 AM] Likewise#6767
KMD price wise is not looking good. 1950 didnt hold, 1820 area will be next  IMO

[07-Jan-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In that sense of analogy, then KMD is still like a Linux kernel with bunch of core crypto-conditions consensus code, like the first few GNU programs for Linux kernel

[07-Jan-19 02:47 AM] Likewise#6767
That is IF it gets adopted

GUI needs to be easier, my mom at 71 should be able to use it. Well she can use a pc but couldn't in 95.
