[27-Oct-19 09:55 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I doubled down yesterday around 5300-5400 sats was very happy to get KMD that cheap

[27-Oct-19 09:56 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
If it drops below 5k sats I'll mortgage my house and go all in

[27-Oct-19 09:57 PM] Markus#5464
Crazy guy spoted ü§î

[27-Oct-19 09:58 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
100%  confident KMD will have an ETH like move one day ....just a waiting game

[27-Oct-19 10:00 PM] Markus#5464
I hope so too, that would be well deserved for all this years all kmd devs spent making all this tech and what is yet to come

[27-Oct-19 10:02 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
Yea I have no worries about the long term....i will double down again if we go 3k sats

[27-Oct-19 10:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
If you remember, Komodo did get a lot of love in a round of the Chinese Crypto Ratings

[27-Oct-19 10:03 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Chinese coins are pumppppping right now

[27-Oct-19 10:04 PM] Markus#5464
Dont forget that Redfox Labs is creating crazy things with kmd tech in asia as we speak

[27-Oct-19 10:05 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821

@BoBot-BUY KMD Monero on AtomicDex would be nice. They should talk to someone with KMD about getting listed.

[28-Oct-19 02:09 AM] bishop#9773
I think the KMD team has more incentive to get ARRR on atomicdex than cryptonote

@Markus I don't think @BoBot-BUY KMD is so crazy.  The crazy ones are the ones who sell their house to buy when it's high üòÑ

[28-Oct-19 02:48 AM] Privatoshi#9487
@bishop I dont doubt that. I never said that Cryptonote should be given any type of priority.

[28-Oct-19 05:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Arrr is superior, but could be a good move to add xmr to capitalize on their community

[28-Oct-19 05:45 AM] Don King#8901
Time to rebrand komodo as a 'Chinese' crypto

Yes, exactly! How can we as a community take advantage of Chinese President's recent speech to get some well deserved attention from the Chinese public?

If marketing really wants to add mandarin version of 'komodo', maybe just use the word 'Dragon' in mandarin

[28-Oct-19 07:52 AM] umitkara48#6464
Market green but kmd not

On that list they have Changelly, but despite calling themselves non custodial Changelly often freeze funds if for any reason their algorithm doesn't like something, same with ChangeNow

[28-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Flint#6435
this bitcoin transfusion into Chinese altcoins real dollars did not enter the Chinese altcoin market so expect a correction and komodo turn will also come when Chinese investors recall their Chinese cryptocurrency rating where komodo often appeared among the leaders! Need to be able to wait

[28-Oct-19 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If the chinese gov wants to have different blockchains for different services then kmd is definitively the way to go

[28-Oct-19 11:48 AM] Flint#6435
we will test the previous maximum and then everything will depend on customer demand and on the number of weak hands that will begin to get rid of coins at the next panic sale

[28-Oct-19 11:51 AM] Flint#6435
@siu - Chainmakers  the Chinese government will develop its own! And they will have nothing to do with the now growing altcoins made in China! Maybe NEO still has small chances to take part of the pie because there are influential ties in the upper circles and the rest will be forced to occupy the emerging markets of Asia

[28-Oct-19 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
KMD tech still makes sense if they want to make their own

[28-Oct-19 11:59 AM] Flint#6435
its indisputable, because then the Chinese would not have included anyone in the rating if the coin is of great interest to a certain circle of people in China and we should not forget about autonomous near-government persons who act as potential investors and do not report to Sin Jin Ping

[28-Oct-19 01:51 PM] umitkara48#6464

Reward after block 7 777 777 2 kmd

[28-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Privatoshi#9487
It's not going lower than $7k within the next 7 days, nor will it go over $13k.
That said, without pulling a chart, it probably found support from $9k to $9.25k, and 8.5k would make people turn bearish.

[28-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I'd leverage between $9.1k to $9.6k..
Bitcoin isnt super complicated.

Price goes up 40%, traders are very happy. Price stays same longer than 5 days after that pump, mood turns down.

[28-Oct-19 04:45 PM] jorian#4555
let's pump this up

[28-Oct-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
10k lets go

[28-Oct-19 04:47 PM] Privatoshi#9487
10k will be hard

[28-Oct-19 04:48 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Conspiracies aside, how does a 160B Market Cap coin pump 41%, in 24 hrs?

[28-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Privatoshi#9487
It is something. Being as it doesnt matter, now we see how hard it is to normally pump BTC. I think the Chinese alts will continue their run, and that's taking away from btc

[28-Oct-19 04:49 PM] Markus#5464
low volume

[28-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Markus#5464
like we saw yesterday NULS +50% and 250 btc volume on binance

[28-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Of course.

[28-Oct-19 04:50 PM] Privatoshi#9487
