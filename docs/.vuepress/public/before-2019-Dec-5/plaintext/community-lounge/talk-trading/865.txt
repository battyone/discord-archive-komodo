[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ive been through a lot of them since 2017, probably not very smart of me to hold through it all but it is what it is

[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064
probalby should have been 50% in btc

[27-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ah well

[27-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i know most alts are getting wrecked, its just the severe deranking relative to other alts that has me really concerned

[27-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
deranked 20-30 spots in market cap the last few weeks

[27-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
pretty brutal

[27-Jun-19 01:02 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821

Irrational dumpage. My fav

[27-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[27-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064
btc is an absolute monster now

[27-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[27-Jun-19 01:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
flight to safety, there is no time to read whitepapers. folks are just hedging against fiat

[27-Jun-19 01:14 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I'll ride my KMD bags out .... got plenty of time

[27-Jun-19 01:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

i think btc has a ways to go

[27-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Vertigo#0439
If it drops to let's say 7k alts will be pretty much free to pick

[27-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Vertigo#0439
Like a giant faucet

Blz sir

[27-Jun-19 01:37 AM] designer#4893
bitcoin has finality.
libra has no finality.
that's why bitcoin is so strong.

[27-Jun-19 01:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
if it keeps mooning etf's may be around the corner

[27-Jun-19 01:42 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
this def looks like a short term bottom on KMD

[27-Jun-19 01:42 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
low RSI on the daily

[27-Jun-19 01:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
either way all hell is about break loose.

[27-Jun-19 01:42 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
could go to 5700 sats though too

[27-Jun-19 01:43 AM] designer#4893
It is predicted that libra will already push bitcoin, which guarantees nothing. ostensibly, bitcoin, which guarantees nothing, should be worthless. but it is the power of bitcoin that it has value even though it guarantees nothing.

[27-Jun-19 01:44 AM] tolken#2655
@Sdunbar for as long as it works out for ya ðŸ˜‰

[27-Jun-19 03:20 AM] jspook16#3059
New kmd ICO price for the rebrand..

[27-Jun-19 03:26 AM] tolken#2655
Been here before.

[27-Jun-19 03:29 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Yeah weâ€™re just getting to ICO price for the rebrand.  New KMD, fresh start.  Fuck all the previous progress.  All KMD supporters rekt

{Reactions}
ðŸŒ§ 

[27-Jun-19 03:29 AM] Sdunbar#5064
its well below ICO

[27-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ico looks around 12k or so

[27-Jun-19 03:34 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Nice.  So glad weâ€™ve made so much progress.  Itâ€™s a common joke but 0/tech I shouldâ€™ve listened to ðŸ˜‚ this is just sad

[27-Jun-19 03:35 AM] richardt#2807
At least we're holding in USD... oh wait, it was $1.70 two weeks ago.

[27-Jun-19 03:35 AM] richardt#2807
At least we're holding in CMC ranking... damn, it was 45th place two weeks ago

[27-Jun-19 03:35 AM] richardt#2807
painful

[27-Jun-19 03:36 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Exactly.  Nothing like giving a release date of Antara and watching the price tank.  No more top 50, price bleeding in USD and sats.  No estimated date on rebrand release.  Letâ€™s just sit on our hands and be optimistic while constantly getting rekt.  Being a KMD supporter hurts my soul

[27-Jun-19 03:39 AM] richardt#2807
Maybe we'll see a strong reversal in July with the releases

[27-Jun-19 03:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's not the losses that kill you, it's the hindsight. you can only move forward. releasing dates and marketing isn't gonna do shit right now

[27-Jun-19 03:43 AM] richardt#2807
Releasing tech as promised that actually lives up to the hype would help.  But not sure what the chances of that are right now with the recent Agama incident.  I'm sure that was a bit a setback

[27-Jun-19 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Took me entire year to save up 2 BTC... sold them at 11k AUD... is basically 2x that now a few weeks later... Now that sucks.

[27-Jun-19 03:47 AM] grumpygoron#4320
@actionslacks itâ€™s not about releasing dates now, Marketing, or hindsight.  Itâ€™s that weâ€™ve had previous promised deadlines that werenâ€™t followed through on.  Or that we were promised updates last year with a rebrand then they swapped companies.  Itâ€™s being dragged along and trying to stay positive while the things we are promised just get pushed to undefined dates and we just have to sit around and hope.  Being confident that Antara will launch mid July is silly considering weâ€™ve never had a previous promised delivery date kept to when they said.

[27-Jun-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Antara is jsut a name they gave to CCs, all that is done works and is in the code.

[27-Jun-19 03:50 AM] richardt#2807
I'm more interested in atomicDEX and how that will pan out.  If it gets released in July and is truly user friendly like they say, could be a huge turning point.  But again, based on previous history, there's a high chance of it being underwhelming.  We'll see.

[27-Jun-19 03:52 AM] grumpygoron#4320
@blackjok3r so then whatâ€™s happening mid July??  Whatâ€™s the point of the date they announced??  Nothing?

[27-Jun-19 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats the hard fork. The release that went out contains all the enw CCs that have been being built all year.
