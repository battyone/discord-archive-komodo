How is it updating a coin like KMD?  I'm a developer myself, I'd feel so stressed out hah

[31-Aug-19 02:12 PM] Thievery#4576
I'm guessing just lots and lots of unit/integration tests

[31-Aug-19 02:13 PM] Thievery#4576
I'm guessing this is the wrong channel at this point üòõ

[31-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Markus#5464
its great that kmd started going sideways not just going lower and lower

[31-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully it soon turn into a uptrend

[31-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Markus#5464
also looking at weekly we can see that 7k sats look like its building a nice support atm, this might be the bottom we will have to see but its a possibility i think

so something similar to centralized exchanges

[31-Aug-19 06:54 PM] Markus#5464
they can use fake money to trade aswell

[31-Aug-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
or Tether, they can just print 100 mil, buy  btc worth 100m. sell the bitcoins at a higher price then they paid for it, cash out in usd and say that they have the cash backing the printed Tether

its interesting when alts just keeps loosing sats value when btc goes down and never recovers

[31-Aug-19 09:14 PM] Markus#5464
btc goes 9600 to 9500 and alts lose 2% and recovers nothing while btc goes back and forth ü§î

[31-Aug-19 09:15 PM] Markus#5464
i quess things can get interesting, some ppl say btc can go below 8k....what about alts ü§î  another -40% ?

[31-Aug-19 09:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
close to zero would be the end point i would assume

[31-Aug-19 09:24 PM] Sdunbar#5064
people assume they cant just keep goin down but i dont see why they can't

Dont mean jsut for KMD... for everything

[31-Aug-19 10:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Tether is liek the USD of cryto right? If you can print as much money as you liek, you can control the price of anything

[31-Aug-19 10:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
then make tether erc20 and use it to clog up eth's chain. It's a pretty versatile weapon. I'm sure there are some people who are enjoying this a great deal.

lets assume tether ios legit... What stops any certral bank just buying as much tether as they want?

[31-Aug-19 10:45 PM] tolken#2655
So crypto is just a scam.

the fact that tether's operators have been allowed continue this circus can only mean that some very well connected people are behind it.

BTC only stops inflation if it is the only coin ü§£

[31-Aug-19 10:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
well it's causing some cognitive dissonance in the crypto space, and people losing real money are starting to understand that even "real money" is a bit of a scam. So it's kind of doing a public service in a really sadistic way. much like xrp hodlers realizing that the founders can just issue as much as they want. hmmm maybe that's why people call xrp a shitcoin?

[31-Aug-19 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fiat be usless... you cant save it or  spend it

[31-Aug-19 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
put in bank.... lose money

[31-Aug-19 10:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
take it out of the bank and buy something worth over $X and go to jail

[31-Aug-19 10:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
yes and of you do decide to dabble in scary, dangerous crypto... make sure and register your addresses according to govt guidelines.

[31-Aug-19 11:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think that the general population is being dumbed down at such a precipitous rate that it's like a race to educate the masses before all is lost.

[31-Aug-19 11:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just gave them my drivers license and they have never asked me single question.... BUt I assume that is onyl to gather evidence for enough suckers before they shut it all down..

[31-Aug-19 11:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully they are too slow

[31-Aug-19 11:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and everyone refuses

[31-Aug-19 11:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean what if 2000 perople all go buy a $10,000 car with cash on the same day

[31-Aug-19 11:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just doenst work

[31-Aug-19 11:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
govt power is based on convincing people to voluntarily submit to govt control. all people have to do is literally say no.

they old "they cant punish everyone, because there wouldnt be anyone at work/school/etc "

[31-Aug-19 11:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but even at a school its hard to get ppl to just say "no we are not doing that:"

[31-Aug-19 11:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well you didnt go to school with me ü§£

There's always something false offered in return for giving up sovereignty like safety, security, moral virtue, saving the children. always.

I'm just trying to think of an elevator pitch for crypto adoption. I think everyone is really starting to wake up. but I'm perhaps being too optimistic.

[31-Aug-19 11:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
the philosophically inclined crypto adopters are being rekt by those who are only in it for the greed.

[31-Aug-19 11:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think in any case crypto is just a demontration that free markets really are a joke in era of fiat currencies

[31-Aug-19 11:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`Markets are too manipulated to allow average joe to become rich overnight.` 
Its much worse than this really... They dont allow anyone to even live...

[31-Aug-19 11:18 PM] Markus#5464
what if this is actually banks buying up btc to then dump and pump it to get all alts rekt until they control majority of btc supply available?

[31-Aug-19 11:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It very well could be.

[31-Aug-19 11:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think the goal is to crush all crypto. btc is just the easiest attack vector.

[31-Aug-19 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if "they" wanted BTC gone it would already be gone....

[31-Aug-19 11:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181

so what's the sentiment like in Australia? are these cash controls gonna backfire? you see any backlash?

[31-Aug-19 11:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
