Now a good time to buy KMD?

[14-Jul-18 09:32 PM] yorklab#7270
With the things KMD has planned over the next 6 months, combined with a possible bull run during that time and the Zilla airdrop next month I envy the people able to buy at current prices.

[14-Jul-18 09:33 PM] JimD#9272
ya, KMD seems like it has potential to be top 10 Blockchain

[14-Jul-18 09:33 PM] JimD#9272
only thing I don't like is Proof of Work

[14-Jul-18 09:46 PM] yorklab#7270
You would be hard pressed to find another platform out there that has all the features Komodo currently has. The only thing missing might be their simple contracts and that's already on Testnet now. Sooner or later there will be a catalyst that will get Komodo noticed by the rest of the cyrpto world.

[14-Jul-18 09:49 PM] JimD#9272
ya, I need to bite the bullet and go through the entire whitepaper but I am leaning towards getting in.  There seems to be quite a lot of competent devs and the discord seems very professional and no nonsense like some of the other Discords Ive been on.  Demonstrable 10K TPS is very nice also considering the Eth and BTC values

[14-Jul-18 09:51 PM] JimD#9272
ya, all the coins have dropped ~80% off their highs so this is probably the ideal time to accumulate

[14-Jul-18 10:01 PM] yorklab#7270
"Demonstrable 10K TPS is very nice also considering the Eth and BTC values".
I think it was 40K. But mute point, they plan on demonstrating much higher very soon. üòÄ

so it got up to 650,000 in latest testnet ?

[14-Jul-18 10:10 PM] yorklab#7270
If you change that scale at the bottom to the right time period, it looks like 1.2 million but that might be a simulation........not sure. JL will have to comment on that.

[14-Jul-18 10:11 PM] JimD#9272
ya, I saw that.  It looks like 113K is the highest that is validated but 1.2 mil is the current peak

Simulated over 1.2 million last night yes. No technical reason that cannot be achieved with real blockchains, but we still need 8000+ vCPU's to run that test, so for now we moved to simulated data. I have ran over 10 tests using 64 chains and achieved full blocks of single payment and 100 payment tx every single time, full test takes that and just multiplies the 64 chain clusters by 128, to reach 8192 blockchains and 1.2 million tx/s and about 8million payments a sec.

[15-Jul-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The first 64/chains will have explorer's and notary nodes, and are capable of cross chain coin transfer. The only reason for not expanding this to all 8192 chains is cost, just to prove a number, its a reasonable to prove that everything works for 64 chains and then simply do the tx on the rest of the chains as there is no reason the rest of these chains cannot be notarized to KMD using MoMoM and allow cross chain coin transfer over all 8192 of them. I don't see the real world using a cluster this big, likely things would be separated out more, but we are showing that this platform can really scale to infinity. A million tx/s seemed a reasonable number to aim for.

Would have been better off hodling the KMD though

[15-Jul-18 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
I dumped everything to buy BTCD which is eventually KMD and i'm hodling them

[15-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
