[11-May-19 05:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
I really don't have a clue on where to bet

[11-May-19 05:51 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Wow . This was quite unexpected..

[11-May-19 05:54 AM] 차미숙#8912
Seems like liquidation spike

[11-May-19 05:54 AM] 차미숙#8912
But never thought it would go through 6500 so easily

[11-May-19 05:57 AM] designer#4893
bitcoin has strong.

[11-May-19 05:59 AM] 차미숙#8912
Interesting world we live in

[11-May-19 05:59 AM] 차미숙#8912
Living off crypto for 4 years lol

{Reactions}
😄 👍 

[11-May-19 05:59 AM] Tek#5253
m still buying dash and bch instead of bitcoin

[11-May-19 06:00 AM] Tek#5253
though

[11-May-19 06:00 AM] 차미숙#8912
I didn't have any clue on where to invest after bitcoin started to have multiple babies

[11-May-19 06:00 AM] 차미숙#8912
But seems people love bitcoin and are willing to pay high fees if it goes higher

[11-May-19 06:02 AM] 차미숙#8912
I had this weird thought in the future where instead of people demanding increasing minimum wage, they would demand high fees so that miners can have their minimum wage on transaction fees

[11-May-19 06:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
charmi, get KMD to $100 please so i can try living off crypto too lol

[11-May-19 06:13 AM] 차미숙#8912
Living off crypto is hard man

[11-May-19 06:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i dotn care what btc does i just want alts to stop dying

[11-May-19 06:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[11-May-19 06:14 AM] Tek#5253

[11-May-19 06:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
Holy you scared me

[11-May-19 06:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lots of terrible projects too, but i have how everything goes down at once

[11-May-19 06:15 AM] 차미숙#8912
Alt has been since inception

[11-May-19 06:15 AM] Tek#5253
its a cascade of million dollar shorts getting rekt

[11-May-19 06:15 AM] 차미숙#8912
It's actually defending quite nicely than 2013

[11-May-19 06:15 AM] Tek#5253

if a big  shorter gets rekt its usually a big green dildo

[11-May-19 06:15 AM] 차미숙#8912
The btc dominance was like 80% back then

[11-May-19 06:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
there were less shitcoin back then, and there werent all these icos

[11-May-19 06:16 AM] 차미숙#8912
And then scalability issue came along and it dropped to 30~40% dominance

[11-May-19 06:16 AM] 차미숙#8912
And the scalability issue still remains, which leaves some space for alts

[11-May-19 06:16 AM] Alexfrog#1338
btc doesnt deserve to be 59.4% of crypto

{Reactions}
💯 

[11-May-19 06:16 AM] 차미숙#8912
About 50% is for alts to grab

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
It's just the nature of crypto

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
Btc has the highest network effect

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
And highest philosophical reasoning behind it

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
But all transactions cannot go through btc

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
It needs some alt

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] Tek#5253
i give btc 3 more cycles of dominance

[11-May-19 06:17 AM] Tek#5253
before something else takes over

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] Tek#5253
no one actually uses BTC to transact

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] Tek#5253
it does'nt scale

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] 차미숙#8912
I do for large amounts

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] Tek#5253
this wont end well

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] 차미숙#8912
Like 200k and over

[11-May-19 06:18 AM] 차미숙#8912
But small amount you're right

[11-May-19 06:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
I can conclude btc and alts are here to stay

[11-May-19 06:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
But i just can't decide where to invest

[11-May-19 06:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
btc: "totally okay to use as long as you are making transactions of over 200k" 😄

[11-May-19 06:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
Which is that million dollar question

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] Tek#5253
@차미숙 if you manage to buy the alts that will survive the next cycle, those are the moonshots

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] Tek#5253
KMD will be one of them im sure

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
research all the projects, spread it amongst the ones with good tech and not enough hype

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] 차미숙#8912
I do hold kmd

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] 차미숙#8912
I held from btcd days

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] Tek#5253
i only got in recently

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] 차미숙#8912
You guys held an alt for 5 years?

[11-May-19 06:20 AM] 차미숙#8912
That is not easy man

[11-May-19 06:21 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i havent held an alt or a btc for 5 years

[11-May-19 06:21 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so yeah

[11-May-19 06:21 AM] 차미숙#8912
I held ltc for 2.5 years

[11-May-19 06:21 AM] 차미숙#8912
Eth for 1.5

[11-May-19 06:21 AM] 차미숙#8912
All made money in USD terms

[11-May-19 06:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
In satoshi, it's no-one-knows territory

[11-May-19 06:22 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its only a gain if you made btc

[11-May-19 06:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
I think it's gonna be the same

[11-May-19 06:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
You could say that but at the end of the day, you need USD to pay rent

[11-May-19 06:23 AM] Tek#5253
reminder than in JAPAN you can pay taxes with BTC

[11-May-19 06:23 AM] Tek#5253
and rent too

[11-May-19 06:23 AM] 차미숙#8912
And only way you can make btc for sure is if you do an ICO

[11-May-19 06:23 AM] 차미숙#8912
Not so easy these days

[11-May-19 06:24 AM] 차미숙#8912
Or if you are Arthur Hayes lol

[11-May-19 06:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i hate btc for killing my alts like this, fuck that shitcoin 😄
