That move should coincide with a bounce off the daily 20sma around the 9kish range

[20-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
daily 20sma is around 9200sat I think

The goal is to bounce off somewhere between daily 20sma and weekly 20sma

[21-Nov-19 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which is about 9kish

If we look at fib lvls then 0.5 and 0.618 would be the once to look out for atm after the parabolic rise https://www.tradingview.com/x/JWEJWaHb/

@BoBot-BUY KMD dont know what ur talking about why would it be upside down

[21-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Markus#5464
If u draw fib from low to high ur looking for potential retrace target, if u draw from high to low ur looking for potential target for a upside movement

Another bear trap or going down for real? Hard to say at this point

[21-Nov-19 04:15 PM] Neko#5830
feels like bear trap

[21-Nov-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
at 90 exahash, what is the mining cost per BTC

[21-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Neko#5830
depends on the location

[21-Nov-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
with and without depreciation costs for miners

[21-Nov-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
say at 5 cents per kilowatt

[21-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Neko#5830
around 4k

[21-Nov-19 04:24 PM] richardt#2807
@Neko I'm also leaning towards thinking another bear trap with the halving in 6 months

[21-Nov-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
4K of electricity costs? what about depreciation of miners, is that an insignificant factor?

[21-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Neko#5830
I dont know, thats a number I read a while ago, price in china is around 5 cents

[21-Nov-19 04:35 PM] Neko#5830
seeing how much the hr increases it could as well be the double

[21-Nov-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, its old number? what was the hashrate at the time?

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] Neko#5830
around 60 ex

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
currently about 90, so 6k of electric costs

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] Neko#5830
almost breakeven

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] Neko#5830
that was in june btc network really is a monster

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
not much room to drop, and that is ignoring any depreciation costs, which i think are actually pretty significant as they become obsolete in a couple of years

[21-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Neko#5830
the halving should throw another wrench in the equation

[21-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I place the bottom mining cost between 6.3k to 7.5k depending on location. That drop to 3.1k for bitcoin in 2018 pushed out most of the old inefficient miners.

[21-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the typical mining hardware cost per bitcoin, assuming 2 year depreciation schedule?

[21-Nov-19 05:18 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Last time I checked on mining hardware cost was over 6 months ago so not sure what it is now but back then it was a little over 3.2k. Double that is usually where miners want to keep the bitcoin price at if they want to start another halving bubble to profit from.

[21-Nov-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so hardware cost of about 3k, electric cost of about 7k, or 10k per BTC... i guess its not sustainable this 90 exahash or sub-8k prices

Is Bitcoin Mining Finally Profitable for Miners in 2019?
Profits earned from bitcoin mining have seen a clear rise since the start of April 2019 and hit a near half-a-year high on April 15, 2019.

i last 6 months BTC hashrate doubled, which likely changes the equation significantly

[21-Nov-19 05:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hardware cost has dropped a bit recently by near half on the new BTC miners.  But still not promising unless coin price goes up a bit

It's official.

We are now in a Bitcoin Miner Capitulation.

The only question now is: 

How deep we go?

1/ The miner wallet net flows from September to present day, point to the story so far having been driven by speculation. Nothing out of the ordinary.

[21-Nov-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
would explain the price dropping as hashrate doubles

[21-Nov-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
which means after the selling is done, there will be a strong rebound
