_thinks @Hollowman9000 must be on a fork and that's why he didn't see the payment already_

hello with the discussion of talk-general where can i dump my komodo for LINK

[19-Apr-19 12:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
üòÇ perhaps you're not understanding it.  
Try reading it from the other side of the fence.   The team has had long conversations about oracles with some smart people.  Pretty sure link appears to be either centralized or trusted if you want to have "accurate" info.  

I am a mortgage service provider for 20 years.  My data is tried, true and trusted.  No reason for me to continue to be a good actor if I'm influenced by a large sum of outside money.

[19-Apr-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes having too much tech, better sell

[19-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Lamp#5829
yes, Chainlink is centralized.

What happened with cardano? Anyone knows?

[19-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Malti#3948
you mean the whole project, or the 'drop'?

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like there is drama in the community

Future of the Cardano Roadmap
The Cardano roadmap is changing. We will be launching an exciting new roadmap which showcases the Cardano 2020 vision after the IOHK Summit, which will be taking place on April 17-18. CEO Charles Hoskinson will outline this vision in his keynote speech and the roadmap will be...

[19-Apr-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like they decided to make a new roadmmap and push back the release of their blockchain? Lol

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They did the old "big announcement coming!" Thing and suddenly it became about them delayjng stuff

Joke is on the people who believe these scams

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Malti#3948
was/is cardano a scam?

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They even delayed the new roadmap lol

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
someone fat fingered on KMD a moment ago

[19-Apr-19 12:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
dropped like a stone

[19-Apr-19 12:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Well, its a multimilliom dollar ICO that has been around for a couple of years promisjng their own blockchain and yet nothing has happened

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Years from their ICO they are still doing drama about roadmap changes and delays and what not...

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing matters more than a good roadmap

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
working tech is useless

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Malti#3948
tech is secondary

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Malti#3948
lol

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
easy to use GUI, who cares

[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a nice roadmap!!

[19-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Malti#3948
where is ours!!!???

[19-Apr-19 12:45 PM] Malti#3948
:p

[19-Apr-19 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"Big announcement coming!" "We edited the roadmap, but wont publish it, nor our blockchain"!

[19-Apr-19 12:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
Hoskinson may have a solid grasp of math, but he is a capricious bitch, and as soon as something goes against his whims, he will throw a tantrum and rage quit- isn't this his third thing already?

[19-Apr-19 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No idea... never followed anything from cardano.

[19-Apr-19 12:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
also, having a good grasp of nitty gritty crypto math is not good enough when making visions become reality

[19-Apr-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Just saw a comment on reddit saying something about drama in their comminity and investigated

[19-Apr-19 12:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
harharhar.. drama-Queen, thy name is Hoskinson

[19-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I can not fathom how that coin is worth multiple billions and yet... no product.

[19-Apr-19 12:48 PM] LocoMB#8593
pink feathers, ruffled... much squawking and clucking... then he lays an egg

[19-Apr-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They raised about 100k btc man

[19-Apr-19 12:49 PM] LocoMB#8593
muh next bitcoin! don't miss the boat!

[19-Apr-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
funny thing is i didnt hear about their "ICO" until it was all closed

[19-Apr-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
seems only insiders knew about it

[19-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It's like buying into the future promise of a car that can drive forward when they already exist.

[19-Apr-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont care how much you know about math. If you have 100k btc you need to deliver

[19-Apr-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I cant even fathom all the things i could do with $2billion with komodo tech

[19-Apr-19 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I would start by doing guis for everything i guess... lol

[19-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Lamp#5829
what has Komodo achieved? No larp

[19-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Lamp#5829
i know it was well thought of in 2017

[19-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Lamp#5829
not followed it since then

[19-Apr-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You mean cardano?

[19-Apr-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Can you believe a project that raised 100k btc before 2017 bubble has not yet delivered a blockchain?

[19-Apr-19 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Even to this day they have a huge marketcap without even havjng their product ready

[19-Apr-19 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Wtf!

[19-Apr-19 12:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There is not enough time in a single day to hand walk you thorugh what KMD has done @Lamp - I suggest checking website documentation and git.

[19-Apr-19 12:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
From 51% attack protection, to inifite scaling, zero gas fees, on chain DEX and more.  Oracles, Custome Consensus.... Too much to list.

[19-Apr-19 12:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@Lamp  if you are serious, take a look at the sidebar
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/custom-consensus-instructions.html

all those things available for any one to use. no gas fees to be afraid of,  different chains for everyone

aeternity is supposed to have oracles in the protocol

[19-Apr-19 01:03 PM] Markus#5464
oh yea Coinbene at it again with their bots

[19-Apr-19 01:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@LeshAft9 - Zack helped create them but wasn't satisifed with the end results AFAIK.

[19-Apr-19 01:08 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I see. Not sure who that is but I wonder why it was unsatisfactory. I've wondered how they're supposed to work in a decentralized way

[19-Apr-19 01:10 PM] Lamp#5829
thx!

[19-Apr-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It was a three day conversation that was quite interesting.  The discussion of trust was big. Ultimately there became and underrating that trust has various levels and that there is no ‚Äúgolden bullet‚Äù to put the oracle discussions to rest.

[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
the definition of trust is a spectrum not binary

bnb is going parabolic for the past months

[19-Apr-19 03:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
'parabolic' if you consider we are still at a bear market lol.

Perfectly reasonable time for entry

[19-Apr-19 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

$BNB is a great case study on how hard it is to hold a coin that goes up 100x. The amount of ppl who said to short this, tried to call the top, FUDDED it, xyz ..... is honestly just sad and funny. The same thing will happen with your potential 100x, do you have the hands to hold

[19-Apr-19 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ride away, who knows when it crests

[19-Apr-19 03:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
XTZ is another case of study also

[19-Apr-19 03:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
pumping like crazy

[19-Apr-19 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Xtz will bust ETH before it pops
