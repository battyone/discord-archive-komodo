Whats up with the btc dip and the bch bump?

[02-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
bch is the "real " btc

[02-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[02-Nov-18 04:56 PM] actionslacks#4072

Doesnt BCH have 32MB blocks ?

[02-Nov-18 05:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
BCH is pumping because they did 700k txs per DAY 😂

[02-Nov-18 05:04 PM] snowdamn#2414
bring the scaling test

[02-Nov-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can upload a blockchain into BCH ?

[02-Nov-18 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with 35MB block it would fit

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
i love how you think, @blackjok3r !

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so apparently they are hard forking

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Is really the onle chain you can do it to without it being an attack'

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and binance is gonna support it lol.

[02-Nov-18 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hard forking a chai with that low hash rat is a bad idea

[02-Nov-18 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not like BCH cna get dPoW onto BTC

[02-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yea idk how people are getting hyped about  lol

[02-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yea they can get double spent easly no?

[02-Nov-18 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes and no... just its already a weack chain % wise of BTC .. .BTC miners can switch to it and cause all kinds of problems ... splitting it is not smart

[02-Nov-18 05:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I see , I mean they are really doing it so it seems they don't care about being vulnerable.

[02-Nov-18 05:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its already in binance support

[02-Nov-18 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it lies with the miners, hopefully there is one very weak chain and one clear winner

[02-Nov-18 05:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[02-Nov-18 05:34 PM] retto#3664
any guesses if it will dump immediately after the fork? me wanna short

[02-Nov-18 06:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
any guess would be exactly that... a guess

[02-Nov-18 06:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
normally coins pump during forks becuase people try to get new coins in case the fork creates 2 chains

I’m thinking once ledger release comes out, that would be one of the relatively safest ways to claim interest and have coins in cold storage

[02-Nov-18 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Using ledger on a new laptop once again 😅 preferably Linux?

[02-Nov-18 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ComputerGenie already got "hacked" and his coins stolen, because of freaking Windows 10.`
tbh, I think any version of Win would have had same results

[02-Nov-18 10:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as I can tell, it was a worm, not an outside hack coming in

[02-Nov-18 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
What’s the difference from an outside hack coming in and a worm?

[02-Nov-18 10:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don’t even want to think of all the dodgy torrents I’ve downloaded in the past LOL

[02-Nov-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think me and most of the newcomers to crypto and security have a mindset where if you don’t instantly get pop ups or slowed pc

[02-Nov-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then you’re “safe” and have no malware 😅

[02-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Close all ports and only allow comms over crypto ports?

[02-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Effectively virtually air gapping said computer

[02-Nov-18 10:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe

[02-Nov-18 10:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
For a dedicated crypto comp

[03-Nov-18 12:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It could be hardwired

[03-Nov-18 12:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Think same concept, just via 1s and 0s over a cord

[03-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If it’s not a valid blockchain operation, it’s simply ignored

also known as "fek, we didn't make enough money on this, time to stop that shit!"

[03-Nov-18 12:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Holy hell @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you were breached!?!   Shit.  None of us are safe.

[03-Nov-18 01:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts I did some dumb shit. downloaded some new torrents, got lazy, and didn't scan them before running (or at least that's the best guess so far of what happened)

[03-Nov-18 01:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sucks man.   Nobody is safe if computer genie isn’t.  Take care out there.

[03-Nov-18 01:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it all boils down to:
do dumb things, get dumb results

Damnit

[03-Nov-18 01:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What happened specifically

[03-Nov-18 01:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you care to share with the class

[03-Nov-18 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
near as I can tell it was a worm embedded in a torrent of either vmware15, acrobat, or winrar
I wiped the ssd, so there's no way to tell now

[03-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And this was included in the automatic update regimen specified by winbloze10?

[03-Nov-18 01:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, win 10 was a result of issues with trying to get an os that would run on this hw set up
I fell it would have been the same if I was using any version of win

[03-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How were you attacked

[03-Nov-18 02:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Torrent

[03-Nov-18 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think it was even remote access, I think it was more like
`if find(wallet.dat) then send_to(me)`

[03-Nov-18 02:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
obviously a little more complex than that, but I don't think by much

[03-Nov-18 03:23 AM] Jetter73#2234
The take away is, don't download torrents on a machine you have .dat files let alone multiple different coins.

[03-Nov-18 03:28 AM] Jetter73#2234
Being careless like that will have your funds stolen no matter the OS you are running.

[03-Nov-18 03:41 AM] Jetter73#2234
There have been people that have been running linux and downloaded a wallet that was compromised. So even though it is harder, i would never say it won't happen if people do not take basic precautions.

[03-Nov-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just use cli and compile from source

[03-Nov-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on linux
