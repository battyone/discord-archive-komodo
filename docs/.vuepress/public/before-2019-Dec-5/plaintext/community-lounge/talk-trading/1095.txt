Still waiting for 5k

What gets me most is that kmd holded so good most of this bear market. Then this fricken flash crash and no recovery in sight. it's not amusing anymore, if you invested a lot in 15-20k sat range like I did. So frickin rekt on everything kmd related. Almost -70% since june. Seems like markets don't even give a breather anymore.

[27-Aug-19 11:10 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
but of course I believe in kmd in long run. My friend said that kmd is too geeky for mainstream, just like linux. Great tech, but you can't make any money with it.

[27-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
@Deleted User yeah, I know. If you still have more money to invest.

kmd & arrr are my biggest bags. I also have 105 other bags. -85-99% with most of them. Doubled, tripled most bags at least two times.

I notice an increasing number of people that were bullish on alts are now leaning towards btc maximalism, myself included.  

I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this is a sign that an impending alt run is about to explode or whether the space is simply more mature and less naive.

@Patrick Friggens My average price is much higher than yours so I feel your pain. I have a friend who also told me "Komodo is a good platform but you won't make money in KMD" He kept trying to tell me over and over again to follow his plan....I didn't. He is now considering retirement because he's doing so well, even in this bear market. I still think when things come together KMD can take off though. I see big things coming related to AtomicDEX. My friend's timeline is simply a lot shorter than mine. üòÅ

@Patrick Friggens no alt season till New money enters

[28-Aug-19 12:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
this isn't rekt, this a surgical strike

[28-Aug-19 12:48 AM] richardt#2807
when rektseason over?

[28-Aug-19 12:48 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
it's not a rekt, it's a road to hell. What btc maximalists don't get is that if they only promote btc and not blockchain adoption in general, btc will die too. It's like watching ongoing suicide soon to be happen.

[28-Aug-19 12:57 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
maybe btc needs to die for blockchain to survive.  I'm all for it. Blockchain is more than just $usdt.

i had put crypto so far out of my mind in 2015 that it took me a few days to remember my passwords in 2017.

[28-Aug-19 01:34 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I capitulated with my shitcoins back in autumn 2014 and forget crypto for almost 3 years. üòÇ

[28-Aug-19 01:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
logging into my exchange accts after a couple years was a nice surprise. I thought 10x was a good profit to take, then it's goes 1000x üòÖ

[28-Aug-19 01:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
I dont think we'll see a repeat of that alt season anytime in the near future.

[28-Aug-19 01:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
too many boat missers waiting at the shore now

[28-Aug-19 01:44 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I mined some ltc in 2013 and various coins like doge and groestilcoin back in 2014. I still have a bunch of old amd rx 280x series cards left in my closet from those days. Maybe I should finally get rid of them. Sold all back in summer 2017. Sold some btc in before christmas to get by couple years and to this date spent all my remaining btc to alts. I've never used any fiat to crypto except my initial investment back in 2013.

[28-Aug-19 01:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
I've put very little fiat in since initial investment as well. maybe thats why I'm not as perturbed atm

[28-Aug-19 01:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
rode a couple of moonshots from nxt days, probably why I'm still buying jl's stuff.

[28-Aug-19 01:50 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
so if I lose everything, I lose it where I got my money in the first place. So in that sense it's not so bad. üòÖ

[28-Aug-19 01:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
well if it's any consolation, every alt is getting just'd. not just kmd ecosystem.

[28-Aug-19 01:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
and everything could go to zero, but as long as btc stays up, kmd can perservere

[28-Aug-19 01:56 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I don't put a blame on kmd at all. It is what it is. I've made many serious bad moves in this bear market. Like selling some shitcoins on huge loss and bought a lot of kmd and arrr with most of it. So it hurts a lot. Actually I'm on profit with arrr, but with kmd I'm down a lot.

[28-Aug-19 01:59 AM] richardt#2807
I spent most of 2015 and 2016 accumulating some alts.  Paid off quite well üòÑ

[28-Aug-19 02:00 AM] richardt#2807
2018/2019 is probably another good time to accumulate.  However, no guarantee of another altseason

[28-Aug-19 02:02 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
btc is great onvention, but in todays world it's a chain of endless bottlenecks. I'ts kind of sad how this whole industry is still depending on it. What other tech is out there that was invented over 10 years ago and it's still most valuable asset in the sector even when there has been a lot innovation since then?

[28-Aug-19 02:04 AM] richardt#2807
network effect and liquidity has a lot to do with it

[28-Aug-19 02:05 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
and btc propaganda.

[28-Aug-19 02:11 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I think btc is good only for network security and it's status as digital gold. Fiat is still the core problem of crypto and even more since the introduction of stablecoins.

[28-Aug-19 02:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
straight up manipulation, corruption, sabotage. the stakes are way too high. btc is not flying under the radar anymore

[28-Aug-19 02:17 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
it's a huge dilemma. Want more fiat or more crypto economy? We all are in this for the money and tech. How do we get around the problem of fiat? Btc maximalists are more like usdt maximalists now. It's kind of pathetic.

[28-Aug-19 02:18 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Imo btc was just an experiment , which now results us into a cashless society ... Fednow, China stablecoins etc

the guys the sec actually goes after all the guys who don't pay into the govt rotection racket. there are too many swindlers to count right now. it is a minefield. the only thing that is verifiable is code that runs. what one of the flagged accounts starts performing dust attacks on the network, all addresses attacked get frozen out of kyc exchanges?
