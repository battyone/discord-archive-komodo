I'll create a post on kmdplatform

[12-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Lumbi#8378
And to think I was bummed, when BTCP kicked me off their discord... the only other outfit that did that was PCN. 😃

[12-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Lumbi#8378
I wouldn't touch DAPS with a barge pole ...

[12-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Keppie#5156
Seems my crystal ball got it right, we got movement 😄

Whatcha think

[12-Mar-19 03:24 PM] jorian#4555
what is proof of protection?

[12-Mar-19 03:26 PM] Lumbi#8378
the shield and logo clash (too busy). I'd go with the a bigger logo inside the chain (without shield).

[12-Mar-19 03:28 PM] modereck#4269
I dont like the logo with the shield, remember me of PIVX

[12-Mar-19 03:36 PM] NNoperator#3835
@Draeth  You might have a more future proof design if you wait for the re-branding and incorporate those new features (whatever they are going to be).  I'm also still pushing for stickers and a place to store a private key so this can serve as a wallet.

[12-Mar-19 03:36 PM] LeshAft9#0083
maybe add a doge in there somewhere

[12-Mar-19 03:37 PM] Draeth#3300
Ok,  so I guess the consensus is remove the shield and make the kmd logo bigger?

[12-Mar-19 03:38 PM] NNoperator#3835
you could possibly fit private keys inside the octagon...  just saying.

[12-Mar-19 03:39 PM] Draeth#3300
Problem is, these aren't individualized

[12-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Draeth#3300
Even if they were, I doubt people would send their private key to put in their coin

[12-Mar-19 03:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
only the stickers need to be

[12-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Draeth#3300
... good point

[12-Mar-19 03:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
make them self loading

[12-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Draeth#3300
So, leave room around the logo to add a private key sticker in the future

[12-Mar-19 03:41 PM] jorian#4555
can't we put up some real KMD terms? like: `in dPoW we trust` or sth

[12-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Draeth#3300
That's a good one!

[12-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Draeth#3300
I like that @jorian

[12-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Draeth#3300
This is exactly why I keep posting these, to get ideas from the community

[12-Mar-19 03:42 PM] jorian#4555
and then the est 2016 indeed, to get some historical notion

[12-Mar-19 03:42 PM] jorian#4555
keep the 777 obv

[12-Mar-19 03:43 PM] jorian#4555
the left side is ok i guess, not sure what the rest thinks?

[12-Mar-19 03:43 PM] jorian#4555
what about those 4 or 5 pillars?

[12-Mar-19 03:44 PM] NNoperator#3835
It would be really cool (in the distant future) if coins like this had displays and bluetooth to serve as a hardware wallet.

[12-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Draeth#3300
I wish I had this kind of response several days ago lol

[12-Mar-19 03:44 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, it seems the bear is still strong

[12-Mar-19 03:45 PM] jorian#4555
btw, how much for a coin?

[12-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Draeth#3300
$21

[12-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Draeth#3300
Free shipping

[12-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Draeth#3300

[12-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jorian#4555
cool, i'll buy 3

[12-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Draeth#3300
Once the design is finalized,  I'll take preorders on my website

[12-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jorian#4555
if i'm not too late, that is

[12-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jorian#4555
okay great

[12-Mar-19 03:47 PM] NNoperator#3835
wish we could get something cheap enough to give away at meetups.

[12-Mar-19 03:48 PM] jorian#4555
it's real silver right? :troll:

[12-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Draeth#3300
@NNoperator PM me

[12-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Lumbi#8378
here's some latin for the band 😉 : notarius - tempus - valorem - gentium

[12-Mar-19 03:49 PM] jorian#4555
what is valorem

[12-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Lumbi#8378

i left a ring for a sticker

[12-Mar-19 04:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That IS much better. Did you find the stickers @Draeth  ?

[12-Mar-19 04:55 PM] Draeth#3300
Not yet

[12-Mar-19 04:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think anyone can print them and add them. at least the ones i saw.

[12-Mar-19 04:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok lemme look again, i did find them when i first considered coins.

Thats all I ever found, might need to get them manufactured then.

[12-Mar-19 04:59 PM] Draeth#3300
@jorian is that what you had in mind? (Scroll up some)

[12-Mar-19 04:59 PM] Draeth#3300
@Cryptofist yea most likely

[12-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jorian#4555
Yeah nice

[12-Mar-19 05:04 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Draeth  I vote for the three 7s placed between the Latin words.. and to make the rope look more futuristic (i.e. harmonious dialog with  the angularity of the octagon) and chain-like 😉

[12-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Draeth#3300
I'll see what I can do.  I'm gonna get what I just posted digitally proofed and then see what it looks like

[12-Mar-19 05:12 PM] Draeth#3300
And I'll work on a chain in the mean time

[12-Mar-19 06:07 PM] jorian#4555
so what is it then?

[12-Mar-19 06:09 PM] jorian#4555
true that

[12-Mar-19 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
```a digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract if, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts.```

[12-Mar-19 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
but it doesn't state ETH explicitly

[12-Mar-19 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
so this probably holds for dICO'd assetchains too?

[12-Mar-19 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
well the comparison doesn't really hold i guess

More and more states in the US are becoming crypto friendly. I'm hoping the SEC follows suit.
