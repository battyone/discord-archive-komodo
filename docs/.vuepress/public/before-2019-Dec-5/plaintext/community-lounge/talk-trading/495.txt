nice new avatar sui,  give us a longterm graph prediction without the noice please

[28-Mar-19 08:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
hmm, this move seems to be driven by bittrex not binance, interesting

[28-Mar-19 08:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
does that mean anything?

[28-Mar-19 08:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
(bigger buy orders on bittrex, higher up)

[28-Mar-19 09:53 PM] blubbi#0643

[28-Mar-19 09:57 PM] CoinKing88#1540

Its nice to see a steady climb (steady for crypto), not 1 big spike and then slow decline

[28-Mar-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no trading contest, no idea why they would fake volume for KMD

[28-Mar-19 10:00 PM] blubbi#0643
is their a site where u can see additiv order book of exchanges?

[29-Mar-19 12:47 AM] NNoperator#3835
coinbene is suspected of being a victim of hot wallet hack and loss.  Hope the komodos were safu

[29-Mar-19 01:27 AM] PTYX#6840
It seems it could only be the ercs @NNoperator

[29-Mar-19 01:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Today there was alot of volume from coinbene for kmd. Not sure if it's fake or real volume.

[29-Mar-19 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as long as weird shit like that doesnt happen on bittrex/binance I wouldnt be too worried

[29-Mar-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362

How much are cryptocurrency volumes overstated?

[29-Mar-19 10:05 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Real trading volumes, KMD one of the least overstated in volume

[29-Mar-19 10:07 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Not something KMD is responsible for but it shows that there is top 25 volume in KMD making it a more relevant coin than it would seem according to sites as worldcoinindex and cmc

[29-Mar-19 10:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`making it a more relevant coin than it would seem`
Is that even possible, though? 🤔

[29-Mar-19 10:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
people wouldn't be dishonest for profit's sake would they?

[29-Mar-19 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
surely not

[29-Mar-19 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's on the internet, so it *has* to be true

[29-Mar-19 10:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
Non-bizarro world valuation would be great for the entire market. The amount of power cmc and various shady as shit exchanges hold now is pretty ridiculous.

Komodo 14° by volume

[29-Mar-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and that doesnt count any of the assetchains

[29-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think it also has to do with the package deals coins buy when listing on a new exchange

[29-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I can imagine that for 1M listing fees they 'get' a certain amount of volume

[29-Mar-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, some exchanges actively say that they do that in their docs

[29-Mar-19 11:03 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Might be, main reason for fake volume is to look important and being able to ask money for a listing on the exchange

[29-Mar-19 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072

Bad morning everyone.

Junkie just made more money did you?

No? Kept shorting because farm animals told you probably.

They bring so much value to this space with their terrible charts and maybe up maybe down

Never heard of him

[29-Mar-19 02:22 PM] NNoperator#3835
Coinbase just figured out another way to keep more of their clients funds.  They will now allow institutional clients to stake their Tezos while still keeping it in their vault.  They get to keep 20% of your staking returns for the service.

[29-Mar-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
80% of staking vapor beats 100% of nothing

[29-Mar-19 02:29 PM] NNoperator#3835
i can see this working out  well in the case of institutional clients who were not permitted to have the coins staking due to risk mitigation.

[29-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I still haven’t KYC’d my tezos

[29-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
10% off current market rate for the Genesis info, think I’d get any takers?

[29-Mar-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
I used to hate coinbase, but I must say I really like their EARN course

[29-Mar-19 03:00 PM] Caglio#3337
They already donated me over 20kmd for my small but handsome portfolio.... ( :

[29-Mar-19 03:00 PM] Caglio#3337
On the other hand, they already took at least 100kmd due to their really big fees 😦

[29-Mar-19 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100kmd? I'll trade you, I almost had to pay $25k in taxes because of their shoddy reporting system

[29-Mar-19 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fekers even report losses as gains 🤦🏽

[29-Mar-19 03:04 PM] Caglio#3337
I still dont know about that tax shit, cos I never took anything out

[29-Mar-19 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for an ez math example:
if you sell $10 worth of BTC, take a hit and buy less back at a higher price, and then sell the amount for $8
they report that you made $18

[29-Mar-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not only did you buy high and sell low, you pay extra tax

[29-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Caglio#3337
So instead of being 2$ in loss, the report 8$ profit ?

[29-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Caglio#3337
Wow they are such a retarded mofos

[29-Mar-19 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yup, they only report the sell side of events

[29-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Like I said I really havent watched into tax thing here, but my friend explained it to me something like

[29-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Caglio#3337
If you invested 5000$ in a crypto over coinbase

[29-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Caglio#3337
And then you pull out your money

[29-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Caglio#3337
Everything over 5000$ is taxable

[29-Mar-19 03:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
*laughs in doorkicker*

[29-Mar-19 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, and reporting only the sell side is how they determine that "over" amount

[29-Mar-19 03:10 PM] Caglio#3337
Obviously they suck, I still like this Earn thingie however

[29-Mar-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
if they already took so much money, its nice when they give smt back

[29-Mar-19 03:11 PM] Caglio#3337
even if its like 10$

[29-Mar-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never looked at it, I use them as little as possible

[29-Mar-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah I fucking started with them, cos they were the easiest to start with

[29-Mar-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
However their fees are really big, I went to calculate it a big ago

[29-Mar-19 03:16 PM] Caglio#3337
And they fucking took a big big chump of my money

[29-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah I jumped off with them in 2013

[29-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now look at me

[29-Mar-19 03:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

meanwhile, ARRR is only at 800 😭

[29-Mar-19 03:25 PM] Markus#5464
how many ARRR do u get for 1 btc with current price?

[29-Mar-19 03:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
I think I will bolster my ARRR stash a bit eventually - price is too good, I paid around 1500Sat or so so far..

[29-Mar-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can get 1/0.00000802

[29-Mar-19 03:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
about 100k+ ARRR per BTC

[29-Mar-19 03:26 PM] Markus#5464
hm

[29-Mar-19 03:26 PM] Markus#5464
might have to take a look into that 😄

[29-Mar-19 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the math of 1 is so hard 😣

[29-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Markus#5464
is there even enough liquidity to buy larger amounts?

[29-Mar-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm sure if you set it, dumpers will dump into it 😦
