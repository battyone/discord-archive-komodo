I cant get my credit below 400 no matter how hard I try.

[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
sadly, i would starve with no bank account

[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if I told you that you don't need a "credit score" if you don't "buy" things you can't afford?

agree with genie

I never got a thing on a loan. not even one. I instead just don't get it than going to get it via loan.

[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
china is scoring everybody and people were outraged

[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
USSA gives everybody credit scores and it is ok

The best way to protect your identity is to destroy your credit score as thoroughly as possible

[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
an in case indirectly I had to get a thing via a loan, like my study. I paid it all as soon as I could.

[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm a happily loan free man. 🙂

hard to buy cars off the lot with cash.  they dont like that.

[21-Oct-18 04:50 PM] bishop#9773
said no car dealership ever

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah i noticed that. You dont want cash? Wtf

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
can only buy things that damage your health with cash at this point

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
what? you cant buy cars with cash in USSA?

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
@bishop  try it.  let me know how it goes.  you will get reported if over 10k

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] bishop#9773
doesn't change the fact that you can buy with cash

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] bishop#9773
or buy cars less than 10k

[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
Sales guys get more incentive to finance

[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] bishop#9773

[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`hard to buy cars off the lot with cash.`
I've done it since '92 and never had a single problem (although they do cut less discounts now than they used to)

[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
uh, well, i have kids.  not gonna cart them around in an $8k shitbox

[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
hard to find decent vehicles under 10k

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c even putting a Cash deposit in a business bank account flags a bank account.

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you are buying from another person selling their car?

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
probably be really hard to buy a house with (literal) cash too.

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
thats fine

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
people refuse if it is more than $10k in cash?

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
person to person is fine.  and lots of people game that system and put a lower price on the title transfer paperwork  than what they paid so that they get taxed less

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I deposit cash to my own business account. not talking about car example here 😄

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`probably be really hard to buy a house with (literal) cash too.`
Again, the only "hard" part is physically carrying it

[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
as i said, if you live in a country similar to meatspoon's, it costs less tax-wise to report everything, trust me

[21-Oct-18 04:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
they flag my account to be cash deposits more....

[21-Oct-18 04:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or something...

[21-Oct-18 04:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c yes, that $10k deposit issue.

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you drop 10% below asking price in cash on someone's lap they sell 90+% of the time

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's for them a trigger of AML and stuff

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
transactions over 10k get flagged for the IRS by vendors/bankers

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so people can atomic swap cars but not coins?

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] bishop#9773
lol

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that'd be so..... weedy.....

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
and even several lower level transactions will get flagged.  Yup, it generates suspicion if you make 3 deposits of 9k.  guilty until proven innocent

[21-Oct-18 04:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[21-Oct-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`transactions over 10k get flagged for the IRS by vendors/bankers`
Stop using banks 🤔

[21-Oct-18 04:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
kind of necessary for me

[21-Oct-18 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You live in Uganda?

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
in some countries it's illegal to pay with cash after a certain amount

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
USA.

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
and for businesses to accept

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
we be fucked

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] snowdamn#2414
haha

[21-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it was funny i read about canandian border cash confiscations, they just say the cash is guilty, but the people are not charged with any crime. they then dont have to worry about buying cars for cash

[21-Oct-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've lived from NJ to AR to WA and nowhere have I ever *needed* a bank account
What part of this story am I missing?

[21-Oct-18 04:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
Civil Asset Forfeiture.  terrifying

[21-Oct-18 04:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's called Civil Asset Forfeiture

[21-Oct-18 04:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
i collect rent from corporate tenants.  Residential, commercial, etc

[21-Oct-18 04:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
they dont want to meet me in a dark alleyway and hand me cash

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
My friend got his bank account closed. and no other bank is opening a bank account.
because some localbitcoin trade did not complete and someone reversed the payment made to him and he asked for a despite solve.
and months later he's having no bank account now at all.
😄

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and you're buying an under 10k car with your corp account? 😕

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
one of my buildings is owned by an S-corp for tax reasons.  gotta use the banks

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
He's forced to use cash.

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and he's feeling much better since then 😄

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what's the last year you left your mining rigs and went outside? 😂

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
heh

[21-Oct-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn about 4 minutes before I got the 1st one

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
so, 8 years?

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so those stories where they can just take all your money without reason, it is actually true?

{Reactions}
💯 

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] bishop#9773
To be fair, he sees sunlight when he goes and gets the new miners at his door

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems much worse than china

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
yes

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so, 10 years?`
Yes, I used the WLC bus to premine BTC

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
it doesnt happen a lot, but it does happen

[21-Oct-18 05:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, they can take all your money

[21-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it should never happen

[21-Oct-18 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
agreed

[21-Oct-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
everyone move to china where your stuff is safe

[21-Oct-18 05:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
often it doesnt.  TSA pulled 11k out of my carry on once and looked at it and put it back.  It is pretty rare that civil asset forfieture is invoked.  but when it is, it sucks

[21-Oct-18 05:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
government already has its lawyers paid, you have to hire lawyers to contest... can take years

[21-Oct-18 05:02 PM] snowdamn#2414

what other countries just take your money without any reason?

[21-Oct-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
bolivia?

[21-Oct-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
venezuela?

[21-Oct-18 05:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
probably

[21-Oct-18 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but those are the rules there you live by

[21-Oct-18 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because guys that live in a town of 30 people don't make 100k a year selling $2.75 sammiches at their gas station?

Sammiches are safu
