`But isn’t it still waaay better than the USD in many ways?`
So are cowry shells, but I don't see folks clamoring about them 🤷🏽

[20-Jul-19 01:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, the main problem with the USD is that it is printed limitlessly.

[20-Jul-19 01:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
Btc is limited. So it is waaay better in that regard

[20-Jul-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the main problem with the USD is that it is printed limitlessly.`
True, but when you compare that to the buy value of BTC rising and falling on the whims of 🦄s shitting 🌈s, it's kind of a semi-moot point

[20-Jul-19 01:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
Emmanuel, you are saying you anticipate miners forking btc and raising the supply?

[20-Jul-19 01:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
But people will still be able to choose to value pre fork coins.

[20-Jul-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The Feb isn't likely ever going to print or recall enough to where the $10k product you purchased yesterday is now worth $20k or $3k

[20-Jul-19 01:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
It would be a failed coup

[20-Jul-19 01:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 sure they are.  All fiat currencies end, many in hyper inflation.

[20-Jul-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
many are, yes
but the offset of new Socialist programs will eat up the remainder with numbers that only exist on ledgers and balance out the difference

[20-Jul-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
too much change in USD? just invent a roads improvement job market that eats up 4x what it actually costs....

Think about how well your public sector company would do if you told people that you couldn't reproduce something that you did 70 years ago "because we no longer have the technology to do it"

[20-Jul-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so, you see, the problem is not unlimitted creation/burning of currency, but who creates and burns that currency`
yes, that
The USD holds exactly as much value as the Fed determines it "should"

[20-Jul-19 01:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
right, and the FED continues, year after year, to determine it should hold less.  that is the only direction fiat currencies go in the long run

[20-Jul-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Pass a $15 p/h min wage? OK, we're printing more so that $15 now equals $7.75

[20-Jul-19 01:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
i get it.  i have a degree in economics

[20-Jul-19 01:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
what i am saying is that BTC is superior to the USD in that the hard cap cannot be raised without sounding the alarm about it

[20-Jul-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`cannot be raised without sounding the alarm about it`
Unless you wrap it in a "sexy" wrapper and pre-push the notion that it's "necessary" for longevity

♻ and now we're back to the beginning of the fact that reality doesn't change how people perceive the "need" for BTC to be "king"
reality now doesn't change their minds, what makes you think that would?

[20-Jul-19 01:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
when people criticize what BTC miiiight become, they are sort of ignoring that right now, in this moment, it is superior to USD in many ways

[20-Jul-19 01:55 PM] meatspoon#7860

right now, people are trading USD for BTC because BTC is better in many ways

[20-Jul-19 01:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure

[20-Jul-19 01:56 PM] meatspoon#7860

i think your points, genie, would be better received and not so argumentative if you acknolwedged that BTC as it is right now is a step away from complete communist monetary control

[20-Jul-19 01:58 PM] meatspoon#7860
the USD is essentially communist.  What is money if not the "means of production"?

in Communist controlled things, more than 5 guys control what the thing is

[20-Jul-19 01:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
5 guys control bitcoin?

[20-Jul-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The Fed 
Core
not much different

@Deleted User that wasn't "personal", economics is what gave them total control

not many econ courses teach Genie's Subjective History of BTC

top 10 wallets of komodo own 51% of all coins currently

[20-Jul-19 02:03 PM] designer#4893
the lack of market atmosphere despite the fact that bitcoin prices currently remain above $10,000 is a great performance on a price basis, shows how many people had a high proportion of alts. this is because the winter is still in full swing for some, depending on the alts ratio.

but like when, certain alts will be pump again and will earn a lot of money. because of its short history, crypto has few cycles to refer to the past and now faces a number of big issues, the assurance of what it was like last time, especially with regard to alt, can be dangerous this time.

I think most of the alts are going to be ruined in this cycle.

[20-Jul-19 02:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
thanks for the pro-tip, genie.

[20-Jul-19 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not "subjective", it's an objective fact that economics is what killed any chance of Core not equaling "Bitcoin" forever

time and opportunity are not many. now, in order to survive, the ideology of decentralization must be abandoned. we have to face reality. 

If someone starts to preempt the blockchain, the game will be over soon. opportunities won't come back.

[20-Jul-19 02:10 PM] designer#4893
humanity has no case of decentralization. 
the history of mankind is monopolized and concentrated in one place.

decentralization can be realized without calling for decentralization. we should be a little more strategic. just like Satoshi Nakamoto used drug dealers and arms dealers in the early days of Bitcoin.

[20-Jul-19 02:14 PM] designer#4893
the moment Bitcoin exceeded $1, Satoshi Nakamoto's mission was over. and vanished without a word.

actually, bitcoin had a hard time getting over 1 dollar.
$100. $1,000 $10000 was not difficult.
by the time bitcoin exceeded $1, Bitcoin had already succeeded.
