will nodl.it sell it ? Or from another vendor? Very interesting

[14-Mar-19 10:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Nodl it sells it direct  www.nodl.it - I haven't talked to them about marketing it on their site as a KMD ready product, but I am going to.

@Draeth do you have a coupon code?

[15-Mar-19 01:21 AM] Draeth#3300
@74D30 negative. Also, after you send payment and click place order, if you get an error, do not redo everything. It works fine but for some reason the payment gateway is spitting out an error. I'm working on it atm

[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] 74D30#6106
I will patiently wait

[15-Mar-19 01:23 AM] 74D30#6106
