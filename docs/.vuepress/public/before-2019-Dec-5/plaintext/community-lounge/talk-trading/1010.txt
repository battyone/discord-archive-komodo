Its no hope thats how market works

[05-Aug-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
they will make u suffer and give up

[05-Aug-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
to then make u regret selling

[05-Aug-19 04:38 AM] Markus#5464
just look what happened 2017

[05-Aug-19 04:38 AM] Markus#5464
alts got fucked up and then 300% in a couple of weeks

[05-Aug-19 04:38 AM] Markus#5464
doesnt means same will happen now

[05-Aug-19 04:38 AM] Markus#5464
but its a possibility

[05-Aug-19 04:39 AM] Markus#5464
its called shaking out the weak hands

[05-Aug-19 04:41 AM] Markus#5464
if u look at litecoin and Eth as example, their valuation against btc its not looking any better then what kmd does, u think those projects spend all that money to see their coin die?

[05-Aug-19 05:30 AM] Hermes#6934
I don't think a rebrand is what will drive the price action. KMD is based on technology but sometimes technology is not something that gives you money or value right away. It needs to be used widely.

[05-Aug-19 05:31 AM] Hermes#6934
and most of the services that make an impact use technology but it's the actual service the one that makes the money and it involves a business .

[05-Aug-19 05:33 AM] Hermes#6934
or a third party company that takes advantage of the technology and use it for actual profitable purposes.

[05-Aug-19 05:34 AM] Hermes#6934
so in the end even the logo of Komodo shares the idea of launching this type of entrepreneur project that is always completely independent from the main Komodo chain or project. :KMD:  üòé

Hopefully the projects that launch help the ecosystem...grow and become more robust.

It will rise once again. The tech is undeniable

[05-Aug-19 05:46 AM] jspook16#3059
@coingirl87 are you selling your kmd

[05-Aug-19 05:54 AM] phm87#7395
On which exchange (with kmd pairs) do we have stop loss orders ? Bittrex binance maybe

Everyone thinks halving automatically = new ATH like it has b4, but the thing they don't take into account that wasn't present during past ATHs, is the ability to short

White vertical line represents 1st time u could short. Look what happened. You'd be a fool not to facto...

98 percent of alts are and have been fucked. Sucks for most but is what it is. I worry about payroll for many cryptos, including kmd.

[05-Aug-19 06:04 AM] dan.#2473
Most are prob paid out vs USD values

[05-Aug-19 06:05 AM] dan.#2473
Of course this is assuming sustained all time lows, and who knows

[05-Aug-19 06:09 AM] coingirl87#6489
@jspook16 in my dreams i sell kmd in times of ath and  living on beautiful Island ...but in reality i have no sell-button and hodl until end

[05-Aug-19 06:11 AM] dan.#2473
Didn't you say you had 1.5m or something at the high

[05-Aug-19 06:19 AM] coingirl87#6489

This is the only chart that matters right now for $BTC

Break this trendline, we're back in business.

I think we get rejected tho...
