Meh I have a decent bitchcoin/alt spread

[04-Jul-19 01:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pump either/or

[04-Jul-19 01:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Suck the fiat in

[04-Jul-19 01:47 AM] meatspoon#7860
when is the fiat pump?  When will Trump say we are capping the USD?

[04-Jul-19 01:47 AM] meatspoon#7860
I have lots of couch cushion change that I hope to be pumped

[04-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Seems the Dems are the ones whining about libra/crypto

[04-Jul-19 01:48 AM] meatspoon#7860
dems whine, its their full time gig

[04-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

McAfee has his own penis/mouth issues

[04-Jul-19 01:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
The gap is closing

[04-Jul-19 01:49 AM] meatspoon#7860
is that a metaphor?

[04-Jul-19 01:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Either/or :abusedsmily:

[04-Jul-19 01:49 AM] meatspoon#7860
ah, i thought "gap" might have been some other sexual reference

[04-Jul-19 01:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[04-Jul-19 11:48 AM] Malti#3948
let's hope 😉

[04-Jul-19 11:48 AM] Malti#3948
it would be good to get to the 20'ish levels before antara kicks off

[04-Jul-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
I think KMD is a bargain at this prices compared to soon 😄

[04-Jul-19 11:52 AM] Malti#3948
I agree, have added to my bags at 11k sats so I'm a happy camper

[04-Jul-19 11:52 AM] Malti#3948
arrr is slowing down, I hope to see a big move soon as well. It sucks that P2PB2B still didn't go live with ARRR trading

[04-Jul-19 11:53 AM] Malti#3948
but well, better to test properly and avoid CB situations

[04-Jul-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`arrr is slowing down`
because only dumpers are willing to sell any volume at 50% reduction price

[04-Jul-19 12:09 PM] yorklab#7270
We haven't seen any whales around for some time. You'd think if the current price was such a bargain and with Antara launching soon they would be gobbling up all they can here.

I would but then you made some comment about regulating a DEX and I had to hang my head in shame

[04-Jul-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Tokenized DEX are regulated

[04-Jul-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Because they have several points of centralization.

[04-Jul-19 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Jul-19 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Bancor, binance dex, etc.

[04-Jul-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They call it dex even though we know they are not

[04-Jul-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And the guys asking doesnt seem to know the difference

[04-Jul-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`They call it dex even though we know they are not` that was my point 😛 :troll:

[04-Jul-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don’t rely on it

[04-Jul-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`A true dex must be like bitcoin`
Pointless, bloated, slow, overly expensive, and centrally controlled by 5 people?

[04-Jul-19 02:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
Well those 5 people are just market participants

[04-Jul-19 02:09 PM] 차미숙#8912
Big market participants

[04-Jul-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the devs are market participants? not according to them 🤷🏽

[04-Jul-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not according to the USD they get paid in either

[04-Jul-19 02:11 PM] 차미숙#8912
Well bitcoin is doing it's thing well so far

[04-Jul-19 02:12 PM] 차미숙#8912
If bitcoin did all transactions, there would be no shitcoin fun at all

[04-Jul-19 02:12 PM] 차미숙#8912
So why complain

[04-Jul-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all I can say to that is: 🤦🏽

the prophecy is coming

[04-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
might need more than 8 days tho

[04-Jul-19 02:20 PM] 차미숙#8912
A true dex has to go through a stress test where the government imposes a new regulation about making using a dex illegal and it has to survive that

[04-Jul-19 02:21 PM] 차미숙#8912
Just like bitcoin is going through for the last few years

[04-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Malti#3948
no @Cryptoon you promised 60k sats in 8 days

[04-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Malti#3948
so make it happen

[04-Jul-19 02:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
