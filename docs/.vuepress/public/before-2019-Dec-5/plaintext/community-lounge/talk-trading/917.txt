Perhaps we'll see more of Torsten after the 15th.

[13-Jul-19 06:26 PM] yorklab#7270
In fact, perhaps we'll see a lot more of Komodo by then.

[13-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Markus#5464
is there something what will be revealed the 15th that is yet to be announced?

[13-Jul-19 06:27 PM] yorklab#7270
Unknown.

[13-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Markus#5464
Ok

[13-Jul-19 06:28 PM] yorklab#7270
I wouldn't mind getting some nice surprises though. You never know.

I don’t expect a pump on the 15, but I wouldn’t rule it out either.

This marketing campaign is adoption focused

[13-Jul-19 09:28 PM] Malti#3948
Not coin holder focused

[13-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Malti#3948
So don’t expect pamps. Expect adoption and coming with that steady growth

Maybe it’s a K64 story. “Can’t talk about it”

Just scroll up or go to Komodoworld’s blog and read about the true KMD strategy

Just a few days away from Komodo's big announcement and someone just can't wait to unload. I will never understand this market.

sorry...

[13-Jul-19 10:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Lieutenant do you really thought people bought the rumor though ? 😃

[13-Jul-19 10:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Even if they wanted to get out, there would be 0 incentive to dump it like that.

[13-Jul-19 10:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am pretty sure, the market has not priced in the rebrand or the tech that we have, so cant exactly sell the news, if they did not buy the rumor

[13-Jul-19 11:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:2561_feelsevilman:

[13-Jul-19 11:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So if the news beats expectations this would be buy on the fomo

Not too sure what to make of that Siu

[13-Jul-19 11:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe i am biased, there is always that possibility 😄

[14-Jul-19 01:39 AM] yorklab#7270
There's only one reason people buy, but lots of reasons they sell, so it's hard to say why someone dumped at such a low price. A good chance it was at a loss too. Does not bode well for KMD at this point. I think the hack did more damage than some may realize (regardless of Komodo's amazing fix and refund), so the slightest amount of bad news may get amplified now.

[14-Jul-19 01:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hack has been forgotten about

[14-Jul-19 01:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Old news

[14-Jul-19 01:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is standard KMD dumping

[14-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nothing more nothing less

[14-Jul-19 01:51 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, could very well be true, and may not mean anything at all. Still odd that it dumps now though. Those dumps look ugly regardless of the reason.

[14-Jul-19 01:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Happens on paper thin orderbooks

[14-Jul-19 01:52 AM] blubbi#0643
btc made a fart

[14-Jul-19 01:52 AM] blubbi#0643
kmd smelt it

[14-Jul-19 01:52 AM] blubbi#0643
crypto is that simple!

[14-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m just waiting on other positions to move so I can start to transition back into KMD

[14-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So please

[14-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dump the shit out of it

[14-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Antara is scam

[14-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
No hope

[14-Jul-19 01:54 AM] blubbi#0643
who cares about tech if btc do a 600 bucks bounce

[14-Jul-19 01:56 AM] blubbi#0643
not my opinion, but thats what we can see since 3 months

[14-Jul-19 01:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doesn’t matter until it does

[14-Jul-19 01:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Same bullshit that keeps KMD suppressed keeps garbage like cardano elevated

[14-Jul-19 01:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think the 5billion in tether happened, people thought BTC to the moon maybe? 😄

[14-Jul-19 01:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But the 5billion was on TRON and was burnt

[14-Jul-19 01:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Come again

[14-Jul-19 02:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
1/2 million KMD dumped on binance

Bye hacker

[14-Jul-19 02:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably sold otc for cheap

[14-Jul-19 02:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Buyer cashed out

[14-Jul-19 02:01 AM] yorklab#7270
That's a good point, could very well have been it.

[14-Jul-19 02:02 AM] blubbi#0643
why should even a otc buyer of hacked kmd dump ?

[14-Jul-19 02:03 AM] blubbi#0643
that makes no sense

[14-Jul-19 02:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you bought it wholesale for 6k sats, why not

[14-Jul-19 02:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Especially if you’re already a KMD whale

[14-Jul-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Get 1/2 mil dirty funds, dump 1/2 mil clean

[14-Jul-19 02:04 AM] blubbi#0643
the same reasons why holders who bought cheaper dont sell

[14-Jul-19 02:04 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Instant profit

[14-Jul-19 02:04 AM] blubbi#0643
wait 2-3 hours  get more ?

[14-Jul-19 02:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Play fuck fuck games with the dirty stash until it’s so obfuscated no one bothers tracking it anymore

[14-Jul-19 02:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Clean

[14-Jul-19 02:06 AM] blubbi#0643
makde more cex acc and sell over a period

Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

[14-Jul-19 02:07 AM] blubbi#0643
in crypto u hold ur bird all the time in hand until a hacker comes along

[14-Jul-19 02:07 AM] blubbi#0643
thats the sense of it

[14-Jul-19 02:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
>be sketchy whale
>be contacted by hacker, wants to offload stash, knows it’ll take work to clean it, offers it half price just to get out before big daddy BTC thunder rapes the altverse again 
>whale dumps equal amount of clean stash to recoup purchase funds + profit

[14-Jul-19 02:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No way the hacker would just dump their 700k, one report and 80% of their gain would be stuck
