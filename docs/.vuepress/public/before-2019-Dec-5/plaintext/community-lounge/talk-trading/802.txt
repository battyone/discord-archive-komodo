[21-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
yeah they don't like it when you speak the truth

[21-Jun-19 08:52 PM] allbits#5898
Then why did they ban you. You're mostly delusional

[21-Jun-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought when they announced the decentralized coordinator, it was being released and not just a whitepaper

[21-Jun-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but it was a nice pump relative to KMD value

[21-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Tek#5253
well I bought somwhere mid that pump

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
crazy

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
and sold after I got kicked for speaking the truth

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the horrible truth?

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
it went down more

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
that IOTA shouldn't be in the top 100 in this state

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
theres aslo many stories about the foundation freezing and stealing funds even

[21-Jun-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
very shitty

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
also many people lost their funds trying to send transactions

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i just felt very lucky i was able to finally get the sends to be confirmed

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and nothing got stolen

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
this other dude in the chat told me he recently got a transaction through that was sent 3 months ago

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
by the foundation or hackers

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
I wanted to test the wallet and the coin but I decided to just sell everything after they muted me

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
its still going down in sats

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
it should leave the top 50 atleast

[21-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
IDIOTAAAAAAAAAA

[21-Jun-19 08:58 PM] actionslacks#4072

[21-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant believe sheinier(?) is their ceo or whatever

[21-Jun-19 08:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
i had a bunch of jinn back in the day

[21-Jun-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
he couldnt deliver a gui for instantdex

[21-Jun-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
was only able to clone the NXT AE

[21-Jun-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
> gui. 
Even I can do that, and im by no means a talented specialist.  ðŸ˜„

[21-Jun-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
CfB is a real talent and he taught me a lot, but i think he chose the wrong people to work with

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
hm

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c opinion on nano

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
its like an IOTA but for the people

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
dubious about their consensus algo

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
just dpos

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but that doesnt seem to matter

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
or thats what they say

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
haven't really looked deep into it

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
nano, i thought made each address keep track of itself

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
its blazing fast tho

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
haven't seen anything faster

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i never could understand how they prevent cheating

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
they make the sender do some pow

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
above 9900 again

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
same like IOTA

[21-Jun-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
if the sender is a spammer they increase the pow that needs to done

[21-Jun-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but who validates the history?

[21-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
51% of the voting weight

[21-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
you have to delegate your nano to someone

[21-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
they have representatives

[21-Jun-19 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at 1 min chat, which hill it has painted?

[21-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
you have to send one nano to a representative / node runner

[21-Jun-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a PoS chain that gets centralized to big nodes that need to validate the history. it just seemed to have potential problems. anonymint tore it apart, didnt seem to like it at all

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜¸ 

[21-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
to "vote for him"

[21-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
you get that nano back

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
i thought

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they change to a dPoS model

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but its the ETH for china right? what can go wrong, go all in!

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
yea its dPoS

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
no actually

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
nano does not have smart contracts

[21-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
its not the plan to have them either

[21-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
it just wants to be the fasstest transfer

[21-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
and they are, ive tested a lot of coins

[21-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253

Crypto Analyst: After $10,000, Bitcoin Price Will Never Again Trad...
While it was only a little more than six months ago that Bitcoin price was trading in the low $3,000s, where it set its bear market bottom and multi-year low, already the crypto asset is trading at over three times the value it was such a short time ago. With such rapid growt...

[21-Jun-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
that is my feeling too, this 10k is the last stand . of the bears

[21-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Tek#5253
You have to be relatively rich now to be able to buy a bitcoin

[21-Jun-19 09:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for *a* bitcoin yes, for mili-bitcoin, no ðŸ˜‰

[21-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Tek#5253
if bitcoin is succesful

[21-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Tek#5253
people will kill for 0.01 btc in the future

[21-Jun-19 09:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will be treated as success, for some decades

[21-Jun-19 09:21 PM] cascrypto#8206
Will alts join or are we dreaming :troll_thuglife:

[21-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Tek#5253
i fucking hope so

[21-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Tek#5253
but history teaches that alts will suffer until btc reaches its top, or when btc goes sideways alts also boom

[21-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
safe bets are large cap coins with many markets

[21-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
ETH is pretty safe

[21-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
the ones that can potentially dump the worst are those that are not widespread available

[21-Jun-19 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
anything below the top 100 is very risky

[21-Jun-19 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
and sitll many of the top 100 will not make it

[21-Jun-19 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
namecoin
feathercoin
paycoin
counterparty
...
few of some I remember from top 10 or top 20 coins of coinmarketcap, not so many years ago ðŸ˜„

[21-Jun-19 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no existence of assets class tokens on coinmarketcap at that time

[21-Jun-19 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only pure forks or modified forks of bitcoin ðŸ˜…

[21-Jun-19 09:33 PM] dan.#2473
^ theyre all rank 200-600 now . or gone

[21-Jun-19 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
exactly my point

[21-Jun-19 09:34 PM] dan.#2473
crazy

[21-Jun-19 09:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ones we have on top 10 or top 20, that's not a certain list of always to be top

[21-Jun-19 09:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
namecoin was amazing idea when it started, and it actually still is, but market and demand and dev progress on solutions.... and many other things I don't know about this project.... it's nowhere now.

[21-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
