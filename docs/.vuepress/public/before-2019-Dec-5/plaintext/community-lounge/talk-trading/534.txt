Then keep zooming out

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
which sites chart?

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Looking at blockfolio

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No matter what zoom

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, they weren't on cmc last i checked

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs always a downslope

[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pretty neat effect

I heard they added 2.5GB to their blockchain in 1 *week*

[11-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
lulz

[11-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sustainable

[11-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Secure

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
so not only are they burning BTC, they will run out of HD space soon enough

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vbk

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where‚Äôs our resident 51%er

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He still around?

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
130GB/year at that rate, but it grows linearly with more people using VBK

[11-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Got a job for him :abusedsmily:

[11-Apr-19 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
VBK chain will take more space than BTC chain in about 2 years or so

[11-Apr-19 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
now that is innovation

[11-Apr-19 04:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt know what to make of trash talking it

[11-Apr-19 04:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Almost feels bad

[11-Apr-19 04:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Like picking on a special-needs kid

[11-Apr-19 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto where did you hear that? This is their mainnet chain?

[11-Apr-19 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright yes, in their discord

[11-Apr-19 04:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
i lurk in their discord, and read it when i feel existential pain

[11-Apr-19 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
why is it so bloated?

[11-Apr-19 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are notarizing xtns, not blocks

[11-Apr-19 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's insanely less efficient than DPoW

[11-Apr-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
I gave a half-assed explanation of what LABS is in their off-topic channel the other day. I was explaining that it's possible to use dpow without a "permit" from KMD. Probably blew their minds when i said it costs 1 KMD/day/chain üòÇ

[11-Apr-19 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
their entire coin is based on making it seem like they need lots of BTC, so they can sucker even more people out of money to invest in them

FPGA miners selling

[11-Apr-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
their profit calculators promised them $20/day or more, they all mined it

[11-Apr-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
now they dump dump dump before they are last to dump at new ATL's

[11-Apr-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
OTC buyers bought at 5 cents, dont forget

[11-Apr-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and all the testnet miners with 50 million mined

[11-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The coinomat swap from Sasha is still a bust which is no surprise. He's going to act like he never said anything about it. It is also why I completely ignore anything that Waves does.

[11-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sucks for holders

[11-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sorry you‚Äôre stuck with it

[11-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn‚Äôt feel bad dumping what was left of my waves when I did

[11-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They have some thing launching don‚Äôt they?

[11-Apr-19 05:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sputnik or something

[11-Apr-19 05:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
they call it VOSTOK - means east in russian it seems.. let's see what comes of it, it is sort of private/puboic thing similar to what NEM did

[11-Apr-19 05:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Once the dumpers are satisfied vbk might find a bottom

[11-Apr-19 05:34 PM] LocoMB#8593
the dual strategy: rope in large players with a private acceess, and hope for spillover and drag effects on the pubic part

[11-Apr-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as volumes hold up, if not, then the daily 10BTC cost will be a pretty large sell pressure to overcome

[11-Apr-19 05:35 PM] LocoMB#8593
or rather- VOSTOK was open for investment, only demanding a minimum of $500k investment ... hahaha looks like Sasha was rwally annyoed with lunch money investors whining about late moonshot

[11-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Buy more kmd or buy rfox tomorrow ?

[11-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if you couldn‚Äôt buy both what would you recommend ?

[11-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
In all seriousness

[11-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Thinking about throwing 1k into it

[11-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Not much but it‚Äôs what I can afford

[11-Apr-19 06:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What is rfox

[11-Apr-19 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
benny's side project

[11-Apr-19 06:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
RedFox labs

[11-Apr-19 06:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
IEO tomorrow

[11-Apr-19 06:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just wondering ..

[11-Apr-19 06:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
to me RFOX ieo might make you quick money, but it seems the whole point is to promote KMD

[11-Apr-19 06:08 PM] Alecandro#1179
soooo

[11-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Alecandro#1179
that's the way I understand it

[11-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Alecandro#1179
from what I've read

[11-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Yes , thats the way I see it too

[11-Apr-19 06:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
its a komodo marketing company

[11-Apr-19 06:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
I love it

[11-Apr-19 06:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
KMD team wasn't joking around in 2017/2018 when they said once we finish building the car's engine, we will focus on selling the car

[11-Apr-19 06:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
Well here it is

similar concept

[11-Apr-19 06:15 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yes of course

[11-Apr-19 06:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Was the million tps test still going down?

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúBuilt the cars engine‚Äù

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
we are waiting on external parties for that

[11-Apr-19 06:36 PM] Alecandro#1179
is that in conjunction with AWS?

[11-Apr-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if i am allowed to say

[11-Apr-19 06:42 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
A clever way of saying yes :)

[11-Apr-19 06:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Maybe

[11-Apr-19 07:10 PM] richardt#2807
@jl777c  aren't you allowed to say anything you want? üòÉ

[11-Apr-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but maybe i get in trouble

I highly doubt anyone here can fault you for saying anything

[11-Apr-19 07:12 PM] richardt#2807
but yes, don't want you to get in trouble either

[11-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Some old chatter about AWS meetings in the scalability channel

[11-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
AWS internally is a herd of cats

[11-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
so scheduling delays don‚Äôt surprise me

[11-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs probably missing an approver who changed positions long ago or has an email that got buried by their notifications insanity or an old trouble ticket with the wrong parties copied etc

Wonder if his deadman switches will activate for the insurance files

[11-Apr-19 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The extradition treaty says that he is facing maximum  5 years sentence

[11-Apr-19 09:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is quite low for being stuck 7 years in the embassy

[11-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
will he survive in the prison though
