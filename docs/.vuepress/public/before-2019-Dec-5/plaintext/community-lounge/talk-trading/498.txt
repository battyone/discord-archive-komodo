[29-Mar-19 08:57 PM] Caglio#3337

This is a biggie

[30-Mar-19 12:24 AM] Markus#5464
btc is mad

[30-Mar-19 12:31 AM] PHBA2061#2530
same for eth

[30-Mar-19 12:32 AM] Markus#5464
so we broke 4.1k as of now...lets see if it reaches 4.2k and pushes through it

[30-Mar-19 12:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
4.1k vs 4k is nothing, the btc price is meaninglessly low if its in the 4 digits

[30-Mar-19 12:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
literally the only thing its movements do is fuck alts, if it moves either up OR down

[30-Mar-19 01:53 AM] blubbi#0643
let's hope not today, kmd should close month above 26,8k

[30-Mar-19 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the btc price is meaninglessly low if its in the 4 digits`
said every delusional fanboy ever

[30-Mar-19 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ $4100, 10+% of the price is based on nothing but unicorn farts and rainbows

[30-Mar-19 02:02 AM] blubbi#0643
may i got something wrong, but why should i sell my alt against btc if i see btc rising?  it only make sense if i doubt BTC high

[30-Mar-19 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks BTC is the "alt", so he doesn't have an answer as to why you'd sell a good coin for a shit coin, "rising" or not_

[30-Mar-19 02:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[30-Mar-19 02:05 AM] blubbi#0643
i expected something like that from  u 😄

[30-Mar-19 02:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sell after the start of the rise and buy back when opposing pair half starts to slide
no matter what your pair

[30-Mar-19 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
remember, you're not "selling CoinX for BTC", you're "buying BTC with CoinX"
so your faith has to be in BTC, not CoinX

[30-Mar-19 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you buy and sell the base

[30-Mar-19 02:11 AM] blubbi#0643
as long as most alt only got btc pair, alt "value" will rise aswell, only if i think btc will go back down it make sense, to sell alt vs btc so sell btc vs "stable coin"

[30-Mar-19 02:11 AM] blubbi#0643
to buy back btc cheaper

[30-Mar-19 02:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's not to mention that there's 3 sides to KMD/BTC and not 2

[30-Mar-19 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as long as most alt ...`
As long as you use the term "alt", you're doomed to worship god-BTC

[30-Mar-19 02:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` alt "value" will rise aswell,`
and that's not always true either, many of us made a killing when BTC slid like the rock it is and better coins rose

[30-Mar-19 02:14 AM] blubbi#0643
im not in philosophic mood right now, just using the "common" used headlines

[30-Mar-19 02:14 AM] blubbi#0643
alts...

[30-Mar-19 02:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, the headlines written by BTC maximalists do tend to use that pejorative; either you break the cycle or you follow like a lemming (in the latter case I suggest USD and municipal bonds)

[30-Mar-19 02:18 AM] blubbi#0643
if one alt only got btc pair, "value" will rise with btc, "value" of that coin only will decrease if someone selling that coin vs btc  and that to me only make sense if i believe i can buy back btc cheaper after

[30-Mar-19 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that only makes sense if you don't want that coin and you want BTC to be the value leader

[30-Mar-19 02:20 AM] blubbi#0643
thats the point, but i only hold that coin cous im promising more revenue "fiat" as from btc

[30-Mar-19 02:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`im promising more revenue "fiat"`
fek fiat, this is crypto

[30-Mar-19 02:22 AM] blubbi#0643
non philosophic theme

[30-Mar-19 02:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
here's a novel idea: use crypto**currency** as currency...

[30-Mar-19 02:22 AM] blubbi#0643
tell that my lessor 😄

[30-Mar-19 02:24 AM] blubbi#0643
as long as i cant pay my food, flat, taxes its an philosophical argue

[30-Mar-19 02:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what are these "taxes" thing? :troll:

[30-Mar-19 02:26 AM] blubbi#0643
im not paying one, so i cant tell u

[30-Mar-19 02:26 AM] Caglio#3337
We shall not pay taxes

[30-Mar-19 02:26 AM] blubbi#0643
just thought of basic needs

[30-Mar-19 02:27 AM] jspook16#3059
Can you tax a tax?

[30-Mar-19 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Can you tax a tax?`
In the US they can and do

[30-Mar-19 02:29 AM] blubbi#0643
unbelievable marcet dynamics fucks my brain more than quantendynamic 😅

[30-Mar-19 02:30 AM] blubbi#0643
im back in mine world xD

[30-Mar-19 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
market dynamics is simple:
unicorn farts and rainbows = BTC rise
a good dose of reality = BTC fall

[30-Mar-19 02:31 AM] blubbi#0643
sure half is psychology not a rational thing

[30-Mar-19 02:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and if you think that feks your brain, just chew on the fact that nearly all maximalists want to be in a constant state of having BTC both regulated and free from regulations

[30-Mar-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
now that veriblock will create a fee market, blockstream strategy to push people to LN will finally work!

Analysis Shows Lightning Network Suffers From Trust Issues Exacerb...
The Lightning Network has been touted as the scaling solution for the BTC network. However, the solution is heavily criticized for many reasons.
https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lncovr.jpg

[30-Mar-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
" the problems associated with the trust issue and micropayments are well known. At the time of writing, the dust threshold is less than 600 satoshis which means if fees were to spike considerably again, the Lightning Network wouldn’t be a feasible option"

[30-Mar-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
so demand for LN is when BTC fees are expensive, but if that is the case LN becomes a trusted service, not trustless. Why the maximalists are relying on LN, it is a mystery.
