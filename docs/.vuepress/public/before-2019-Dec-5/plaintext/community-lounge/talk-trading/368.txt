I don't know if it's going lower, but that run before was basically initiated by one person. With low volume it is easy to manipulate if you have more than a few bitcoin. The market may be waiting for Komodo to make the next move now.

Of course if someone want's to manipulate the price back up again that would be fine with me.🙂

`Are we not all on the same team we all want the best thing for komodo. So I really don't understand the conflict.`
I don't understand it either, @hastrup; especially since the wallet that that he's butthurt about isn't even by or involving anyone in this community. From what I gather, there's a loose association between the wallet and 1 or 2 people but it was more that they wanted options for the community than particular "ties" to that wallet. Like I said, this is about far more than a mention in a file and *maybe* someday he'll tell us what he's __really__ mad about....

[05-Jan-19 02:08 AM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 don't under play the claim ledger option it have been a request from the community for very long time. You both have said some horrible thing to each other. I just don't get how it went this far. When we all what the best for kmd Sui was flabbergasted that there where any drama. As I know it this community is fact based we don't speculates we producers and help each other. I say we but I can't code or do marketing. But we all want the same thing kmd to make it. I have a whole monolog but I can't translate it. But as Google say "don't be evil" like they even try not the point. All have a great evening good day

Yes sure.

[05-Jan-19 08:23 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so now it should be clear that if your code can be copy-pasted then first you need to get funds to get paid not to feel abused. And so thre must be a group interested in such code. If there is not big enough group there will be no funding. How many people use ledger with Agama? Personally I use Agama on a PC so I see it mostly beneficial to Ledger, not to KMD, as it makes Ledger product better, Agama is good on all default machines.

It's nice to see that I'm not alone in that

I think the fucking  magnum wallet dev is a giant a-hole

[05-Jan-19 10:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
fuck that dude

[05-Jan-19 10:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm not using his closed source bullshit

[05-Jan-19 10:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
even after he declared his coding superiority he went back and asked for help

[05-Jan-19 10:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
I know english is not his original language but I just wanna say, put up some code, or go the fuck away

[05-Jan-19 10:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
and get out of the deep end of the pool... go play with solidity

but yeah  you too

[05-Jan-19 10:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
are you a magnum wallet dev?

[05-Jan-19 10:26 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm asking because it looks like you write to someone who maybe will never read it, I have no idea what is magnum wallet and this whole discussion seems not related to KMD to me

It's a licensing issue

[05-Jan-19 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
purely legal

[05-Jan-19 10:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
something I am VERY well versed in is litigation

[05-Jan-19 10:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
you let people come into this project and take code without attribution and it sets a precedent

[05-Jan-19 10:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
I have too much invested to let that shit walk

[05-Jan-19 10:30 AM] actionslacks#4072

ok then let's open #talk-licensing if this is getting to be a big issue for KMD

[05-Jan-19 10:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
please

[05-Jan-19 10:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
lets do that

[05-Jan-19 10:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
this project is marketcap-wise the equivalent to a company I work for and they have a small strike team of lawyers to deal with ip infractions overseas. it's time to play small ball with this shit.

[05-Jan-19 10:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
really? I mean.. c'mon

[05-Jan-19 10:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
if magnum wallet is't gonna give attribution they need to open source it

[05-Jan-19 10:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can be inclusive without being a doormat

[05-Jan-19 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
I hate lawyers with a passion I am sure you will never understand. but this bullshit needs to end.

[05-Jan-19 10:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 you cannot use ledger with agama. Nor can you claim rewards with it unless you extract the privkey, which defeats the purpose of the hardware wallet.

[05-Jan-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is a problem that the community has been asking the team to solve for 2 years.

[05-Jan-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now that the reward went from 12 months to monthly, it is required all that more.

[05-Jan-19 10:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
we are being literally pissed upon by someone that is no way affiliated with kmd and you guys are like " whoa, this feels great"

[05-Jan-19 10:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Na we are like, look at that idiot for investing his own money to further the community whilst open sourcing code that could potentially steal all your funds in a closed source wallet....

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Jan-19 10:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
Honestly, and not to put too fine a point on it, but this will not stop happening unless magnum wallet is made an example of.

[05-Jan-19 10:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Those guys with the closed wallet are within their right to do it because there are bad people in the world. You should have known.

[05-Jan-19 10:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyway that will be my last comment on it. People will not change and i would rather sit here and wait for KMD to moon.

[05-Jan-19 10:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Some magical whales will come with their magical GUI devs and we will all be rich once they are done! I cant wait.

#chainzilla  needs to nut up or shut up. it's fucking a literal phrase in a line of code

good, then you can find the precedent case for suing because MIT wasn't observed in a 10MB min file :trollface:

[05-Jan-19 11:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
I've already won, years ago. money still matters, but not as much. this is my pet project. much like many here. and when an outsider comes in and shits in the house of my brethren, I take offense. it's only natural

I love you guys

[05-Jan-19 11:10 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@hyperDEX  I understand your anger, but can you show me the list of people that requestet the feature ? For me there is never the case that all the people wants sth, and if sth is necessary that requires a lot of work you need to have at least evidence for that. Best evidance is funds raised. Secondary is list of people or a poll. I think I'm part of "this community" but never requested ledger claim button. I dont see how ledger is needed for KMD at all. This is my point of view. To go beyond points of views proofs are needed, like I mention in sentence before. If no proofs we stay on "point of view" discussion level which may be fun for some but mostly useless.

[05-Jan-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I funded it myself, why do i need to justify it?

[05-Jan-19 11:11 AM] actionslacks#4072

ledger is a steaming pile of shit that is likely hackable by any number of methods but the real metric is adoption and perception

[05-Jan-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Should i spend the next few days compiling a list of people requesting it to justify my investment?

[05-Jan-19 11:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Regarding licensing @actionslacks maybe Im wrong but it seems people want decentralization as they do not believe in the law or they want to remove it, which means remove licensing needs too, make everything open source and no-rights maybe? So this is also a community of "no complaints" since you participate in it on such rules? IDK, interesting times for sure

[05-Jan-19 11:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@hyperDEX  depends if you want to prove sth or not

[05-Jan-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There are rules even for open source

[05-Jan-19 11:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if those people requested - you could aske them for support

[05-Jan-19 11:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

the  point is that luke spent countless hours reverse engineering the motherfucker and magma cam in and said "hurr durr it's not rocket science to steal your code"

[05-Jan-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Who do you think paid for the countless hours 😄

[05-Jan-19 11:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think the purpose of you writing here sth is waiting for kind of support?

[05-Jan-19 11:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
expecting

[05-Jan-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
To do what?

[05-Jan-19 11:15 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
which is obvious - if I spent much time working on sth that I believe some people wanted from me I would expect some support if I was in trouble
