True about long for shitcoins. In reality you will have pennies (pennystocks, eurotunnel eurodisney ...)

[17-May-19 09:56 PM] phm87#7395
Thx

[17-May-19 09:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it can do - shorts, longs, high leverage, low fees, crypto, stocks, forex as availiable markets and possibility to create very custom positions (like a BTC/Microsoft lets say or some complex index)

[17-May-19 09:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But this tech is in early testing stage  atm

[17-May-19 10:00 PM] phm87#7395
Will orderbooks will be in mempool or a blockchain ?

[17-May-19 10:01 PM] TonyL#3577
All positions are on blockchain. Actually it's not a exchange - you trade against "house"

[17-May-19 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
Oh

[17-May-19 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
Decentralized house ?

It's kinda broker DAO

Orderbooks in mempool can be unfair I read (on a similar project)

@Crabby Paddy I did hear of one but when I looked it up it had wacky gun laws.
Out of the major parties; Liberal over Labor for less taxes.
I voted Liberal as policies more business/investment friendly.

At the end of the day though, it doesn’t really matter. It’s a fked up system. Lol

@Deleted User you mean party funding relative to votes ?

[18-May-19 10:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Here even if you vote blanco, your vote-funds get evenly distributed

[18-May-19 10:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the only way to make sure the parties dont get your vote-money is to vote invalid

[18-May-19 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362

does BTC look like its about to move to anyone else?  My TA skillz are... amateur.  But volume seems to be dropping off and we are tightening on the hourly.

[18-May-19 04:15 PM] Markus#5464
volume is rly drying up

[18-May-19 04:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
and that sort of indicates that a move is imminent, right?

[18-May-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464

whats your take on btc next week?

[18-May-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
usually the big move happens after a day or so with blue line right around the green line

[18-May-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i have no idea, i just watch the patterns it makes most recently, as if it is being forced, odds are the whales are using the same algo to push the price

[18-May-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is inactive now, though

[18-May-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the blue line ALWAYS gets back to the green, as it is just a 24 hour average. it usually crosses at an angle, that is why the prior pattern of soft landing in the green line and then stair stepping stood out as strange

[18-May-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
after the stairstepping stopped, we seem to be oscillating, so normal TA should be able be decently accurate (until the stairmaster starts again)

[18-May-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the thing about trading signals is that if you want something that is always telling you up vs down, it wont be very accurate well in forex i got one to get to 85% accurate for 2 hours ahead, but it is hard to make money with that as the magnitude of movement is not that big

[18-May-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so try to make predictors that predict the big moves and dont bother with the small stuff as you will just overtrade and lose all your profits

[18-May-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
we are now in a medium term up and short term down and long term down period, but strong medium term up move that makes it very chaotic

[18-May-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
do u think there is possibility that we are in one of those "pre bullmarkets" ?

[18-May-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea what that is

[18-May-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
one second will find a example

[18-May-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are in a bull market, then we can consider the long term direction as up. in that case anytime the short term is down, it is underpriced and you could get the difference to the mean

[18-May-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so the daily average to weekly average might be a possible gain here

[18-May-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, better to buy now than at $8000+

[18-May-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but really if you are establishing positions during the transition of bear to bull, already you missed out on a big percentage gain. the time to have established a position was when BTC was totally oversold, ie. below $3500
