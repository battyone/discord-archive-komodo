[20-Feb-19 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain if @blackjok3r had moved it to vh like he said he would, it would be much more alive :troll:

[20-Feb-19 10:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, in that case i wouldn't have to run a T9+ 24/7 and be done with few CPU cores 😃

[20-Feb-19 10:11 PM] SHossain#0007
@coingirl87 when pangea goes live and generates any fee, a portion will be rewarded to PANGEA holders

[20-Feb-19 10:13 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thank you 👍

[20-Feb-19 10:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There are a couple big chips holders here, yassin among others iirc, not sure if they are selling any big chunks though

[20-Feb-19 10:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might be able to sell some chips at right price. Don't have stupid amounts, but got a few.

[20-Feb-19 10:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
How much is the circulating supply?

[20-Feb-19 10:22 PM] coingirl87#6489
I want to buy chips for 1000 kmd for the right price

[20-Feb-19 10:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
21 million chips in total

[20-Feb-19 10:24 PM] Tek#5253

It you're going to shill one project, then you should shill the rest
