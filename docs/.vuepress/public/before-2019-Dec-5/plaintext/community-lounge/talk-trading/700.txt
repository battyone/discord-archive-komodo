I feel like this is a falsification unless they really want to word weasel the "created for the foundation" as an achievment.  In that case, EVERYTHING you do is a crypto first!

Just like their claim that they are first üòÑ

[30-May-19 12:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That's sort of what I am understanding... and although its not default into agama, (Pirate), it's defaulted privacy and multicoin.

[30-May-19 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So if I read Cross Platform - Shielded Addresses First Sapling Enabled Zcash wallet, Open Source, Then Agama already did that, if you enable Pirate.

[30-May-19 12:18 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But because Pirate isn't default enabled, then They can say this is true I guess. 

Still doesn't change the fact only 4% of the pool is shielded, and people can/will just switch back to a t addy with a click of a button so they made a noble effort.

This run is a bit different than the others. Instead of coming right down it continued to go up. Also, Bittrex is leading the way in price.
