And hypothetically does that mean I should consider my whole computer compromised?

[03-Oct-18 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Still don’t get how this internet stuff works. If I didn’t log in on it since getting malware (if it really was from his hacks) wouldn’t they need to wait for me to login + use my 2f

[03-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
And lastly is it safest to use agama iguana seed

[03-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Then add a few words at the back to make it a custom seed?

[03-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Gonna spread my funds out into like 20 wallets now and stop being a lazy fucker when it comes to security 😅

[03-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I’m guessing using the random seed + a few words would be most secure?

[03-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Random punctuation

[03-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Open the base up

[03-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe even some character map symbols cut and pasted in

There’s no negatives to custom seed right?

And wake up 10 years later and kmd has updated agama to shits

[03-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Good luck guessing that

[03-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
My custom seed will always work yeah? 😂

[03-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just making sure before I go ahead with my 40 word seeds

[03-Oct-18 02:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It would be quite ironic for James to bust backward compatibility after the whole nxt debacle

[03-Oct-18 02:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
My seed is weak apparently LOL

[03-Oct-18 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000

[03-Oct-18 02:11 AM] IP#9768

[03-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
How safe is using 4g on mobile

[03-Oct-18 02:16 AM] Deleted User#0000

[03-Oct-18 02:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Now to z address my funds and leave the taxman confused :trollface:

[03-Oct-18 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
So send t to z then z to another z then z back to my new t right?

[03-Oct-18 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
In lots of 100 or 1000 so it’s not as easily tracked

[03-Oct-18 02:35 AM] bishop#9773
...or use jumblr

[03-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Jumblr 100% safe? Just don’t wanna risk it when it’s got a big fat EXPERIMENTAL on it 😂

[03-Oct-18 02:36 AM] jspook16#3059
Are you getting out of kmd @Deleted User ?

[03-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Fuck no LOL my exchange acc got hacked somehow so I presume my pc is compromised

[03-Oct-18 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Been putting off securing everything for too long anyway, just spreading it all into different wallets

[03-Oct-18 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
And fucking the taxman off

[03-Oct-18 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
I won’t sell til 100usd don’t worry 😂

[03-Oct-18 02:38 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh snap!  Best get on that quick man. Yeah I'm staying till moon..

[03-Oct-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO if the ledger gets the intrest ug fixed that would be the best, never like HW wallets, but with the 1 month intrest claim stuff, using paper wallets to claim intrest is a major PITA.

[03-Oct-18 05:12 AM] cryptot14#0931
anyone interested in doing a bulk trade? Will give KMD for REVS, MGW, or HODL.

[03-Oct-18 05:14 AM] cryptot14#0931
PM me.

[03-Oct-18 05:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@cryptot14 You might could save yourself some pestering and define "bulk" 😉

[03-Oct-18 05:26 AM] cryptot14#0931
Depends. Liquidity on BarterDEX is only around 10-20 KMD's worth at a time. 

I might do 1000 KMD, if the price is right.

[03-Oct-18 05:31 AM] jspook16#3059
I might take you up on that. It'll have to be tomorrow though if you still have kmd left

[03-Oct-18 05:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not selling any more pirate.
will keep them either to the moon or to dust.

[03-Oct-18 05:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did not get much of response to my sell calls. did not sell even small chunks. only did 2 trades

[03-Oct-18 05:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this 3rd trade was the last one.

[03-Oct-18 05:48 AM] cryptot14#0931
@jspook16 
Sounds good. Hit me up tomorrow. I"m here on and off.

[03-Oct-18 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still has to wonder why he's among the least liked members of the community and can't mine PIRATE fast enough to sell to everyone that wants it, yet the really nice guys that everyone should like can't give it away with tickets to see strippers 😕_

[03-Oct-18 08:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"off" implies I was ever on it 😛

[03-Oct-18 08:49 AM] cryptot14#0931
😃 I don't mind. I was a little late to the game. Would love a second chance.

[03-Oct-18 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, BTC is dead, it's only up 14.427x in 29 months 🙄

[03-Oct-18 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At the same level of deadness, in March 2021, KMD will be $15.725

14>9

[03-Oct-18 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
14 = dead, then 9 = more dead

[03-Oct-18 08:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, wasn't in response to what you said

[03-Oct-18 09:00 AM] snowdamn#2414
BTC-wise
