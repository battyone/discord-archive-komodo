how secure is googles authenticator really from being hacked

[14-May-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it just generates 6 digits every 30 seconds based on a seed

[14-May-19 04:56 PM] Malti#3948
@Markus my point mainly is that new accounts are being opened up

[14-May-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if that seed is compromised, so is the 2fa

starcapital seems to be a hedge fund and they have PIRATE as part of the portfolio

[14-May-19 04:56 PM] Markus#5464
if u have a hardware device for authentication is that more secure?

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if that seed is compromised, so is the 2fa

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Privacy is important, especially for those that are well to do.

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and he problems with ZEC cant really be fixed anytime soon

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But equally important to all.

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] Markus#5464
is the chance for the seed to become compromised less on a physical device then a mobile app?

[14-May-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810

Im certain their exposure came through our community.

[14-May-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus are you asking if it is less likely for a single purpose device to be compromised as compared to something that runs whatever apps?

[14-May-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
investing in PIRATE is only by owning ARRR

in general a dedicated device has just that dedicated program, so if it is secure and you dont hand your device to someone who can scan it, it should be ok

[14-May-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810

WTB 100 BTC worth of KMD at 13k sats

[14-May-19 06:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Me too... if I had that much BTC.

[14-May-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore that there is only 2BTC to 19k sats on binance, it is time to panic sell since BTC will always go up

[14-May-19 06:17 PM] Markus#5464
u found any sellers when u were doing same campain at 21k?

[14-May-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually I did, but had to pay a premium over market price

[14-May-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the real market isnt the few BTC the bots are playing ping pong with as they push the price around to match some silly fiat peg

[14-May-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
out of curiosity since u predicted the bull market to end 2017, did u sell any btc to pick them back up cheaper?

[14-May-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
we did hedge a too small amount, which we used during the deepest of the bear market

[14-May-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
should have hedged 20% of funds, instead of 5%, still the 5% hedged was a very good thing when BTC was $3500 for some months. it can sure eat through a lot of BTC when it is dropped so low

[14-May-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
lets see if this pullback will settle around the 24 hour average: http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[14-May-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it has still not reached the green line, but should at around $7800, then it tracks the daily average for a day or so to recharge and goes up from there. that is the pattern repeated half a dozen times now

[14-May-19 07:07 PM] Markus#5464
below 7800$ on coinbase now

[14-May-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it touched the daily average on http://159.69.45.70:8050/
now the big question is if this will stick to the usualy pattern. if it goes a lot more below, then it could be we will have a real correction back down to the normal fib retracements

[14-May-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
as that is what the TA people will trade it to, absent big giant whale pushes

Did i miss something, did you guys buy large amount of KMD from BTC team fund?

[14-May-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it was for the CRYPTO/SUPERNET revshare

[14-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I should have waited, but it seemed a very good price at the time and indeed after the deal it went to 38k, so it was indeed a good deal

[14-May-19 07:50 PM] CoinKing88#1540
You bought KMD right before that pump to 38K a few weeks back?

[14-May-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
not right before, about a month before

[14-May-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but i dont want to be trading with the accumulated revshares

[14-May-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so once i do the purchase, i leave it be

[14-May-19 07:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Is there a FAQ about all KMD projects and revshares etc. I  get lost in everything, when you say revshares i think DEX asset but it seems there is much more happening in here.

[14-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
this is for the CRYPTO coin that gets the notarization fees

[14-May-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810

Ah i see, and the notaries get those fees for their work on the dpow? So this is kinda like a bankaccount to pay the notaries? And you filled that account yourself by buying that kmd?

[14-May-19 07:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No, it‚Äôs goes to CRYPTO (coinname ) coin holders.  Notaries get easy mining on KMD and BTC for notarizations covered from ICO funds

[14-May-19 08:00 PM] CoinKing88#1540
And crypto coin is a coin for a KMD project just like the DEX coin is for the dex project?

[14-May-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
CRYPTO gets the notarization amount net of the BTC txfees and yes it is the analogue for the DEX coin and barterDEX

[14-May-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
