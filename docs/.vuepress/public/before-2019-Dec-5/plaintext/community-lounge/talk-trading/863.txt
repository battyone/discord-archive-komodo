According to Duffield, each new stage of Dash‚Äôs development will allow the platform to multiply its user base tenfold. This will be achieved by leveraging both traditional proof-of-work mining and proof-of-service masternodes to run the network. Included in the plan is an increase in the block size. While this subject has been highly contentious in the Bitcoin world to merely increase its size to 2mb, Dash aims to increase it to 2mb and beyond, eventually reaching the 400mb level. In order to economically handle this data load, masternodes are incentivized, each node earning around $1,200 per month in rewards at present prices, sure to go up over time, meaning that they will easily have the resources available to afford the additional hardware and bandwidth requirements of such a system. Finally, in order to handle an increasing network load, the Dash team is working on proof-of-concept hardware prototypes designed specifically for masternodes to assist them in handling whatever load the network requires.

they're making a giant whale map. full situational awareness

[26-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c i dont know how address balances work but the way u  described it, would the "whale" be able to send the dust to get rid of it?

[26-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Markus#5464
so that it would not be part of his future transaction

[26-Jun-19 08:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
soon large btc moves will be macro econimic events that perhap will be used to anticipate market fluctuations. imagine arms manufaturers accepting btc and you can better understand the military implications as well
