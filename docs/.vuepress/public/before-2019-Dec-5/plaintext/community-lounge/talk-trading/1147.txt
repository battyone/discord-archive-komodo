[19-Sep-19 06:27 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Kmd dipped into the 4hr 200ema for the first time in a long time so things could look up soon again

[19-Sep-19 06:27 PM] Markus#5464

crypto -- the ultimate fleecing

[20-Sep-19 01:02 AM] meatspoon#7860
hmm, i dont know if crypto is the ultimate fleecing.  BTC is doing pretty well on a monthly or weekly view...  the rest of the space, that's another story

[20-Sep-19 03:17 AM] richardt#2807
Both BTC and ETH doing well price-wise

[20-Sep-19 03:20 AM] richardt#2807
I've always wondered.  What would happen if KMD actually worked with/partnered with ETH instead of shit-talking it all the time.  Whatever happened to unifying and helping the entire crypto space?  Ultimately, we're all in it together

[20-Sep-19 03:41 AM] richardt#2807
The whole "we're the best tech" and "other coins/projects are inferior" hasn't been working out too well for KMD.  Frankly, it's been counterproductive and an overall bad look for KMD

[20-Sep-19 03:44 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well no one is going to get rich when the entire market is only 150 USD but it would be nice if that price was higher since Im the only one trading I suppose but with graviex's high btc fees for withdrawl it almost makes it a altcoin swap out I suppose.  Its too bad this is so hard.  Any way you priced down I see haha I mean if I really am the difference to actually running this project Im rather sorry ha ha

[20-Sep-19 05:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
@richardt  Vitalik is shit talking eth too. kmd has spent nearly 2 years already integrating eth and erc20 coins into mm2. Making eth atomic swappable with btc is a giant fucking favor to eth that never gets acknowledged. This isn't a pissing contest. It's a fight for survival. We are all in it together. I seriously doubt anyone else is putting as much money and work into creating liquidity for other peoples' projects. it's not the best mobile atomic swap exchange, it's the only one.

It's not 2018 anymore. Longest altcoin bear market and maximum btc dominance. Project need to earn it's mcap. Some are better than others. KMD is better than most. It's a fight for survival. ✊

[20-Sep-19 06:35 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
This is how I feel: I was sick and tired of btc already back in scalability wars and even more when bcash fork happened. I thought bcash doesn't matter. It doesn't solve anything. It's the same shit as btc plus roger ver in it. We need something better. BTC need to be dethroned. It's not good for anything other than trading against alts. It was nice to cash out something in christmas time 2017, but my hatred only grew in spring 2018 when bear market began. It's fucken disheartening to look how better projects are being treated in this market. Only Binance and money printing scam ieo's make any money now days. Absolutely sickening. Fuck buidl and BNB. It's ridiculous to even think that bnb is any kind of sound money. Fucking chinese exchange token that you can buy fish&chips. What delusional bunch of scammers. Binance must be dethroned too. Ethereum had it's run. So shitty, but so high mcap. It's clogged as fuck. 2nd layer bs solution will not save eth. Time to replace it with something better. No mercy. They don't show mercy to us either. It's about the fight for survival now. sry for my shty eng. 🙂

[20-Sep-19 06:59 AM] LocoMB#8593

@richardt stating the truth does not typically translate into a higher price point.

[20-Sep-19 09:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
As others have said we have entered a new era, we need real utility to survive and go up in value.

[20-Sep-19 09:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why does LTC have value? It was second only after bitcoin and its only utility is liquidity and lower fees.

[20-Sep-19 09:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It brings nothing of technical value to this space

[20-Sep-19 09:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now what does KMD have? It has tech but no liquidity, how do we fix this issue? By allowing people to make risk free money

[20-Sep-19 09:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
A global orderbook will bring liquidity and users and if everything goes well, it will allow CEX and DEX to coexist.

[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you want faster trades with a promise a exchange will pay you whilst they use bots and wash trade, cool go for the CEX, if you want real orders with real coins on the line that has no need for your stool sample and control over your own funds, cool you can use the DEX.

Once this becomes a reality, do you think projects like LTC or Steller or XRP will have any value?

[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I read somewhere XRP is being used for global remittance, this is the process .....

Coinbase USD --> XRP
XRP --> offshore XRP address
XRP --> Peso

Why would anyone use this silly service where there could be huge fluctuations in price?

[20-Sep-19 09:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why not by KUSD pegged to the dollar and just sell it to the other side? We have the same utility, yet XRP is somehow worth 150x more than all of KMD tech combined

Waves Transitions to Self-Regulating Monetary System
Waves is transitioning to a self-regulating monetary system, allowing the community to determine block generation reward size and coin supply.

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
wasn't waves a PoS coin

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
WAVES is PoS, not PoW.

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] Tek#5253
thought so

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
"self-regulating" just means the large stakeholders will vote for max block reward

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
1 minute block times

[20-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
this is 3% inflation, where before it was 0%

[20-Sep-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I read between 1-30 seconds on some website

[20-Sep-19 09:30 AM] Tek#5253
proof of stake is shit anyway

[20-Sep-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe they changed the blocktime, in that case 6% inflation at 30 second blocks

[20-Sep-19 09:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[20-Sep-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Telling people he will rebuy coins on the open market didnt do much to drive hype

[20-Sep-19 09:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
His Coin’s days are numbered

[20-Sep-19 09:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Unless they want money transmitter licenses

[20-Sep-19 09:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They won’t get them

[20-Sep-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Of course not

[20-Sep-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They have 100M plus at least but im sure Sasha has cashed out already so he doesnt really care

Remember coinomat ( unlicensed money transmitter business) ,  all someone has to do is tip off the right people and it will be blocked

[20-Sep-19 09:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
