Why are we talking about btc?

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its not doing anything

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Can 6M whale dump more??

[18-Sep-18 07:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have some alerts and fiat loaded up on some exchanges

Dont care about btc

`Why are we talking about btc?`
Because my belief that BTC shouldn't be the measure of all things doesn't matter to the world üò≠

6M whale seems to be buying more at these prices: http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RD7SZpgtfrLXB32bRcckYaVmre2ByL73Pi

[18-Sep-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
though no transfers in last week

[18-Sep-18 07:53 PM] halkuon#8190
interesting if we go sideways now for a few weeks or months that would be great

[18-Sep-18 07:54 PM] halkuon#8190
hopefully 16k holds

[18-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I never see that whale claim bonus. Has to be up in the 100ks by now.

[18-Sep-18 08:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That transaction history makes me sad i never bought z9‚Äôs

[18-Sep-18 08:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Interest just dumped to the miners

[18-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I thought only exchanges made the bonus into a transaction fee. I wonder why the whale is doing it. Unless it's CZ wallet that he holds on binance.

[18-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
125320 in interest on RD7

[18-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
All utxo‚Äôs made before block 1000000

[18-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So he has awhile to claim

[18-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or she

[18-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But let‚Äôs be honest there are no women in crypto

[18-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Waits for cheapshot joke)

[18-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
:abusedsmily:

[18-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
They are but mostly looking for the men that "made it"

[18-Sep-18 08:23 PM] CHMEX#0686
it might be the binance Cold store wallet. There are transactions form binance hot wallet to it... I guess with 300k KMD withdrawn in one transaction you need to go through the KYC process even at binance so that would speak against a whale

[18-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
RD7 = safu?

[18-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Not for the people keeping their coin on the exchange. Missing out on a lot of bonus. Miners will be happy though.

[18-Sep-18 08:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
just a theory I have might be wrong yes the RD7 address

[18-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Intrest claimed shows as the tx fee in the explorer by the way

[18-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Every time they do a transaction

[18-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I remember correctly it was a bug in the explorer

[18-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That makes sense. Still, he could be compounding the shit out of that bonus.

[18-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What‚Äôs an extra 6k a year

[18-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
When you‚Äôre balling with 6M

So once polo is out there is still tradestatoshi

[18-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is there still a chain to move coins on?

[18-Sep-18 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where can you even download the Btcd wallet

[18-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Chain isnt moving because jl isn‚Äôt staking iirc?

[18-Sep-18 09:37 PM] venne#4038
hmm kmd price starting to look intresting to get starter positions

[18-Sep-18 09:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
Btcd -55.40%

[18-Sep-18 09:39 PM] venne#4038
well btcd had a nice run

[18-Sep-18 09:40 PM] venne#4038
still dont understand why polo wasnt contacted to just swap to kmd tho

[18-Sep-18 09:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thats not how c-exchanges work.

[18-Sep-18 09:45 PM] venne#4038
well it was never tried

[18-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
2.42 spv mode giving anyone problems on KMD?

[18-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
My counterparty is threatening to send a team of door kickers in

[18-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If I don‚Äôt get the tx out

[18-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In a timely fashion

[18-Sep-18 10:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Spv mode gave me some bs about electrum shepherd unable to push transaction

[18-Sep-18 10:13 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or something along those lines

[19-Sep-18 01:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
We still have to be 100% native for barterdex?

[19-Sep-18 01:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@venne  they were contacted many times they refused to reply

[19-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pretty sure the team beat them to death on that, @venne

[19-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Do all of you expect the crypto marketcap to grow again during the next bullrun, to the point where multiple projects are in the 5-10b marketcap again?

[19-Sep-18 05:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
or was everything overpriced as fuck back then (considering the developments happening now)

[19-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont know whats reasonable and whats not. On one hand I was looking up normal companies, and shit like that and it seemed 200m was considered low these days and even tiny companies had higher marketcaps than that

[19-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
yet I see a list of "unicorns" and successful companies at the 1b or less mark

[19-Sep-18 05:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It will grow one way or another,  when the usecases start rolling out and being refined ,  crypto will take a life of its own outside of investors

I think the last bull run was mass delusion. But lately it seems like the trading is just unadulterated manipulation interspersed with people strategically unloading large positions. but hey, BTCD is back up guys!

[19-Sep-18 08:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
well lets hope for 1 more mass delusion

The guys that sold the top in 2013 @ $1000 probably felt pretty good for awhile too.

[19-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If we hit 10b but with adoption still growing...

[19-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If we hit 10b on a bubble like last year...

[19-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It‚Äôs all relative

[19-Sep-18 09:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, crypto to the masses is still a pretty abstract and difficult concept to grasp. awareness is rising, but judging by tsome of the top 20, human intelligence is still on a downward slope.

[19-Sep-18 09:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe I'm a sadist, but I think we need some real crashing to get all the fluff out

[19-Sep-18 09:11 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
in 2030 the whole market won't be less than 100 trillions, counting the few that scale and survive, even if kmd is just 1% it will be 1 trillion mc

[19-Sep-18 09:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
Anecdotally It would have to be to contain all the value in the current system. But the current system is pretty artificial and the real value is arbitrary at best imo.

[19-Sep-18 09:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
I wonder if wars will ever be fought over crypto.

[19-Sep-18 09:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
A that would need to happen is for the USA to dictate that oil be traded with crypto I guess

[19-Sep-18 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
a war over currency and oil? surely that could never happen....

[19-Sep-18 10:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think in a crypto war future all devs would have to be anonymous to survive
