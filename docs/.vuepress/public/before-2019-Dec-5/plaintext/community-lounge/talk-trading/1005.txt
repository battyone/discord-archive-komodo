[04-Aug-19 05:07 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 05:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[04-Aug-19 05:07 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Trading shitcoins back and forth

[04-Aug-19 05:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
That's the point

[04-Aug-19 05:08 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's a zerosum game

[04-Aug-19 05:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[04-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Lanii#8302
Why does it matter

[04-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Lanii#8302
Im not a plane company

[04-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Lanii#8302
They are in the business of "flying"

[04-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Lanii#8302
Not accumulate more btc

[04-Aug-19 05:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Point is you probably accumulate btc to drop on some fool when it's at 100k

[04-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Lanii#8302
yes

[04-Aug-19 05:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
This is a zerosum game bud

[04-Aug-19 05:10 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Adds no value

[04-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
just like everything else....if u buy a stock u will probably want it to grow to sell it at a higher price

[04-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
in other way why would u even buy one

[04-Aug-19 05:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Life it self is a zerosum game aswell  lol

[04-Aug-19 05:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 05:14 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[04-Aug-19 05:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
