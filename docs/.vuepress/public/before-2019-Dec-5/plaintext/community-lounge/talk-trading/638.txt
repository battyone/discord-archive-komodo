[12-May-19 02:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why would someone with 2.5million kmd worry about revshare of a NN?

[12-May-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
someone sent him like ~4000 KMD as well

[12-May-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
while trying to vote

[12-May-19 02:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he makes more in 5% rewards than any revshare

[12-May-19 02:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
🤦

[12-May-19 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
5% + revshare vs 5%

[12-May-19 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
and not caring about what other OPs have to offer other than direct money :S

[12-May-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but it doesnt make sense.

[12-May-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
With 1million KMD you make about 5k kmd a month

[12-May-19 02:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a NN makes 1.5k kmd a month

[12-May-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
revshare of 20% of that is just 150KMD a month

[12-May-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its not worth the effort imo.

[12-May-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no taking into about he has about 2.5million votes

[12-May-19 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is about 12k kmd a month

[12-May-19 02:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
vs. 300KMD a month

[12-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine there are people who wouldn't have bothered to vote otherwise

[12-May-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
also madmax is pretty active on tg while many other OPs are not

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo it doesnt have to do with revshare, he just have support from big whales

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is not bad

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Interest + rev share > interest

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Muh altruism

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You see what wins

[12-May-19 02:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Compete in the future

[12-May-19 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure that taking 11k for an 18k job that you might not otherwise have is "altruism", but OK

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, "altruism" is giving away 7k that you already have (not promising it out of what you will get if you get the job later)

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last year I believe the last day many things happened

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Very weird to see CZ lagging in votes

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“and not caring about what other OPs have to offer other than direct money :S”

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hope the whales wake up

[12-May-19 02:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
votes don’t lie

[12-May-19 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
welp, revshare people are mostly first in their region

[12-May-19 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
except tau who i dont know who he is.

[12-May-19 02:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
pungo and madmax are on top in their region, so revshare does seem to have influence

[12-May-19 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
20% revshare for a node that received 1M VOTE, is ~0.0015 KMD/month/VOTE

[12-May-19 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
so yea, get your extra couple dollars over the duration of the year or support the ecosystem

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Madmax does support the ecosystem, no?

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
sorry 0,00050625*

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
yea, no doubt he does

[12-May-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
very very much so

[12-May-19 02:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
komodod.com was launched by madmax

[12-May-19 02:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
was just going to say, madmax runs: https://komodod.com/vote2019/

[12-May-19 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, even without the revshare he would have deserved/gotten the votes

{Reactions}
💯 

[12-May-19 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So lets not attribute it too much to the revshare :p

[12-May-19 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, he is not about just revshare, he does have good things going.

[12-May-19 02:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what has been certainly the case tho is that not much votes went to NA in general.

[12-May-19 02:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
still not written in stone though

People want to participate in the rewards, that's why they vote for Madmax. Promote rewards, in a type of masternode without management (notarynode) and each election will be a pump for komodo, since the price pump is much easier to see all the great work you are doing
