[24-Jul-19 10:10 PM] Caglio#3337

[24-Jul-19 10:11 PM] Lumbi#8378
I recommend wallet discipline.. and withdraws from exchanges. things could get choppy in the weeks ahead.

[24-Jul-19 10:12 PM] Markus#5464
what is gonna change in upcoming weeks?

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Markus can never know in the 'wild west' ü§†

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Caglio#3337
I honestly feel more safe having my money on binance than in some kmd wallets üòÑ

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Caglio#3337
And I dont want to put money in coinomi, had some not so good experiences with them

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Markus#5464

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Markus#5464
i have 3 for extra safety, spread

[24-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Caglio#3337
But I dont want to spend money on it, ill rather get 1.5 grams of coke

[24-Jul-19 10:14 PM] Lumbi#8378
you can only 'win' if you don't 'lose' :6849_pepeold:

[24-Jul-19 10:14 PM] Markus#5464
alcohol/drugs/smoking waste of money....end all and spend cash on crypto and invest in ur future

[24-Jul-19 10:15 PM] Markus#5464
pro tip right there

[24-Jul-19 10:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
If you wanna be 100x safer with wallets always dl and sync the blockchain and do transactions only when sync'd.  javascript and all of it's fustercluck dependencies is the weakest link in wallet security.

[24-Jul-19 10:16 PM] Lumbi#8378
ubuntu cli alll the way :3040_kingpeepo:

[24-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Depends

[24-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Drug is not a waste of money

[24-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Caglio#3337
if you are not using it yourself

[24-Jul-19 10:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I am a timmy @actionslacks

[24-Jul-19 10:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
@Caglio you said you knew nothing about crypto, well you are getting an education. Advices to you is buy as much kmd as you can afford, then buy more. Work extra to buy more. If it goes to $.50 again, you are blessed, buy more. Buy sell other crypto then buy more kmd. You will be able to live off the interest in the coming years.

[24-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Caglio#3337
No more

[24-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Caglio#3337

[24-Jul-19 10:33 PM] joe2x4#5987
Extra advice, stop using win XP, it is shit

[24-Jul-19 10:38 PM] Caglio#3337
My computer cannot work with windows better than 7

[24-Jul-19 10:38 PM] Caglio#3337

[24-Jul-19 10:43 PM] Caglio#3337
He is full of cash

[24-Jul-19 10:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought about kidnapping him and having it in my basement for a while

[24-Jul-19 10:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
my good lord man

[24-Jul-19 10:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
why do you care if kmd dumps then? sounds like you got a golden ticket

[24-Jul-19 10:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
why would anyone pay you money for revenge porn anyway?

[24-Jul-19 10:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
big deal, she banged you before she met him

[24-Jul-19 10:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
you need better stuff for blackmail

[24-Jul-19 10:47 PM] joe2x4#5987
So to sum up, caglio is in the middle of his crypto trading education, continues to use XP as operating system of choice, knows lots about illegal marketing, and revenge porn. Yet has the best advice regarding kmd marketing and price.

[24-Jul-19 10:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
seems legit, what's our next move @Caglio ?

[24-Jul-19 10:51 PM] Caglio#3337
She banged me few months ago

[24-Jul-19 10:51 PM] joe2x4#5987
I mean at least put live Linux on yer cpu you can get so much more porn on it

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
and she is engaged with him for last year

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Also, he wouldnt like to see her nudes outside anyway

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
But I wont blackmail him, unless ukranian mobsters come for me

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
Then I will have to do what I can to protect myself üò¶

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought about shooting them, but when you gamble in casino

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
they take your id

[24-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Caglio#3337
they will find my family

[24-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Caglio#3337
So I would rather not engage in such an activity with mobsters

[24-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Caglio#3337
It wont end up good for me in the long run

[24-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Caglio#3337
And joe stop being sarcastic

[24-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Caglio#3337
Or I will get you on some crypto seminar and take your lunch money

[24-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Im just kidding @joe2x4  you are like a brother I never had ‚ù§

[24-Jul-19 10:59 PM] joe2x4#5987
@Caglio next to time you  sleep with that woman again, make sure to give her the old razzle dazzle. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=razzle%20dazzle.     #4

[24-Jul-19 10:59 PM] Caglio#3337
Cant open it @ work üò¶

[24-Jul-19 10:59 PM] Caglio#3337
Many pages are blocked

[24-Jul-19 10:59 PM] Caglio#3337
I cannot even whore myself on bongacams.com

[24-Jul-19 10:59 PM] Caglio#3337

[24-Jul-19 11:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
```The¬†Razzle Dazzle¬†is a glorious sex act that takes some planning, but¬†the juice is worth the squeeze. First, you must buy glitter, find a crown royal pouch (the one with the drawstring), and find some rope.```

[24-Jul-19 11:00 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Epic trading discussion again

[24-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Caglio#3337

üòÇ üòÇ

[24-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Actually @joe2x4 I am sure you want to hear a fun story

[24-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Caglio#3337
About my life experiences

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You could send him DM

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Most of you crypto lovers here probably never had an armpit sex

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I don't want to hear

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] Caglio#3337
I could, but I get tipped for my stories here

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] Caglio#3337
So bigger the audience is, bigger the tips are

[24-Jul-19 11:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, I, for some time, was interested into having an armpit sex with my ex gf Natalie

[24-Jul-19 11:02 PM] Caglio#3337
Its lovely way of showing ur love and affection toward her, ofc, armpits need to be completely waxed or shaved, and smell of a coconut oil you use to get a tan on the beach

[24-Jul-19 11:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
ü§¶

[24-Jul-19 11:02 PM] Caglio#3337
After a while I found out I am not into armpit sex, how I am into a smell of a coconut

[24-Jul-19 11:02 PM] Caglio#3337
So one day, I went to local supermarket, Kaufland

[24-Jul-19 11:02 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Turn yourself in dude

[24-Jul-19 11:03 PM] Caglio#3337
And bought myself a nice coconut, she looked like a charlize theron, so ofc, I named her Charlize

[24-Jul-19 11:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Then I begged my gf natalie for a threesome with Charlize

[24-Jul-19 11:03 PM] Caglio#3337
Finally she said yes, cos it was my bday, and she allowed me to fuck her and charlize in the same time
