My strategy is to ride bitcoin cash up and leverage that position for a sizeable position in Komodo before it goes.

[20-Aug-18 12:08 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The bitcoin Bitcoin cash debacle will be settled in this bear. That I'm for sure of.

[20-Aug-18 12:10 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think crypto will moon when global fiat in decline. Not global market, because with market recovering and few viable Fiats that hold value it will put cryptocurrency back into a bull market and only cryptos that work 100% of the time will benefit.

learn about buying/investing in property.
commodities
precious metals
market psychology in economy/trading etc
.... maybe this will not help much ... meet and be around ppl who make money will also help a lot.

[20-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I fucked myself up by growing up with the wrong people LOL. Its hard to meet people with a good mindset in this generation, hence why I keep to myself mostly LOL.
Ive been looking at property and the whole

should ask this in mining channel

I tried mining when I entered cryptocurrency industry. learned that I'd instead do better buying some and learn how to use my existing knowledge of software development and system administrations to this technology, and make something which will make money.

It *should*

[20-Aug-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have always figured if the hash rate keeps going up, the price has to "recover" eventually.
