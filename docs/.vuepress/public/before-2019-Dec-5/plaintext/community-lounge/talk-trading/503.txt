neither cares if you're a real customer though

[01-Apr-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, they're happy to get my $

[01-Apr-19 05:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So I’d have to burn up my credit before they’d allow me to mine

[01-Apr-19 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
started with a $20 plan and now it's a 😮 bill

What do you mine

[01-Apr-19 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in fairness, I do a **lot** more now than I did then and most of it cannot be done on a home 10MB

[01-Apr-19 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`What do you mine`
a bit of <https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.json>

[01-Apr-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's cpu, who cares about "profitability" of something that costs $4 a year?

[01-Apr-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or you mean with vultr?

[01-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vultr

[01-Apr-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
whatever I'm involved in testing at the time

[01-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Gotcha

[01-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Is that cloud mining thing profitable ?

[01-Apr-19 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it is for the hosting companies

[01-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
oh

[01-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337
My friend alright is here ❤ ❤

[01-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
"cloud mining" services are often flat out ponzis

[01-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
I mean literal ponzis

[01-Apr-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"often"?

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
wouldn't trust anything that doesn't allow you to rent hashrate and decide where it will be pointed

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
MMR and NH can be profitable if you hit a niche

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I wouldn't really count either of those as "cloud mining"

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
NiceHash ?

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Is that NH ?

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok I was looking at that

[01-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
https://www.hashtap.ca/ this seems legit as well

[01-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Caglio#3337
when I said cloud mining

[01-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Caglio#3337
But as being a noob

[01-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Caglio#3337
Its obviously not what I wanted to say 😄

[01-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
miningrigrentals.com nicehash.com and https://www.hashtap.ca/

[01-Apr-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
are the only 3 sites I know off where you can rent hash and point it where you like

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"cloud mining" is generally some company physically has a gajillion GPU/ASIC and they charge you to use them

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
or just a literal ponzi with no real mining whatsoever

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
So I need to buy

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or both 😛

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
equihash

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Caglio#3337
If I want to mine KMD ?

[01-Apr-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
don't

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
like I said, you need to hit a niche for any of these to be actually profitable

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
ok

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining KMD with rentals, unless you hit a big reward block, will almost always be at a loss

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
I wont 😄

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Caglio#3337
Oh

[01-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
just renting and mining KMD isn't going to do anything for you

[01-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Alright

[01-Apr-19 05:33 PM] Caglio#3337
I wont do it then

[02-Apr-19 04:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was pretty obvious to me that btc would finally break 4200 and then rise to like 6k

[02-Apr-19 04:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
annoying that KMD is tanking as a result
