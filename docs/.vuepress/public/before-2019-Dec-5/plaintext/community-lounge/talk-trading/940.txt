@Sanyadurnov  the only road maps left belong to other projects.  komodo is done w/rebrand right?

If atomicdex become popular it gives strong push for kmd... i think.. but its not easy to make it popular , a lot of people don‚Äôt realize a benefits of technology

[17-Jul-19 05:25 AM] allbits#5898
If there's sufficient liquidity it will get popular very fast. Breadwallet has tons of users, and, at this point, it seems inferior to me - uses Changelly to trade - KYC and three to six hour waits.  Word of mouth will expand it fast if it keeps working as it adds users, and if there's consistent liquidity.

People are opportunists if automicDex can benefit them in a big way they're going to use it.

German Finance Minister: Facebook Shouldn't Be Allowed to Compete ...
‚ÄúThe issuance of a currency does not belong in the hands of a private company," according to Germany's finance minister.

[17-Jul-19 07:58 AM] jorian#4555
are we in the 3rd stage of 'first they ignore you, then they mock you, then they fight you, then you win'?

[17-Jul-19 08:00 AM] jorian#4555
also ```‚ÄúThe issuance of a currency does not belong in the hands of a private company," according to Germany's finance minister.``` this is too painful; the ECB itself is basically a private company

[17-Jul-19 08:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also how will they reconcile the fact of other alternative currency systems, like the chiemgaeur

[17-Jul-19 08:38 AM] jansako#3330
They cannot. Anyone can issue a currency these days, in fact always could (what stops you to hammer out bits of Aluminum in your back yard and call them coins, as long as someone else accepts them as such). The tech just made is super easy to make a currency and so it shall be done by many.

And now for real. Swapped @ethereum for $KMD on @AtomicDex in 7 minutes. 
Try to send funds to a #CEX, trade and send back to a wallet in 7 minutes

Won‚Äôt be needing that $ETH anymore anyway. $KMD is the future!

This #DEX is amazing. 
Great job @KomodoPlatform @0xca333 ...
