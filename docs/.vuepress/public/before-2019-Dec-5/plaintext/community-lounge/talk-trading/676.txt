I wish we soon get to have spv/cc integration so we can move forward with a decent gui

[23-May-19 09:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
So is k64 like a separate coin you can buy? I always thought it was a part of redfox or komodo team

[23-May-19 09:52 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i cant seem to find a website or anything dedicated to K64

[23-May-19 09:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

it will end up with less value then if more projects had kmd coin as primary instead of creating a new one for each project
