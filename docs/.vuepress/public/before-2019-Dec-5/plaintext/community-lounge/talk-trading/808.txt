[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
And he tolds me the best thing ever

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
He paid 200 euros, but

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
He is only depositing 100 euros

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
on a bet 2

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
which is when u pay taxes in croatia, 180 euros

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337
so if he wins, he will be short of 20 euros

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337

[22-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Caglio#3337

speaking of bitfinex, are they running the tether printer again?

[22-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Caglio#3337

@coingirl87 nice brain

[22-Jun-19 04:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@coingirl87 best time to sell i think

[22-Jun-19 04:03 AM] coingirl87#6489
Look at cmc ...that are facts...most alts are in green zone...kmd not... only 2 shitcoins of top 100 are "better"

[22-Jun-19 04:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So people have dumped, when the selling is done it will go back up and the people that sold will buy back in

[22-Jun-19 04:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Marketing will not stop a dump and no marketing might cause a pump

[22-Jun-19 04:04 AM] nael55#5863
everything is down 5-10% relative to their btc value

[22-Jun-19 04:04 AM] nael55#5863
that's what happens when btc goes berzerk

[22-Jun-19 04:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe BTC will top out in 20 days then alt season happens, who knows

[22-Jun-19 04:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Trying to blame the team for lack of marketing is just silly

[22-Jun-19 04:05 AM] p.#1126
@coingirl87 you are on meth

LOL they listed Leo at 2x what people bought it as? üòÑ

[22-Jun-19 04:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
1 LEO i think was $1 USDT

[22-Jun-19 04:07 AM] nael55#5863
it started trading OTC in that range

[22-Jun-19 04:07 AM] tolken#2655
@coingirl87 virtually everything is wrecked. wut u talkin bout

[22-Jun-19 04:08 AM] nael55#5863
by the time it got to exchange, theree was already lots of hype

[22-Jun-19 04:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@nael55 basically it is USDT....there is no extra value in it

[22-Jun-19 04:08 AM] nael55#5863
no, it's an exchange token w/ tokenomics. whatever the tokenomics are

[22-Jun-19 04:09 AM] nael55#5863
pretty sure they have a buyback program

[22-Jun-19 04:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So they shot themselves in the foot basically

[22-Jun-19 04:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If they got 1B for 1B tokens, now have to pay $2/token their debt is 2B

[22-Jun-19 04:09 AM] nael55#5863
i think they wanted to solve their solvency issue

[22-Jun-19 04:10 AM] nael55#5863
hence the raise for a token

[22-Jun-19 04:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Na i get that

[22-Jun-19 04:10 AM] nael55#5863
idk how the buyback works

[22-Jun-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They use a % of their profits to buy back

[22-Jun-19 04:11 AM] nael55#5863
or if the token has other functions, like trading fee reducer or sometehing

[22-Jun-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So now instead of paying 1B back, they could be paying 2-3B

[22-Jun-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah

[22-Jun-19 04:11 AM] nael55#5863
maybe it was their best move at the time

[22-Jun-19 04:17 AM] coingirl87#6489
I dont blame team...only marketing  part of team...how is it possible to be number 3 of loosers with that tech?  Bnb is a shitcoin...but with great marketing 16 % in 7 days ....tron...a fucking shitcoin and scam have 5% gain in 1 week...same shit for dogecoin......and kmd. With best tech on market have -11 % gain...bamm...how does it works? Please be realistic and rational...komodo dumps when bts rise and you will see...kmd will dump when bts correction will start...

[22-Jun-19 04:17 AM] Caglio#3337
@coingirl87 you use curse words a lot, I like ur filthy mouth, wanna hook up ?

[22-Jun-19 04:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@coingirl87 might be worth buying BNB or Tron then, if kmd will dump regardless

[22-Jun-19 04:19 AM] Caglio#3337
She has some points tho

[22-Jun-19 04:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
cmc doesnt correlate with what is really going on. if you look at any major exchange right now evertything is in the red

[22-Jun-19 04:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but really

[22-Jun-19 04:20 AM] Caglio#3337
We dropped from 22 to 13 k

[22-Jun-19 04:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Still price wise we are not that bad

[22-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean few months ago we were at 0.50$

[22-Jun-19 04:22 AM] coingirl87#6489
I am investor and i see that i loose a lot of money in last week üôà

[22-Jun-19 04:23 AM] coingirl87#6489
During shitcoins with no tech make profit

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is the nature of the beast. not much logic can be applied to price movements

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, actually the reverse shit happens

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Tech coming out

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Price drops

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Wallets hacked

[22-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Price rises

[22-Jun-19 04:25 AM] coingirl87#6489

@coingirl87 : short term fluctuations are quite annoying, but if you look at the overall market, everything is up compared to the lows during the bear market.  At the rate things are going, KMD does have a lot of upside in the long term

[22-Jun-19 04:32 AM] designer#4893
the market leader can grow at a tremendous rate due to the network effect, even if he lacks technical skills.

@coingirl87 I have always agreed on marketing.  Now this wallet mishap is a big speed bump

[22-Jun-19 04:33 AM] designer#4893
the genius of Satoshi Nakamoto lies in the insight that penetrates the humanistic collective psyche, in addition to the technical aspects.

A lot of upside??? 3 years ago i invest for dicoprice for round about 12k...now we kiss the dico price....so where is the upside??? Dont understand me wrong...i love jl777 and whole developement team for the innovations and tech but ....yeah...look were we are after 3 years with no marketing....dico price

[22-Jun-19 04:36 AM] coingirl87#6489
No...my decision was clear...all in or nothing

[22-Jun-19 04:36 AM] ryman112#0068
Still gotta have some marketing.  Recognition from a shitty wallet isnt good marketing

[22-Jun-19 04:37 AM] ryman112#0068
When is this rebranding gonna come into play lol

[22-Jun-19 04:38 AM] ryman112#0068
How so?

[22-Jun-19 04:38 AM] ryman112#0068
Got ya

[22-Jun-19 04:38 AM] ryman112#0068
The rebranding is a joke at this point but we shall see

[22-Jun-19 04:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I concur

[22-Jun-19 04:40 AM] richardt#2807
I think July 15th could potentially be a make it or break it scenario for KMD

[22-Jun-19 04:40 AM] wolfgang#3508
kmd is one of the best project in the crypto space.... im mind blown we are we so massively undervalued

[22-Jun-19 04:40 AM] coingirl87#6489
Marketing and komodo is difficult toppic...i am still waiting for team meeting video of 2018 in zurich

@wolfgang yes and it is why we discuss marketing and rebranding

[22-Jun-19 04:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@richardt  no it won‚Äôt be

[22-Jun-19 04:41 AM] ryman112#0068
They dont have to be ready to get the name out

[22-Jun-19 04:42 AM] ryman112#0068
Its never a problem to be known in a space.

[22-Jun-19 04:43 AM] designer#4893
why aren't the stupid public and investors as well as the smart and enterprising people interested in komodo?

[22-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Just chill guys. In the end most reasonable alts and btc will outperform almost any other investments available.

You guys are just salty looking at btc

[22-Jun-19 04:43 AM] richardt#2807
@polycryptoblog :  I suppose it will depend on how much or how little it is hyped up.  Another repeat of the dICO flop will not be so good for KMD

[22-Jun-19 04:43 AM] designer#4893
It's not a lack of marketing, I think there's another reason.

[22-Jun-19 04:44 AM] ryman112#0068
Not at all salty.  Just wondering when we will see some sort of marketing

[22-Jun-19 04:44 AM] ryman112#0068
Could be happy77

[22-Jun-19 04:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thats what i mean...i have never discussed about tech....only marketing...in cryptospace strategy to wait until 100% finished products is deadly

[22-Jun-19 04:45 AM] ryman112#0068
Agree

[22-Jun-19 04:45 AM] richardt#2807
@designer :  One of the reasons is KMD products are hard to market and hard to use.  Until that gets fixed, there won't be much effective marketing

[22-Jun-19 04:46 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Who would have thought ltc, doge, ripple would be a better investment than Google like just think about it

[22-Jun-19 04:46 AM] ryman112#0068
Not talking about marketing a specific product but getting the damn name out there

[22-Jun-19 04:47 AM] richardt#2807
To compete with other projects, that requires a lot of funding.  Something KMD lacks
