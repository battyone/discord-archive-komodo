barterlly have some problem with USA citizen (i'm not sure but checked )

[12-Jun-19 10:38 PM] crumb#2550
perhaps you can use DigitalPrice then

[12-Jun-19 10:40 PM] crumb#2550
or if you want to do large amounts post your order in this channel and use trusted team member as escrow

my Chevrolet diesel truck is completely metric, but it's essentially an oversized Isuzu.      https://time.com/3633514/why-wont-america-go-metric/

Why Won’t America Go Metric?
Our centuries-long ambivalence about meters and liters mirrors our ambivalence about our place in the world

btc breaking backwards compatibility seems like a coup. It's as if it has been taken into private hands. perhaps the magnitude of the coup will sink in at some point.

core performed a coup, BCH tried to prevent it and noobs eat up "LOL BCASH" social media posts like it's the word of god

BTC is lost, it'll be corporately controlled shit coin soon enough. LN introduces huge degrees of trust and control to the system, and Core is purposely making BTC less useful on chain to force people to offchain trusted/controlled systems

[13-Jun-19 02:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
so people arguing about decentralization is a straw man argument. btc is now literally the elephant in the room of the decentralization debate.

[13-Jun-19 02:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
so now it will be argued that btc is getting added privacy with all this crap and that you should'nt waste time on the current privacy projects

[13-Jun-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
they captured btc. now to furiously engineer it into irrelevance

since they have all the money, they would want to protect it from their attack dogs

[13-Jun-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe the second 1%, who want to become the top 1%

[13-Jun-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User moving $100M in gold across the world is expensive and hard. It's basically free with cryptocoins. That is why

[13-Jun-19 03:19 AM] allbits#5898
The numbers are so large that even if the top one percent are convinced to allocate one percent of their wealth to crypto, globally, it's a staggering number

[13-Jun-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is how it starts

[13-Jun-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and when the middle class finds out this "secret" that the wealthy use, then the upper middle class will copy

[13-Jun-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but some of these upper middle class will become upperclass when crypto does its 10x to 100x

[13-Jun-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and this is how the new generation will experience the crypto in real life

[13-Jun-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the ones that put in 100% into crypto become very rich

[13-Jun-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
10% pretty rich

[13-Jun-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
1% keeps up with the rest

[13-Jun-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
0% falls behind

[13-Jun-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
of course there is also the other end of the spectrum of the billions of users doing trillions of transactions, but clearly this cant be on any single chain

I initially thought BCH to be a good alternative to BTC core shenanigans, but it was poisoned by CSW -
wonder if Roger Ver can recover from being bitten by that reptile .. maybe, if BTC core keeps getting more clunky

[13-Jun-19 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
using the algo of converting only what you absolutely need into fiat for living expenses and the rest in crypto, ignore the bull/bear cycles and after a couple of them, even at the low you have a decent amount of money

there is no need to "own" a house you need to pay 5x over 50 years. just rent until you can afford to actually buy it, but make sure to buy in jurisdictions without this property tax, which is just another form of rent as if you dont pay it, you get evicted

The general rule of thumb for crypto now is today is the cheapest day for buying it

[13-Jun-19 04:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
i think of it as the next industrial revolution, only instead of mass production it will be mass accessibility. everything can be configured to be exponentially more effecient, accountable, and available to all with the capacity to understand, use, and potentially contribute to the systems progression. your internet will pay for itself through all the mechanicms that are currently serving a very select fee for example.
