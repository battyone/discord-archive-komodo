KMD gets a legit buyer once in awhile

[21-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then bots beat it all to hell again

[21-Apr-19 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you're trading wrong

[21-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Markus#5464
well can say like this....i bought cheaper then this, was late to the profit taking cause it take half day to get ur deposit confirmed to binance so there was nothing to profit from when it arrived, i dont keep funds on exchange for safety reasons

[21-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Markus#5464
and bittrex barely got any liquidity, mostly bot action

[21-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Markus#5464
so theres that

[21-Apr-19 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`was late to the profit taking cause it take half day to get ur deposit confirmed`
like I said.....

[21-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Markus#5464
how is that trading wrong when ur deposit to half decade to confirm

[21-Apr-19 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
When you're trading right, you have a trade percentage already on the exchange and you trade when you want/need to trade

[21-Apr-19 08:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bouncing currencies around from wallet to wallet and exchange to exchange, you'll end up spending more in fees than you make

[21-Apr-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
idk how much profit u make but the 0.0002 kmd fee is not a big deal to me

[21-Apr-19 08:56 AM] Markus#5464
binance doesnt have deposit/withdraw fees

[21-Apr-19 08:56 AM] Markus#5464
except transaction fee

[21-Apr-19 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`fee is not a big deal to me`
it's not until it is

[21-Apr-19 09:00 AM] Markus#5464
i can live with 5$ fee if i made profit of 1k+

[21-Apr-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
its my tip to the exchange

[21-Apr-19 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why make $1000 when you can make $1005
multiply that out over a year and you're giving away thousands

[21-Apr-19 09:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Everyone needs to eat :p

[21-Apr-19 09:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its my tip to the exchange`
because the 0.1% they chage you per trade isn't enough?

[21-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Markus#5464
fee depend if u pay fees with BNB and so on aswell

[21-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Markus#5464
then theres different lvls

[21-Apr-19 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[21-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Markus#5464
to u it sounded like every $ matter

[21-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Markus#5464
so if u pay less fee

[21-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Markus#5464
it should matter

[21-Apr-19 09:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Every $ does matter, and I'm too lazy to explain why buying a 3rd coin to trade 2 coins based on a 4th market is just silly

[21-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464

lets see if 20k holds

[21-Apr-19 12:23 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
It better does

[21-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Markus#5464
doubtful in this situation, looks like btc going to take shit

[21-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Markus#5464
if btc doesnt go up from this point we have a double top

[21-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
then it could retrace to 4.6k

[21-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
if theres no buy support kmd might go to 17k in worst case
