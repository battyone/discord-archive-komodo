[21-Jun-19 09:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I’d be 2.5x better off if I just sat on all the BTC I ever bought :abusedsmily:

[21-Jun-19 09:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Jun-19 10:40 PM] tolken#2655
Not bad for gold relative to this past decade

@Tek Verus Agama.

[21-Jun-19 10:43 PM] NNoperator#3835
If you want rewards try chameleon wallet FTW!

[21-Jun-19 11:08 PM] tolken#2655
Chameleon just needs ledger support, really slick interface.

[21-Jun-19 11:16 PM] Tek#5253
almost done emptying my binance account

[21-Jun-19 11:16 PM] tolken#2655
I think gold is a worthwhile asset to hold, but people like Peter Schiff go out of their way to dismiss crypto, which in turn makes me question his motives on everything. The guys batting average is horrendous.

[21-Jun-19 11:16 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 11:16 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 11:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He is a scammer more than anyone, teaching "trading classes" 
But if he was as good as he says he is, all the travel, all the idiots he teaches, he would make multitudes more just trading right?

[21-Jun-19 11:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
People that cant trade, teach

[21-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Tek#5253
if you pay for lessons on trading you are a tardo

[21-Jun-19 11:44 PM] tolken#2655
Hah. Btc at 10k isn’t insane, Kmd at 0.000139 is insane.
