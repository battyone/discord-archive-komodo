[11-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
(Experienced the dump that is)

[11-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ye its tough

[11-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
market is not done yet correcting

[11-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I‚Äôm thinking how much I need in rewards as a nice additional income

[11-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
A few hundred K Kmd would be nice

[11-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye

[11-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem is that once I think, well like 5k$ additionally each month

[11-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then Im like okay but why lot 10k$

[11-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think Im now waiting for us to touch 12-13 k sats

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
majority of alt trading is automated depending on what BTC/USD is doing. then, fanboys of a particular alt just make it worst/better üòÄ

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I just keep buying

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One can never have enough

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats what I keep thinking

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Especially when its dirt cheap like nowadays

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I bought already 10 times or more this year Komodo so you see

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I buy montly

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and its not gonna stop so lol

[11-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the problem is if you buy monthly and then it dips more you want to buy more

[11-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so you can do it in bunches?

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
xD

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If we hit below 15k im buying again probably

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye Im waiting for 12-13 k sats

[11-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but for us to hit that btc needs to go to 5.8 k

[11-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and I dont want that to happen

[11-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just because things will get seriously worse than they are right now.

[11-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I kind of do

[11-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last time we bounced at 5.5k as well

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but we keep forming higher lows

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
time will tell

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Higher lows are good, no?

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
i still hate Coinbase for adding BCH without notice, that's when things started going sour with BTC/USD

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats why I dont see us going to sub 6 k

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but well

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
lets see

[11-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If we go below 6k I have some alarms on blockfolio

[11-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I whip out that fresh fiat fast enough

[11-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ahaha ye

[11-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
hopefully the crypto winter is having its break

[11-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and we can see some rebound soon

[11-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if not more time to buy komodo at lower prices :

[11-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so its a win/win situation ahah

[11-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Sdunbar#5064
eventually at a low enough price dont they just run out of money to pay all their team?

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Sdunbar#5064
the team already looked a lot smaller last i looked at the website

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In theory yes

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Sdunbar#5064
did some already get cut?

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which one?

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd?

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think the team is still the same

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think kmd team is expanding

[11-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Buddz1993#5380
charles  known as ptyvx just went for chainzilla

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats the only one I see that "left" kmd

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, we have a bigger team now

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tony is a new dev I hadnt seen before?

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Alright wasnt fultime on the team before?

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Is paying salarys/wages becoming a problem with the constantly reducing value of the coins?

[11-Sep-18 09:11 PM] snowdamn#2414
i smell troll fail, got NN costs mixed up with number of team members lol

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I‚Äôm not really sure how kmd devs are paid

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Supernet?

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright is a team member and in the QA team

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I assuming through some funds that were set aside from ICO

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I also think so

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
that may or may not have been immediately converted to USD

[11-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
but i thought it was just left as BTC

[11-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Sdunbar#5064
rather than converted

[11-Sep-18 09:13 PM] snowdamn#2414
we all rich here, don't worry
