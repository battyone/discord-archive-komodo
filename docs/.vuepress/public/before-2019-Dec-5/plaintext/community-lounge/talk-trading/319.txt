Probably laughed harder than I should have with this one 😭

Did something notable happen lately that I should be aware of in the bch abc vs sv drama? I still have both 🙃

[30-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
in a surprise out of all surprises, they decided both chains will live on. it wont be that only one coin will live, even though this was clear from the first block of the fork as the chains split at that moment and it was a foregone conclusion that this would happen.

[30-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr it was a massive PR stunt to get free press, centralized control over a multibillion dollar marketcap, not to mention take advantage of the initial steep discount on SV as everyone was made to hate it and dump it

[30-Nov-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
be careful what you believe from CSW. just a little truth mixed in with big lies

So was a promotional event costing millions of dollars with no foreseeable return ?

[30-Nov-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they have their return, bought a bunch of SV at $40, sold enough at $100 to pay for the fake "hashwars", now they centrally control SV

[30-Nov-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
net cost $0, and now they can pump and dump SV whenever they want

[30-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the ABC guys are the big losers as they participated in all this, but I guess they had to as the fake hashwar was presented in a way that the exchanges decided who got to keep the BCH ticker based on hashrate, even though hashrate had nothing to do with anything

[30-Nov-18 08:40 AM] house#8741
Geez... what a waste of crypto space that guys is. I can t understand what he thinks to gain from his shenanigans outside of tarnishing his already tarnished name ... maybe there is something I am not seeing?
Seems like a 1 step forward two steps back move. His credibility must be shot to hell now

[30-Nov-18 08:42 AM] house#8741
Else, all he wanted to do was to make ver and co waste tons of capital. In that, he prolly succeeded

[30-Nov-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
mcafee is the most trusted crypto advice, by the mass market

[30-Nov-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe the game is about mass market recognition

[30-Nov-18 08:46 AM] house#8741
That is actually quite an insightful observation... no such thing as bad press ... hmmm ... let’s cook some children

[30-Nov-18 08:48 AM] house#8741
Fun aside ... I think you might have something there that we can work with as an ecosystem

I'm anxiously waiting for faketoshi to exploit the fatal flaw in bitcoin that only he knows about.

[30-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure it is the segwit funds

[30-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
technically they are implemented as "anyone can spend" outputs and the miners follow the new segwit rules and only spend if there is a proper signature...

[30-Nov-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you had a lot of hashpower that honored the anyone can spend part and ignored the segwit signature requirement, then it seems you can spend all funds in segwit addresses

[30-Nov-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why segwit adoption had to be slow, to prevent the temptation to do this. now with so many blocks mined it is hard to go back to day one. but i guess with so much segwit tx  in each block now, it could be that a new nosegwit fork of bitcoin can arise. of course even if it is technically possible people will just keep using the segwit version of bitcoin to preserve the economic state of the current chain

whut?

[30-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats old news ...

[30-Nov-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dutch already banned a bunch of games because of it

[30-Nov-18 10:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Games only impact children as far as their parents allow them to be impacted

[30-Nov-18 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly ... gambling for children certainly isnt good.... but thats not the governments job to police that shit.

[30-Nov-18 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as lotteries and raffles exist it will always be a bunch of horseshit to speak about the "evils" of gambling and "children"

[30-Nov-18 10:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Gta liberty city cause me to want to commit crimes. It's not my fault.

[30-Nov-18 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"Gambling is bad, unless I like the form it takes"

[30-Nov-18 10:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Gambling isn't the worst part of loot boxes. The worst part is you pay $100 for a game that you don't have access to 30% of the game, and require more money to unlock, or a ridiculous amount of play time.

[30-Nov-18 10:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

There's a cure for that: stop paying
people don't pay for extra code in games and they will stop paying people to add that code 😉

[30-Nov-18 10:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, the governments job is to implement laws based on what the society who elect them, want to change.

[30-Nov-18 10:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
And I definitely don't pay for games that do that

[30-Nov-18 10:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
