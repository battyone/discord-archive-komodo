indian fakir rope trick: it'll just stop at $8k and keep hovering there

[14-May-19 11:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
unless the fakir is a total twat and it is an ill tempered cobra instead of a rope

[14-May-19 11:06 AM] Tek#5253

i am seeing this pattern ever since the recent bull stampede has started

[14-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the green line is simple the previous 24hrs average and that is acting as the floor, so the correction, retrace is only going back to the 24hr average

[14-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
from there it keeps bouncing up by 5% or so

[14-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it just rides above it for a few days

[14-May-19 12:14 PM] Vertigo#0439
They skipped alt season?

[14-May-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as BTC dominance is increasing, BTC dominance increases

[14-May-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
using that logic, until BTC dominance reverses, there wont be any altseason other than altmageddon

[14-May-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
thoughts on binance opening tomorrow?

[14-May-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
personally I think it won't change too much, just a gut feeling tho

[14-May-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c whenpullback to 7200? ðŸ˜¦

[14-May-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the 24 trailing average is already 7400, if the pattern of last weeks holds, it wont get to 7200 until deep in the next bear cycle

[14-May-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the "correction" is falling back to yesterday price

[14-May-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
trying to trade this is the equivalent of trying to catch falling knifes during bear market

[14-May-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
might as well just send all your coins to hollowman

[14-May-19 12:39 PM] Tek#5253
I took some profits when btc hit 8k yesterday, wanting to buy the retrace at 7k or so

[14-May-19 12:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have heard the argument that one should just hodl. Btc does most of its yearly gains in a handful of days that canâ€™t really be timed.  Trading a crazy manâ€™s market is... hard.

[14-May-19 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
thats 10% of my folio not riding the gains ðŸ˜¦

[14-May-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
im not a trader but look at how parabolic it is

[14-May-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
all shorters got rekt until the 8500

[14-May-19 12:49 PM] kaks#6612
