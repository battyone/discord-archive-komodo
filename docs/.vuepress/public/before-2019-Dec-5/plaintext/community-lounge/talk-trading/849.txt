There is nothing to stop btc from ath from 13.8k upwards

[26-Jun-19 10:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we reach that price, ATH will happen immediately after

[26-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Flexatron#8809
Everything gets bought up

[26-Jun-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The 6.2k range from 13.8k to 20k was litterally a pump and dump

[26-Jun-19 10:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No resistances above that

[26-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Mark81#4505
Can anyone believe what we are experiencing here? So fast.

[26-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810

[26-Jun-19 10:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Keppie#5156
I just feel stupid that im making the same mistake as in dec2017. So naive to think any of my alts would outperform bitcoin

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Tek#5253
just try to have a part btc at all times

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Tek#5253
i have learned also only just now

[26-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Tek#5253
for as long as btc is dominant you should have som btc

[26-Jun-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
the target is 16k

[26-Jun-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
then correct to like 10k

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i wouldnt expect a 30% correction so soon

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
more like a 15% to 20%

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
or even just 10%

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Flexatron#8809
100k is correct

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Tek#5253
yeah I was thinking this but some other experienced people are calling for a 30 to 40% correction

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
either at 13k400

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
or at 16k

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
NOBODY has any experience with what is happening now. it is a new occurance in history

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
years from now you will reminisce of these special days

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
nah it has gone parabolic like end of 2017

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
but this time it doesn't really fit the cycle

[26-Jun-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so far, but what if this is just the very first part of the 100k parabola

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
Yeah that could be it

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
Im not selling at all

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
don't care

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it is years ahead of the normal cycle

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
well this is the great golden bullrun

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
all the other years there was uncertainity about crypto

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253
but now everyone knows tht it isn't going away

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
so yeah... 100k by eoy?

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
anything is possible

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
if goverments start buying up

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
and companies

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253
100k soon

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] kaks#6612
if 200k i'll sell my 0.01 btc üòÖ

[26-Jun-19 10:52 AM] kaks#6612
easy money from nothing

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine a very big dam that is blocking all the water downstream. that is the BTC dominance. the higher it goes, the more water on the other side of the dam. it cant keep rising forever... and the more water that is collected, the more will eventually flow

patience

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you want to panic, that is ok too

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
nah ive been watching this shit for so long I'm immune to panic

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
this is surely a much better scenario than BTC testing new bear market lows at $1500

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
(not actually that long)

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
but i check daily

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
and a lot

[26-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Tek#5253
so

[26-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Tek#5253
when i first started out  late summer of 2017 tho

[26-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Tek#5253
I had restless nights and a lot of panic

[26-Jun-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
making another run at 13k

[26-Jun-19 10:55 AM] kaks#6612
only thing i hope that pirvacy coins be top of #10

[26-Jun-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the pullbacks are just 3% to 5%

[26-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
14 of 15 green days

[26-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Tek#5253
could also be that the rich of the world pump it to $100k with their infinite fiat

[26-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Tek#5253
just to make sure plebs can't get in anymore that easily

[26-Jun-19 10:56 AM] Tek#5253
I was talking about btc yesterday with some normies and they already find this expensive

[26-Jun-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810

[26-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Tek#5253
their faces when it reaches a million usd

[26-Jun-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and as soon as one alt reverses, then the race is on to find the next alt before it reverses

[26-Jun-19 10:57 AM] Tek#5253
m gonna stay out of the trading things

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Tek#5253
it has only cost me money and time

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Tek#5253
I buy and hold now

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if indeed trillions will be flowing into crypto, it will come into BTC first

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Tek#5253
learned my lessons

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then flow into others. any crypto in the top 100 or even 200, will do just fine

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Tek#5253
yeah I have only top 100 coins

[26-Jun-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
rising tide lifts all boats

[26-Jun-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
a rising tidal wave... well some of the boats maybe go under water a bit

[26-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Sherdogz#6731

[26-Jun-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
we all knew this was theoretically possible

[26-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Tek#5253
I remember somewhere in 2014 or so watching a video about a bitcoin miner in china

[26-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Tek#5253
the reporter asked "how high do you think this will go?"

[26-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
"Oh one millon usd easy" he said. me and my friend laughed, called it a scam and didn't look back until 2017

[26-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
its gonna hit 1 million.

[26-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Tek#5253
