I do have to say that i dont mind the market getting a fair price, what i dont like is all the manipulation in the markets

[25-May-19 01:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Im pretty sure someone is artificially keeping KMD down

[25-May-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is due to wallstreet joining the party that things have gotten worse

[25-May-19 01:26 PM] crumb#2550
that will not work forever

[25-May-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
all the altcoins are kept down via fiat pegbots

[25-May-19 01:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The ability to naked short sucks 😦

[25-May-19 01:27 PM] Markus#5464
It wont get better either with Binance opening margin trading

[25-May-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
this creates a built in bargains across the board

[25-May-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
how else to make nearly risk free and massive percentage gains?

[25-May-19 01:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Borrow money from the fed at 0 and loan it out at 3% to the masses  😃

[25-May-19 01:28 PM] Markus#5464
But why do they prefer usd over btc?

[25-May-19 01:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then fractional reserve and make big bets, if you lose, get bailed out, if you win dont worry about it 😛

[25-May-19 01:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
People are in it for the USD 😃

[25-May-19 01:29 PM] crumb#2550
as long as tech evolves and we gain actual real-world usage, let them do their thing. suddenly the cork pops and they don't know what hit them

[25-May-19 01:29 PM] Markus#5464
and when usd collapse then what? 😄

[25-May-19 01:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Hollowman will be the big man on his block

[25-May-19 01:29 PM] Markus#5464
:troll_lol:

[25-May-19 01:29 PM] crumb#2550
when usd collapses they just print more of it

No wonder 1 btc will be 1m usd sooner or later

[25-May-19 01:30 PM] Markus#5464
usd wont have value 😄

[25-May-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all fiat govts boiling the frog by inflating in sync with each other. forex is the balancing device to make sure no country is left behind

[25-May-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
for anybody with a long term memory, the cost for everything used to be much much less. yet we are to believe it is 2% inflation or less

[25-May-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
first step is to make sure education is so broken, nobody can do math

[25-May-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then it becomes easy to fiddle the numbers

[25-May-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember in argentina, they were saying inflation was "only" 40% or so. yet, prices were changing daily, maybe 10x the official rate

[25-May-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
Price of things often go up cause they increasse tax rate, look at gas price in europe....in some countries tax is close to 200% on gas

[25-May-19 01:32 PM] crumb#2550
key to understanding official inflation statistics, is that they constantly adjust the methodology. to have it "fair and accurately taking account the changes happening in economy"

[25-May-19 01:34 PM] crumb#2550
they don't need to *fiddle* the numbers, the numbers are not 1:1 comparable due to changes in methodology

[25-May-19 01:34 PM] crumb#2550
i looked into it a few years ago. very eye opening experience

[25-May-19 01:38 PM] crumb#2550
although in some cases they will fiddle with numbers if changes get too out of hand and cannot be *saved* by methodology changes

[25-May-19 01:38 PM] crumb#2550
africa, latin america more prone to go that way

@Markus we can add/update CCs on the fly

[25-May-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
no one else can do this

[25-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419

[25-May-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
People don't seem to understand how difficult it can be to get a CC into production. You typically need a team of people to test it on testnets prior to throwing it into production otherwise you will be hard forking the chain until it's 100% stable. We provide both the testnet and team of people

[25-May-19 05:47 PM] Alright#0419
an incentivized testnet for all asset chains, but not limited to just testing as the CCs can stick around after testing phase

Also the first coin to use KMD's momom scaling tech. We'll do a stress test to demonstrate some dick swingingly large tx/sec number in production at some point 😂

[25-May-19 06:58 PM] richardt#2807
Whatever happened to demonstrating 1 million tx/sec with AWS?

[25-May-19 07:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Probably wait til bull market for that,   Is it worth paying for all the servers and taking the time to coordinate it just for bragging rights.  The mechanism was proven with the 42k tps test, it scales linearly

[25-May-19 09:23 PM] richardt#2807
Market sentiment is already good and it seems there are already lots of eyes on KMD on social media at this point

[25-May-19 09:24 PM] richardt#2807
Haven't had any status updates on that for awhile.  Didn't know the team was just waiting

[25-May-19 09:30 PM] richardt#2807
Any KMD involvement with the new Amazon Managed Blockchain?  If not, seems like a missed opportunity despite the advanced partnership with AWS

[26-May-19 02:28 PM] LocoMB#8593
was that yet another planned hard fork, or some just some more  bumbling incompetence?
regardless, double sped looks reaaaallllly bad in any case..

[26-May-19 03:05 PM] Markus#5464
Binance website is fucked up for anyone else?

[26-May-19 07:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[26-May-19 07:26 PM] meatspoon#7860

okay now its down xD

[26-May-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
now down like 7%

[26-May-19 07:51 PM] Markus#5464
i dont think price matter at this point, it will come by itself it just needs time

[26-May-19 07:51 PM] Markus#5464
see it as a opportunity to buy the dip and multiply more times later xD

bear is dead

random 5% boost, this is no bear market phenomenon

[26-May-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
we might actually be in bull market, and out of the transition

well if we do TA then this triangle breakout target is 10k

[26-May-19 08:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
10k today?  you mean in 5 minutes :p

[26-May-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and in bull marketmode, 10% pullback from high is the "correction"

[26-May-19 08:06 PM] Markus#5464
will be interesting to see how all this will end....feels like fomo is kicking in
