😄  @house

[27-Nov-18 01:48 PM] Cassius#9158
You've got that right. A lot of people never would have imagined it could go so low

[27-Nov-18 01:48 PM] DrKush#8774
2700 is realist

[27-Nov-18 01:48 PM] house#8741
Nice to see you back on the block Cassius 💪🏽

[27-Nov-18 01:49 PM] house#8741
Based on what doc ?

[27-Nov-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`2700 is realist`
That's low even by my standards (3200-4600)

Yeup, I think they’ve pushed harder than expected it would go, just my opinion of course, but the fear was all too real

[27-Nov-18 01:53 PM] DrKush#8774
this is the institution played with us

[27-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Cassius#9158
Hey @house good to see you too. Wanted to look in on things, been busy with various other projects for a while

[27-Nov-18 01:53 PM] house#8741
Good for you broham, 👌

[27-Nov-18 01:53 PM] house#8741
There is a life outside of crypto then ?

[27-Nov-18 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, 2700 is pure market observation, ignoring cost-to-mine?

[27-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Cassius#9158
As far as I know, there's nothing of interest outside

Haha. I work from home now too. Full time in crypto for 2 years

[27-Nov-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one's called me "flat" in 20 years 😛

[27-Nov-18 01:58 PM] Cassius#9158

You were here pre nxt ico ?

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Cassius#9158
No

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] house#8741
Damn, I missed it by a month

[27-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Cassius#9158
Got into BTC 3 Jan 2014, though I'd seen it around a bit a while before.

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Cassius#9158
Then Nxt in April that year, and then...

[27-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Cassius#9158

Yeup ... the good old days when we were kings of the asset creation *sigh*
If only we knew then what we know now eh bud

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Cassius#9158

[27-Nov-18 02:15 PM] Cassius#9158
Still, can't complain too much

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
alot has changed since those days

_got in "late" and is still happy with profits of a $3200 BTC :trollface:_

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, much of the 😭 comes from folks buying on the bubble

[27-Nov-18 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i put my first ever mined btc into nxt ico lol shame it wasnt a full bitcoin though

[27-Nov-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everything I have/do started with $4500 buying BTC @ $460 😛

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now, my day-use GPUs cost that much 😎

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
think mine was about £20 worth of btc at the time 🤣

[27-Nov-18 02:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
landed me 2.25mill nxt which gave me a nice uplift even at those low prices

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bought at $460 and by the time cb cleared my payment BTC was @ $720 and days later $940

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
haha best way

[27-Nov-18 02:19 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
people have the opposite story this year ...

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There is about no way to duplicate where I started and how I got here, but crypto has been very very good to me

[27-Nov-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`people have the opposite story this year ...`
moral of the story:
don't buy on a high of a parabolic

[27-Nov-18 02:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
most of the people will be sat on the fence this time around no doubt and get rekt again

[27-Nov-18 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fanboyism aside, he's not always wrong

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, bitcoin stopped being bitcoin when the BTC community let Coinbase make an economically based decision that a fork is a "new coin"

[27-Nov-18 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until that is rectified, the rest is just noise

[27-Nov-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`he's not always wrong` <- didn't mean that he's always right :trollface:

[27-Nov-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and this entire "decentralised" crap`
imo, that's proof that he's **not** the Satoshi that wrote the wp (the whole '1 CPU, 1 vote' thing and all)

I secretly like to think Satoshi is still alive and watching ... laughing his arse off into his cereal bowl

[27-Nov-18 02:47 PM] house#8741
Hehe, Freudian slip but it could’ve been better

[27-Nov-18 02:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.`
AKA:
`Decentralized nodes decide what the rules are based on the most amount of votes/nodes using a given ruleset, not what some centralized group of 'gods' decree`

is he really sticking to his claim of being satoshi ?
*knows it sounds weird to ask*

[27-Nov-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dafuq are "weird commas"?

@ProfFaustus I'm retarded, I guess; so, please, explain to me how the last 2 sentences of the white paper aren't the epitome of `this entire "decentralised" crap`....

Do yoy think the real satoshi would answer somethibg like: "piss off with your socialist jizz" to a legitimate question?

[27-Nov-18 03:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@siu - Chainmakers  no good guys, just good ideas. Also initial ideas are not a holy grail - can be improved. Just some business guys prasing orig whitpaper to play the "our legacy" marketing.

[27-Nov-18 03:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What i liked since the start about the whitepaper was gow apolitical it is

[27-Nov-18 03:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also some genius people in the passt were assholes - Newton one of greatest examples :trollface:

[27-Nov-18 03:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But apolitical?

[27-Nov-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm still not convinced that bct "satoshi" is *the Satoshi* that wrote the wp

[27-Nov-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not even meaning that, I'm inclined to believe that bct "satoshi" was someone that read the paper and used the name "to be in charge" (so to speak)
more of an homage than a related person

`Small cell lung cancer is almost exclusive to life-long smokers`
One should not conflate a process with a single part of that process
Anyone that repeatedly adds particulates to their lungs will experience the same (this is why cancer is more prevalent, per capita, in non-smokers in metro areas than in 3rd world plains and mountain regions)

[27-Nov-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cars

[27-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wonder how prevalent it is in China (never looked into it)

[27-Nov-18 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you dry and smoke pepermint for 30 years it will damage lung cells too

[27-Nov-18 03:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
My wifes grabdma smoked till convalescent. She used to take her oxygen mask off to take a smoke. And hid a pack of cigs below her pillow. She had cancer 3 times. 3rd time exploted her lungs... game over
