looks like news of the rebrand is being syndicated

[16-Jul-19 01:27 AM] BlackJesus#6161
😮

[16-Jul-19 01:31 AM] bopicasso#8995
Syndicated ....?

[16-Jul-19 01:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
looks good

[16-Jul-19 01:40 AM] Sdunbar#5064
You guys messed it up for me

[16-Jul-19 01:40 AM] Sdunbar#5064
now i just see the impregnation of a lizard egg

[16-Jul-19 01:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I still like it

[16-Jul-19 01:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064

[16-Jul-19 01:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
“syndicated”

[16-Jul-19 01:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@hyperDEX

[16-Jul-19 01:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Skin isn’t dark enough

[16-Jul-19 01:45 AM] dan.#2473
So cool story today what's next

[16-Jul-19 01:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We spread this like fire on socials, ask live streamers what they think about the rebrand/tech/hollowman

[16-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You don’t want to associate me with Komodo

[16-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
just sayin

[16-Jul-19 01:57 AM] tolken#2655
I wonder how many bullshit chains will be created overnight with Antara composer. We got stats for that? 😛

[16-Jul-19 01:58 AM] tolken#2655
Would be cool to see a live graphic showing all the clusters/chains firing up,

New logo killed the hype :(

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] dan.#2473
It doesn't have instant appeal. But i can see it working

[16-Jul-19 02:14 AM] p.#1126

Its best to pump a sperm up the girls butt, so she need to fart me out for a week

I like their logo

[16-Jul-19 02:28 AM] Caglio#3337
Hm that logo really looks like ours

[16-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Caglio#3337
Are they gonna sue us ?

#rebrandingwentwrong

[16-Jul-19 02:29 AM] dan.#2473
Don't think there's really a case for that, but kind of funny

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] Caglio#3337
It would be fun if a guy who made the logo earned like 1000kmd to steal logo from others ( :

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Take it easy Caglio

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Lol it does look identical, even the color scheme is extremely close

[16-Jul-19 02:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Need to take that medication in regular intervals 😄

[16-Jul-19 02:32 AM] Caglio#3337
Mhm

[16-Jul-19 02:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I let the team know @shrk thanks

[16-Jul-19 02:34 AM] Caglio#3337
We should have used adidas logo with little komodo underneath

Na Nike, just do it

[16-Jul-19 02:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It would not be Komodo if it went smooth 😃

Re-re-logo-ing in 6 months

[16-Jul-19 02:37 AM] Caglio#3337
@p. but just the start of re-re-logo-ing - final product, at least 2-3 months later

[16-Jul-19 02:37 AM] dan.#2473
I'd be curious what other logos they passed on

[16-Jul-19 02:37 AM] grumpygoron#4320
I miss the library presentation days

[16-Jul-19 02:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Of all the things I ve lost, I miss my mind the most

[16-Jul-19 02:38 AM] shrk#2280
Actually I think it's okay that the logos are similar, almost everything in the world of design has already been invented

[16-Jul-19 02:38 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Let’s copy a logo rather than keeping our original one

[16-Jul-19 02:39 AM] Caglio#3337
It would be so funny if the whole rebrand is just new logo

[16-Jul-19 02:40 AM] shrk#2280
Check the site, it’s sexy

[16-Jul-19 02:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, looks really nice
