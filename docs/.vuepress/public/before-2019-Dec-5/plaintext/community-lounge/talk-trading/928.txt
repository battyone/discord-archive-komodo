when I joined SuperNET community and then learnt all the tech James been building that already gave me understanding that James is kinda 3-5 years ahead of everybody else in making solutions in cryptocurrency space.

[15-Jul-19 10:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That analysis is still true today.

[15-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Alecandro#1179
is this real

[15-Jul-19 10:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
lol i would like a explainer if it is, liked the older one better hehe

[15-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Malti#3948
If it is, I like it

[15-Jul-19 10:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also @Caglio you build for the future not for today, if it is for today you are already too late.

[15-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I prefered old loogo more

[15-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Caglio#3337
I must say that

[15-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
For the record I just found this on twitter

[15-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Alecandro#1179
This isnt necessarily the rebrand logo

[15-Jul-19 10:54 PM] Alecandro#1179

Well from what i have understood for example atomicDex is going to be expanded later on with more features,  i can just imagine what could be possible

[15-Jul-19 10:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well here is how i see it (sorry for people that have read this same thing many times already lol)

[15-Jul-19 10:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
atomicDEX is a mobile version of the DEX. It is the first DEX via mobile so good for marketing.

[15-Jul-19 10:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This will get people using it and trying it out.

[15-Jul-19 10:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Next comes the desktop apps. This will allow more people to use it.

[15-Jul-19 10:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Next comes the market maker functionality - this is where the magic comes into play.

[15-Jul-19 10:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will be able to hook up my app to the APIs of the exchange.

Say i want to trade KMD/BTC

[15-Jul-19 10:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD/BTC on binance is say 0.0002 as a example

[15-Jul-19 11:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
On the desktop app i can set it to 5% spread, so i list my KMD (probably need some reserves within the wallet so it can complete in a reasonable time period) automatically for whatever the price i can buy it at binance + 5%.

So in this example i would set x amount of KMD at 0.00021

[15-Jul-19 11:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This rate is always changing obviously. But when someone buys my KMD on the DEX for 0.00021 it triggers a buy on the CEX at 0.0002

[15-Jul-19 11:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Thus making the 5%

[15-Jul-19 11:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Now if you are making 5% constantly risk free, i want to do the same. But how do i make sure my sells are done before yours? I set a lower margin, i do 4.9%

[15-Jul-19 11:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Ok now joe sees how easy i am making money, he sets it to 3%

[15-Jul-19 11:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This happens over and over until the market finds the lower % they are willing to take for this free money.

[15-Jul-19 11:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Now the people that say well 1% is not worth the effort, will leave and maybe the price goes to 1.5% and they come back.

What it will do though, it make the DEX the most liquid exchange ever

[15-Jul-19 11:05 PM] yorklab#7270
What about the issue with CEX's using lots of confirmations? That would hinder that scenario I would think.

[15-Jul-19 11:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This is like the miners mining Bitcoin, the more miners the less they make but there will be eventually a balance.

[15-Jul-19 11:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@yorklab that is why you have to have a portion in the wallet.

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You will need say 5000 KMD in your DEX wallet, and BTC/KMD in the CEX

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] yorklab#7270
Ah I see. So you already own what you need.

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Like trying to arb between 2 exchanges

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Correct, you rebalance as you go, one side might have more KMD and the other BTC, then once a day rebalance

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Malti#3948
So average joe can be the middleman

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Malti#3948
?

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They are arbers üòÉ

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Malti#3948
Ah yes

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Malti#3948
Cool

[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Markus#5464
Just one quick question tho....KMD doing real atomic swap dex but lets say binance or some other big name making a token dex, how will kmd make ppl see the difference and make ppl want to use the "real" dex instead over a token dex?

[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Malti#3948
Looking forward

[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus the US gov will help us there. Any proxy dex needs money transmitter licenses üòÉ

[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So waves/bitshares is dead

[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Markus#5464
Ok i see

[15-Jul-19 11:08 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This is why i cant see a world where having the only scalable DEX = shitcoin.

[15-Jul-19 11:09 PM] Markus#5464
True

[15-Jul-19 11:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Short term price actions aside KMD will show the world how it is done, even if it takes converting 1 person to KMD a day, we will eventually win üòÑ

[15-Jul-19 11:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also why community marketing is so important

[15-Jul-19 11:10 PM] Markus#5464
True that, ive been talking to ppl at work who invest into the stock market abit about crypto and then they ask me for advice and i introduce them to kmd obviously

[15-Jul-19 11:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
:troll_hardcore:  be careful, with the bots and the whales taking control will be a roller coaster ride hehe

[15-Jul-19 11:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once we are beyond the control of <100 BTC whales the prices shouldnt be easily moved. Until that point we will dance like monkeys for our masters

[15-Jul-19 11:12 PM] Markus#5464
this bull cycle can be interesting definitely

[15-Jul-19 11:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
i stopped talking to people about crypto a while ago

[15-Jul-19 11:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Sometimes I touch myself when I talk about crypto

Thinking about the gains?

[15-Jul-19 11:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So? Was nothing will happen today?

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Alecandro looks like that logo may be right

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im confused now.

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Still doing stuff i think

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Caglio#3337
That logo sucks

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Alecandro#1179
How you see logo stuff?

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Caglio#3337
They should have put me on logo

[15-Jul-19 11:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
found a link to a website that is using it üòÑ

[15-Jul-19 11:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```Still doing stuff i think``` what would be needed today?

[15-Jul-19 11:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont think it is ready to be shown just yet, but looks ok

[15-Jul-19 11:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[15-Jul-19 11:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[15-Jul-19 11:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[15-Jul-19 11:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Anyway.

[15-Jul-19 11:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[15-Jul-19 11:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It doesnt have to do with pumps

[15-Jul-19 11:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It has to do with due dates

[15-Jul-19 11:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
