I tried to withdraw fiat from Bistamp, more than usual for I must pay taxes at the end of month, and it turned into a proctology session, aka more aml questions

[13-May-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253
weird

[13-May-19 02:02 PM] Tek#5253
is bitstamp going retard?

[13-May-19 02:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've read they do such things, may depends on amount

[13-May-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
pretty impressive action by Binance to work in the speed they do to make sure everything is staying as safe as possible

[13-May-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
"Our team is making progress and has been working through the weekend. In the past few days, we have made some significant overhauls to our system, with a large number of advanced security features added and/or completely re-architected. We will share details on some of the changes later."

[13-May-19 02:07 PM] Tek#5253
yeah binance is great

isn't it strange that he paid 40 million dollars for a "hack" that wasn't Binance's fault?

[13-May-19 02:09 PM] Keppie#5156
Safu fund covered it, not cz

[13-May-19 02:09 PM] Keppie#5156
Just part of their service

[13-May-19 02:10 PM] Markus#5464
Considering the amount of crypto they get from all  the fees im almost safe to say that they prefer to pay it themselves then lose customers

[13-May-19 02:10 PM] PTYX#6840
it just striked me as odd

[13-May-19 02:10 PM] PTYX#6840
it wasn't a binance hack

[13-May-19 02:10 PM] PTYX#6840
it was a user issue

[13-May-19 02:10 PM] PTYX#6840
according to them anyway. in regards to hackers having api, logins, and passwords.

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] Markus#5464
We can just quess and imagine what exactly happened but nobody will most likely ever get to know

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] Tek#5253
non actually

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] Tek#5253
they stole 7k btc directly from the hotwallet because of an error / bug in the segwit implementation @PTYX

[13-May-19 02:12 PM] Tek#5253
so it was a binance hack, and also possibly api keys got stolen, and emails

[13-May-19 02:13 PM] PTYX#6840
they exploited a bug within the detection system but they didn't infiltrate Binance infrastructure

[13-May-19 02:13 PM] PTYX#6840
so it's not a binance hack according to their description

[13-May-19 02:13 PM] Tek#5253
nah i saw screenshots of transactions moving out of the binance hot wallet

[13-May-19 02:13 PM] PTYX#6840
sure they could have caught the transaction going out with enough stops in place, but that's not a hack

[13-May-19 02:14 PM] Tek#5253
they were a bunch of btc withdraws in chunks of 500 to 700 btc

[13-May-19 02:14 PM] Tek#5253
totalling 7k butts

[13-May-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
im just stating the facts

[13-May-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
well what I have seen are the facts

[13-May-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
I haven't veriefied the screenshot to be real

[13-May-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
but I don't think it was fake

[13-May-19 02:15 PM] Tek#5253
they didnt, some anon who investigated did

[13-May-19 02:16 PM] Tek#5253
none of what I just said came from binance

[13-May-19 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@Tek all those movements show is someone had control of those accounts and withdrew at the same time

[13-May-19 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
the full balance was withdrawn in one tx

[13-May-19 02:16 PM] Tek#5253
no it wasnt

[13-May-19 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
bypassing the binance security checks. however, if we assume the hackers took control of those accounts via phishing, then binance shouldn't be at fault necessarily

[13-May-19 02:17 PM] PTYX#6840

no I saw screenshots they left binance in chunks of 600 btc

[13-May-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
but i could still be wrong

[13-May-19 02:17 PM] Tek#5253
just stating

[13-May-19 02:19 PM] PTYX#6840
yes, one transaction with multiple inputs

[13-May-19 02:19 PM] Tek#5253
oh right might be that i only looked at the inputs

[13-May-19 02:19 PM] PTYX#6840
it was a coordinated withdrawal

[13-May-19 02:20 PM] Tek#5253
some speculate it was csw + frens behind the hack

[13-May-19 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
to assume the full weight of the attack is strange in hindsight

[13-May-19 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
again, it wasn't a hack

[13-May-19 02:20 PM] Tek#5253
the steal then whatever lmao

[13-May-19 02:21 PM] PTYX#6840
if they did it via api

[13-May-19 02:21 PM] PTYX#6840
they wouldn't need to login to the exchange

[13-May-19 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
i think so

[13-May-19 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
they removed it now

[13-May-19 02:22 PM] PTYX#6840
well, if we assume each input is a pwned account then they could just withdraw to one address with each api

[13-May-19 02:23 PM] Tek#5253
bitcoin mooning again

[13-May-19 02:23 PM] Tek#5253

[13-May-19 02:24 PM] Tek#5253
apparently the monero inflation will drop below the btc inflation in 3 monhts

[13-May-19 02:25 PM] Tek#5253
and until the next halving, xmr will be the "big cone" with the least inflation

[13-May-19 02:25 PM] Tek#5253
im betting on it having a moon against btc back to 0.03 btc

[13-May-19 02:25 PM] Tek#5253
bc of this
