we have been working on atomicDEX for a long time

[14-Jul-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what new product are you talking about

[14-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Caglio#3337
I know, I remember barter dex

[14-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont know

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
barterdex wasnt finished, so we started atomicDEX to finish it

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Markus#5464
ur confusing urself Caglio :troll_lol:

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
notice all the other cross chain atomic swap DEX, that run on mobile phones?

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok lets look this from my perspective ( :

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW has been finished for years

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337
When I first got involved in this beautiful shining gem

[14-Jul-19 07:41 PM] Caglio#3337
Yes dPoW was there already

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
But we were a Z coin, about to get BarterDex out

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
and there was that shitty company

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Monaise ? was that the name ?

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
We waited for that

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm... Like we wait for this rebrand

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
meanwhile, we lost Z shit

[14-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Caglio#3337
barterdex didnt start as it was supposed to

[14-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Caglio#3337
Monaise was a bigger fail then time I gambled away my fiances wedding ring

[14-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Caglio#3337
So if its really a start of rebrand

[14-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont know haha

[14-Jul-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you are confused

[14-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Markus#5464

there is no way to change peoples preconceptions overnight

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont give a flying fuck about gains now, its just about to finish something finally

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
before the rebrand, there wasnt even anything we could use to communicate to people

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I remember when raiblock rebranded to nano

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
It took them how much time ?

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean we wait over a year

[14-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337
and now rebranding starts ?

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Caglio#3337
Why the fuck announcing something then, I mean makes no sense at all

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] p.#1126
you would think it would be something BIG

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] p.#1126
coming

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] p.#1126
:troll_lol:

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the long term process starts. everybody will have a clear message to communicate

[14-Jul-19 07:45 PM] Markus#5464
Why dont we just wait until tomorrow and find out?

just sell now, we never finish anything if you dont count all the things we finished

[14-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Caglio#3337
Sure, wanna buy my coins for satoshi price I paid them ?

[14-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean its not lot of them, you can afford it

[14-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
It would mean a lot to me

[14-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I owe money to ukranian mobsters

[14-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
There is a big chance I wont be able till rebrand finally kicks in

[14-Jul-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I wont be alive* not able

[14-Jul-19 07:49 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway lets not fight, but just conclude that its better to have one thing finished, and completely functional, than making 12 different break grounding techs, while we cannot have a fucking normal working wallet

[14-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Caglio#3337
1 thing at the time, and we will be mooning, 10 half products are worse than one working product

[14-Jul-19 07:50 PM] yorklab#7270
It seems to me Komodo will have that working product tomorrow.

[14-Jul-19 07:51 PM] yorklab#7270
So you won't have to wait long.

There goes my hope of @jl777c buying my share of kmd and making me able to walk the city behind 8pm without carrying a piece

[14-Jul-19 07:57 PM] Markus#5464
Not sure what u been taking Caglio

[14-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Caglio#3337
I took some mescaline 3 weeks ago, but that was exception, I am usually only using first class Puerto Rican coke

[14-Jul-19 07:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Hollowman9000  Not shitcoins Methane!

[14-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Ofc, cheap polish speed sometimes, but it gives me headaches and constant depression and suicidal thoughts

[14-Jul-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
what you really need is for BTC dominance to go below 40%

[14-Jul-19 07:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe try no drugs

[14-Jul-19 07:59 PM] Caglio#3337
How can we do that ? Should I kidnap Roger Ver ?

[14-Jul-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Actually if I kidnap him I guess he will have some cash on him

[14-Jul-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
Then I dont actually need to kidnap him, just rob him

[14-Jul-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Good idea @jl777c thank you

[14-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[14-Jul-19 08:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio i needed the laugh. atomicDEX is the continuation of barterDEX. barterDEX and hyperDEX used mm 1.0, now that was not great and if i am really honest, if i had known what i know now, i would not have done the GUI.

But now with mm 2.0 we can finish what we started.

[14-Jul-19 08:26 PM] Alright#0419
man @hyperDEX worked flawlessly when their were good bobs

[14-Jul-19 08:26 PM] Alright#0419
it wasn't the UI's fault at all

[14-Jul-19 08:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep but we had to hack the crap out of it to work.

[14-Jul-19 08:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But with mm 2.0 it seems to work flawlessly.

[14-Jul-19 08:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We are porting as quickly as we can to get hyperDEX working again üòÉ

[14-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
I think the biggest limitation of mm1 was how difficult it was to properly maintain a bob, and how alice interacted with not so well maintained bobs

[14-Jul-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
matching utxos

[14-Jul-19 08:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
NAT issues

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
networking was the worst thing

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
even utxos matching wasn't so bad IMO

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
when there were good bobs, it "just worked"

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] Alright#0419
when there weren't, it "just didn't work" ü§£

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Like CG said, he had no issues with CLI...

[14-Jul-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But we are not catering to that crowd

[14-Jul-19 08:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Matching utxos wasn‚Äôt too bad but definitely not something the average joe would do

[14-Jul-19 08:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The splitter was buggy too in BarterDEX

[14-Jul-19 08:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
From My brief experience with Atomicdex  I‚Äôd say we nailed fixing a lot of user experience issues

anyone who will use atomicDEX, it will blow their mind

[14-Jul-19 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
and, from my experience of our first DEX to compare with this one, it's amazing how much progress we made

[14-Jul-19 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
it's 1000% more reliable and easy to use

[14-Jul-19 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
no more splitting utxos
