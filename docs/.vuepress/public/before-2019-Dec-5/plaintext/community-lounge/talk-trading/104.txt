[18-Aug-18 12:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I entered in crypto space when the market was in total bottom. like when BTC was in 250+ etc. 
I know how people reacted to different projects.

[18-Aug-18 12:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no matter how good or bad

[18-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I truly believe we can change the  way of things with what you guys are developing , I see so many projects focusing or either on TPS , or on a ICO platform , or smart contracts  , how can't I beliebe when we are focusing on everything that I mentioned and much more??

[18-Aug-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only matter for a token holder is to be able to cope up with the weekly expenses. or save their investment value.

[18-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
believe*

[18-Aug-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
everything else to them is later.

[18-Aug-18 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless some are actually developing and innovating on the tech they have the token of.

[18-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
multi wallet its perfect and works like a charm.

[18-Aug-18 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[18-Aug-18 12:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I know many will be here who actually understands the tech, and are not just an investor mindset only 🙂

[18-Aug-18 12:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm having the feeling the hard times are ahead. what we see is just the start.

[18-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380

@jl777c  are there any public articles (announced?) for these new China rankings? I think China will take it as seriously as it is advertised 😃 If it's on a not advertise webste on internet no one will see it and no one will take it serious

[18-Aug-18 12:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in my country sometimes gov make official ann about things on some langind pages no one ever goes to or even no one knows it exist... impact is no one really knows it

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
chinese govt office is doing its own promotions

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Did anyone from kmd approach them to explain and discuss tech? Or was this all their own research into us 😮

[18-Aug-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
we were not approached

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and we did not approach them

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we sent out some inquiries after we debuted at #5, but I didnt hear that we got any response

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
A third place ranking is not anything you can buy with money

[18-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Hegelian#0018
Is IOTA a good coin from a technical standpoint?

[18-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Hegelian#0018
Technical as in their tech not their chart lol

[18-Aug-18 07:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No idea

[18-Aug-18 07:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[18-Aug-18 08:39 PM] NNoperator#3835
from coinbase:

[18-Aug-18 08:39 PM] NNoperator#3835
There's a new coin on the block.    Exciting news Glass JAR  — Ethereum Classic (ETC) is now available on Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase app.

Be one of the first to buy, sell, or send our newest addition with Coinbase's secure, easy-to-use platform.

[18-Aug-18 08:40 PM] NNoperator#3835
regarding ETC being available on their platform

[18-Aug-18 08:41 PM] NNoperator#3835
Not exactly new,  could argue that it is older than ETH  (which it is to be honest)

[19-Aug-18 03:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
Kmd Btc fund for notarization to at least 2030 i believe

[19-Aug-18 03:08 PM] dontrustverify#1166
What does that mean?

[19-Aug-18 03:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
That KMD can notarize up to 2030+ with current BTC holdings so the chain can be keep alive and secure till than no mater the bear

[19-Aug-18 03:10 PM] dontrustverify#1166
Shure Shure , buy the price can easily go below 10k 8k satoshi no ? If bitcoin bleeds until 3000$ October 2019

[19-Aug-18 03:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[19-Aug-18 03:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Keep an eye on BTC dominance in market share as compared to alts

[19-Aug-18 03:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Check log scale

[19-Aug-18 03:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Check market behaviour as per news and rumours

[19-Aug-18 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[19-Aug-18 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅 yea and that too

[19-Aug-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can end up doing the reverse

[19-Aug-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or if you are wrong more than correct, just do the opposite your instincts tell you to do

I think the stock market is going to crash late 2018 early 2019

[19-Aug-18 11:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
With that crash my price predictions will come true

[19-Aug-18 11:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Btc 2-3k

[19-Aug-18 11:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm thinking kmd 30-50cents

[19-Aug-18 11:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's my strategy for buying in

[19-Aug-18 11:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Even if banks don't get bailed out there fdic insurance will have to print money to make good on their "garuntee" of money insurance in the event of a bank being illiquid. Which is going to set the stage for hyperinflation within 5 years after this crash

[20-Aug-18 12:00 AM] BlackJesus#6161
The stock crash will be bottom of the crpyto bear market. You heard it here first.

[20-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC 2-300k

[20-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD $30-50

[20-Aug-18 12:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sounds like your strategy for getting left behind

[20-Aug-18 12:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s okay though, I’m comfortable sitting on the deck of the boat, drink in hand, watching the gamblers run down the dock scrambling to get back on, cheap entertainment

[20-Aug-18 12:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some will miss the boat

[20-Aug-18 12:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I have holdings right now. I'm just timing my big buy-in

[20-Aug-18 12:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It'll honestly be the difference if me being well off and stupid well off :/

[20-Aug-18 12:06 AM] BlackJesus#6161
