so... at what point does KMD become a good buy?

[07-Aug-19 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
overall volume keeps falling with price.

[07-Aug-19 12:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think we wont pass the 80-90 cents range..

[07-Aug-19 12:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so somewhere between that area

[07-Aug-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the lack of interest is astonishing.

[07-Aug-19 12:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed but that's who to blame?

[07-Aug-19 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[07-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Markus#5464
ppl are just silly

[07-Aug-19 12:59 PM] costa2439#3771
The price will rise when supernet and other assets.  Start distributing dividends regularly.  It is a real way to get rich.  You don't need marquetin, you need a viable way to enrich people

The price will rise when btc finish his move

[07-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Markus#5464
im probably the person being most negative about SuperNet and other assets related to DEX payouts

[07-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Markus#5464
to me its the worst system ever

[07-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Caglio#3337
The price will rise like a phoenix

[07-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Caglio#3337
How many times that was correct ( zero )

[07-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Caglio#3337
Last bottom = 0 satoshies

[07-Aug-19 01:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
There is a lot sketchy things about komood

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
komodo

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] phm87#7395
I think that AtomicDEX fees will go to this revenue scheme and DEX hodlers @Markus  see arrows here above

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Caglio#3337
Binance pushing it forward for a while

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Oszy#5734
1k btc wall getting destroyed

[07-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Markus#5464
I know @phm87 that is just the issue i have with it

[07-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Markus#5464
those coins barely exist, not being traded and were created probably before kmd even existed

[07-Aug-19 01:09 PM] phm87#7395
I don t hodl any of these. I may buy 1 DEX for the fun

[07-Aug-19 01:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Markus those coins paid initial development, before it was Komodo. Long term holders that made this possible

[07-Aug-19 01:10 PM] phm87#7395
@Markus the big oil company from South Arabia is owned by few ppl, not traded but it is still worth billions

[07-Aug-19 01:11 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that some DEX CEX and OTC on these coins can be good

[07-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Markus#5464
those coins should not even exist

[07-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Markus#5464
should of been converted to 1 coin

[07-Aug-19 01:11 PM] Markus#5464
not spread out in 6-8 different coins

[07-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Markus#5464
98% of ppl here today probably dont even know it exist

[07-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Markus#5464
and if ppl would like to get some they cant cause nobody trade them

[07-Aug-19 01:12 PM] Markus#5464
have just seen Dex trades

[07-Aug-19 01:12 PM] phm87#7395
I saw other trades on barterlly or another platform

[07-Aug-19 01:13 PM] phm87#7395
Of other coins I mean

[07-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Markus#5464
anyway its just my own opinion what i myself think about it

[07-Aug-19 01:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
think if you would have hold any assets during 5 years of development with all possible risks, including jl hitting bus, and 2 full cycles of bear market. It's not that easy
