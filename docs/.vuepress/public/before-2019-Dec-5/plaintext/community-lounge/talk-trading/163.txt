BTCD shows the entire fallacy of TA

[18-Sep-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but if enough people follow it, the price behaves according to TA

[18-Sep-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there is clearly a separation between value and price

[18-Sep-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and anybody that says that markets are efficient and price in everything is just being ignorant of the reality

[18-Sep-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some day the people with the big money will be understanding the crypto at a more fundamental level

[18-Sep-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
until then people will see something go up 50% and use that to justify buying

[18-Sep-18 05:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
and they said you needed to be around in 2009 to be a crypto pioneer 😏

[18-Sep-18 05:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  this was your comment yesterday "Personally, I despise the fact that ETH exists over ETC, but I'm still waiting for a single, rational argument that states why BTC is a more valuable (aka "better") "store of value" than ETH [specifically 30x] or KMD [specifically 6300x]...."

[18-Sep-18 05:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
and this was my answer "up until now, i think btc still statistically prove that it is a better store of value than eth or kmd, if we look at the trading volume , drop from ATH, adoption ...  not sure about the future though"

[18-Sep-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no need to remind me what I said, I have nearly perfect recall about the things **I** say...
I'm still waiting for you to explain your counter position as to how someone that purchased BTC at $19k has a "store of value" at $6.2k (given that markets are your claim support)...

[18-Sep-18 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
someone that purchased BTC at $19k as a "store of value" at $6.2k would only have a "better" "store of value" than KMD if KMD were now at 0.0019 cents

[18-Sep-18 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given that BTC is a perceived 6300x

[18-Sep-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
real estate is probably a better store of value than crypto, its just not so easy to fit into your pocket

it tends to keep up with inflation, even can generate income

[18-Sep-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe assetized NYC parking spots would be a good crypto store of value

[18-Sep-18 05:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  sorry I don't get what you said, if I bought btc from ATH, it's -68% now, for eth it's -85%, as for kmd it's -91%

[18-Sep-18 05:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so btc is the best store of value in this case ?

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
depends on your HODL limits and where price will be when HODL is not an option 😉

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i think real estate would have been better

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
-30% in real estate is rare

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you dont purchase during a bubble

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That it has lost less value isn't a valid support that it has a greater "store of value"; because, words

[18-Sep-18 05:29 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@jl777c  agreed,  we are comparing btc, eth & kmd

[18-Sep-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
using the worst possible trade strategy is not likely a good way to analyze

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that 👆

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why people use the "loss from ATH" as some justification for anything

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
who buys at ATH?

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
compare buying KMD at ICO vs holding BTC

[18-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is 50% better store of value in this case

[18-Sep-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if some sort of long term dollar cost averaging is used to compare, then the differences between the three would depend on exactly when you started

[18-Sep-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
hey, but if you count from ATL to now, then I think KMD wins that comparison as the ATL for KMD is some very low panic sell price

[18-Sep-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
basically you can prove whatever you want to just by picking the right comparison to make

[18-Sep-18 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_just sits back, holds, and waits for the day when BTC loses its delusion based god-like status and value has some measurable basis..._

[18-Sep-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you can sell call options on BTC and generate income, you just need to sacrifice any upside

[18-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD panic low

this starts looking like a double bottom.

[18-Sep-18 06:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
could be a Fallacy or not... still a good probability of a profitable trade

[18-Sep-18 06:03 PM] jorian#4555
BTC is getting squeezed too

[18-Sep-18 06:03 PM] jorian#4555
many expect downward movement

[18-Sep-18 06:03 PM] jorian#4555
and when BTC goes down, alts go down

[18-Sep-18 06:03 PM] jorian#4555
🤷

[18-Sep-18 06:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
for every $1k BTC drop from here add 1 year to the wait 😧

[18-Sep-18 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
i'd say a huge spike in BTC would make bear market duration longer

[18-Sep-18 06:05 PM] snowdamn#2414
$12k to be safe

[18-Sep-18 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
we haven't had capitulation

[18-Sep-18 06:06 PM] jorian#4555
this 6k isn't capitulation

[18-Sep-18 06:06 PM] jorian#4555
it's hope

[18-Sep-18 06:06 PM] jorian#4555
but we need to kill that hope

[18-Sep-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414

[18-Sep-18 06:06 PM] snowdamn#2414
y u bear, jorian? 😀

Everyone says that like it’s prophecy to be fulfilled

[18-Sep-18 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this reminds me of the times when C waves failed

[18-Sep-18 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
everyone expected a new LL that never came

[18-Sep-18 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and you kept doing bad moves while the market inched up slowly

[18-Sep-18 06:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i might be wrong, but i do remember sentiment like this back in the day.

[18-Sep-18 06:08 PM] jorian#4555
well one thing that is hopeful is the shorts:

we're above $6k and all those fools need to cover

[18-Sep-18 06:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
eventually

[18-Sep-18 06:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
if we go to $2.5k, i will be the fool 😅

[18-Sep-18 06:10 PM] jorian#4555
$4k

[18-Sep-18 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
but yeah, it'll probably go lower

[18-Sep-18 06:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$4k would be nice if the rest of the markets can break away from following BTC as if it were *the* thing to decide all things

[18-Sep-18 06:14 PM] jorian#4555
BTC is still the mothership, it will take a long time

[18-Sep-18 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sadly true 😭

[18-Sep-18 06:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
alts will follow BTC until it makes new ATH, then break off, need to think optimal haha

[18-Sep-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well the 1st step would be to stop using the feken term `alts` 😣

[18-Sep-18 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's, literally, impossible for a breakaway as long as the prevailing mentality is that BTC is *the* thing and all other things are as some alternative

@siu - Chainmakers  do you think

[18-Sep-18 06:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
usd gowin up may impact BTC (investors shorting BTC for USD bonds or sth?)

[18-Sep-18 06:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if big players do so they can impact market a lot

[18-Sep-18 06:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Has KMD finally found support here at 16k sats

[18-Sep-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I support the idea of it going back to 70k sats, does that count?
