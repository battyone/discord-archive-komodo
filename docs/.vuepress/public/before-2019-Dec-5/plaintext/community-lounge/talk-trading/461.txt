one thing that has helped me doing research is measuring WTF-s per minute (what the feks per minute) while reading whitepapers. if i get too many WTF moments, then it's probably not worth my time. @74D30

[10-Mar-19 06:30 PM] crumb#2550
basically it's a measure if everything written makes sense and sounds logical enough.

If the whitepaper is a marketing document, its probably not a good thing to buy

[10-Mar-19 07:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If the whitepaper is a cryptographic research paper, it probably is a solid project, which means that the market will completely ignore it and chase the pump and dump scams instead üòÑ

**KOMODO ECOSYSTEM AIRDROP / GIVEAWAY **
*Not spam*

Hey guys! For those of you who know, OPay/OCryptoUnion has recently onboarded onto the Komodo platform. 
Utilizing Komodos existing contracts as well as blockchain, they have developed a platform for crypto loans (Similar to Salt/Nexus) and by doing so, also have introduced a very important aspect to Komodo.
KSB (komodo debt backed stable coin) No more shitty tether with their unredeemable tokens, or printing like banks.

KSB will be powering ZADDEX, a DEX which will list komodos ecosystems coins. KSB allows any coins (komodo ecosystem or not) to be traded and be used as a fiat gateway. Ultra low fees, KSB is redeemable for FIAT instantly by bank.
OCU is also working on a launchpad, with a partnership with Africas biggest Stock market exchange, they aim to help fund start up companies in Ivory coast, start a VC, and a whole lot more.

Think of O crypto Union as the head, with many branches like their launchpad, dex, stable coin, loans, vc 

I know a lot of posts get buried under the constant talks here (and I love it) but for those of you who are looking into a coin, this is one to keep an eye on.
Total supply of around 130m, trading at 1c, it is currently at around 1m marketcap, tiny considering what they have already achieved, and with @Fab√ò  leading the project (formerly worked at goldman sachs), 
his vision is to create something amazing with the tech komodo is providing.

I would like to help spread the love to my fellow komodians. Some of you got my KMD airdrops in the past *cough* @Caglio 

I would like to further donate to the amazing community that komodo is

**I am giving away multiple lots of ~~15,000~~ ~~10,000~~ 2500 OUR simply message me, leave a comment, or engage in some talk and I will send them to your komodo address üòÉ OUR is accessible on Agama.**

@bishop  its a promissory note with less than 9 months duration , it‚Äôs an exception in the securities law ( reves family resemblance test )

[12-Mar-19 12:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That said, promissory notes are generally defined as securities unless they mature in 9 months or less.  (Securities Act 2(1), 3(a)(3); Exchange Act 3(a)(10)).

[12-Mar-19 12:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Judicial Exceptions include:

A note delivered in consumer financing; or
A note secured by a mortgage on a home; or
Any short-term note secured via a lien or assets of a small business; or
Any note evidencing a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù loan to a bank customer; or
Short-term notes secured via assignments to accounts receivable; or
Any note which formalizes an open account debt incurred in the ordinary course of business, especially when collateral is involved.
