[06-Aug-19 05:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Regardless , rebrand is done it provides a good base for the future

[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] Sanyadurnov#9361
Guys, what do u think, why coinbase no added kmd?

[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] p.#1126
Lol

[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
just feed the vicious cycle

[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
"No human will ever buy a KMD ever again.  It will only be sold from one bot to another at lower and lower prices until 0.  Then it will be delisted from all exchanges and be completely dead, forever."

[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] Caglio#3337
@Sanyadurnov top tech, noone would buy other coins if kmd was there

KMD's logo is a sperm, to represent the fucking you will receive if you buy it!

@Alexfrog good work dude

[06-Aug-19 05:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Did you guys know that the reason kmd is dropping is cuz it's pegged to 1USD

[06-Aug-19 05:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Kmd will always equal 1USD

[06-Aug-19 05:17 AM] Caglio#3337

But i like u

[06-Aug-19 05:17 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I paid BTC for it.  Since BTC's true value is infinity, and KMD is worth $1, I have lost $infinity on it.
