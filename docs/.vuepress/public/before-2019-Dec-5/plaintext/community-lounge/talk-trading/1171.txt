All these btc price predictions about 200k are from the same muppets who with 0 experience shilled you all those alt gems that are now -9000%.

The same idiots who have been in markets for 1 year or 2 max.

This is who you follow. Gfy.

@glassnode posted a chart of address counts with 1000BTC or more today, it prompted me to look back further in time, this is amazing.

The rate of growth of 1000BTC addresses now matches the early growth in Bitcoin's network...

Just learned about "props" in trading after listening to the "Chat with Traders" podcast...They usually talk about stocks etc, but there might be some for crypto too:

Prop Shop
A prop shop, short for proprietary, is a trading firm that deploys its own capital in pursuit of trading profits. Prop shops can go long, go short, or do both.

The interesting thing is that some even pay the traders a salary and give them the capital (and top software) to trade, which they often even lose while learning during the first year or so, just because they see the potential in them

"richardt: "LocoMBToday at 11:14 AM
is syscoin still a thing? goes to check cmc
... jeez .. I can't make anything out of the gobbledigook there- I remember syscoin was aiming to become a blockchain marketplace- what happened to that?"
Pretty much what happens to every project making bold statements and never delivering to the scale at which it aims to deliver"

Not so much.  Syscoin delivered mainnet w/ marketplace initially way back in 2014, and did evolve it forward with Blockmarket before pursuing refactored design.  "Never delivering to the scale at which it aims" is a little ironic to read. "Never" is a strong word considering Syscoin 3 and 4 releases delivered their intended purpose - a streamlined blockchain and protocol for supporting services at scale. If Syscoin GitHub wasn't very active, I'd be satisfied with your statement, but it's busy. That team through its own experience as well as client interactions seems to have learned a lot in the past several years in regard to what does and does not belong on a blockchain. Apparently that's something a lot of other projects are still coming to terms with, with some even trying to implement many of the same things Syscoin already did and later determined were bloat factors best handled in other ways (e.g. "Aliases" and a range of other native smart contracts onchain). Decentralized service at enterprise scale demands quite a bit of innovation and groundwork. They're still producing.

A MAJOR step. Now you can trade $BNB ETP on Swiss Stock Exchange (Ticker: $ABNB).
