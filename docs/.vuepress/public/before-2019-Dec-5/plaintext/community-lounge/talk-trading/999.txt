worrying about getting the perfect tops and bottoms would take anyone to the loony bin pretty quick

Ledger making fun of Zooko, lulz

[03-Aug-19 11:18 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wasn't this zooko guy supposedly involved in creating btc

[03-Aug-19 11:18 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why he need more cash lol

[03-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
No

[03-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
and No

[03-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
he makes 2000 ZEC per month already

[03-Aug-19 11:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
Zooko has beeen involved in open source a long time, and used Bitcoin early on, but I would not say he had anything to do with "creating" BTC, that is a stretch

[03-Aug-19 12:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Arrr and k64 are my portfolio sinkholes at the moment

[03-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Markus#5464
ouch pirate -20% against btc

[03-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Arrr is just lack of interest

[03-Aug-19 12:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
k64 is too much bullshit floated out previously that didn‚Äôt come to fruition

Memba when u used to join shitcoin telegrams and the admins would say "we have partnership under NDA we cant announce yet" and you would believe those muppets and fomo buy bags?

Then those bags would go -90% because it wasn't true.

Junkie membas.
