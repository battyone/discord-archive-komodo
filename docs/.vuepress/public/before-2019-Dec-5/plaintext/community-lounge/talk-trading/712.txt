7.5k is quite low

[30-May-19 05:19 PM] jorian#4555
8350 has 2 supports

[30-May-19 05:19 PM] jorian#4555
if it breaks there, we don't know how low

[30-May-19 05:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it was above 9000 only for the length of time it took to post one dragonball meme, then tanked

[30-May-19 05:20 PM] jorian#4555

would like to see a red weekly candle

[30-May-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
cant see how this rise is sustainable if it keeps going parabolic without pullbacks or sideways going

[30-May-19 05:22 PM] 차미숙#8912
It is a weird chart indeed

[30-May-19 05:22 PM] jorian#4555
you are a bear, therefore we will be bullish

[30-May-19 05:22 PM] 차미숙#8912
I have never seen a chart like this

[30-May-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
im not a bear but come on i dont see how this is sustainable at all, if this was in a bull market this would soon be in euphoria stage

charlize theron is ready to find a love of her life

[30-May-19 05:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mind-melt:
Charlize Theron is an African-American

[30-May-19 05:24 PM] 차미숙#8912
But then if you think about how much things have fallen for a long time, it's merely a slight recovery

[30-May-19 05:24 PM] Caglio#3337
she is from south africa

[30-May-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I heard they do ass to mouth

[30-May-19 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[30-May-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337

[30-May-19 05:25 PM] Caglio#3337

[30-May-19 05:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I would rather buy Ford Ranger, so when I drive drunk and drugged to be sure I do not kill myself

[30-May-19 05:28 PM] Caglio#3337

[30-May-19 05:43 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
@Markus im waiting for adoption + institutional investors + high quality, mature products

[30-May-19 05:44 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
