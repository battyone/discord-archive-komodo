but after that gets filled the bots will start the tankening

[17-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
during the hacker attack i think it dropped pretty low, even lower maybe

[17-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
0.2 cents

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i think the decline wiped every trader out of KMD, and those who remain now are long term, or traders who got stuck and their trade is now a long term trade

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] dokrates#8987
komodo was hacked?

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess people thought we couldnt fix things

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it was during the very early days

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
still had some significant bugs, we we solved it pretty fast

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
then got hit with another attack

[17-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and then a third one, all in the same week

[17-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Tek#5253
a fren his server got deleted once again ( discord )

[17-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Tek#5253
is there a decentralized discord blockchain app?

[17-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I remember buying some Komodo at 5k sats.

[17-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Tek#5253

😮 

[17-Apr-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
actually i think it was trading at 5k sats, as the ico was at about 10k sats

[17-Apr-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so the hack must have panic some who sold to 500 sats

[17-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i dont think it ever went below about 6k or so on bittrex did it?

[17-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253

[17-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Tek#5253
> he didn't buy KMD at 0.002 cents

[17-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I also purchased a handful of BTCD at 35 cents and held them until the Komodo swap. Wasn't many but has to be the lowest ico price you could get.

[17-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
73.34% rfox target has been reached on round 2 😄

[17-Apr-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
in the first 3 hrs, but it seems most in asia went to sleep

[17-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's still dawn in most parts of Asia. So we'll see

[17-Apr-19 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810

[17-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Tek#5253

I have to go through nicotine withdrawls, and a mooning kmd would totally satiate my dopamine receptors

@Tek every time I saw a "KMD appreciation thread" on /biz/ it was full of nay-sayers

[17-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Tek#5253
things changed now

[17-Apr-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
I did threads on both KMD and DASH regularly

[17-Apr-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253
dash didn't seem to have sticked much

[17-Apr-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253

[17-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253

[17-Apr-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
only privacy loss

[17-Apr-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if you worry about that, just make a new address

[17-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Tek#5253
im in agama wallet it has a receive button then it has a create invoice button

[17-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Tek#5253
but not a "make a new address thats also unlockable with your current private keys" thing

[17-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Tek#5253
I'm not really worried about it but I should be so lets do this the correct way even if its going to take a bit longer

[17-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Tek#5253
sad there isn't a "generate extra address" in agama

[17-Apr-19 08:09 PM] Tek#5253
lmao yeah that works, I've used it before
