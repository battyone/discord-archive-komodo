Ichimoku Cloud

[28-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Acura#2748
Price over the cloud =  bullish

[28-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Acura#2748
Price under the cloud = bearish

[28-Dec-18 11:36 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah really nice action, this to me is confirmation of breakout, next we need follow through.

[28-Dec-18 11:37 AM] ver_User#6608
*almost confirmation, but in reality the action and volume are pretty good to just call it breakout already

[28-Dec-18 12:14 PM] actionslacks#4072

Rocks are good for things too.  I see a bunch of South City Skeleton Keys there around the gold bar.  They can open any house on the block.

@blackjok3r is there a file size limit? That's pretty nifty

[28-Dec-18 06:43 PM] Vertigo#0439
Nice $0.80

[28-Dec-18 06:44 PM] Vertigo#0439
17 cents more to where I bought my main stack lol

[28-Dec-18 06:44 PM] Markus#5464
why ppl always look at usd price?^^

[28-Dec-18 06:45 PM] Vertigo#0439
Because you buy and cash out on usd

[28-Dec-18 06:45 PM] Markus#5464
why u cash out

[28-Dec-18 06:46 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
BTC should go up to 4.5k and KMD to 1.2 $ or so

[28-Dec-18 06:46 PM] tolken#2655
$1.2, that‚Äôd be a nice appetizer.

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
1.2$ will come automatically if btc increasses price

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Markus  you cash out when bottom, cash in when top, allways remember that :trollface:

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
oh yes ofc üòÑ

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Vertigo#0439
@Markus Because that is what the whales do eventually

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
not rly

[28-Dec-18 06:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
now all depends how well you can predict bottom :abusedsmily:

[28-Dec-18 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
to me if u gonna cash out crypto to usd...u might aswell trade stocks

[28-Dec-18 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
if ur in crypto and hold alt coins, u take profits in btc

[28-Dec-18 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
not usd

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] tolken#2655
Markus, all just numbers and how you want to look at them.

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] tolken#2655
makes no difference really.

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] Vertigo#0439
To me if you would have cash out when BTC was 20k and buy again with usd you would have 8x the amount you have now

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yeah - why yo ucash out in numebrs bro? why not flowers

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or crypto kittties

[28-Dec-18 06:49 PM] Markus#5464
or u traded it into stable coins, thats crypto üòâ

[28-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Vertigo#0439
Well stable coins are based in usd lol

[28-Dec-18 06:50 PM] tolken#2655
Usd or USDC, doesn‚Äôt differ much really, for a us trader anyway.

[28-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Vertigo#0439
That is why I use USD instead of BTC price

[28-Dec-18 06:51 PM] Markus#5464
if u cash out usd ur gonna pay taxes, if u trade to stable coins u wont have to deal with taxes

[28-Dec-18 06:51 PM] Vertigo#0439
Yes you do. Well yes you are supposed to

[28-Dec-18 06:51 PM] tolken#2655
@Vertigo the problem I see with only looking at usd valuation, is that you loose a dimension of information to base your trades on.

[28-Dec-18 06:52 PM] tolken#2655
I like to look at the price interrelation of crypto.

[28-Dec-18 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
who will know if u hold stable coins, its literally impossible to know ur coin address and i doubt a exchange would snitch u on holding stable coins during a bear market

[28-Dec-18 06:53 PM] tolken#2655
@Markus In US, pay taxes on USD or USDC, or even if you dump BTC for LTC, you are technically obligated to pay tax in all scenarios.

[28-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Vertigo#0439
Yeah ...

[28-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Markus#5464
and who gonna do the researsh if u mentioned nothing

[28-Dec-18 06:54 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, lots of ways to skirt the law, but that‚Äôs another discussion all together. The risk reward isn‚Äôt high enough for me.

[28-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Vertigo#0439
Depends on the amount more than 10k gets reported by Coinbase or bittrex

[28-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Vertigo#0439
Or Gemini

[28-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Markus#5464
so u hold less then 10k at a time üòÑ

[28-Dec-18 06:56 PM] tolken#2655
Hah.  Good luck Markus üòÉ

[28-Dec-18 06:56 PM] tolken#2655
I appreciate your rebellious nature üòÉ

[28-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
i mean it sux being from the US but in my country u only mention anything when u decide to sell for fiat, if u dont u dont tax anything

[28-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
so u simply dont convert to fiat

[28-Dec-18 06:58 PM] Markus#5464
nice discussion tho haha üëç

[28-Dec-18 06:59 PM] tolken#2655
wish it was that way in US. That would be quite a tax haven. They can‚Äôt have it that way. Kids, roads... you know. To help people. üòõ

[28-Dec-18 07:03 PM] tolken#2655
The closest thing I  think I could ever come to concenting to taxation; is if it were restricted to corporations, not individuals. Corporations being entities that are given the  special privileges they have provided by government and most importantly  considering they‚Äôre voluntarily formed, seem like the least offensive and entity to tax.

[28-Dec-18 07:03 PM] Markus#5464
whole tax system is a scam

[28-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
think like this

[28-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
if for example your city decides to build a new shopping center, they pay lets say 1 billion to get the job done. Then they get back a huge portion of it from taxes

[28-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
great discount

[28-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
If i want to build a new house do i get same opportunity?

[28-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
nope

[28-Dec-18 07:05 PM] tolken#2655
right, tax incentives allow government to vector resources where they choose. Often times right into their friends pockets.

[28-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
ye ofc
