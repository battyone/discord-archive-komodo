[07-Oct-18 03:25 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is komodo a better investment than btc?

[07-Oct-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a dog 💩 is a better investment than BTC

[07-Oct-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo

[07-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
why?

[07-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
saying that is very bold my friend

[07-Oct-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because Core has no interest in advancing the tech of Bitcoin any farther than it suits their personal wants, Core over-promotes the "value" of everything they do, and Core perpetuates the myth that LN is "part of Bitcoin".

@Stephen Daniels , its computer genie, he is an outlier

[07-Oct-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but in the long term, it is quite a reasonable point of view

[07-Oct-18 03:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yes, @siu - Chainmakers,  it's but a select few that base the value of a tech currency on its tech

[07-Oct-18 03:34 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
yeah it is, however the market isnt rational

[07-Oct-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
in the long run it averages out

👌 

[07-Oct-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
or even a stopped clock is right twice a day

[07-Oct-18 03:34 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
there is imperfect understanding and most crypto buyers dont think about that

[07-Oct-18 03:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
bitcoin may be lagging in tech advancement, but saying dog shit is more valuable is quite radical

[07-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
@jl777c do you think we are many years away from average people figuring out that btc aint all that great

[07-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really, a dogshit changes over time

[07-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will take years for the average people to figure it out

[07-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the big question is how much BTC the average peoples have

[07-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto reallocates resources faster than any other industry that I know of

[07-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
< 10% would be my estimate

[07-Oct-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
likely about right, which means that when the majority players are more vested in non-BTC than BTC, they could make a flippening and then the rest would follow

[07-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
coinbase has 25 million users and there are only 21 million bitcoins

[07-Oct-18 03:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
on a strictly central exchange trading level, BTC's role is crucial
don't need to touch fiat and can move between exchanges that do not list same coins
the day might come where there is no such need, but, today, BTC is boss level

[07-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
theres not enough for even each upper middle class coinbase user to buy even one bitcoin

[07-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Yassin#3685
25 million users * 0.0001 btc

[07-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Yassin#3685
:trollface:

[07-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
crude oil isnt anything an upper middele class person needs to purchase

[07-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yet is seems pretty important in the global scheme of things

[07-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
well i just meant that most coinbase users are middle or mid- upper class americans

[07-Oct-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`on a strictly central exchange trading level, BTC's role is crucial`
To allow exchanges like CB to decide what "is BTC" is every bit as bad as going back to fiat

[07-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
no its not

[07-Oct-18 03:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
exchanges will be dominated by regulated stable coins

[07-Oct-18 03:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
might be bad, but invaluable

[07-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
fiat and bitcoin are not substitutes

[07-Oct-18 03:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
my believe is that the next bull run will be triggered by the stable coins regulated by the SEC that are coming out.

[07-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
btc is only alternative to fiat, the dollar still has a hundredyears left in its life

[07-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Stephen Daniels Today at 10:42 AM
no its not`
You're right it's far worse to remove consensus from currency and put it in the hands of 1 person than to use fiat controlled by an entire govt

[07-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
we wont have a bull run till late 2019

[07-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
its not in the hands of one person nor will it ever be,

[07-Oct-18 03:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not talking about timeframes

[07-Oct-18 03:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just stating what could be the underlying catalist

[07-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
point is, in 2019 btc might be dead

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its not in the hands of one person nor will it ever be`
Seems you missed why the fork of Bitcoin was canceled 🙄

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you think brian armstrong controls btc lol?

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Regulated FDIC insured stable coins will make a difference for mom and pop traders in the USA

[07-Oct-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt he control coinbase?

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if people use stable coins as reference instead of BTC, this is the beginning of the downfall

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC would need to stand on its own merits, instead of being the universal clearance currency

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is where its going in the USA

[07-Oct-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The economics of BTC forced any actual Bitcoin protocol consensus out of the hands of users and permanently into the hands of Core and CB was the singular force to do it

[07-Oct-18 03:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
personally, i won't touch national stablecoins until banks allow direct deposit 🤓 
and will only do so when exiting

[07-Oct-18 03:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need a non regulated stable coin, pegged by blockchain tech and not by a institution.

[07-Oct-18 03:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
agree

[07-Oct-18 03:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
something like the makerDAO is trying to do

[07-Oct-18 03:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
much hard

[07-Oct-18 03:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that using gateways cc, price cc and a specialized blockchain that burned or generated coins accordingly to the holdings in the gateway.

[07-Oct-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
fiat would still require trust

[07-Oct-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only one way I know to do this totally decentralized without many volume limits

a KMD doubling would be very nice right about now 🙏

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
I will wait until people test the CC i wrote a month ago and catch up

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the point for more tech, when we are not testing the tech I already make

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
true... i got stuck at gateways cc as it is 😦

[07-Oct-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
need to catch up

[07-Oct-18 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Always be on the look out, because you never know when you'll be stalked by hit-men that eat nothing but cream cheese....

Tron peeps are going nuts.  Over what I have no clue.  Looks like it went up for no apparent reason.
