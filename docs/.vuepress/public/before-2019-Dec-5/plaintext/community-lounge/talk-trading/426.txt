[18-Feb-19 01:22 PM] jorian#4555
bittrex seems to lead the price rise here

[18-Feb-19 01:22 PM] jorian#4555
29200 vs 28200

[18-Feb-19 01:22 PM] yorklab#7270
I think Bittrex and upbit is combined in some way.

[18-Feb-19 01:22 PM] jorian#4555
trex touched 30k

[18-Feb-19 01:24 PM] yorklab#7270
I remember some time back they announced that. If you watch both you will see the prices seem to be similar

[18-Feb-19 01:25 PM] jorian#4555

hahaha

[18-Feb-19 01:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is the first week to open above very weekly resistance and above upper weekly bollinger band for the first time in history.

[18-Feb-19 01:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We have moved from official bear to official bull mode

[18-Feb-19 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also All time high in volume is a great sign that this is a sustained bove

[18-Feb-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is the most bullish i have seen KMD in all its existance.

[18-Feb-19 01:55 PM] Malti#3948
if Siu says it's bullish, then  I'm a happy hodler

[18-Feb-19 01:55 PM] designer#4893
king, bitcoin is back.

[18-Feb-19 01:56 PM] yorklab#7270
The entire market seems to be in a good mood. I was expecting this from Komodo but not this early.

[18-Feb-19 01:56 PM] Malti#3948
the nice thing is that it's has been since friday, the uptick

[18-Feb-19 01:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like knocking on gaming industry doors brought much attention

[18-Feb-19 02:00 PM] alen#3721
Komodo is top perfomer in 24h from top 100 coins.
Media should give some more attention to this.
Komodo deserves it

[18-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
@siu - Chainmakers do you have  a link to more info? missed that one

[18-Feb-19 02:13 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[18-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I bought at 6.5

☝ 

[18-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Alecandro#1179
I bought some KMD around the $3-4 mark but not that high

[18-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
And eaten a juicy dick

[18-Feb-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
last non-trade I bought at was pseudo of $2.14

[18-Feb-19 02:26 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
can we please talk in terms of btc?😋

[18-Feb-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"we" can't, but you can feel free to do so

[18-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I really hope, one day we get KMD at 5$

[18-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
I can say I would be happy, and probably even out my money too

[18-Feb-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Old ATHs and all would be like wow, but I am not sure that is going to happen

[18-Feb-19 02:28 PM] az#1921
5$ ? From my point of view this coin is pure gold. Not a chance I sell it at 5$.

[18-Feb-19 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got a bag I'll sell @ $5, I need more miners

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I want to have bags 😦

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea $5 seems a little short sighted imo

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Im just saying, I would be happy with it

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
Like really happy

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Alecandro#1179
I’m sure we all will 🤙🏻

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
But like I said, I used to buy it at 6.5 so... 12$, 15$ or more would be amazing

[18-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Caglio#3337
5$ I could live with

[18-Feb-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yea $5 seems a little short sighted imo`
Not when you bought at 43 cents as a result of $10 selloff

[18-Feb-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

🤷🏻‍♂️

[18-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when you sell is all relative to when you bought, really; as long as you get positive ROI on the back side

[18-Feb-19 02:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
bought in at 8$... so that makes me a 'institutional investor" 😅

[18-Feb-19 02:31 PM] Alecandro#1179
What was everyone’s lowest sat buy of KMD during this bear? Mine was .0001578! Did anyone catch the 13’s?

[18-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_sold a ton at 60-80 cents just to buy more in the next dip_

[18-Feb-19 02:32 PM] Caglio#3337

_has "a few"_

[18-Feb-19 02:32 PM] yorklab#7270
I consider a lot of news we've seen so far as "Developer" news; the average Joe doesn't know the significance of the Rogue game. As far as I'm concerned the really big news hasn't been announced yet.

I am not even checking the prices anymore

[18-Feb-19 02:38 PM] Caglio#3337
But this is a nice bull run

[18-Feb-19 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[18-Feb-19 02:39 PM] Caglio#3337
