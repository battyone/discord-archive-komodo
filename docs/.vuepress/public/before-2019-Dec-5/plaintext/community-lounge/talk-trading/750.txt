i have a macbook pro, is plenty fast, rarely heats up, usually only when syncing pirate chain for a couple of hours as komodod tends to send the cpu to 200% usage :p

[07-Jun-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i will announce later today the method that will be used for early redeems. in order to qualify for this, your address needs to be uncontested and in the swept funds, you need to have filled out the form, and you will need your old compromised privkey to prove you had control of the address. if all these conditions are met and it isnt for a very large amount (size yet to be determined) then I will aim to get them processed before June 15th.

from what i can tell, the vast majority fall into the above category. i will use the blockchain to prove that the repayment has been made. after this first phase of repayments, the number of claimants will be much reduced, but there will still be a lot of KMD left to payout. the second phase will deal with swept funds that are big, but are uncontested. so make sure to fill out your form ASAP.

the third phase will deal with funds that were stolen. at that point all that will be left are the disputed addresses, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

the sooner we can complete the refund process the better, so my goal is to complete all phases other than dispute resolutions by the end of this month, but with vast majority of cases before june 15th. thank you for your patience.

Btc cannot handle all transactions as it used to, so it is only natural that dominance keep getting lower as there are more transactions

[07-Jun-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 

Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors

first 70 special tx are sent to those with claims smaller than 7 KMD
if you are one of these, please let me know you got funds and then send to your claim address
