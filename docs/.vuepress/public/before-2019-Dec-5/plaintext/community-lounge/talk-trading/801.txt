Id like to take this moment to thank James for allowing the KMD ecosystem to absorb all this 14000 sat KMD :troll_thuglife:

[21-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Tek#5253
and i tested atleast 30 cones

[21-Jun-19 06:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I never thought I would approach my low buys of 13000 earlier this year

[21-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Tek#5253
one thing ive learned is that in crypto, everything moons and dumps harder than you expect

[21-Jun-19 06:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Need to get that Gym membership again to carry these bags.

[21-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I had my 14000 orders filled overnight, thought they were a joke before then.
