[30-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Markus#5464

[30-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Lanii#8302
never blow your load man

[30-Jul-19 06:19 PM] Lanii#8302
never fully close a position, hard learned lessons üòÉ

[30-Jul-19 06:20 PM] Markus#5464
from now on just gonna change the stop loss incase it pumps/dumps so that i secure profits rather then closing too early

[30-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh thats probably better

[30-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
A smart dude taught me a technique

[30-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
Where you take 40-50% PT's before breaking range

[30-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Lanii#8302
and then chill with the rest 50-60%

[30-Jul-19 06:21 PM] Markus#5464
yea thats good

[30-Jul-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302
Considering you always expect a failure to gain a level or lose one

[30-Jul-19 06:22 PM] Lanii#8302
It makes hella sense

[30-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Markus#5464
one thing that definitely helped me lately was to learn how to spot divergences on macd and rsi

[30-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont use indicators but when I first started I did

[30-Jul-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
and divergence was the only thing I'd use it for

[30-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
However never enter a trade based on oversold or overbought

[30-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
I seriously think its a meme sold to retail to rek them

[30-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
same with patterns, H&S lmao

[30-Jul-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
I longed all of them since january

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464
i tried trading oversold/overbought on 15 min chart, it works quite well actually if u also can spot a falling wedge/rising wedge

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
mh idk dude

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
anyways its not rly my business

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
I tend to shit on indicators

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
but if it works for you

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
then keep going

[30-Jul-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464
but it was just for testing so i basically just closed out after 10-20% gains with 10x

[30-Jul-19 06:26 PM] Lanii#8302
How long have you been doing TA?

[30-Jul-19 06:26 PM] Markus#5464

[30-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302
But God damn feels like its just getting harder and harder lol

[30-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Markus#5464

^^

[30-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Lanii#8302
you trading anything else on mex besides btc?

[30-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Markus#5464
i have done a few litecoin and eth trades but mostly btc

[30-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Lanii#8302
okok

[30-Jul-19 06:29 PM] Markus#5464
altho im looking into maybe try another platform for leveraged trading, not big fan of those system overloads

[30-Jul-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
yes they are horrible

[30-Jul-19 06:30 PM] Markus#5464
i have heard ppl saying API trading do not have system overload issues so i might try to make some small program with just limit/market sell and buy nothing else

[30-Jul-19 06:32 PM] Lanii#8302
yes

[30-Jul-19 06:32 PM] Lanii#8302
Api is way better

[30-Jul-19 06:32 PM] Lanii#8302
I think it eliminates this issue

[30-Jul-19 06:32 PM] Lanii#8302
Not very certain though

[30-Jul-19 06:32 PM] Markus#5464
might be true

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
You could also try Bybit

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
There are some people shilling it who moved from shitmex

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Markus#5464
yea alot of ppl talking about it

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
They also moved cuz of overload

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh

[30-Jul-19 06:33 PM] Markus#5464
and they have a nice statistics page so u can follow ur trading progress nicely

[30-Jul-19 06:34 PM] Markus#5464

üòÇ

[30-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Markus#5464
Altho i think bybit might be legit, they recently got added to tradingview also heard they will integrate so u can connect with API through tradingview to bybit so that u can execute trades from tradingview directly

[30-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Lanii#8302
I think tradingview was talking about doing this 2 years ago

[30-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Lanii#8302
idk if it was mex or finex

[30-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Lanii#8302

Just build a smart chain that taxes your balance and sends them a cut. you must pay a fee or no freedom for thee.
