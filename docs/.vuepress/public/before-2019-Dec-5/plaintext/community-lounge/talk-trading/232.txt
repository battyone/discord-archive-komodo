is binance buying their own coin to keep it from plummeting?

[18-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
binance has a quarterly burning ritual

[18-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so every quarter you will see a bump

[18-Oct-18 07:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it has a giant head and shoulders on the weekly and been under the 200day ma for some time now

[18-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the recent burnt was a few days ago , I think

[18-Oct-18 07:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
hmmm  there was a burn just yesterday

[18-Oct-18 07:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
wow

[18-Oct-18 07:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
also rumor said most of the employees choose to receive pay in bnb üòÑ

[18-Oct-18 07:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i think they bought it few weeks back before the burnt yesterday, you can notice it from the chart

[18-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
next burn will be on January

[18-Oct-18 07:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, with that giant h&s it should have crashed by now

[18-Oct-18 07:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
giant spike up after each burn O_o

[18-Oct-18 07:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

Whale burned through half of his stack

[18-Oct-18 08:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Got sold in?

[18-Oct-18 08:36 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
nah, just his normal accumulation nubbling

[18-Oct-18 08:36 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Though, he did reset his wall a few times, might have simply not used all his funds

[18-Oct-18 08:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
The wall was 1,8mio now 800k

[18-Oct-18 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[18-Oct-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Gordon Komodo if that satisfy you, during the early days of Komodo testing (when James started developing it), I participated and mined few hundred coins in my computer. later, formatted the whole drive without keeping any backup or privkey or wallet.dat. those coins were lost. consider they are burnt.

marketbuy of the binance whale was 3 times in a row after 24h, with small 500sats increases inbetween, let it dip, then get the market buy. wall is lowered. 4th time there was no market buy, only steady increase by 500sats, 5th increase should be again 19th 9-10am

[19-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe the whale is bittrex buying for the exchange.

[19-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Vertigo#0439
