when he hardly gets any buys through probably?

[04-Feb-19 05:33 PM] Alecandro#1179
He's only eaten about 3 BTC in the last few days

[04-Feb-19 05:33 PM] Alecandro#1179
Maybe he will get impatient soon lol

[04-Feb-19 05:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He used to marketbuy +10%

Then remove all buys walls dropping the price below and eating those orders too

[04-Feb-19 05:34 PM] Tek#5253
I hope the market stays low for another few months

[04-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
it probably will

Allessio Rastani predicting bottom in Q2/Q3 of 2019

[04-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Around these or 2k levels for btc

[04-Feb-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah I'm not buying buttcoins thoguh

[04-Feb-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
I prefer Dash as payment/store of value/btc chain

[04-Feb-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
blockstream is incompetent

[04-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
all they had to do is raise the block size to 2mb

[04-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
they didn't

[04-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Tek#5253
idiots

[04-Feb-19 05:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why dash

[04-Feb-19 05:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
over ZEC?

[04-Feb-19 05:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not that ZEC foundation is competent or anything

[04-Feb-19 05:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I always thought at least ZEC was technically better with ZK Snarks

seems like there's always a decent amount of people trying to front run whale bro

[04-Feb-19 06:15 PM] Markus#5464
For ppl who dont see it but here is whalebro's strategy currently... he let his wall sit at 18.5k and when ppl put sell orders between 18.5k and 19k he buy them with other btc not connected to his buy wall

[04-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
seems very possible

[04-Feb-19 06:32 PM] yaheardme#2938
his wall is great for us

[04-Feb-19 06:32 PM] yaheardme#2938
at least for now lol

[04-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
@Cryptoon Dash is not trying to be a private coin anymore

[04-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
they aim for mass adoption, the privacy tech on ZEC is superiour yes.

[04-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
But Dash has the DAO for funding

[04-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
the first one

[04-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
it still runs

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
since its inception

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
then why prefer dash over anything that is faster?

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
They are the payment coin that aims for mass adoption and are more decentralized, ZEC is held by a private company

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
Dash has the DAO.

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
self funding

[04-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
masternodes for instant payments

[04-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
so it can be used to buy coffee

[04-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
without second layer

[04-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
I prefer dash cause of its track record

[04-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
constant innovation

[04-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253
LTC uses dash code to run its LN network

[04-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253
they recently innovated Chainlocks making 51% attacks not possible anymore

[04-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Tek#5253
big campaigns in failing countries

[04-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Tek#5253
like venezuela and colombia

[04-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Tek#5253
the dash dao is worth more than anything i've seen.

[04-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Tek#5253
in my opinion

[04-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Tek#5253
I prefer Dash over faster more recent tech because of its proven PoW security.

[04-Feb-19 06:51 PM] Tek#5253
just too much good stuff happening in the Dash camp basically

[04-Feb-19 06:51 PM] Tek#5253
Also recently saw a report stating Dash is third for usage on darknet markets

[04-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
LTC came before that lmao

[04-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Tek#5253
forgot the winner but I thought it was BCH

[04-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I listened to an interview about dash a while ago

[04-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but was doing something else at the same time

[04-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Tek#5253
podcast? I probably linked it here then

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
Recently became active member in the dash community 😄

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But the thing I remember from it was that they also have a foundation

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and that the way money was spent on certain things was kind of stupid

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
while there were more important tech investements that needed to be made

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
was a couple of months ago iirc

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah uhm they have a self funding chain

[04-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Tek#5253
then masternodes get to vote for projects to happen with that money

[04-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Tek#5253
so its not a democrazy where every holder can vote ( which is good cause not everyone should have a vote, if you let the masses decide, stupid decisions get made )

[04-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
The masternode overlay means instant transactions can happen.

[04-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
its a hybrid system

[04-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
the first ever masternode system, all masternode tech is copied from this

[04-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Tek#5253
I like dash a lot

[04-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
I was in the BCH camp but they just keep splitting and fucking things up

[04-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
I found my way into Dash they are doing good

[04-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
P.S I think LN sux.

[04-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
I also don't like the XMR model where the developers have all the power

[04-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
and where they just fork away and destroy their network supporters ( miners ) every 6 months

[04-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
that's just stupid

[04-Feb-19 07:01 PM] Tek#5253
Dash works well. Me Likey

mr whale has been absorbing some sells this morning

[05-Feb-19 01:02 PM] yaheardme#2938
will be interesting to see how the day plays out

[05-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Alecandro#1179
That is good. Now we know he’s there for reals again haha

[05-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Alecandro#1179
Not just to prop price up. He wants that KMD

[05-Feb-19 04:29 PM] yorklab#7270
With some exciting things seemingly getting closer and a whale sitting on the bid, you would think people would want to start buying and holding, but when there's any bump up in price people fall over themselves trying to sell. I suppose because that's been the reaction so many times before, it's now a self fulfilling prophecy; everybody's selling before the inevitable drop back down.

[05-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea, probably just bear market mentality. People are all about getting small % trades now instead of holding for longer terms

[05-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Alecandro#1179
looks like whale bro is about to get more KMD

[05-Feb-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` it's now a self fulfilling prophecy`
I often wonder how much of the market ends up in that category when "*everybody* knows that indicator x means y will happen" 🤔

[05-Feb-19 04:45 PM] Alecandro#1179
I feel like a lot of times it's the opposite, just because that is what the general market sentiment is

[05-Feb-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And I wonder that too, how much is done in opposition of what "*everybody* knows"?

[05-Feb-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>Well, if *everybody* is doing x then I should do y

[05-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Markus#5464
