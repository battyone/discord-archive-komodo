I think @Tek  must have picked up a coke habit or something. I don't remember this intensity.

time for new bear market

[04-Jun-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
85% drop from $9000 would get us to $1350

[04-Jun-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, it could just be a beartrap

[04-Jun-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810

```I will spite you
this is my new goal```
I'm told that having unattainable goals is both good and bad for the human spirit, so I don't know if I should be happy for you or suggest a therapist in your immediate area 🤷🏽

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Tek#5253
Just you wait until the spitening begins. You didn't think it was possible, like many things.

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Tek#5253
But it is

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Tek#5253
and I will spite you

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Sell all your KMD and ARRR Tek, the price will go down to spite ComputerGenie 😛

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Tek#5253
by the way this is phase one of the spitening

[04-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[04-Jun-19 06:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
i like the spritening better

[04-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253

You lack the capacity to do any of those things....

[04-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
Heh I have good faith. Your spitening is coming.

[04-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[04-Jun-19 06:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a) would require your physical presence and b) & c) would require me giving a fek about random people on the internet

[04-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
I don't need physical presence to spite

[04-Jun-19 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the little "x" on my screen renders your silliness moot

[04-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Tek#5253
the moment you press the x my spitening is succesful

[04-Jun-19 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, then, much like your trading: you fail

[04-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
> spite means to hurt annoy or offend

[04-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
> UH IM CUMPUUUTER GEENLET I JUST PRESS THE X TO SHUT YOU UP YOU CANT SPITE ME

[04-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Markus#5464
we will see if it hold or not

[04-Jun-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
does this correction make you happy about the TA?

[04-Jun-19 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem a healthy thing to deflate the euphoria a bit

[04-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bounce at 7300 straight to 9300 tbh

[04-Jun-19 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fek, I hope not

[04-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Markus#5464
Happy well its nice when u try to predict if it drops where it could end up at and it work

[04-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Alexfrog#1338
bounce at 1 cent above your buy order, straight to new ATH in 1 second 😄

[04-Jun-19 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
27% straight jump is never sustainable

[04-Jun-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the price was suppressed for a long time more than 42%

[04-Jun-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
or some fundamental revaluation happens

[04-Jun-19 09:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`unless the price was suppressed for a long time more than 42%`
Technically, at $3020 it was but we'll have to agree to disagree on "long time"

[04-Jun-19 09:30 PM] Alexfrog#1338
nonsense, everyone knows ComputerGenie is Satoshi

[04-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Markus#5464
Either way this drop in btc was expected even if ppl kept saying it wont happen and its not needed
