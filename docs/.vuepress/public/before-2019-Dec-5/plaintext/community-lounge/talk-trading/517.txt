current price is still about 15% above IEO price, but they're not happy because it's not x2 or x3 like Binance IEO

They ban people in their discord, make telegram read only, no announcement from them for the listing and miners sit on their havy bags. Will be fun üòÑ

reading VBK discord gives a pretty good idea about the general mindset in crypto space

[05-Apr-19 09:45 AM] crumb#2550
all about the benjamins, and FAST :abusedsmily:

[05-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
what will happen when the 700million vbk mined from the testnet hit the market later today...

I'll stay with kmd tyvm

[05-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Post#7345
nah its "only" 50 mill which gets unlocked

[05-Apr-19 09:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
VBK main chat is like watching a memory hole, lots gets typed, lots gets deleted. Lots of angry miners being censored

[05-Apr-19 09:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
imagine burning BTC trying to run broken VBK code that doesn't even work. That is a bitter pill.

[05-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Post#7345
that would be a good tweet ,)

[05-Apr-19 09:59 AM] crumb#2550
i feel sorry for the guys who write how revolutionary this VBK tech is and how it will benefit the whole crypto space üò¶

*imagine how do those vietnamese people feel right now*

[05-Apr-19 10:16 AM] sœÜldat#8733
it is often the poor people who will be mistreated in this case..

[05-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I saw people saying in their chat that miners were selling OTC at 500-1000 sats...

[05-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Brutal

[05-Apr-19 10:21 AM] sœÜldat#8733
a hard blow for IEO buyers

[05-Apr-19 10:24 AM] sœÜldat#8733
They lock the VBK wallet to force people to become hodlers?

Closed source, is that a hinderance?

[05-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jorian#4555
it's probably not compatible

[05-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jorian#4555
unless someone adds support in barterdex

[05-Apr-19 11:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
is that VeriBlock ? I'm just hearing about this now.

Well I dont like people losing money when they had the best intentions and got manipulated into buying something like this

[05-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I guess dyor is still in order so...

[05-Apr-19 11:55 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Experience is not free imo. You have to lose to learn. Or atleast thats my view on my past trading experiences ü§£

[05-Apr-19 11:56 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
It is only D1 of trading so it could come back up once its bottomed. Maybe worth a punt below ieo if poss

[05-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I feel bad for the guy in the chat claiming he had already mined 3-4BTC worth of that shit

[05-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362

A day or 2 around these prices and we might see some frustration dumps.

Yeah once early testnet miners can deposit

[05-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they will be racing to dump and lock in some profits...

[05-Apr-19 12:07 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
They got 2x so they can go down more for sure

[05-Apr-19 12:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
probably people are afraid of being dumped on, because of that twitter video, fyi the vietnamese group in that video has managed to buy about $220000 worth of VBK

[05-Apr-19 12:11 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Crazy

[05-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201

3 hours till deposits enabled...

[05-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It all could be one big scheme to get people to dump at first and then buy everything back and pump shit

[05-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Keppie#5156
Compare it to all the Binance launch pads

[05-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Keppie#5156
They all start like this

[05-Apr-19 01:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, it might get pumped tomorrow though, we'll never know

[05-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Keppie#5156
One big pump soon & bleed afterwards

[05-Apr-19 01:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I know a IEO get dumped at half the IEO price at listing, then pumped to  7x  IEO price.

[05-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Veriblock's system of spamming the btc network with 512 times as many BTC transactions as Komodo needs is going to result in btc transactions costing $100 again, at which point Veriblock will die because its insanely expensive to use. üòÑ

[05-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
ZEN accomplishes basically the same thing without BTC being involved at all

[05-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
forces forks to be mined publicly

[05-Apr-19 01:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Zencash  right ?

[05-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[05-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Alright#0419
Although ZEN actually prevents attacking forks from reorging the network

hype of losing their money

[05-Apr-19 01:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[05-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well from the looks off it

[05-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it shows that its not adding any value to the ecosystem.

[05-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its basically replicating what others have done but in a more expensive way

[05-Apr-19 01:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
people get rekt because of their greediness, it's not necessary Veriblock's fault
