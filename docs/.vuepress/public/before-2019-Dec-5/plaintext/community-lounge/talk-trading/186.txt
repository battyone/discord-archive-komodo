whats the very best anti virus / scanner you reccomend?

[03-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Using hitmanpro and malwarebytes atm

[03-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Im still confused. Checking my email it appears no ones signed in out of the ordinary, as well as the fact I get notifications whenever I do get a login request + 2fa

[03-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Password reset confirmation button message was unread too 🤔

[03-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
So they clicked reset password, put my email in, but never accessed my email or clicked the link (from what I can tell) but somehow managed to get the website to make a new password for my account

[03-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any ideas how 😮

[03-Oct-18 10:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
use Linux instead of windows

considering the shitshow windows users go throuogh constantly, it is much more effective in terms of effort, time, nerves, energy and general well being to use Linux- very favourable bottom line

[03-Oct-18 10:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@LocoMB You disapprove of forcing users to be part of the largest beta test in history? 😮

[03-Oct-18 10:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
windows registry is a festering bilge, there is simply no anti virus scanner that is worth the name- malicious coders can hide ansthing in that stinking sinkhole

[03-Oct-18 10:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
yeah I do! 🎣

real conumdrum: getting rid of malware for sure also gets rid of the so-called OS

Would this be my pc compromised though

[03-Oct-18 10:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or possibly btcmarkets in which case I should warn others

[03-Oct-18 10:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
My email wasn’t even logged on or accessed so idk how they managed to reset my password if the email link was unpressed

[03-Oct-18 10:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
because: 'anti' - Virus 🥓 softfware _only_ finds malware that was identified before, so by definition there is a huge dark number

[03-Oct-18 10:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
operating with any nonsiginificant amount of money simply needs some consideration

[03-Oct-18 10:42 AM] LocoMB#8593
give it a try- the initial resistancde is not that big, but the peace of mind you get _is_ ... and there are gazillionis of Linux (esp. uuntu) 101 tutorials on the net

[03-Oct-18 10:43 AM] LocoMB#8593
basic install is similarly easy as windowes- maybe even easier

I noticed shapeshift login yesterday too, and then went to changely and saw the same thing. I used coinswitch.co after (which really just put orders through shapeshift or changely) but they used the lowest btc fee ever, and it took like 3 hours to get 1 confirmation :/

[03-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Acura#2748
There is also godex.io and flyp.me for these trades

[03-Oct-18 02:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
cool thanks guys

[03-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
too bad volume on barterdex is too low

[03-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
or liquidity is low, better said

[03-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if liquidity is high, as in a lot of people are offering, but not many people buying? :p

[03-Oct-18 04:14 PM] jorian#4555
then volume is low 😛

[03-Oct-18 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
@Cryptoon exactly. People aren’t buying. There’s plenty of liquidity for kmd, btc,bch,eth,ltc

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is true, then it is like a dry forest after a long dry summer. just one spark can ignite things

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah think it's a combination, need bull market to come back to draw in more people

[03-Oct-18 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
On whole, the volume and liquidity are low on barterdex because there exists only 1 jl on the planet and no one else wants to fund the non-dumping side of being an LP

[03-Oct-18 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
Should I shift my focus to BarterDEX?

[03-Oct-18 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
😃

[03-Oct-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
A never-ending loop of "no one trades on barterdex" because " no one trades on barterdex"

[03-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think tolken has been offering a lot of coins at close to zero margin for some time

[03-Oct-18 04:37 PM] tolken#2655
I generally offer at zero while waiting for confirmation that bob is working as expected.

[03-Oct-18 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Should I shift my focus to BarterDEX?`
Imo, the entire community should (on all levels)

[03-Oct-18 04:38 PM] tolken#2655
Eth falls into that category now. Have seen successful Alice kmd/eth but still waiting on a bob trade.

[03-Oct-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One day it was all any of use were doing, the "next" we all went off to do "everything" else

[03-Oct-18 04:41 PM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I figured it was accepted mm1 problems were identified and recognized as limitations of that iteration, so work on it was basically put on hold in favor of rewriting in Rust. Afaik, that’s in active development.

[03-Oct-18 04:41 PM] tolken#2655
Does kinda feel abandoned, but I’m sure that’s not the case... right? 😃

[03-Oct-18 04:42 PM] tolken#2655
Would be great to get an update from the team where the rewrite is.

[03-Oct-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm certain that it's not abandoned, and I'm aware that a lot is waiting on mm2
just adding my 2 cents

[03-Oct-18 04:42 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, I hear ya.

[03-Oct-18 04:43 PM] tolken#2655
I want to be able to do things like set min-amounts for trade pairs.

[03-Oct-18 04:44 PM] tolken#2655
Limit which UTXOs sizes will be traded.

[03-Oct-18 04:44 PM] tolken#2655
ltc/kmd might be fine with tiny UTXOs, btc not so much. Jl mentioned this would be a mm2 thang.

[03-Oct-18 04:45 PM] tolken#2655
of course just getting more reliable matches is paramount.

[03-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @artem.pikulin and @artemciy_dice are working on MM2.0 and generally working from #deleted-channel

side note: Removing margin trading for US-based customers
By the end of the year, we're taking steps to remove our margin and lending products for US-based customers. These changes are part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that Poloniex complies with regulatory requirements in every jurisdiction. In doing so, we're also making every effort to ensure a smooth transition for customers who may be affected. We will provide more communication in the coming weeks about the final date but it will be by the end of the year and encourage customers to take steps to unwind margin positions at their convenience.

Existing loans will remain open and continue to fund positions and earn interest for their previously specified duration.
