Are you planning on liquidating any time soon?

[25-Sep-19 08:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no

[25-Sep-19 08:43 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Then don't worry!

[25-Sep-19 08:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
liquidated a bit a moth ago, to cover some rent money.

[25-Sep-19 08:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that was too on bear prices.

[25-Sep-19 08:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this teaches a lesson actually. which I guess many won't understand.
If you buy a cryptocurrency token on very cheap, it doesn't mean you'll be millionaire in future for sure, even if that cryptocurrency goes multiple times the value gradually. the bear markets in between are brutal and you can lose the investment to survive in between.
The ones who plan and build some fundamental rules to keep the financials sorted might survive and will do become millionaire gradually if they keep maintaining their position on their original investment.

@rogerkver I did invest, Roger. Then I sold in 2013 to pay my rent. I didn't have disposable income to work for two years without pay and invest at the same time. I should've gone into more debt, but that would have been irresponsible towards my family who I supported

Dollar cost averaging into KMD and ecosystem will do great, I get paid bi-weekly and can comfortably put 500 in every 2 weeks

I'm one of the lucky ones that can keep their real life financials seperate from my crypto financials...

[25-Sep-19 08:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to do dollar cost average, the assumption is you are getting the dollars from somewhere.

I honestly dont see us going below 8k i think it would be a very bad scenario cause then we will trade below 200 ma daily and below pivot point on weekly which usually indicate bear territory

first is 200ma prob

it was totally expected that the introduction of Futures and ETFs will lead to massive price manipulations... at least i expected that...

[26-Sep-19 04:36 PM] cipi#4502
on stock markets, there is a good way of predicting prices of stocks by analyzing the data from CBOE of the issued calls/puts for the stocks
the price on the day these calls/puts expire will be the price that is best for the issuer of these calls/puts (max. profit, min. losses)
that is likely what hapenned to BTC too in the last days

1. We broke down 3-months consolidation and 200DMA -> I am assuming bear market till proven wrong.
2. With #1, it means $btc bull market failed to break previous ATH for the 1st time -> I am going to assume the first MACRO-BEAR market!

Happy to be wrong.

[26-Sep-19 09:04 PM] cipi#4502
i wonder if there is a way to decentralize the issuance of derivatives, so that there is no single/few issuers
because this bis issuers will always try to make the price on the expiry date be as they like it to be, depending on how many clients have bought how many puts and calls from them

i had anticipated an ETF being approved after the latest bump but I guess it was determined that a paper btc futures operation would suffice. So here we are. the crypto believers versus private, leveraged, 10 to 1 contracts on fake bitcoins. what happens next?
