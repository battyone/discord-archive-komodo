It's called community driven QE bro

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Malti#3948
on that note, imma buy more KMD as we speak

[05-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was mostly asking to see if there was another option for people outside of sending an exchange if they have trouble creating a new wallet.

[05-Jun-19 02:42 PM] PTYX#6840
@Malti the only issue with returning funds is that if the seed is compromised, there's no way of telling if your signature is valid. Other information would be required and you wouldn't be able to tell who was the bad actor until someone did a double claim on one address.

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] PTYX#6840
Hopefully they can manage it but it's going to be alot of work.

[05-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Malti#3948
the most important part is that funds are safu at the moment, how we will be able to claim them back is a problem for later

[05-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Keppie#5156

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] altcoinist#1501
Stolen funds can be frozen by exchanges

[05-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that would be quite the centralized thing to do though ;p

[05-Jun-19 02:55 PM] OsTa#2589
How to pay ours bills if funds are locked? and imagine how much time to see our money back?

[05-Jun-19 02:57 PM] OsTa#2589
do we will receive the 5% staking missing during the period of the locked time?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the following days more info will be made public

[05-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
for now most important is that most funds are safe

@Tek and I love some of your responses here ‚ù§

[05-Jun-19 03:08 PM] p.#1126
what does this mean for the price #trading :3040_suspepe:

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
bug happen, even to the best. the important thing is how a project responds to the bug

[05-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
Agreed

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Malti#3948
go sleep @jl777c

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Keppie#5156
Bnb price reacted postively on hack due to how to they ‚Äòsolved‚Äô it

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Keppie#5156
Im sure we‚Äôll be fine pricewise

[05-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Malti#3948
it's not a blockchain vulnerability or anything like that, it's a wallet exploit, doesn't represent the full project/ecosystem

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was able to get my coins moved to the komodoQT wallet with the name changing of the wallet.data file. Thanks @NutellaLicka for the advice.

from fear and loathing in las vegas

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Malti actually not really a wallet exploit, more like a node.js exploit that agama used somewhere

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wonder if more projects are affected and how those will respond...

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
actually

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
probably the same thing anyway

[05-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if node.js exploit, the wallet is exploitable because of it

[05-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
meh

[05-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Malti#3948
fek it, Tesla's burst into flames by themselves as a core product to the company, stock dips, stock goes up. Long term vision and goal is where it's at

[05-Jun-19 03:20 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c I‚Äôll donate some to a recovery fund if a plan is announced.

[05-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Malti#3948
so it's not even an agama fault, shiiit it just shows the proactivity of people at KMD

[05-Jun-19 03:21 PM] tolken#2655
Not a whale, but every bit helps? üòâ

[05-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Jun-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810

[05-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Malti#3948
it mentions NPM and node.js so I assume it's alike lol

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Malti#3948
I should be CTO at google

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Malti#3948
or shouldn't

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
npm is very broad

[05-Jun-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it was one specific library with an exploit specific to agama or a recent fork of agama

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c you say you weren‚Äôt able to get 100% of compromises addresses, but some of those compromised addresses could be legit users moving their funds to safety first?

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] tolken#2655
So that 1mil might be less?

[05-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we will be very closely analyzing all claims

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but I know of several large ones that almost add up to a million, the attacker was collecting them as if he invoked the exploit with small amounts, we would fix it

[05-Jun-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and not everybody is aware yet, so it could be bigger

[05-Jun-19 03:32 PM] tolken#2655
Hopefully you find some common receiving addresses for compromised addresses to help narrow down what‚Äôs legit vs isn‚Äôt.

[05-Jun-19 03:33 PM] OsTa#2589
does komodo team is trying to track stolen funds and share it to exchanges?
