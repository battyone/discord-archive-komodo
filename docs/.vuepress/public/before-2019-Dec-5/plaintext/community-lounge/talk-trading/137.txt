@Hollowman9000 that video is very accurate.  3 explosions today.   Each one bigger than the last.  

So when KMD hits 100 where are we going?   Bora Bora?

The final drop before the etf runup again?

[06-Sep-18 06:14 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I think wallstreet is recking crypto atm.. inside trading of goldman sachs triggered this btc drop.

When normal people are thinking about shorting etc

[06-Sep-18 07:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is when a LOT of people are about to get REKT

[06-Sep-18 07:17 AM] jansako#3330
Yep, if you are a 'normal person', by the time you see the trend, it is usually too late.

[06-Sep-18 07:22 AM] snowdamn#2414
never forget, short positions need to be covered eventually üòâ

[06-Sep-18 07:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, apparently, 100M usd of btc was dumped in 10mins which caused a 5% drop in btc. If you short 10x on a different exchange you are just printing money... lose 5% on your position in btc (which was prolly bought at a discount otc anyway) and win a multiple of that amount in shorts...

I was showing the token cc contract to a friend yesterday

[06-Sep-18 09:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he was not so impressed

[06-Sep-18 10:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
until he realized the fact that it only costed a normal transaction fee to create and transfer the tokens

[06-Sep-18 10:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
he had the realization and went... wow

[06-Sep-18 10:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not much talk afterwards lol

[06-Sep-18 10:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's hard to grasp the implications at first glance I imagine.

[06-Sep-18 10:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
I understood it very early, and If i was greedier I would have bought more then. Just a life lesson I guess. Trust your intuition.

The cross chain transactions a few days back that I got working for the first time was the WOW for me.

Its a CC for importing outside world data to the blockchain

[06-Sep-18 10:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
@siu - Chainmakers you should also tell your friend that CC scales along with regular txs

[06-Sep-18 10:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[06-Sep-18 01:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
old system wants blockchain/tokens only for their private businesses, settlement, etc., so that the system stays same.  n00bs/uninformed do not have the knowledge required to determine that such thing is only possible with making public blockchains illegal, which is never going to happen.  scum of the earth will get their private toys while public ones go to üåù.  understand this or üò¢ later when you're calculating how much the crypto you sold would have been worth if you HODLed ü§ì

Hard work, wanting it more than others

[06-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although how you grow up also creates your mentality, if you never see people working hard/fighting for what you want, I think it's a lot harder to grow that kind of mentality

[06-Sep-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I think wealth creates bias towards the wealthy`
Want creates a bias towards those that have from those that have not; be it wealth, bananas, or anything one places value on.
The larger inherent issue is that "wealth" and "being wealthy" are subjective terms that are more widely used by those that do not wish to do what is required to gain what they want by any means other than telling those that have such things that those things should be given freely to those that do not have them (for no other reason than those that do not have those things do, in fact, exist on the planet).
