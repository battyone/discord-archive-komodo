[19-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Bittersweet#9376
what about your own carnivore rule

[19-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Bittersweet#9376
you are truly a man of principle

[19-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Bittersweet#9376
:troll_hmm:

[19-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Tek#5253
the carnivore rule is one to make sure you don't get hookworm or whatever its called, they are in flesh of carnivoreous/omniovorous animals only

[19-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
so eating plant eaters is perfectly safe

[19-Jun-19 09:15 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@Deleted User You know what action you have to take if your mother-in-law knocks on the glass, don't you?

[19-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
the worm i was thinkin about is Trichinella larvae in pressed bear meat, partially digested with pepsin. The classic coil shape is visible. Trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the Trichinella type. ... Several subtypes of Trichinella can cause disease with T. spiralis being the most common.

Turn up the heat in the oven

🤣 😂 (2) troll_lol troll_hardcore 👏 

[19-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
it can also be in pigs

[19-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Tek#5253
thats why islam doesn't like pigs

[19-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Tek#5253
the worm gets ingested. then it bores through your gut and lays eggs in your muscles

[19-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Tek#5253
if you eat a pig that has this worm you r fugged

[19-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Tek#5253
or bear

[19-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
it does'nt always die with good cooking cause it lives in a calcium capsule

[19-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
thats very resistant to heat
