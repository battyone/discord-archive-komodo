🤦🏽

[11-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Keppie#5156
that makes 0sense 😄

[11-Apr-19 10:39 AM] Keppie#5156
im korean, i swear

[11-Apr-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, you're doing a snapshot every hr for 24 hrs?

[11-Apr-19 10:39 AM] kolo#1111
I can’t say exact timestamp for snapshot

[11-Apr-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[11-Apr-19 10:45 AM] kolo#1111
You’d better dislike variety now, than hammer me if something goes wrong in a timestamp I announce

[11-Apr-19 10:46 AM] kolo#1111
Time is still irreversible for us

[11-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Keppie#5156
Someone got me a link to RFOX discord ?

[11-Apr-19 10:47 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not sure if there is one Keppie, The Telegram channel is active though. Benny is answering Qs there with other team members

[11-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Keppie#5156
Alright, thanks

[11-Apr-19 10:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
Here a SUGGESTION first block that is mined after 14th of April 2019 12.00pm UTC is the snapshot height.
Sync a node now with addressindex=1 after it's fully synched stop the daemon
After the blockheight is known start daemon with -stopat=HEIGHT
Daemon will sync up to that height and than not accept new blocks.
Do a getsnapshot from there and distribute the VOTE2019 which will be something  600 sendmany calls.

[11-Apr-19 11:04 AM] kolo#1111
@CHMEX process is almost same

[11-Apr-19 11:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
`getsnapshot` or similar rpc call exist

[11-Apr-19 11:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its quite simple

[11-Apr-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
@kolo what is the timestamp?

[11-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
Ah lol sorry about that, didn't scroll up enough to see you had said you cannot announce.

[11-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand why you cannot.

[11-Apr-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
@kolo are you aware the getsnapshot rpc exists?

[11-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
you can easily snapshot any given block with a single rpc command

[11-Apr-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to sync to the block though. get snapshot doesnt take a height... I was going to fix that but it would taek weeks massive job

[11-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
invalidate the next and do `getsnapshot`

{Reactions}
☑ 

[11-Apr-19 11:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
that's why I suggested use -stopat=HEIGHT

[11-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
yes that as well

[11-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
stopat probably safer option

[11-Apr-19 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
he can use the notarystats.py scrtipt I made also at that height to get exact ntoary counts for KMD and AC..

[11-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd getting shot in the face lol

[11-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Really good time for jl to fill his order

[11-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Buddz1993#5380
we touched 19.5 k sats I believe

[11-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Buddz1993#5380
really nice price to rebuy

[11-Apr-19 11:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vbk 1268 sats

[11-Apr-19 11:50 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
The real kicker is that KMD has been going down since the beginning of the month and then we get a day like this. I should have held off a few more hours on that buy.

[11-Apr-19 11:51 AM] kolo#1111
@Alright yes

[11-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Last move I made with KMD was to buy verus and arrr

[11-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And that was quite some time ago

[11-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

BTC just wanted to flip me the bird

[11-Apr-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying that even a stopped clock is right twice a day?

[11-Apr-19 12:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I hope we dont go and revisit lower weekly bb

That would be harsh

[11-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
we might see 17k lvl

[11-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
if btc drop to 4k

[11-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Much deeper than that

[11-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

`back at a 2 months low`
only if you only look at 1/2 of the equation

[11-Apr-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looking at the full equation, it's not even at the 1 month low

[11-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yes 2 months low for sats not dollar value that is true

[11-Apr-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not even that, either
feb 11 was 17900 sats
