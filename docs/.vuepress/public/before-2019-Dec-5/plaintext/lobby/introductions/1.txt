Hello everyone,

I have been part of this community for a long time but never really introduced myself.

Currently, I am travelling a lot, like a digital nomad style. If there are Komodo events & meetups let me know and maybe I'll come üòÉ The reason why I like this project & community is its open source nature and strong values on decentralization and working technology. That's why I joined back in the day, and that's why I am still here.

Apart from being part of the Komodo marketing team, I am also involved in 'Komodo Pioneers' project. We just got the great news today that we were officially elected to run a second notary node. Our mission is to use some of the funds we generate to support the Komodo community. Mostly we have done this through meetups but we are open for ideas.

If you would like to help the Komodo ecosystem someway shoot me a message and we will see if we can help. Be aware that Pioneers is only giving out micro-funding and prefers to build relationships versus one-time advertising.

Hi all!
I'm Regnar, I've been hanging around Komodo since the BTCD > KMD swap days. I was never really a programmer but the longer I've hung around here the more I've started to learn and so I've started actively teaching myself. You can usually find me around random projects helping in anyway I can, always on a volunteer basis, as I do work full time outside of crypto. 

A little while back I had the honor of having my name put up on the Komodo team page as a key community contributor and I'm also community support in a few different Komodo ecosystem projects here in Discord. If you have any questions or just want to say Hi don't be shy or afraid to reach out!

Hi guys. I'm a fan of the KMD project and I'm hodling some. Today I started mining it. I am a translator in English, Dutch, French and Russian. If I can be helpful to this community, let me know.

hey I'm' new to the scene.  Just trying to rap my head around everything.  I have always been involved with and surrounded by ERC20 tokens.  What does komodo have over Ethereum/Tron blockchains?

Hi I just joined. 
I had Hush from a web wallet which I did access in Agama a long time ago, but have moved it to a new wallet just in case.

[07-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jabe#4227

Hello, i'm  Mauro, from countryside of Brazil. I'm Art Director of an advertising agency and i'm studying (and loving) UX. I have no working experience in UX  but i know that the Cryptospace has a huge lack of usability and i'd love to help the cryptospace in this quest and learn a lot in counterpart. I have much interest in komodo platform because i think it is a great project so, if i could be usefull somehow, here i am. (:
