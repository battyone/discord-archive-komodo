Hello, I‚Äôm trying to move my funds out of Agama on native mode, but it‚Äôs taking forever to sync. Any tips on how to make the syncing go faster?

[07-Jun-19 01:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Unfortunately can‚Äôt make syncing faster except by using a bootstrap , for security reasons it‚Äôs recommend you sync normally

[07-Jun-19 01:49 AM] habship#2279
The syncing gets stuck at a certain point

[07-Jun-19 01:49 AM] habship#2279
It was syncing fine but then at 82% it just stopped

[07-Jun-19 01:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It may have just slowed down to recent blocks,  #deleted-channel  is the best.  If you have your keys you can import into another wallet like Verus Agama and move them from there

[07-Jun-19 01:52 AM] habship#2279
I only have my wallet.dat

[07-Jun-19 01:52 AM] habship#2279
Is it possible to download another wallet and read my dat. file from there?

[07-Jun-19 02:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , KomodoOcean

[07-Jun-19 02:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But you will need to sync as well

Have there been any plans to work with Trezor to support komodo?

They announced they would be supporting a long time ago

‚ö°Ô∏èSecurity notice for Telegram‚ö°Ô∏è 

In your settings, go to privacy and security, under your phone number, select to share this with nobody as its defaulted to everyone.  

That‚Äôs unacceptable and a security risk for pirates and SIM swaps.

Nobody in telegram needs your phone number and Telegram is stupid for defaulting it to share.

[07-Jun-19 08:07 PM] absonsol#3374

[07-Jun-19 08:08 PM] Alright#0419

[07-Jun-19 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
You won't have to "transfer" it, rather just import your private keys to the new chain's wallet
