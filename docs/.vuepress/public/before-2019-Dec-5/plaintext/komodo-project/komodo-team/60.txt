This is HUGE news! This will make it possible for $KMD holders to claim intrest for funds stored on their ledger without exposing private keys! @KomodoPlatform https://t.co/7tYvfwPsQQ

If you being a developer say that delayed Proof of Work is a "Centralized" solution I assume:
- most probably you just skimmed the whitepaper
- or read and didn't understand it
- or didn't read it?
- even worst, you just believe that someone said it is "Centralized"

#jl777 the core developer of @KomodoPlatform explains why "delayed Proof of Work is Centralized" argument is wrong. This argument makes one think it is intentionally misunderstood.

I also see AWS having arm64 servers avalible now .. not open source of course, but being able to build KMD on that will be great.

[05-Dec-18 06:29 AM] ph03nix#3115
@blackjok3r do you think amazon will try to steal komodo technology?

[05-Dec-18 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Most bloockchain is MIT llicensed so if they wnated to use any of it they just will yes

[05-Dec-18 06:31 AM] ph03nix#3115
any way to prevent this?

The same way I'd expect be with kmd and other if they take it, enhance it and open source it

[05-Dec-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
problem with MIT and FreeBSD licensing is theat they dnt NEED to open source it ... although its usually in their best intrests to do so

[05-Dec-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
opensource means that you get FREE development

[05-Dec-18 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm.... ü§î

[05-Dec-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
apple products use the freeBSD OS ... and are closed source ... but freeBSD is opensource

[05-Dec-18 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for example

[05-Dec-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thing is ... if you write the code, they are going to approach you about develoing things on it I would assume, as most code isnt exactly easy to follow for someone to start from 0 and have to read all of it to figure out how it works.

If a dev thinks adding a google 2FA to their website makes their website/project devs look less capable coz they themselves could not make it better without 2FA, that is such a silly argument. It instead gives their website/project more solid security.
