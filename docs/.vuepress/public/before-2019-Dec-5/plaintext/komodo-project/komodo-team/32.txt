@Mylo one of my circle mentioned a tweet from this week of a KMD credit card. Had a lot of traction over here. In terms of simplicity (making the tech easy to adopt and easy to use), that was massive. Copy should sell brand, CTAs should hit and highlight deliverables.

atomicexplorer.com ?

Not official.  Yes, good point.  These are things that marketing and the agency have on the table.  There is a some unity required, and 1 or 2 community sites will 99.9% be voted to receive some branding love as well as better resource linking.

"We are all involved in the education aspect, it's part of our social contract to leave something for other people to learn from" (paraphrased badly) was what was said to me in the first meeting.  This is another part we are working on, a "learn more" area for traders and developers.

peer2krd and notary involvement with the world/community/side-projects as well.  There are non-english speaking forums where out of all popular equihash coins, kmd is the lowest mentioned.

Has anyone used this peer2krd?  Has anyone ordered?   @Virginia (Peer2Group) how many batches/customers can you guys support - i read in one channel the first batch of cards is out and waiting for next batch - which EU countries etc.  need more info.  Can you work with community #komodo-team - i had a quick look at kmd twitter and a message was retweeted once or twice in mid July.  Do you want more ppl to sign up, can you work with this channel first for feedback and i'll see what our writing resources are like for an update.  we recently wrote about a partnership with gonetcoins which has a service in canada entering the US with reloads available in many stores via virtual ATM.

@Regnar nice twitter poll üòÉ  thanks for getting the info, it is quite interesting.

@Kay Gee sell brand to who? 

I'd like to re-visit the twitter poll concept.

[01-Aug-18 12:41 AM] Mylo#8306
Anyhow, I've got some dev work to do.  My first exposure to smart contracts was to test a blockchain enforced contract for a faucet.  This is in alpha testing, history is in #cc-general channel.  https://github.com/imylomylo/KMD-CC-Token-Test-Guide/tree/master/rpc/faucet

Unfortunately i ran into a conflict with a docker image for testing contracts.  Docker is a technology where you can basically "press play" and you have a service.  It needs some further work but makes the dev-experience for non-system (e.g. front end) & other tech users quite easy to get involved.  https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-komodod is the start, it needs some docs and maybe a simple dev front end so community can get involved during alpha phase.

There is also lightning network testing being done with a side project, which integrates with smart contracts - hopefully include community too!!

[01-Aug-18 06:19 AM] Kay Gee#2313
@Mylo sorry, I‚Äôve worked in advertising for years and I fall back to default positions. Imo copy should always sell the brand to the reader, all readers- that‚Äôs why there is copy.  Surely that is why there is a website, right? To inform and involve KMD users and to grow the KMD user base? Selling the brand just means explaining why KMD over ETH, for example.

On each page, in each block of text, you want to trigger an emotional response - whether that is pathos or desire is largely irrelevant, but the stronger the emotion evoked, the greater the likelihood you will create a behavioral change. What I was clumsily saying is that short copy can sell the big picture concepts (simplicity, security, flexibility, etc.) but the CTAs don‚Äôt just have to be ‚Äú[we‚Äôre the brand/platform/ for you]‚Äù as there are deliverables which in and of themselves are seemingly creating hype - without any context.

Anyways, I‚Äôm sure you know this and I‚Äôm just riffing because of excitement: for once, this is a project I‚Äôm invested in (quite literally) rather than one I‚Äôm being paid to care about. 

There may also be an element of advanced procrastination at play üòâ

Yeeeeewwwww!

@Kay Gee i'm a dev by trade, but worked with more bad marketers than good, so only know enough to be dangerous.  evoking emotions that's advertiser's craft, but yeah marketers (the good and bad) make a living on those emotions.   CTAs and _all_ the copy are being updated - there was a message testing post on reddit in the past few days and we're working with an agency to unlock what we have already, where we'll be in jan 2019 with the new tech, which is super engaging - interoperable, simple to make apps on with a very rich feature set.

[01-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Virginia (Peer2Group)#1459
Hi @Mylo Mylo, 

First of all, I want to thank you for the support.
This 1st batch was 100 cards. For the moment, the cards are only eligible for legal EU residents, that is, citizens who are legally living in a european country which belong to Eurozone.

Your proposal sounds very good! I'm going to contact you by another channel, for more details. Thanks!

[01-Aug-18 09:49 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Virginia (Peer2Group) @Mylo  is that also possible to add topup of other KMD platform coins like Hush, BTCH or Chips? I saw currently it's BTC and KMD, which is good enough, but possibility of other coins (not assets) would be good? I also didn't see more detailes on the page (from where the price it taken and how much % the provider takes. Also good to display team members details (linkein?) for more trust then just anon page. Then I think KMD card could compete with other popular ??

[01-Aug-18 09:51 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Actually to topup also other popular coins like LTC/ETH/XMR/Dash could be good from marketing perspective - other communities may like to have it.

[01-Aug-18 09:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also for better marketing if pre-ann correctly (widely) after doing above adjustment some time limit could be made to subscribe for "free card" and after that period cards could be like 10$ or so (or lower % charge margin for early birds) ? Thanks to this hurry-up effect more people could join this quickly and could be more viral...

[01-Aug-18 09:59 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
For example the charge could be 1% for early birds and 3-5% afterwards (not sure what is it now, but should compete with Monaco and TenX)

[01-Aug-18 10:00 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
And also calculate the cost of card production per unit - later it might be charged that amount.

@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã thanks for the great suggestions and ideas. This is just a  1st step phase thats why 100 cards. Of course we can accept many other cryptos, but as you see we are already sold out the cards in about 4 days and have quite a big waiting list. We will work on it during next months and I don't discard a 2nd, bigger batch in september

[01-Aug-18 02:10 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so this is also maybe a reason to have these cards paid sth - to hire more people as there is probably some manual work involved in the process ? question if you got already a business model to make a proper pricelist or overall action plan. If there is so many people waiting seems idea is great and might be worth investing more time, people, money.

[01-Aug-18 02:27 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
For the reason of not wasting time/human resources /(sending cards to people who will never use it) I would suggest to revert the process a bit: 1. user registration and KMD+BTC address creation  (if not registered - lowest priority) 2. user optional payment - just anything between 0 and 10 KMD (for sorting out priority list + having money to pay additional people helping with faster cards creation 3. preparing and sending batches according priority list 4. iterate üòÉ

@Gordon Komodo  thx for sharing. Personally I treat card-coins (created only on purpose of the card) as scams or ponzi. No need to create new coin just for card purpose. You can use existing once -> does not make any sense to create a new one -> shady thing.

[01-Aug-18 04:59 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
The exception could be if the card-coin is revenue based (you buy shares of company) or sth, but I believe mostly purpose is to create new coin, hype it with the purpose of card (like there was no other possibility without?) and dump it later sucking money from "lucky investors" üòÉ

[01-Aug-18 05:01 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Actually making revenue coin for perr2group card could be interesting - get money for bigger marketing of the card and promise  some % of charged fees in the future. But a decent plan and market knowledge needed  before starting.

[01-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I posted the article just to show that there is huge demand for cards. I think it is because people are so used to it.

its hard to see how we could explain things much simpler than theyre already put I think LOL but thats partly due to already understanding or being around komodo for so long, just as a test I showed the articles to some of my friends who are the average casual investor

He said specifically we need to say why it benefits him, and why should he care about it. He wasn;t being rude, he just said that sthe only why you will make people care about it.

[02-Aug-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 million transactions per second, btw:
1) Its cheaper for you to use the platform than any other
2) Increases your security  and anonymity as there are so many TX's its almost impossible to trace a single one. 
3) its more reliable for your use and wont fail when too busy

[02-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Regnar#6164
4) it's not 1M tx/s for Komodo Platform that is shared among all chains built on it. Every chain is capable of that scaling, and even scaling tx/s greater than Komodo itself. (Might just be a point to make)
5) Tx/s don't just mean individual people buying things. They can mean messages sent, things like tweets, products communicating with each other, buying and selling to one another, automated micro transactions. which allows for scaling of any type of product or service imaginable.

[02-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I read something, think it was on XRP tbh, but they talked about autonomous cars/uber communicating with one another and send micro transactions to allow cars to tip one another to move through traffic faster. Or the conversation with Richard Gendal Brown in which the famous quote comes, "on the blockchain, nobody knows you're a fridge". I think when we get out of the mindset that a transaction is a person walking into a store and swiping a card to buy something, and instead we realize the world of microtransactions, of instant, automated transactions by people, and automated transactions by machines. we realize that the even with half a century that VISA has had to build infrastructure clearly isn't effective enough to handle these types of transactions. hell, VISA crashed in Europe two months ago, failing to do exactly what it was designed to do, individual human transactions.

[02-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Regnar#6164
or we realize that things like email, twitter, text messaging, or any form of communication COULD (not saying they all should) exist on a chain, or form of chain, it's easier to understand that the 1M tx/s milestone, while arbitrary in scale, is important as a benchmark to competitors.

If we said 7.4B transactions a second we could say it's important because every person on earth could transact at once every second. or however many fridges there are, cars, etc. it's easy to see how even the 1M mark could be overshadowed haha

nice one satinder

@Regnar yeah humans aren't going to be doing the most transactions.  we're moving from a time where people paid for software, to people & machines paying for services - it's the original IBM SaaS vision from 20 years ago - and now these services (and devices that use these services) have to pay themselves to be maintainable by humans and other machines.
the economy now involves "robots".  they create value, and now that value is programmable.  they're pseudo-autonomous - and nobody wants to pay for software to run these machines.  my 2c

[02-Aug-18 01:53 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea, "transaction" is in people's minds as a human transaction for goods, either on Amazon, in a store, or with someone else, and though IOT and robots buying/selling/transacting has been known about for decades, it seems most people don't see it on the horizon.

[02-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Regnar#6164
Just looking at VISA infrastructure, or traditional banking infrastructure and the use of ACH systems to clear transactions at T+3 its laughable to think that they will be able to handle these micro transactions, or non human transactions (transactions of monetary value, or even information)

[02-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Regnar#6164
The problem I see for us is, internet, coding, and even blockchain is like clay for bricks. it's difficult to show the builder they can build a house from this clay. But if we turn that clay into bricks, move our product/service one step down the line, it's much easier to show them they can build a house of bricks. So we either need to take that step ourselves and develop these bricks for use, or we need to find others who are willing to turn our clay to bricks and then sell it themselves.

[02-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Not a perfect example obviously

[02-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Regnar#6164
So I guess by this analogy it is up to us to identify the markets that each Komodo product or service is designed for, either as of now, or planned in the future.

[02-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
ie. selling bricks to builder, or selling clay to brick maker

[02-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Regnar#6164
@Mylo are you typing?

[02-Aug-18 02:21 PM] Mylo#8306
it's spot on.  kmd does a lot of things first.  we're a small focussed team.  and you're right, we don't know all the potential markets for our tech.   for one group, it's empowering - for another a convenience.  in one culture it's accepted in another it needs to work a different way.  we are all pioneers.  the other blockchain groups too.

the server for the "community news site" has been provisioned - probably be a few days til it's testable.

does it say i'm typing the whole time?  i'm doing a cpl things at once

[02-Aug-18 02:22 PM] Regnar#6164
yea haha it did

[02-Aug-18 02:23 PM] Mylo#8306
ok weird.  i'm using franz app which holds discord in webview along with slack, whatsapp etc.

[02-Aug-18 02:26 PM] Regnar#6164
yea no worries.

[02-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Regnar#6164
It would be worthwhile to get a list of Komodo capabilities, features, or functions, so we can see which are clay and which are bricks. Also which aren't "products" yet but could be, and which ones are products that have limited use cases and would be better bundled with others.

Sirin Labs are looking for a next-gen blockchain which can handle their daily FINNEY smart-phone payments. 
Komodo's ecosystem should be able to handle all those ... for now they're stuck using ETH but the CEO indicates they need to upgrade. 
Perhaps Komodo marketing team could try and make contact if they haven't already.
