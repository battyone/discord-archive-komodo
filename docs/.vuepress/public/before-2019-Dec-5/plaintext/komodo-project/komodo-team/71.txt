OK

[31-Jan-19 02:26 PM] linuxchip#2621
@PTYX is there any demo available

[31-Jan-19 02:26 PM] linuxchip#2621
i mean is there any kind of sales demo can be arranged

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes, please write me an email at hello@chainzilla.io and I'll send you the brochures, and we can coordinate a meeting in order to walk you through what KICs can do.

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] linuxchip#2621
what is managed services ?

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
(KIC) Komodo Independent Chain

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] linuxchip#2621
OK

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] PTYX#6840
If you are a developer and have a team, you don't need managed services

[31-Jan-19 02:27 PM] linuxchip#2621
I think its better to have a call and discuss more

[31-Jan-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
If you don't have a dev team but have everything else, Chainzilla can launch and manage your blockchain for you on Komodo.

[31-Jan-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Sure, send me the email and let's coordinate a call.

[31-Jan-19 02:28 PM] linuxchip#2621
Is chainzilla from Komado

[31-Jan-19 02:28 PM] linuxchip#2621
or other

[31-Jan-19 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a Komodo service provider

@linuxchip Hi! Welcome to Komodo. Glad to hear that you're looking to build with Komodo.

As PTYX just mentioned, ChainZilla is one of our Komodo service providers. That is one option.

The other service provider we have is Luis Garcia @siu - Chainmakers  who runs ChainMakers. You can view their website here:

https://twitter.com/Fluence_One/status/1090258636335546374  this is a very interesting report, with dapps developer answering what challenges they faced. It's an useful lesson and could be the theme of an article explaining how Komodo compares in that regard

"More than half of respondents mentioned that they have to use centralized infrastructure when developing their projects: 48% of surveyed DApps relied on a centralized backend, 31% used a centralized file storage, and 21% used authentication APIs such as Facebook Connect."

is there any new script added to Komodo website? I can't load it with Firefox, I have the NoScript extension but it worked until yesterday, so it must be some old script I blocked elsewhere that now has been integrated in Komodo website

[01-Feb-19 03:50 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not having any issues @KomodoWorld just tested on Brave, Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. I also tested on IE üòÇ  though IE is having problems... And I'm having problems for still having IE somewhere on my system üôÉ

[01-Feb-19 03:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Regnar I know it's my NoScript extension blocking some script element that has been added to the website, I wish I know what is new so I can enable it...

I keep seeing people suggest we 'contact' certain people to make new content, or reach out to exchanges for listings, etc. but most of the time this stuff costs money, listing fees, interview fees, etc. We should have a fundraising page since we are a community, where we have addresses dedicated to particular projects. So KMD/BTC/other addresses specifically for "exchange listing fees", or marketing, or bounty support, UX/UI developer costs. or whatever else. I'm sure we can come up with some pretty mutually exclusive/collectively exhaustive buckets to simplify it.

[01-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Regnar#6164
For example, Development expenses, Marketing and partnerships, Listing fees, dPoW notarization fees. or something

[01-Feb-19 03:59 PM] Regnar#6164
I always see you posting bounties @KomodoWorld which is why I suggest this

[01-Feb-19 03:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the people more asking for it are probably the less likely to donate

[01-Feb-19 03:59 PM] Regnar#6164
I agree

[01-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Regnar#6164
but it still stands that we should be able to point people to a location where they CAN if they want

[01-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Regnar#6164
and actually select where they want their funds to go. I'm not really for paying listing fees to exchanges, especially being established and on major exchanges already, so I wouldn't donate to that pool. etc

[01-Feb-19 04:01 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
well, all that is needed on the website is a list of donation addresses for specific purposes

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Regnar#6164
I imagine something like this <https://airdropvenezuela.org/> where it just has simple addresses for each. and you can click on a bucket and see what exactly those funds will be used for, exclusively

[01-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Regnar#6164
right

[01-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Regnar#6164
Like saying "development expenses" entails hiring 3rd party developers to fill skills needs we don't currently have in house, or expanding into areas we may not have a lot of industry expertise in (IoT devices, Supply chain development, or w.e.) things that are niche but are industries Komodo products would do well in. or even supplementing for current developers who are being paid. 
"Marketing" would be partnerships, conference costs, travel to meet person to person with execs, content providers, outreach etc.

[01-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Regnar#6164
like I said, there are probably some pretty solid buckets we can create that are mutually exclusive and cover all reasonable ground

[01-Feb-19 05:13 PM] CarterZYZ#4045

having it laid out like that for various languages is pretty awesome.

[01-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Regnar#6164
I feel like we have a lot of stuff that is depreciated still in the docs, sometimes it says it's depreciated up top, and other times it only says it's depreciated as a response. 
For example:
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#getaccountaddress>
^ Has depreciated in the tip up top. 

<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#getaccount>
^ has depreciated in response

[02-Feb-19 11:15 AM] jorian#4555
at a first glance: `built atop an unsturdy foundation` isn't that a bit too difficult language? i had to reread it 3 times. also, a Read More would be nice to have in there, since not much technicals are given in there

[02-Feb-19 11:15 AM] jorian#4555
otherwise, good to have this!

[02-Feb-19 11:16 AM] jorian#4555
and more as a general note: it looks like all the text is written in some headline font. spacing is weird between letters and so it doesn't read that 'fluidly' like a book

[02-Feb-19 11:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the language, you're probably right, we could simplify

[02-Feb-19 11:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Not many technical details, but this is mostly intended to capture interest and have people contact Komodo for more info

[02-Feb-19 11:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just a hook, so to speak

[02-Feb-19 11:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the spacing, not sure exactly what you mean but it might be due to the "justify" alignment. We can play around with it

[02-Feb-19 11:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
This is just v1, we can always improve : )

[02-Feb-19 01:30 PM] yorklab#7270
This was well written. As a non-techy I was able to understand without too much thought - of course I've been here a while so that helped also. The ```built atop an unsturdy foundation``` part does have a somewhat negative tone to it and perhaps could be re-written in a better way, but it otherwise seems fine.

[02-Feb-19 04:51 PM] Regnar#6164
"Attackers  cannot  re-org  any  blocks  that  were  mined  prior  to  the  notarization, **uinless** they first overpower the KMD network and..." pg 6

[02-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Also "In 2018 alone, 10 separate attacks led to more than $23 Million in losses." or a close variant of it has been stated 4 times in the promotional. reading through the promo it feels repetitive, and not in a way that solidifies the point. I think we could probably change the wording a bit. my two sats

[02-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Regnar#6164
My revision of first page:
"Without adequate security, a blockchain project cannot thrive. Therefore it is paramount that a project's blockchain be strong enough to withstand attacks that undermine it's integrity and immutability. Traditionally, the solution was an expensive arms race of hashpower, forking mining algorithms to counter an ever-growing ASIC market, or novelty consensus mechanisms that compromise decentralization. Fortunately, there is an easy solution. Komodo‚Äôs Blockchain Security Service uses proven technology that protects every integrated blockchain with the power of the Bitcoin network, for a tiny fraction of the cost."

@Daniel CP In the Year-End report under "Community & Social Media " it states +425% growth and 8.2 subscribers. That subscriber number sounds just a bit low. üôÇ

[03-Feb-19 02:00 AM] PTYX#6840
But it was much lower definitely

[03-Feb-19 08:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Thanks for the feedback and comments guys. 

@yorklab  425% growth is accurate. Jan 1, 2018 was under 2K subscribers to the subreddit. We saw a lot of growth in Jan and Feb, before the market really tanked, and then also a huge surge when we ran the infographic contest. I think we grew by 1.5K from the infographic contest alone

[03-Feb-19 08:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar thanks for spotting that typo, I will fix that now

[03-Feb-19 08:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the other comments- let me explain a bit.

The first paragraph is extremely negative. This is intentional. It provides strong contrast between 1st and 2nd paragraphs, and highlights the importance of Komodo's solution.

[03-Feb-19 08:15 AM] Daniel CP#2020
In general, in copywriting, you want to clearly identify the problem and your "customer's pain points" in the parlance of the industry. The formula is generally explain the problem--> identify the  ways that this is problem is impacting your customer's life--> present the solution --> explain the benefits of the solution and how much better your customer's life will be after the buy your product/service

If a 51% attack is not something that a person has ever thought about or worries about, then Komodo's Blockchain Security Service is not for them. If they have worried about a 51% attack, then we essentially want to harness that negative emotion for a brief moment before introducing Komodo's solution

[03-Feb-19 08:18 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Also, the copy you suggested is great @Regnar , but it's taking a different approach. You've suggested several different solutions and then present Komodo's as the best one. This method is a bit trickier and requires much more analysis. Right now, Komodo has the only third-party security solution in the blockchain space so mentioning other ways of mitigating the risk of a 51% attack probably isn't the way we want to do things. This is especially true if we don't give those other potential solutions a thorough examination at any other point in the brochure

[03-Feb-19 08:19 AM] Daniel CP#2020
As for the mention of $23 Million lost in 51% attacks, I count 3 mentions of that and each one is on a different page

[03-Feb-19 08:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
It's important to remember that very few people are gonna sit down and read this things front to back. All of you guys have read every word of the brochure, which is great and I thank you for that. 

But for ordinary potential customers, I'd say we have somewhere between 1 and 2 minutes of people's attention before they move on to something else. 

In those 60--120 seconds, what do we want them to learn?

-- 51% attacks are a serious problem. More than $23 Million has been stolen in 51% attacks in the last 12 months 
-- Komodo has a third-party solution that protects any UTXO-based blockchain with the power of the BTC network
-- 6 blockchain projects are already using Komodo's Blockchain Security Service and a major crypto exchange has officially endorsed it

[03-Feb-19 08:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If a reader can come away with those 3 key pieces of info, this brochure is a huge win

[03-Feb-19 08:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
One last thought-- Komodo has an awesome community and we appreciate everything you guys do to help the project. But, ultimately, our marketing materials are not made for you guys. I don't say that in any kind of mean way but you guys are just not the target audience

[03-Feb-19 08:26 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We need to grow-- our community, our developers, our social media following, our investors. That means reaching new people who have no idea what Komodo is or maybe have heard of Komodo but don't really know what the project is all about. Everything we produce will be created with this audience in mind so please bear with us if it seems like we're repeating ourselves, our like we're recycling content, or like we're just publishing the same stuff over and over. All of this is intentional.
