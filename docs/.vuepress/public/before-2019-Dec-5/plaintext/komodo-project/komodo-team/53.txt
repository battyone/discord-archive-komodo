@Meyse that's certainly something we want to do üòÉ

[10-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Meyse#0952
to be blunt, i dont think these infographics will do that job. i might be wrong ofcourse

[10-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jon008#5899
for me it is nice to see lot of infographic contestant who participate in the contest. lot of them make their entry to be qualified and they tried hard to complete it in time of submission. i hope that we all recognize the time and effort of all contestant..

So $DAPS clearly won the last poll over $TRX $XRP and $XVG in regards to who has the strongest community!! Lets match them up with some other strong communal projects like $ICX $NEO and $KMD - this should be interesting!!!

@benohanlon @Steve Lee might be interesting to be active with kmd on delta?

[10-Oct-18 06:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not many coins using it yet, so kmd might not get lost in other notifications?

[10-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@benohanlon  let's get in contact with them please

[10-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
thanks for the heads up @Cryptoon . How is their user adoption? Are they the key competitor to blockfolio now?

[10-Oct-18 07:29 PM] WhiteWidow#8771

[10-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Tek#5253

Hehe what a spoilt sport, sounds like NIH syndrome.

Consensus customization with crypto conditions allows for dApps to be built with access to all parts of the blockchain.

 - the block reward distribution (and probably fancy cryptonomics and governance) Mr Vlad probably dreams of
 - off chain data oracle ized to become part of consensus rules
 - utxo locking for stable coin gateways
 - tokenization of assets
 - instant payment channels, on chain, comparable with lightning network.  Also lockable and therefore exchangeable for other gateway coins, crypto or stable coin, tokenized asset or combinations.
 - fungibility between chains

This is only the beginning too!  Very flexible extensions to v1 and v2 blockchain tech.

Hey all.. ViisiitCoin will become a new coin that will be used to create a new marketing channel, so I guess, no better place to also send this message. There is an active bounty challenge going on for people that want to give feedback on the whitepaper of the ViisiitCoin. ViisiitCoin will become an assetchain of Komodo.

The whitepaper is a Google docs, and we cannot give the link to it away freely, so‚Äô I‚Äôll need to add you to the document through an e-mail if you‚Äôre interested.

[13-Oct-18 03:16 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
More info on the whitepaper, you can find on the bottom page of www.H12N.com

for hash to be stable price must be stable. For price to be stable community must grow, because miners will not sell to same people everyday (same people have limited amounts), so new people are needed to sustain the network, otherwise all collapses. One can actually calculate at what rate members must grow in number daily (assuming avg BTC one have to spend), assuming amount of KMD or BTC needed to sustain mining/hashrate.

PS did anyone in marketing team try to make a report of marketing strategies used in crypto? To see the full picture to know which things make sense, which not? it's seems without strong constant inflow of new people we can only expect KMD economy going down long term.

I think its good to make a lightpaper with descriptions how to use the userinterface (agama wallet, barterdex, hyperdex) with beyond links to deeper tech. The original english whitepaper is good but almoust nothing about userinterfaces. I think many users want just a quick intro to get the basics an start then. What do you think?

What are your thoughts on Komodo?

- Independent blockchain creation.
- 51% attack resistance.
- Atomic swaps in use over 100,000 times.
- JL777 one of the most active lead devs I‚Äôve seen.
- I think the project would fascinate you.

What would it take?
