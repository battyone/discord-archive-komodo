Hi

[11-Apr-19 07:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I read this article about a project called Decent, the article doesn't explain what they plan to use but since it's funded by DCG group I suppose it's Ethereum. I wrote an email shilling for Komodo, let's hope for the best 😅  https://hackernoon.com/how-will-decent-use-blockchain-16d025dd5942

How will Decent use blockchain?
If you were reinventing health insurance, how would you do it?

Admin?

[11-Apr-19 07:27 PM] Steff#1446
I would have some questions

[11-Apr-19 07:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
Go ahead and ask @Steff, someone will reply

[11-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Steff#1446
Thx!

[11-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Steff#1446
So I would like to know if it’s allowed to use the Komodo Logo for merchandise?

[11-Apr-19 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Audo @benohanlon can answer that I guess

[11-Apr-19 07:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as long as it puts kmd in a positive spotlight, I doubt anyone will object and community projects will be encouraged 😃

[11-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Audo#5667
yes, Komodo is an open source project, you are welcome to use the logo in ways that benefit the project & community.

[11-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Audo#5667
like selling Komodo coffee mugs

[11-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Steff#1446
Great

[11-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Steff#1446
Could you send me a vector grafic of the new logo pls?

We cannot send the new logo until the rebrand is online

[12-Apr-19 02:59 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@Audo do we have any updates to the ETA for the rebrand?

[12-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Audo#5667

So in short, it'll be ready when it's ready.  Nothing new about KMD release timeline 😃

In 1 week I bring on the #Komodo team to discuss $KMD, how to create a custom #blockchain, and their DEX. 

What questions does the #crypto community want me to ask.

RT and leave your questions in the comments.
Twitter

[19-Apr-19 03:09 PM] Berg#2666
Would it be possible for KMD to help HUSH by leveraging their scale for marketing?
HUSH has recently upgraded and become a KMD AC, with lots of exciting things in the works.
We're hoping that we can find support in the KMD community to help us gain some traction, whether it be Twitter, Blogs, Forums, Exchange Outreach, etc.
Anything is much appreciated.

If you haven't already, join us on Discord!

https://myhush.org/discord

[19-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Audo#5667
Hey @Berg 

Can you brief us about all the dev things going on? I'm afraid we haven't had the time to follow you guys closely.

It would be great to highlight what kind of contributions your team is making for the Komodo ecosystem.

[19-Apr-19 03:21 PM] Berg#2666
We were the first coin to convert to become a KMD Asset Chain, Komodo did a case study on the HUSH v3 upgrade as well, which I'm not sure if it's published or intended to be or not.

[19-Apr-19 03:35 PM] Audo#5667
yeah that one is not published yet.

We will of course promote that once it's out

[19-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Berg#2666
Awesome

[19-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Berg#2666
Our biggest concern is our current uphill battle with liquidity, as Cryptopia faltered and left us with extremely low volume.
We're hoping that the Komodo team can assist us with getting our foot in the door for some exchange listings, as we're now extremely easy to list for exchanges that already offer Komodo trading.
I'm hoping that we can work together to help push HUSH in the right direction.

[19-Apr-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
exchange listings are simply about paying crazy fees. there seems to be no otherway

[19-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
or maybe polish up the whitepaper and do IEO on an exchange and you will get automatically listed on the exchange

[19-Apr-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but there must be a fee for IEO, probably comparable to listing

[19-Apr-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no free meals? something like that

[19-Apr-19 07:53 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
IF the exchange gets the fees from the funds raised then It's win win, the project gets new funds and listed on exchange at the same time

[19-Apr-19 07:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But if the project has to pay the fee upfront, then it is another case

[20-Apr-19 01:11 AM] PTYX#6840
IEOs are costing around 10% of funds raised plus a listing fee between 5-30 bitcoins

[20-Apr-19 01:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Some exchanges have different arrangements though.

[20-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Berg it s not even launched, but you are already on Barterlly's prod servers with HUSH3

[20-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw @FabØ had to list OUR and maybe ZEX, maybe you could get in touch

[20-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@PTYX dont forget the trading fees on the huge volume following the listing

Proper DEXs with no centralized kludge (so, like, not BinanceDEX) win in the end.

Not sure where you'd like this announcement, but let me know!  I have just released the latest version of VerusPay, the self-sovereign payment gateway, with Komodo KMD support added.

[25-Apr-19 12:51 AM] Oliver Westbrook#7752

#deleted-channel I think

[25-Apr-19 10:05 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Why are there no twitter Posts about the Dex and the mm2? Think this is huge and should be shared with the public. A part from gains, a bit more volume in kmd would be nice. More volume will lead to usdt pair on binance i guess?

[25-Apr-19 10:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
I think because its not ready yet

[25-Apr-19 10:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
Why twitter about unfinished things?

[25-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, alpha testing still underway

[25-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
seems closer to near-beta to me

[25-Apr-19 01:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Good to hear!

[25-Apr-19 01:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CoinKing88 if you interested in testing #chainmakers @siu - Chainmakers the app they are looking testers for is based on MM2.0 😃

why is this separate to the mm2 dev effort here?

[25-Apr-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
GUI on top of engine

[25-Apr-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
same engine, different GUI

[25-Apr-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like asking why are there more than one wallet for the same coin daemon

[25-Apr-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also the decentralization thing

[25-Apr-19 04:29 PM] klein#5233
ok so just a different gui to the same dex?

[25-Apr-19 04:29 PM] klein#5233
not a different dex?

[25-Apr-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt know of this till today and nobody needs my permission to do whatever they want to

@klein it's a very good overview, only the initial phrase sounds strange: "During the last two weeks, we have not seen much progress, but despite this fact, there is something interesting." then you follow up with a string of recent news that would make most other projects pale in comparison 😄

[26-Apr-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
also i didnt say an explorer for all komodo projects as there is really no way to know about all of them, but rather a combined ecosystem stats for the chains that we know about

[26-Apr-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810

[01-May-19 07:24 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes, agreed.  These things have long ago been identified and why the tech continues to be made and a rebrand of what komodo is, who it caters for and the tech and services it provided.

What does success mean to you?

Hello
Few weeks ago, jl777c asked to NN candidates to help to support coins using block explorers. Jl777 wanted that each block explorer display a banner with links to other assetchain. I heard that kmd marketing team is doing the list of coins that need support. Do you have a first example of the list ? (With social media links of each AC of the list if possible)

[06-May-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
I'm hosting a block explorer for chips (it should be ready about tomorrow) and I'd like to add the banner discussed (or develop it with help of other NN candidates)

[06-May-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[06-May-19 04:52 PM] Mylo#8306
@phm87  it will be small inoffesive _text_ banner - will likely just need to adjust some css to make banner taller for a line of text linking to projects

[06-May-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
I used an iquidus but I may use sth else later. I can have a look if some code is already developed

[06-May-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for your quick reply

[06-May-19 04:54 PM] phm87#7395
Is there any ETA ? Can I help ?

[06-May-19 04:56 PM] Mylo#8306
