@dudezmobi while it is better than last year, we need more focused results now.

[01-Jul-18 11:56 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@PTYX anyone doing the analysis how top20 projects are doing marketing? MAybe we can find there sth more then wash trading ? üòÉ

[01-Jul-18 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
not ony I mean what are they doing now, as now they might do not so much, but they must have done some successful actions in the past

[01-Jul-18 11:57 AM] PTYX#6840
The problem is that Steve is the commander in chief when it comes to marketing. We can talk about it all day and make plans but at the end of the day, he needs to move that on his end.

[01-Jul-18 11:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is it a problem or opportunity ? üòõ

[01-Jul-18 11:58 AM] PTYX#6840
For example, I'm using other projects as templates for the chainzilla marketing. However, it's difficult to stick to one strategy

[01-Jul-18 11:58 AM] PTYX#6840
A problem is an opportunity

[01-Jul-18 11:58 AM] PTYX#6840
For the right person

[01-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Audo#5667
yeah milestones on our website, for sure we should have them.

[01-Jul-18 01:31 PM] yorklab#7270
"For example, I'm using other projects as templates for the chainzilla marketing." I do that in many areas of my work life. I don't try and re-invent the wheel, I see what works best from others (let then do the hard work) and emulate that.

[01-Jul-18 02:07 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
does Steve reports weekly / monthly about results ?

[01-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Audo#5667
We did that public Trello board in hopes it would become the perfect solution to create transparency and get feedback

[01-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Audo#5667
It's like an ongoing live report

[01-Jul-18 02:18 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
perfect solution for transparency is when you do weekly/monthly updates, have goals to reach with ETAs and are paid for reaching them üòÉ

[01-Jul-18 02:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this way you see if there is any progress or justification of no progress; otherwise you change managing people after month or 2 depending on circumstances

Community Building & engagement
We must rely on our active community to spread the word. For that to be effective we must have:

1. Clear branding
2. Clear messaging, explanations, and stories
3. Easy access to information, material, and graphics 
4. Bounty campaigns and engaging environment

"organic growt...

[01-Jul-18 02:22 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
asumming you have managing board and lead JL, any team leader (like Marketing team leader) should report actions todo list for next motnh and after month is over report what was achieved, what not and why. BAsics of managing. MAybe it is what actually happens but we just not suppose to no ? üòõ

[01-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Audo#5667
Indeed, that would be good to have too. We have briefly discussed how we could achieve that, both dev and marketing updates. It is just a big commitment to start doing and so far neither team has had the time.

[01-Jul-18 02:23 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also no problem if some goals not reached - all is good as long as you have some reasonable justification - it's normal. Bad is only in 1 case - if there will be constant excuses.

[01-Jul-18 02:24 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
real life companies have often delays like 6 month or even 1 year

[01-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Audo#5667
I'm talking about public updates. Of course we have internal team updates and meetings

[01-Jul-18 02:24 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I see ok

[01-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Audo#5667
From what I see things are moving to the right direction. There is just so much stuff to discuss and decide, not just from marketing perspective. There's also the development vision and business side.

[01-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Audo#5667
We have come a long way from the early ICO days

[01-Jul-18 02:28 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
definitely moving the right direction, only a matter of optimizing that how fast they move üòÉ managing not official structure like this is sth new

[01-Jul-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
@yorklab definitely, I've learned that you want results the last thing you want to do is reinvent the wheel

[01-Jul-18 09:18 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I do my part by retweeting and talking about komodo as much i can.. just not to come across as pushy

[01-Jul-18 10:24 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We've recently invested in a platform called Melt Water that will drive insights on what is being talked about and by what writers and contributors. We have several influencer databases that we've spent time developing relationships with. Once categorized, we've decided that we will also make this public to our community to help add to, or understand the level of engagement and activities are.

[01-Jul-18 10:25 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we will offer more transparency, which is something we've not focusing on as much in the past.

[01-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we've  made the decision to share more and not be in an endless "planning" and "perfecting loop that has often slowed down production output. we will share drafts under disclaimers and provide updates, whether they're formally announced or not. please also remember there are many items that are under NDA, where contractually we cannot disclose things until they've become finalized. we will however give high-level updates on status updates regarding these but won't disclose company/project names until allowed.

We've been invited to be a founding member of a UN affiliated consultancy that is building a Blockchain Consortium group. This is an exciting opportunity for us, and will help give us credibility and validation as we pursue a nation-state blockchain solution that is a primary use case james has identified for our scaling solution.

[01-Jul-18 10:41 PM] dudezmobi#1945
done we have a barterdex channel in products here at discord?

[01-Jul-18 10:41 PM] dudezmobi#1945
or we switching to hyperdex?

[01-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Steve Lee#1967
currently hyperdex is the main focus for the barterdex frontend, as decided by the technical team. we are aligned and will support any co-marketing activities that the hyperdex team needs.

[01-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we're in discussions with several projects on integrating barterdex to their front-ends. licensing of barterdex backend for liquidity providers is also being worked on.

[01-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
the business plan and structure needs to be finalized and ironed out before the marketing team can promote.

Someone mentioning in telegram about how to convince waves and erc20 tokens to move over to KMD. Obviously independent blockchains are a big factor, however does anyone think that providing your own mining power might be a turn off to many projects?

[01-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Regnar#6164
obviously we can encourage them to use dPoW to help secure their chains, but they are likely to be under powered still, any thoughts on this?

[01-Jul-18 11:54 PM] Steve Lee#1967
There are efforts in creating solutions that will make ERC20 migrations more seamless. We haven't targeted waves at all, but they do have a targeted solution to create a token on their product that is  streamlined.

[02-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I guess I'm just trying to figure out if we have a viable solution for ultra light, bordering on skeleton projects that have no desire for their own mining capabilities

[02-Jul-18 01:25 AM] Regnar#6164
I guess PoS would be a suitable mining algo for barebone projects.

[02-Jul-18 05:10 AM] RAE#3178
There's an Instagram channel: 'ethereum_updates' that I've noticed bullishly posts KMD graphics and news and reaches 43.1k followers. 
Thought I'd mention it for everyone's info and liking the KMD posts. 
Also...Steve Lee thanks for the updates today, very encouraging to read. 
Regnar keep up the awesome work mate,  you're definitely one of the top community contributors and you're resolve is to be applauded.

maybe put at a fraction of a cost in italics

I think the top one sums it up nicely and gets people more interested. Youll hear lots of blockchains with "protection" but for someone to read "Protect with bitcoins hashrate" sort of grabs their attention

Given the business target demographic, I'd disagree with Soldat about "at a fraction of a cost"; I think it's a good "selling point"
