@Everything Tangle  "I was wondering what‚Äôs the point of someone (like myself) investing hours into this infographic "   the short answer is money ü§ë

[07-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The long answer is that the infographic won't be rendered irrelevant, even after the rebrand

[07-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The rebrand will deal with things like colors, typeface, and the logo, but those are relatively easy to swap in and out once a graphic is complete

[07-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
(the rebrand will also come up with new messaging, new product strategy, a new website, and other things, but the new visual identity is the important point here)

[07-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We want the infographic to be a visual explanation of the architecture of Komodo's tech, which isn't changing one bit. The infographic will remain useful far into the future

[07-Sep-18 10:06 AM] jorian#4555
i dont call that a rebrand. more a restyle. i thought we all agreed the marketing from komodo was lacking, but what you're saying now is that even with partnering up with Ideas by Nature, we don't get to see a change in marketing strategy?

[07-Sep-18 10:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
What about it isn't a rebrand? Just because the name isn't changing?

[07-Sep-18 10:12 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I mentioned the rebrand will include new visual identity, new messaging, new product strategy, a new website.  That IS a new marketing strategy

[07-Sep-18 10:12 AM] jorian#4555
i'm sorry, i totally didn't read that

[07-Sep-18 10:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just some more info about the rebrand, since a lot of people have been asking about what exactly it will include. We don't have specifics or details yet but one of the major things we're trying to improve is the messaging. We want to find ways to talk about Komodo that are both easy to understand and really do justice to the magnitude of the tech itself. That's a hard task, as explaining Komodo is complicated. We are also working on the "user journey", which will help educate people about Komodo and guide them through our ecosystem in the way that makes the most sense. We also need to figure out what we want out CTA (call to action) to be, which is tough because it may be different things for different people. If you're a developer, we want you to build on Komodo. But even that isn't clear because devs can build in different ways (do we want devs to launch a blockchain? start coding smart contracts? building dApps? or something else??) If you're an entrepreneur or business leader, we want you to use Komodo tech but you can't build yourself so we would need the CTA to be contacting ChainZilla or Chainmakers. If you're a user, the CTA might be downloading Agama, downloading HypderDEX, buying KMD, etc. So we need to figure all of this out and really craft the messaging and website in a way that caters to everyone while also pursuing the goals we've decided help Komodo the most.

[07-Sep-18 10:30 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're also working to establish a clear product strategy. This will, at some point, need to come with a legal business entity which will work closely with Komodo but still be separate. This is necessary for a few reasons. First, the legal entity will allow us to raise funds from investors and VCs. Second, it will help to build new partnerships and agreements with other projects, businesses, educational institutions, etc. Third, the legal entity will leverage the product strategy to develop revenue models, which will sustain the project well into the future.

[07-Sep-18 10:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And of course, once all of this happens, the marketing team will help promote the CTAs that support the product strategy and revenue streams

[07-Sep-18 10:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So lots and lots of stuff going on behind the scenes. The new visual identity is just the "front end" of the rebrand

@jorian crowdsourcing ideas doesn't always mean you have to use them verbatim. It's a seeding ground. Let me quote feverbee who are a good source of community ideas that I read regularly. 

"Crowdsourced competitions are widely misunderstood. Visit any major crowdsource effort and you will find only a tiny percentage of ideas are ever implemented. Most contributors don‚Äôt have the skill, knowledge of your products, or understand your company‚Äôs constraints well enough to develop a fully-formed idea. Worse yet, crowdsourcing efforts are rarely set up to accommodate truly groundbreaking ideas.

Browse the 550+ ideas implemented through Dell‚Äôs Ideastorm, is there really a game-changer in the bunch? Most ideas tinkered around the edges of old products. There aren‚Äôt any new smartphones, social networks, cryptocurrencies, machine learning, or breakthrough products here. Crowdsourced ideas often closely resemble a list of customer complaints (isn‚Äôt every complaint also an idea of what to improve?)

But the real benefit of crowdsourcing ideas and solutions extends beyond fully-formed ideas. It helps identify amazing talent to hire, new approaches to follow and to confirm or refute your existing thinking. You might not use an idea in its entirety, but you may learn from unique aspects of each idea.

Having a hundred, or even a thousand, fresh pair of eyes give their opinion on a problem more than pays for the relatively tiny fee to attract them in the first place." - https://www.feverbee.com/crowdsource/

yeah we indeed are doing a **rebrand** not a simple visual refresh (http://fabrikbrands.com/rebranding-vs-brand-refresh-whats-the-difference/)

Actually even a rebrand is an understatement. We are doing much more, rethinking everything and coming up with a grand plan & strategy for Komodo, from development, to business, to marketing. There are a lot of things to figure out before we can lay down the final marketing strategy for Komodo. The marketing comes last, and is affected by the business strategy, goals, and so on.

The big question is what Komodo is looking to achieve during the, let's say, next 10 years. What is the ultimate goal and vision? Is all we do alligned with that vision? Are we focusing on the right things today to get there? How do we track our progress and measure success?

Hi, 
What is the official way to write cryptoconditions?
"Crypto-Conditions"?
"CryptoConditions"?
"Crypto Conditions"?
etc...?

[07-Sep-18 02:25 PM] CrisF#3405
And is "CC" the official abreviation?

[07-Sep-18 02:32 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I always say CryptoConditions but googling shows BigchainDB using both Crypto-Conditions in some places and Crypto Conditions in others. But it looks like Crypto-Conditions does seem to be the proper way as far as I can see. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-01

[07-Sep-18 02:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, @xRobeSx .  I've seen many variations too so was wondering if Komodo had an official version.  That link is very useful and I'll go with that.  Thank you!

[07-Sep-18 02:38 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Good points @CrisF I think its important we use the same spelling as other projects since Crypto-Conditions is a standard and not just for KMD

@jorian @Everything Tangle I just wanted to clarify the reasoning and logic behind the infographic bounty contest.  Could our team and/or Ideas by Nature produce this infographic? Absolutely. However, getting the design of an infographic isn‚Äôt the main goal of this bounty contest. The main goal is to educate people outside of our existing community and leverage their networks to promote increased awareness and growth. Although the bounty is open and shared within our own community, we‚Äôve also identified finalists from bounty contests ran by other projects. We‚Äôre also reaching out to crypto agencies, research organizations, and freelance content contributors that might not be familiar with Komodo. We‚Äôve also kept the guidelines open-ended and the resource material fairly dense, so it forces these content creators to really understand and learn our technology and vision. This will push them to creatively reinterpret the messaging in ways we might have thought of versus copy pasting and adding a stock image. Creating the infographic ourselves and only promoting it within our own community is like preaching into an echo chamber and can also be seen as biased. However, if people are seeing 10-30 different infographics all talking about KMD, it might entice people to really look into us and tell their friends if the messaging resonates. Our hopes are to introduce KMD to a whole new audience as well as reintroduce the new KMD to those who might have not stayed up to date. This bounty will serve as a pilot on how effective this sort of approach could be.

Bruce Fenton's chainstone labs/atlantic financial (he didn't clarify which) sold almost all of their ETH by March this year because he doesn't believe ETH will maintain dominance over their "killer app" which he says is tokens themselves. Likely meaning he believes another platform will move in to take hold of the "Token" market. In our case this would be the independent chain market, but as easily launched as a token on ETH or Waves. 
https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1038165837818068992

Bruce is a huge Atomic Swap fan but I haven't been able to get his attention unfortunately. Perhaps we can reach out in a more official capacity to turn him into an ally, or advocate of Komodo tech. He's also involved in the Ravencoin project which is already listed on BarterDEX engine. He is also a proponent of the tokenization of real world assets which I know has been of interest to many here in Komodo.

Our fund held ETH since the crowd sale

Sold almost all of it by March of this year

Main reasons:
- overall portfolio rebalancing
- concerns over scaling & immutability / central control

Tokens are the killer app of ETH & I don‚Äôt think it will maintain its market share...

'Crowdsourcing' is simply a PR scam. Nothing more. It is a shameful marketing practice which takes advantage of and manipulates naive people to invest their precious time, skills and resources without a reward or legal pay for their efforts. It is quite sickening that companies relentlessly and cluelesssly think this is ok. Offer a bounty, 50 naive people work their ass off, 1 or 2 get some 'reward', the rest get nothing.  It is a completely LAZY and unjust way to accomplish something.  Do your research, go through portfolios of designers then HIRE/CONTRACT a designer to do consistent good work.

[07-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Daniel CP#2020
No one is forced to participate in a bounty contest. People choose to do it, probably for a variety of reasons. Some may do it because they are creative and enjoy making visually captivating graphics. Others may be doing in hopes of winning the bounty. Others still may be strong supporters of Komodo and want to help promote the project.  I'm sure there are plenty of other motivations. But in no case is any one tricked or forced into making in infographic.
