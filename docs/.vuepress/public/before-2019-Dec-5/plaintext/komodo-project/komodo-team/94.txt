So what is the block reward every 90 seconds 120 seconds it can't be random

[20-Sep-19 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are 8 coins given per block
on average 50% of blocks are mined by PoW
on average 50% of blocks are staked by PoS
"on average" because: math

[20-Sep-19 04:30 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Your not making sense your defending a already broken system thats being measured  what is the network block reward for POW ever how many seconds then split the math properly your staking has always been a joke

139k sol currently on pool. if you have 37k sol, you will get your share.

[20-Sep-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
no one takes anyone's rewards from pool.

[20-Sep-19 04:31 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
Its too unpredictable Im trying to measure this every 24 hours but you stats arn't stable.  I again ask how often is POW block reward

[20-Sep-19 04:31 PM] gcharang#6833
there is also Notary payment

[20-Sep-19 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
`I again ask how often is POW block reward`
no set time. it's random. 50% PoW and 50% PoS

[20-Sep-19 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Your not making sense your defending a already broken system`
Why is it that you seem to have a problem mining any coin in this system and everyone else can mine and understand just fine?
At some point you might need to look around and realize that your problem is you and that's why you were booted from the PIRATE discord

[20-Sep-19 04:33 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
I don't know why you are playing games like this I hate people that make something public but only annoy everyone.

it's

Note : miners call my pool umining as kind of nickname of unimining.net
I tried to explain labs 50% pos 50% pow on my discord but I was not very clear.
Maybe I missed few msgs (I will go to read arrr discord) but I guess that a website such as whattomine does not take into account pos part in profit calculation. Miner compared his earnings on my pool with this other pool http://mininglabs.rocks/workers/RDUJAMCMwcre4L1Dii5zq1XzGEHAEu94Rg and he said that a similar hashrate gave 12 times more. Do you know if website such as whattomine takes pos % into account ? And who is the pool op of mininglabs.rocks?
Sorry toaskhere but the conversation happened here

Why no answer yet on this? Is there no interest to get listed on more exchanges or just ppl being too busy?

[22-Sep-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what good does getting on some small exchange give?

[22-Sep-19 09:04 AM] Markus#5464
BitNordex is a new nordic exchange they got all licenses required also a fiat gateway

[22-Sep-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
what sort of listing fees, vast majority of exchanges are basically just charging "only" 3 to 5BTC for listing, with no real trading volumes

[22-Sep-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464
Dont know listing fee

[22-Sep-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
anything other than a top 10 (real volume) exchange is really not worth listing on, as we are already in 3 of the top4 and almost half the top 10.

[22-Sep-19 09:13 AM] Markus#5464
Maybe its free listing if they think the project is good thats why i thought it can be a great opportunity since its a new exchange with fiat gateway and everything they run is licensed

[22-Sep-19 06:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Markus  I will check them out ,  if it’s free listing can’t hurt.  But not worth paying for an low volume exchange

There is an AtomicDEX Community Channel on Telegram. We try to help. Some questions, however, can only be answered by members and developers. 

Would it be possible to get a Matterbridge Bot for AtomicDEX? So that the developers can answer via Discord?

Investor question: How much did Binance pay you to post this tweet? https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1177257973292392450?s=20  Komodo promoting one of the highest security ignorances possible in cryptocurrencies.

{Embed}
Komodo (@KomodoPlatform)
https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1177257973292392450?s=20
Komodo is proud to be a member of the @binance Staking Platform. https://t.co/DE7qicboIS
Twitter

[26-Sep-19 10:59 PM] Portman#9202
You should have posted "Binance approached us with an offer of $XX to promote cryptocurrency users to leave KMD on Binance's Exchange. This is a very high security risk which we HIGHLY DISSAPPROVE OF. If you do not hold the security keys to your crypto, then it is not your crypto - it belongs to the exchange you store it on. Millions of dollars have been REGULARLY lost on exchanges via exit scams, corruption etc. the latest being QuadrigaCX. Instead we are doubling down on educating the masses about proper coin security and we call upon ALL cryptocurrencies developers to do the same. The most secure way to collect KMD Interest Rewards is using our AGAMA wallet. Thank you."

[26-Sep-19 11:02 PM] Oszy#5734
The most secure is ledger, and Agama is not "Ours" anymore.  They  never encouraged people to hold funds on an exchange, this post in my opinion was just formality, saying binance is doing the right thing by distributing the collected rewards which was not the case until now.

[26-Sep-19 11:05 PM] Oszy#5734
You are not getting more on binance than you would get in your wallet, but from a day trader point of view, who are keeping KMD on binance on a daily basis, it's not a bad thing to get those rewards while trading KMD.

[26-Sep-19 11:05 PM] Portman#9202
The tweet itself enourages people to hold funds "Komodo is proud to be a member of the @binance Staking Platform."

[26-Sep-19 11:06 PM] Oszy#5734
No it is not. It suggests that if you do have kmd there, you will get the rewards same as if it was in your wallet.

[26-Sep-19 11:06 PM] Oszy#5734
No one says to send it there and keep it there

[26-Sep-19 11:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Sometimes, you take marketing where you can get it
and what is written is not taken as it was intended

[26-Sep-19 11:08 PM] Portman#9202
The binace staking page the tweet links to: "With Staking, Binance users will be able to grow their funds by receiving monthly rewards & distributions simply by depositing and HOLDING FUNDS on Binance."

[26-Sep-19 11:10 PM] Oszy#5734
said binance not komodo,my take on this is obviously not to do that

[26-Sep-19 11:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
the wailing about lack of marketing has been deafening here in the past. if this binance gimmick had not been touted, the objections would likely outweigh your current complaint. I agree that binance is a cex and that comes with some pitfalls, but hey, it's the wild west.

[26-Sep-19 11:11 PM] Portman#9202
THEN SAY THAT in the tweet

[26-Sep-19 11:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
you want to leave your ass hanging out there, no one can stop you.

[26-Sep-19 11:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
if more people buy kmd then the benefits might outweigh the lack of opsec principles

[26-Sep-19 11:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
I am in no way affiliated with the team btw and my opinion is my own

[26-Sep-19 11:17 PM] actionslacks#4072

[27-Sep-19 12:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think that documentation needs some dumbing down, or maybe just a "kmd for dummies" type page. but honestly, as more people get red pilled into crypto, It's a race to the bottom for the hearts and minds of the pre-programmed masses. Whenever you think you idiot proofed something, nature tends to evolve a better idiot.

[27-Sep-19 12:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
crypto itself is an esoteric concept to almost everyone. the details of how kmd has engineered many great solutions to as yet unforeseen problems just makes it that much more difficult to sell. But the Mobile Dex is the moon shot to mass adoption. seeing current progress makes me giddy in anticipation.

[27-Sep-19 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's only so much they can "dumb down" certain things
In my mind, I equate it to time-traveling back to the 1300s and trying to explain to someone from there how a 28 core and 56 thread CPU works

[27-Sep-19 12:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's an epic task. to describe complex concepts that can be understood by the greatest amount of people possible.

`the details of how kmd has engineered many great solutions to as yet unforeseen problems just makes it that much more difficult to sell. `

fwiw, I'm not disagreeing that there should exist some "simplified" version of explaining it that doesn't make folks' eyes glaze over while they say "huh?"
just pointing out the difficulty level in coming up with such a thing

[27-Sep-19 12:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
to understand the benefits of dPOW, aPOW and nSPV requires an understanding of something beyond, "buy this shitcoin and moon lambo naow", which is where 77.7% of crypto investors are at when it comes to technical inderstanding.

No need to detail anything to day traders who do not give a crap about the tech - the explanations need to be imparted to businesses and how/if they can benefit from the platform.

[27-Sep-19 12:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the explanations need to be imparted to businesses and how/if they can benefit from the platform`

About the Binance tweet, Komodo isn't recommending Binance or suggesting that anyone store their funds on a CEX. But if KMD needs to be listed on CEXs (and it does) then it's best that users are able to earn their active user rewards, rather then the exchange itself taking those funds
