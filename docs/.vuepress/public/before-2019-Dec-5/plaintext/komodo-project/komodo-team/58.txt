this one

[13-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I saw he's saying in the comments it's not ZEX üòÑ

[13-Nov-18 04:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no idea what project he's talking about

[13-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Coincollect maybe, but they are known for a while now?

[13-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Acura#2748
CoinCollect is building a mobile Dex using BarterDex Engine - this was my last Info

[13-Nov-18 05:08 PM] tolken#2655
Re: new site. Looks clean. My minor critique, and this is a very subjective one, it seems very popular these days but I‚Äôve grown tired of it (super long vertical pages).  I want to personally see the whole thing at a glance, at least as much as possible.

[13-Nov-18 05:09 PM] tolken#2655
The first thing I see (on mobile) is ‚ÄúOpen-Source Infrastructure For An Interoperable Blockchain Ecosystem‚Äù in huge bold type. Is that what best describes Komodo? Seems like it describes many other projects.

[13-Nov-18 05:14 PM] tolken#2655
If I am still interested after that, I scroll down and see some icons without any key definitions. Nice icons but they don‚Äôt mean anything. Then a full screen listing  ‚Äúscalability, security, interoperability, adaptability‚Äù

[13-Nov-18 05:15 PM] tolken#2655
Security ‚Äúbitcoin level security‚Äù that‚Äôs sexy. I want to know more.

[13-Nov-18 05:17 PM] tolken#2655
Scalability ‚Äúlimitless scalability‚Äù slightly intrigued? Many claim scalability, maybe being slightly more specific, even if not entirely accurate, would be more informative. A theoretical near-term scalability as an example (like 1m tps)

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] tolken#2655
Interoperability: ‚Äúseamless interoperability‚Äù using the word interoperability to describe interoperability, seems like there could be a more descriptive way to say this.

[13-Nov-18 05:20 PM] tolken#2655
Adaptability: ‚Äúcontinuous development‚Äù I‚Äôd hope so!  Could we give some indication of how active the development is? Team size, team growth, github activity?

[13-Nov-18 05:22 PM] tolken#2655
I know these aren‚Äôt meant to be huge text bubbles, but at the same time this is of course the first thing people see. Making it as potent and concise as possible can help people get it. Regardless, nice work team, great to see progress!

[13-Nov-18 05:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Acura Yeah I have their whitepaper

[13-Nov-18 05:41 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@tolken  Just a reminder, this is an interim web refresh where the main goal was to get updated messaging and minor visual update. Full focus is now on the actual rebranded website where we're introducing a entirely new web experience and incorporating a re-hauled design.

[13-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Steve Lee#1967
regarding the header - i agree we could add something stronger here. the challenge is that Komodo is complex, and it's hard to incorporate everything without sounding too high-level marketing speak. But we'll look into this.

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] tolken#2655
Certainly, just wanted to provide some personal feedback. I‚Äôll let the experts parse what‚Äôs best to do üòÉ

[13-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
All feedback is useful for sure.

[13-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we were purposefully keeping those initial descriptions vague as below is the CTA to go to the technology page, which expand on all 4 pillars in great details

[13-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Looking at it now, it might not be apparent that the CTA below is tied to the pillars above

[13-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we tried to get the tech related details for continuous development in, but that would impact launch so we're rolling that over to the rebranded site

[13-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We're thinking of having a dedicated "proof points" section that would aggregate github commits, dedicated solutions and technology landing pages, a dev portal etc.

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] tolken#2655
Vague isn‚Äôt bad I suppose, but it seems the challenge is to ensure they‚Äôre interested to dig deeper. Also it‚Äôs important to consider that the website isn‚Äôt necessarily people‚Äôs first exposure to Komodo (maybe they hear word of mouth, or because of some awesome PR that comes from a successful 1m tps test :P), so it doesn‚Äôt have to say everything at once, but just lead them to what they‚Äôre looking for.

[13-Nov-18 05:48 PM] Steve Lee#1967
right that was the goal

[13-Nov-18 05:49 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We do have a few updates already planned for this interim site, but the majority of focus will now be on the rebrand.

[13-Nov-18 05:51 PM] Steve Lee#1967
If there are any specific examples of things you've seen that you'd like to see in the new rebranded site, feel free to dm them to me. We're currently building out our requirements list to drive a new sitemap.

@Cryptoon not related to any of those, still secret üòô

[13-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
üò≠ need to knoooooow

[13-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Just made me think of a cool visual to show scalability. It could be a chain with green orbs flying around in the link, and it gets more and more intense and then a second chain spawns out of it kind of like a DNA strand splitting. and now they both have green orbs flying around (but less intense) and some orbs flying between the chains, and when it gets more intense it splits again etc.

[13-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Regnar#6164
to show how when the transaction amount gets too large on a chain, a scaling chain spawns and handles some of the load, but the two chains are next to one another and transactions (the green orbs) can move between the chains

we really need to push a better elevator pitch, often we are still described as a Zcash fork

[15-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Audo#5667
On our explorer we give this explanation about Komodo:

**What is Komodo?**

End-to-end Blockchain Solutions Provider empowering developers to build freely and participate in creating the largest open blockchain network.

Komodo Platform strives to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technologies around the globe and to lead the world in blockchain integration. All of the Komodo‚Äôs unique and cutting-edge technologies are open-source and available to everyone.

With a collaborative approach, rather than a competitive one, Komodo Platform is working to unite the blockchain industry, empower business leaders and entrepreneurs, and eliminate the need for centralized third parties in financial transactions.

[15-Nov-18 07:25 PM] joe2x4#5987
"Komodo is an opensource blockchain, tool kit suite, and protocol that is used in the interconnected open blockchain network." 

My explanation in one sentence. I'm defining komodo in the scope of a larger umbrella network called IOBN in this instance. Just my 2¬¢

[15-Nov-18 07:32 PM] joe2x4#5987
In other words we should properly define /name that overall network/forest/universe komodo is creating and use that to help define komodo

If $BCH devs are mindful and sneaky they can make $BCH network absolutely equally hash-strong to $BTC. It will be resistant to 51% attacks completely. Apply delayed Proof of Work on it. It's practically field test proven tech. Contact @KomodoPlatform

Using dPoW is the most cheapest way to secure itself against any current or future 51% attacks. I am pretty sure $KMD community will even fund your dPoW fee devs are willing to apply it to $BCH. A possibility of absolutely free 51% attack resistant $BCH.

I was just thinking a discord widget for the new Komodo site could be pretty cool, showing maybe the biggest/most visited channels (jl777, marketing, support, the github commits, and maybe other tech channels) so users visiting the site can see into the Discord to see what the content is like before joining up. could help lower any barriers to entry people have if they don't already have discord, and I'm sure our content here is quality enough that having a widget view (read only) will entice people to join.

Not sure if this works for this but it may:

@benohanlon another thing that would be cool would be an active/live updating github web like the one in this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzjXRiwKvRQ> in which updates to github appear there, and maybe indicates the newest commits in the past 24 hours.

[19-Nov-18 04:33 PM] Regnar#6164
if it were interactive too it would be great, like mousing over a point and can access it on github. I'm not sure what software was used to make the video, or if it would be something we can create/host on the website, it would make for a super cool center piece of the development section

[19-Nov-18 04:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Just tracking #feed-github shows like 25 commits in the past 24 hours alone. So it would be a quickly growing web.

I think that's an excellent opportunity tbh. We already talk about having nation state capabilities, and while that may not be as a currency, it is still a huge opportunity. Look at Factom, they will probably go for that one, but they have won some prior ones as well. So it's definitely an interesting shot. Assuming that Komodo wants to be involved in government in anyway.

Currently passports use rfid chips that have your personal info in it.  The idea is this in conjunction with their current method of swiping and comparing .  When the passport gets swiped the system sends a coin from host country / confederation account to visiting country  address with encrypted hash of the encrypted rfid chip info.   it provides a way of tracking . When a person enters and exits a country .

[20-Nov-18 12:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
its just a general idea,   im not sure of the low level aspects of blockchain for feasibility.   Another way of doing it, would be AssetsCC,  where each asset is just one token which corresponds to a passport,  tokens name can be the hash.

[20-Nov-18 12:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

"More specifically, the agency is primarily looking to identify proposals that can solve the following problems around government issued certificates, licenses, and attestations:

transfering assets from one chain to another becomes a whole new kettle of fish, but I dont seee why it would not be possible.

[20-Nov-18 05:00 AM] Regnar#6164
The standard use case gov sees for blockchain is tracking/verifying info. Hashing docs and storing them on a chain, or a variation of that. I'm willing to bet that will be the most common application type, and definitely one of the easiest or most useful. Depends again, if Komodo or one of the 3rd parties here wants to try and build something to pitch.

I think they‚Äôre getting more into facial recognition these days. Most likely your address will simply be your face.

[20-Nov-18 05:12 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea but considering the proposals that solve certificate, license, attestations issues related to issuing and verification and storage maintenance, it's most likely they aren't looking for this to track people, but to track and prove the legitimacy of official government documents that are issued.
