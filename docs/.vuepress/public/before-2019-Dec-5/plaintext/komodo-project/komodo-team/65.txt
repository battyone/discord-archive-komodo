without actual usage, advertising to consumers is pretty silly

[30-Dec-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
at this stage we need to connect with the other projects that will utilize the komodo tech

[30-Dec-18 09:49 PM] klunex#3191
i dont like verges marketing at all

[30-Dec-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
as you say users dont care about the tech

[30-Dec-18 09:50 PM] klunex#3191
lets see how it plays out for resistance. That was my idea, i posted already in july here. We will see. Maybe i am wrong üòâ

[30-Dec-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to make the DEX easier to use before pushing a lot of people to use it. maybe resitance will solve the user adoption problem after they raise $10 million

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe they raise $500,000

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] klunex#3191
but our dex is easy already isnt it? hyperdex?

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of how they do, it will help us

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Meyse#0952
guis for bdex are not mature enough to do actual marketing anyway

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
hyperdex is not competitive with binance

[30-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if users dont care about the tech, then that is the benchmark that is needed to be met

[30-Dec-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like trying to get people to use manual transmission cars when all they can drive are automatic transmission

[30-Dec-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
we have finite resources, we need to push where we are the strongest

[30-Dec-18 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
and while our DEX is pretty unique, there are literally dozens of other DEX (not actual atomic swap DEX but the people that dont care about tech accept them as DEX)

[30-Dec-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so the DEX is something we have for the ecosystem, now a potentially major project will productize it, we have mm2 in the works

[30-Dec-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
this all seems not so bad

[30-Dec-18 09:56 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c can res close source so kmd is not able to use the new fancy code?

[30-Dec-18 09:57 PM] klunex#3191
i am very curious how the resistance story develops

[30-Dec-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
they could, but then it wouldnt be very acceptable by crypto standards

[30-Dec-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
all users would need to trust them with all their funds

[30-Dec-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
might as well be a central exchange at that point

[30-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Seko#7408
25k for a video or a whole campaign?

[30-Dec-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
one video

[30-Dec-18 09:58 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c ok then it would defeat the purpose of a Dex. Have they reached out to you or any on the kmd team?

[30-Dec-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is $35k, or $15k, all depends on subscribers

[30-Dec-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
they havent reached out to me, cant speak for others on the team

[30-Dec-18 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we know that CZ of binance knows about komodo, chinese govt too and everybody that follows that. so it is clear that komodo is recognized for its tech

[30-Dec-18 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
as we get the first wave of dapps built on komodo, then people will see the actual difference between a komodo dapp and an ETH dapp

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] Seko#7408
Crazy...

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
will be like the difference between CPU mining and ASIC

[30-Dec-18 10:01 PM] Seko#7408
What do you think Ethereum has done financially to make them where they are today?  It was much more the technology that brought Ethereum there. Correct?

[30-Dec-18 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
they were the first with smart contracts and got thousands of devs

[30-Dec-18 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this created thousands of projects

[30-Dec-18 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
all raising funds

[30-Dec-18 10:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Funds based off its own ecosystem which lead to a mass cannablization and waves of scam/shady projects

[30-Dec-18 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the exchanges are already recommending coins to use dPoW

[30-Dec-18 10:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's one of the goals,  to make DPoW an exchange standard

[30-Dec-18 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
they really dont like being hit with the 51% double spends

[30-Dec-18 10:06 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c how many projects are on dpow now?

[30-Dec-18 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
40+, almost half a dozen external coins if you count the ones in the process now

[30-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Seko#7408
Would you say that dPoW is currently the strongest horse in Komodo's stable?

[30-Dec-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the most mature "horse", simple and complete

and without security in a blockchain, what do you have?

[30-Dec-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
an insecure chain isnt immutable

[30-Dec-18 10:08 PM] hastrup#8742
A central bank

[30-Dec-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so what is the point for it

[30-Dec-18 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why dPoW had to be done first

[30-Dec-18 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
now the notarization process is extended with MoMoM tech to implement cross chain tx

[30-Dec-18 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and the custom CC are very  very powerful

[30-Dec-18 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
even simple things like having the bitcore extensions built in, that is a big benefit if you need explorer level data sets from the deamon

[30-Dec-18 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
next year, there will be CC based projects finalized and ready for users to use, maybe some of them will benefit from advertising

[30-Dec-18 10:13 PM] Seko#7408
I think the biggest problem of many is that they believe it goes from one day to the next.  Everyone should believe in the thing as such.  I believe in Komodo and feel part of the community.  We can all help. We are Komodo!

[30-Dec-18 10:14 PM] Seko#7408
And Pirate of course...;)

[30-Dec-18 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
still it is less than a million lines of code

[30-Dec-18 10:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the problem is that people judge crypto by the present tech, while it take another 10 years to have everything in order and not sure what will survive of the existing wave beside Komodo

[30-Dec-18 10:19 PM] Seko#7408

Got infos about the rewards ian balina is getting from resistance:
Resistance

        DMM will receive compensation in the amount of 1.5% of the hard cap
        DMM will receive compensation in the amount of 218, 000 tokens

Ivan is getting at least the same if not even more.

Crazy, realy risky in my opinion. Like all in....

It's a scam probably

[01-Jan-19 11:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Like I said before it's more than just liquidity providers and users.

[01-Jan-19 12:08 PM] klunex#3191
i scam i wouldnt say. I know ivan on tech, he is very serious. But maybe they make a mistake. As jl777 sayed the dex has to work fluently. Otherwise people will move again to centralized exchanges and it was just a huge waste of money. 
Or you are right. They dont care because they could gather a lot of money. 
18M is quite a high hard cap. All the tech they are mentioning to use is more or less existing....

[01-Jan-19 12:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't think it's a scam, many team members are experienced and with good reputations. It's not Safecoin. If they will accomplish the goals is another question...

[01-Jan-19 12:20 PM] klunex#3191
I am also curious how they came to komodo? Ex kmd communitymembers? Moles?

[01-Jan-19 12:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Why? Just studying which existing tech is available

Coincollect is working on a mobile and decentralized Exchange based on BarterDEX.  Maybe @Diesmaster and @barv  can tell more about the project.

[01-Jan-19 01:48 PM] klunex#3191
@KomodoWorld  it strange in my opinion that we suddenly experience due to their marketing that they build on komodos code. Nobody asked or got in contact. I admit that i dont know if that is common in the space.

[01-Jan-19 01:49 PM] klunex#3191
@Seko nice. Its the same marketplace? Do you know?

[01-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Seko#7408
@klunex They're going to use the BarterDEX API, so yes, same marketplace...

@klunex it's normal, komodo forked zcash that forked bitcoin, pivx forked dash, nem forked nxt, etc. It's all open source software

[01-Jan-19 02:31 PM] klunex#3191
ok

[01-Jan-19 02:36 PM] klunex#3191
so you just do it without saying anything to creators. I didnt know it. Interresting, always new things to learn. üòÉ

marketmaker is GPL, so whatever changes they make to marketmaker needs to be open sourced back. they could make close source GUI though

[01-Jan-19 05:03 PM] klunex#3191
@jl777c ok sounds not bad.
What do you think about bisq fiatgateway? I understood it like this:
Alice Bob and an arbitrator have a 2 of 3 multisig address. Lets assume Alice has crypto, Bob fiat. Alice puts an order. Bob want to fill it. 
He makes a small securitydeposit in crypto to a timelocked address with the condition that Bob can withdraw if time is over or an arbitrator can transfer just to Alice. 
Alice make payment to the 2 of 3 multisig address. 
Bob makes fiat transfer to her bankaccount
After receiving, Alice sign tx from multisigaddress to Bob-> Bob can get crypto

If Bob doesnt do the fiattransfer, Alice consult arbitrator.
Arbitrator check evidence and eventually sign funds from multisig back to Alice and small Bob deposit as well.  As well if Alice got fiat and doesnt sign, Bob can complain and get 

I find the concept not bad. At least better than the visa/mastercard fiat gateway resistance is using which requires kyc. Its a bit tricky with the arbitrators, they have to be trusted, somehow chosen and in the idle case noone of the participants. An idea is to chose one randomly of a list of elected arbitrators similar to notary nodes and show both participants his telegramlink or something like that. A small fee for arbitration is an option.

[01-Jan-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
human involvement requires trust,but fiat tx seems to always require that
