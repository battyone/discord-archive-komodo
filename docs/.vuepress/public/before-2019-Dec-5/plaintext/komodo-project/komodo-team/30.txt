@Regnar here is the commit where GAME merged in their dpow changes. Its a good overview of all the necessary things:  https://github.com/gamecredits-project/GameCredits/commit/e65fe302111408c02d2bf7e286205d4273fa0fed

So for dPOW marketing, do we direct them to chainzilla, chainmakers or kmd marketing team ? or all the above base on preference

[26-Jul-18 07:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
currently i direct them to chainzilla because they offer a percentage of revenue to referral 😄

as long as it gets the job done, doesnt matter

So we're talking about Hush dPoW? Not trying to rush, but considering I do marketing I like to somewhat stay in the loop.... It's still a work in progress from what I've gathered, any expectations?

[26-Jul-18 11:01 PM] Mylo#8306
@Berg welcome to the marketing <->dev bermuda triangle!!

[26-Jul-18 11:04 PM] Mylo#8306
duke is working on hush dpow.  there is no time constraint - it'll get done when it gets done.  if i hear anything about it's activation i'll @mention you or DM you if necessary

[26-Jul-18 11:05 PM] Berg#2666
Awesome, thank you!

[26-Jul-18 11:05 PM] Berg#2666
I know everything is on an "as it gets done, no expectation" kind of schedule, just have a hard time staying in the loop with everything 😃

[26-Jul-18 11:17 PM] Mylo#8306
are you doing btch marketing too?  there's plenty happening with crypto conditions atm.

[26-Jul-18 11:17 PM] Mylo#8306
which btch inherits when kmd goes live with it.

[26-Jul-18 11:18 PM] Mylo#8306
btch will have it's own token/asset exchange and smart contract functionality - like blockchain enforced faucet and other contracts as they are developed and saved in the src code as a "catalogue" to choose from to adopt or customize for your own needs.

[26-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Mylo#8306
@Berg 👆 just a heads up on what they are testing

[26-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Mylo#8306
sorry to mention  you in multiple discords 😃

[26-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Berg#2666
Unfortunately I don't have any access to that Twitter

[26-Jul-18 11:41 PM] Berg#2666
Oh, don't worry about it!

[26-Jul-18 11:43 PM] Mylo#8306
and you never know what other goodies hush will get....kmd has the CHIPS project.  so whatever non-assetchain-to-KMD interop happens, hush will be pretty close to the action.  duke probably will innovate his own magic.

[26-Jul-18 11:44 PM] Berg#2666
I currently volunteer as Hush's marketing lead, and I don't expect compensation for what I'm doing as a community member. However I know JL spoke of bounties, and I currently have no position in BTCH, so to become to lead marketer for that project I'd required to be rewarded a stake in the project, lump sum or annuity. I'd definitely love to do so, but I'd first need some agreement on that front, as well as someone figuring out how to obtain the BTCH twitter from me (I'm pretty sure Clamoring still owns it)

@Gordon Komodo Bytecoin is a cryptonote coin, like Monero, not sure if it's suited for dPoW ?

[27-Jul-18 07:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i was working on the list that @Regnar gave me, so cryptonote coins can't be notarized on btc chain? alright

[27-Jul-18 07:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i will update my twitter

[27-Jul-18 07:44 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm not sure, I know they don't work with BarterDex but maybe they can be notarized

[27-Jul-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible to dPoW non-bitcoin protocol coins, but that is a lot of custom work in a new codebase. however, if the coin has a dev that is familiar with their coins consensus code, it could be done efficiently

@glx when is your date?   I’ve been waiting to hear to do a KMD raffle and giveaway.   I’ve done them for every dICO so far and planned to do one for you and prlpay as well.  

Typically it’s a simple infographic with a requirement to follow You, Komodo, tag three friends with a hashtag of your choice.  
I run them for 3-7 days.    
EQL and OOT offered up additional tokens for the winners.   
Let me or @Regnar know if you want us to run one of these for you.  👍

[27-Jul-18 05:03 PM] joe2x4#5987
Monero fair coin value is $24.18 lol

[27-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
this are the list of Algorithm on https://www.crypto51.app/ SHA256 , Equihash, Scrypt, X11, Ethash, Lyra2REv2, LBRY, Pascal, Neo SCrypt, Pascal, NIST5, Cryptonight, Qubit, Quark.

[27-Jul-18 05:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I am going to approach SHA256, Equihash and Scrypt projects for now. Let me know which algo I should approach besides those three. Thanks

[27-Jul-18 05:37 PM] glx#4214
@FishyGuts @Regnar - That would be great.  We need to finish making the dICO app better first.  We are working with floating dates now.

[27-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@glx , i noticed that your platform charges monthly fee for access, Maybe you can do giveaway for one year free subscription? or free access but paid premium model. Just a suggesstion. Good day!

[27-Jul-18 05:40 PM] glx#4214
@Gordon Komodo - ha good call that is what we have now. On sign up you get 1,000 free tokens.  We deduct 100 per-month for membership so you have 10 months free

[27-Jul-18 05:41 PM] glx#4214
@Gordon Komodo - then we are building a viral invite friend strategy so that you can earn more tokens.

[27-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@glx though currently there is not much content in it though, so people sign up and spend their 1000 free tokens on almost empty platform

[27-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But seems like you have a plan, so good luck!

[27-Jul-18 05:55 PM] glx#4214

As long as you're always striving for a better product and open to critique and praise, it should always show in your work.

Is there a fund or address that is set up for community contributions towards marketing initiatives?

[29-Jul-18 12:10 AM] digital bullion#8223
If there isn’t a fund. I am willing to contribute 100 KMD towards a future raffle or something similar.

[29-Jul-18 12:10 AM] digital bullion#8223
Has anybody tried to engage Max Keiser?

[29-Jul-18 12:11 AM] digital bullion#8223
He interviews a different crypto project almost every show. He has 220k +  followers

[29-Jul-18 12:13 AM] digital bullion#8223
As far as I am aware he has a touch more integrity than Mcafee. Just my opinion but I would not want to be invested in a project that Mcafee is shilling.

[29-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Regnar#6164
@FishyGuts ^^^

[29-Jul-18 01:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Regnar You handle that boss.   I have not been around NEARLY enough lately.   
Let me know an address to send it to.  Ive got 10KMD to contribute.

You can actually make bounties to try and get community involvement too.

[29-Jul-18 04:15 AM] digital bullion#8223
Awesome thanks for the info Regnar. I will see what I can come up  with 🧐

Is there any particular aspect that the marketing efforts are being directed towards at present?
ie I was reading above that the DPOW aspect  is something to be brought to peoples attention.

[29-Jul-18 04:19 AM] digital bullion#8223
Also is there a place that I can find a historical list of JL777’s posts? 

I love reading JL’s insights and vision for the future of KOMODO and the world at large.

[29-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea Gordon and I have been looking for dPoW areas to reach out to other coins. Graphics stuff isn't a high priority for community driven marketing right now just because we are revamping designs and are shooting for it to be a unified, consistent look.

[29-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Um I have some of his Q&As on reddit, but I haven't done one in a while.

[29-Jul-18 04:21 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm also collecting a lot of his best quotes throughout the years but it has been a difficult process because many of the forums that he was on back then have since shut down or changed and I'm stuck using way back machines searches which often doesn't have those smaller forums.

[29-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
anything else anybody would like to add, it seems that HKN would implement masternode, but i haven't mentioned masternode capability

[29-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm not sure masternodes are a thing KMD asset chains are going to have.

[29-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I think most functions of masternode are already accomplised by kmd blochchain

[29-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
like private send , near instantsend(60 seconds)

[29-Jul-18 05:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
security - we have dPOW

[29-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so using masternode as just a gimmick name for reward for holding a certain amount of coin , could be a thing?

[29-Jul-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Gordon Komodo Your last part was the part I was about to say you were overlooking: keeping the rich paid just because they are rich

[29-Jul-18 05:33 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I don't really want to judge what a project wants to do to control the circulation supply 😄

[29-Jul-18 05:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I added my comment too

[29-Jul-18 05:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
masternodes can earn a lot of tx fees if the blockchain is successful, because they're the ones validating blocks

[29-Jul-18 05:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this feature is not available yet for kmd assetchains

[29-Jul-18 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
**all** nodes validate blocks 🙄

[29-Jul-18 05:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yeah I mean generate blocks

[29-Jul-18 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
privileging those that can afford excessive amounts over those that cannot

[29-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's like staking

[29-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but it can be programmed so that only masternode can generate block for an asset chain?

[29-Jul-18 05:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes like PoS staking but only those with above a set amount

[29-Jul-18 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
actually, it's not like staking - with staking, nearly any amount can get you earnings; with MN, only those with bank can afford to generate

[29-Jul-18 05:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
James said it's not possible yet, adding this customization will take time

[29-Jul-18 05:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
maybe it will be possible in future, not soon

[29-Jul-18 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_realizes, just now, what channel he's in and backs out of the channel_

[29-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
We are just trying to sell what people want 😄

[29-Jul-18 05:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it seems a lot of projects that could move to KMD, also like to use masternodes

[29-Jul-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because MNs attract investors looking to make a "free" buck off a passive activity

[29-Jul-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
from an investment standpoint they are nice

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
we provide the tools, let the projects decide whether they want to use it or not , i'll say

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this parameter is a consensus thing, like choosing PoS or PoW. I wonder how hard it would be to add this option. Is it just like PoS but with a minimum staking amount?

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We looked at this before. And I know a dev who can code it for us, provided a bit of help in setting up the right -ac parameter

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but james wasn't so keen on it

[29-Jul-18 05:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
because it can break other things?
