@benohanlon  my bad I tagged you on Twitter and posted about him here, it's also the github link from monday with Mylo. Watabou is the creator of pixel Dungeon, a roguelike game for computers and mobile. Over 5Million downloads on google playstore.

@KomodoPlatform @watawatabou Dude you should build on this! please talk with @0xca333 and @benohanlon It would be awesome to get an on-chain version of Pixel Dungeon, or expand on toy town stuff. Can we see if we can make this happen :D https://t.co/KrhUnt5BTH

[20-Feb-19 12:07 PM] Regnar#6164
He had liked this tweet, but he could just like every tweet tagging him, so I was wondering if we were able to follow up with him to see if he was interested in designing a game using Rogue CC.

[20-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I reached out to him via email last week as well. There's a good chance they're looking to see what we can do.

[20-Feb-19 06:38 PM] Regnar#6164
I think that would be a great help, to get an established game producer to build with RogueCC. I'm not sure how we can really showcase what RogueCC can do, I have to read more into it and look for a great selling point. I also don't know what exactly about it would get Watabou to build on it, like a series of unique points that can't be gained elsewhere.

@Regnar  Ideally they would  use Crypto Conditions to incorporate Pixel Dungeon with their Blockchain. CC is mainly what is being showcased here.  I will go ahead and put together a write bout how/what/why of it all.  Gotta finish up some marketing  plots first. (mapping out a year+)  üòÉ

[20-Feb-19 10:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
In a year from now I want to be chatting with game devs  daily, explaining how awesome CC and CC Mobile is for gaming. and recruiting them to the Komodosphere of Games

[20-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Pixel Dungeon, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup I reached out to first alongside some game studios. One more point of contact too... that is specifically for Rogue.  If any one of them responds to me ill be beyond ecstatic.

[20-Feb-19 11:00 PM] Regnar#6164
@Cryptofist I'm a bit of a novice programming wise but is rogueCC kinda like RPC calls that can be incorporated into in-game actions? Or do games have to display with a pretty graphic what the rogue game is showing in texts?

[20-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I believe so, RogueCC only works with the Rogue Game or interfaces based off of it( graphics in game, GUI, menus, etc) 
We could change all of the outputs (monster names/item names) use the drawing in ascii for specific graphics to display too, so you could make something like a Pirate themed version of Rogue  that would be on the same chain. 

... and that's just RogueCC though.  JL777c can work with other devs to make say PixelDngCC, FortniteCC and the like. 

I believe there wil/ be specific engine based CC contracts at some point as that makes some sense to have framework built.

There was some discussions I had with JL about the games, in short Rogue can be altered but not changed to an engine that is different, without severely heavy dev work. 

What can also be done is add additional features to the game on the outside (DEX, leaderboard, multiplayer, etc) this is where the tech will grab the gaming industry by the horns. There is a TON of possibilities here....

[20-Feb-19 11:35 PM] Regnar#6164
is there a way to stream games as you play?

[21-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sure, you can just use a regular streamer set up. Something like OBS studio.

[21-Feb-19 10:49 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@Cryptofist @Regnar  the pixeldungeon dev was the first i asked @benohanlon to dm as he's got an opensource roguelike with nice graphics that CC might be able to breathe new life in.  one thing we have to understand is that many of these devs might not understand that blockchain doesn't  necessarily means cryptocurrency. Might be a turn off to open source devs when you start talking about tokenization and blockchain. We've got to better understand the current limitations that blockchain might be able to overcome. i.e. Roguelikes are traditionally single player...with cc rogue we can enable multiplayer and tournament modes that weren't possible before.

[22-Feb-19 12:46 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Steve Lee Absolutely! It's going to take some time for developers outside the space to not only fully understand the possibilities, but to also trust the space.  I hope that the information I present and ideas I bring to the table help with both of those aspects. I've been making a point to keep in mind that we are showcasing the tech and trying convert people *outside of* the space to be our brothers and sisters under the banner of blockchain enthusiasts.

looks like they help with monetizing of games as well (not just their own like Runescape and old-runescape) it might be a good opportunity to get in their ear about using blockchains for games and they may try to gain experience and knowledge to pass on those recommendations to their clients

[22-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Cryptofist#7504
That is less OSRS players than I thought there were! There is a custom bot building service for  OSRS called dreambot., mostly for farming gold. It's amazing to see what people come out with between code + gaming. 

I wonder how Jagex would feel offering blockchain services to their clients...  I think they may want to see the current PoC we have in full gear then maybe make something on komodo themselves. If that works out I can see Jagex becoming a leader in decentralized gaming......

[22-Feb-19 06:20 AM] Regnar#6164
yea I could see them doing their own thing, my goal was to get Komodo in their ear in general. If  they build on it great, if they push it to their clients great.

I think a lot of other blockchain projects are looking for dApp developers (or blockchain game people), but should be looking for traditional game developers who understand all the non blockchain parts of building a game/community/ecosystem, and then bring the expertise and tools from Komodo

Seems likely that UpBit and Bittrex would have been the targets.

[24-Feb-19 08:02 PM] Regnar#6164
from a marketing standpoint, does it seem like a good idea to draw Exchange attention towards this tweet? On one hand it shows the Einsteinium is a target for attacks (exchanges may feel it's risky) on the other it shows that dPoW is doing what it's designed to do and protecting EMC2. I think this is a good way to show Exchanges additional examples that dPoW works and reduce any doubt they may have. I'm curious if anyone thinks this may be taken the wrong way and hurt EMC2 project?

[24-Feb-19 08:07 PM] yorklab#7270
If I were an investor looking into buying EMC2 I would feel much safer knowing this. I think it's good news for Einsteinium and perhaps no longer a target for attacks.

[24-Feb-19 08:25 PM] Regnar#6164
yea true. I personally think Bittrex and UpBit (Especially Bittrex after the BTG attack) would be very happy to see this, but I'm looking through the lens of a pro-Komodo business minded person, I was hoping to get some opposite insight. I was thinking of tagging Bittrex and UpBit on twitter too.
