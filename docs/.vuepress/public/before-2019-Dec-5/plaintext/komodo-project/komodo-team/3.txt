[03-Jun-18 08:35 PM] regnar#0000
Komodo scaling development likely to reach finish line first for actual secured crypto transactions scaling.

no reason to shard one big chain if everything is automatically segregated into their own chain, anti-sharding.

KMD creates one giant meta chain out of cluster of chains so we just secure all independent chains via dPoW and use KMD to generate proofs for cross chain smart contracts.

Scaling is easy if you skip security and decentralization, but is nonsensical to do so, Komodo solution truly will remain decentralized and secure while scaling.

KMD scaling is built on BTC codebase and is proven tech, not white paper theory.

scaling chains are independent chains using the same cluster ID and mining nodes and we have scripts to automatically spawn chains including explorers. Each chain is secured through Bitcoin hashrate through dPoW.

We can recycle Bitcoin's electricity, one coin using 0.5% of all electricity is a bit extreme, but we can use that same electricity to secure an entire ecosystem of thousands or eventually millions of chains, then it's not so wasteful at all.

Marketing this new tech isn't as easy as some facebook and twitter ads. Triply nested cryptographic proofs are more difficult to understand than atomic swaps. Yes Atomic Swaps, those UTXO based cross chain trustless swaps powering the BarterDEX and HyperDEX.

"unlimited scaling secured by BTC" in a nutshell

[03-Jun-18 08:35 PM] regnar#0000
I think is the TLDR?

I think that the recent 51% attacks (most recent one was today on $zen) + $GAME new can be a very powerful marketing narrative for Komodo if invested right. What do you guys think?

[05-Jun-18 01:05 AM] maegus#0000
It definitely should be.

[05-Jun-18 02:10 AM] regnar#0000
I wonder if it would be worthwhile to go to these chains that have been 51% attacked and offer the first year free (privately of course) so that they would be even more inclined to try the notary services.

[05-Jun-18 02:13 AM] regnar#0000
Though I'm normally in the camp of "if you're good at something, don't do it for free"

[05-Jun-18 02:13 AM] regnar#0000
Maybe do it for payment in some of their coins, if they have a big supply of them for dev funds, which could increase in value when their investors know their coin is better protected, further increasing Komodo teams holdings?

[05-Jun-18 02:14 AM] regnar#0000
just brainstorming

[05-Jun-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Before you all go wanting a heaps of third party coins installed on our servers, we need to make sure we can secure our KMD from their coin deamons. LOL... whats to stop another coin, puting a "sendtoaddress" RPC call in their code somwhere and stealing all our funds.

[05-Jun-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am sure its able to be sorted out, and I hope we can do lots of coins in the future ðŸ™‚

[05-Jun-18 02:16 AM] regnar#0000
lol honestly man, that seems more your specialty, which is why we're glad you step in here to straighten out some of these marketing dreams lol

[05-Jun-18 02:16 AM] regnar#0000
because, I'm not a dev, so yea, that would be a bad situation

[05-Jun-18 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#0000
haha. Not sure sometimes if I should say these things, but I believe its better to be honest about things. There are already people looking to solve this, but its seems a convoluted way so far. But as long as it is solved, we can add a LOT f coins. We have testnet notarizing 64 chains on a single server, easily. We will look to see how far that can be pushed in coming days/weeks.

[05-Jun-18 02:22 AM] regnar#0000
yea I think this sort of stuff is the important things that need to be said between marketing and devs. a lot of these types of things I and I'm sure plenty of other Marketing focused people here aren't aware of, so it's nice to have some insight in what is possible, and what isn't just yet

[05-Jun-18 02:23 AM] imylomylo#0000
also we don't want to over burden ourselves that we run out of resources (devs, operations hands) and mismanage komodo's tasks.

[05-Jun-18 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Got enough to do already lol.

[05-Jun-18 02:25 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah.  game is first cab off the rank, we learn from this integration to improve for others.

[05-Jun-18 02:27 AM] imylomylo#0000
making sure GAME is reasonably secured is first goal.  once we know (which won't be for another 4+ weeks, but more likely 10 weeks)

[05-Jun-18 02:28 AM] regnar#0000
okay sounds good.

[05-Jun-18 02:29 AM] regnar#0000
but is this something that will become quicker to implement or is it always a tedious process

[05-Jun-18 02:34 AM] regnar#0000
Oh I understand that, I'm saying the idea of 3rd party coins seeking dPoW with Komodo, I imagine it takes a significant amount of time not just to implement but to check and make sure they aren't going to do anything shady

[05-Jun-18 02:34 AM] imylomylo#0000
GAME shares similar codebase to CHIPS.  they were forked from same version of bitcoin at the time.   if other coins share similar codebases, then it is likely to be less work in the future to integrate than a coin that has forked from a different codebase (e.g. 0.16v of bitcoin) which has had more changes.

[05-Jun-18 02:35 AM] regnar#0000
because as Marketing channel, we should have an Idea if we should be focusing on migrating newer erc20 coins to assetchains, or if more established coins using dPoW would be a better focus of our time.

[05-Jun-18 02:35 AM] regnar#0000
okay that makes sense, so it's really dependent on the coin

[05-Jun-18 02:35 AM] imylomylo#0000
oh the erc20 -> assetchain definitely wins that focus imo

[05-Jun-18 02:35 AM] regnar#0000
could be weeks, could be months?

[05-Jun-18 02:38 AM] imylomylo#0000
we know assetchain tech better than integration of other coins into dpow tech.  there are 500 erc20 projects out there (i don't know the number, just saying there's heaps) - if 1% of those erc20 projects comes over by the end of the year - that's plenty to build on for 2019.

[05-Jun-18 02:39 AM] regnar#0000
I worry that marketing focused on the erc20 tokens (which could really be done at any time, or even better when Ethereum gas prices rise) and we right now the market is more prime for us to focus on 51% susceptible coins, since we can play the recent attacks.

[05-Jun-18 02:42 AM] regnar#0000
basically the recent events have made dPoW of 51% susceptible chains to be likely the most successful marketing efforts, just as when ETH gas prices soar it would make ERC20 project migration the best focus of our attention.

[05-Jun-18 02:43 AM] regnar#0000
but all of this is moot anyway, if we aren't there yet to handle these dPoW implementing just yet, mind as well focus on erc20 lol

[05-Jun-18 02:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah the erc20 token -> assetchain takes advantage of more tech, agama wallet, barterdex trading, dico fundraising, dpow security services, privacy - all within the ecosystem.

[05-Jun-18 02:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
many more avenues to market

[05-Jun-18 02:47 AM] regnar#0000
yea, I'm only talking about timing in the market with the news and focus of recent articles being 51% related

[05-Jun-18 02:48 AM] regnar#0000
but got it, erc20 focus

[05-Jun-18 03:19 AM] n2okpride#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> There is a plan for the 51% attack campaign, but it isn't fully ready to go mainstream yet. We'd be willing to take one additional project as another case study and proof of concept but it is being treated in a very targeted approach.

[05-Jun-18 03:19 AM] n2okpride#0000
FYI - <@U33CGLNNR> found this interesting website: https://www.crypto51.app/

[05-Jun-18 04:21 AM] ryan797#0000
Question, anyone here working with CMM to practice this 51% resistance?   Seems like a partnership made in heaven.  
DPoW on a resistant attack chain.

[05-Jun-18 04:23 AM] ryan797#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> did you see that CMM link claiming 51% resistance?

[05-Jun-18 04:23 AM] ryan797#0000
I posted on twitter

[05-Jun-18 04:23 AM] emmanux#0000
<@U9LUDEM8T> first we need to know if it is really resistant. It sounds like bs to me.

[05-Jun-18 04:23 AM] ryan797#0000
Supposedly nodes are banning double spenders and block times are so fast the attackers couldnâ€™t make the longest chain.

[05-Jun-18 04:24 AM] emmanux#0000
bs

[05-Jun-18 04:24 AM] ryan797#0000
Without engineering it, even a 75% hashrate attack didnâ€™t take over.

[05-Jun-18 04:24 AM] ryan797#0000
I asked <@U02LQ1WHQ> about the feasibility for their tech/code to achieve this.   Havenâ€™t heard back, but the man has more important things to do that to investigate the veracity of some brand new coins claims.

[05-Jun-18 04:24 AM] emmanux#0000
I think that they need to learn the hard way, that their chain isn't invulnerable.

[05-Jun-18 04:25 AM] ryan797#0000
I am highly skeptical and openly skeptical in their discord.

[05-Jun-18 04:25 AM] ryan797#0000
Now not when theyâ€™re big.

[05-Jun-18 04:25 AM] ryan797#0000
Iâ€™m sure it could be done in a more engineered fashion.  



Thatâ€™s part of the plan too Emm... they want to know and work on it.

[05-Jun-18 04:26 AM] ryan797#0000
You cant just say shit like that and not expect an attack.

[05-Jun-18 04:26 AM] ryan797#0000
But I think thatâ€™s their goal.

[05-Jun-18 04:45 AM] maegus#0000
Komodo was on that list in the first iteration until someone told him it would be impossible without you somehow convincing a super majority 2/3 of the notaries to conspire which is basically 0% chance of happening because they are mostly devs...

[05-Jun-18 05:04 AM] jon#0000
Hey all. I'd like to humbly suggest we "sell" dPoW as "Komodo Consensus". Waaay better for branding.
