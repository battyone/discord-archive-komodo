I don't use exchanges but I did look at zaddex and it looks like a nice exchange. Wonder why it has low volume?

[17-Sep-19 05:29 PM] Regnar#6164
Maybe they would be the first to let their users trade with DEX users or something

[17-Sep-19 05:29 PM] PTYX#6840
Isn't zaddex a redfox project?

[17-Sep-19 05:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I think they are separate, but they definitely have a connection of some kind

[17-Sep-19 05:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Maybe the redfox ceo and Komodo general manager has some knowledge of why it's deaded üòú

First Triumph as a blockchain venture..... :troll:

[17-Sep-19 05:33 PM] PTYX#6840
```You may know us as Southeast Asia‚Äôs first blockchain venture builder. But what you may not know is that the latest cryptocurrency exchange to add our $RFOX coin‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäZaddex‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis a product of our business model. Yes, our friends, we successfully launched a blockchain venture! And we‚Äôve got some details on how the exchange fits into the overall RedFOX ecosystem.```

i guess any new exchange coming out in this bear market conditions would suffer from low volume

why would anyone register to a new exchange when they dont plan on buying something?

[17-Sep-19 05:35 PM] Lennart#9331
i hope that in more bullish markets zaddex will find it's userbase

[17-Sep-19 05:35 PM] Lennart#9331
a little competition here, a little giveaway there

[17-Sep-19 05:36 PM] PTYX#6840
If the volume isn't hitting records highs at coineal and liquid, it won't blow any hats over at zaddex

[17-Sep-19 05:38 PM] PTYX#6840
Unless they really start producing or delivering value it will be dead in the water as most other projects will in the next 3-5 years (if lucky)

[17-Sep-19 05:49 PM] Regnar#6164
I saw some white label crypto exchange solutions. I didn't get a quote or anything but if someone wants to take on the immense liability of CEX and make marginal gains from low volume, the option's out there

[17-Sep-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`You may know us as Southeast Asia‚Äôs first blockchain venture builder`
And here I thought their claim to fame as a "first" was the first chain created by a team member to blow off dICO and start ICO on  a CEX :troll:

Some look more shady than others. However, you can buy a Binance "clone" for 15K

[17-Sep-19 05:58 PM] PTYX#6840
It's hard to say whether the clone will take your btc after you gain some volume. You'd need to do some serious code review if you purchased it WL

[17-Sep-19 06:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I wouldn't want to actually do one

[18-Sep-19 03:06 AM] digital bullion#8223
Zaddex is a joint venture between OCU and Redfox, I believe REDFOX has a 50% equity stake, yet OCU is responsible for the development and operation as far as I know. From all accounts they say that the exchange is still in beta and that development is still occurring, as fsr as I have read from the whitepaper and frlm their telegram, the full exchange ought to launch before year end.

 It is hard to attract a user base without actually pushing some form awareness campaign and why would anyone begin a marketing campaign before the beta testing had been completed.

[18-Sep-19 04:07 AM] digital bullion#8223
At least they have delivered a functional exchange, it is more than what can be said of a lot of projects.

[18-Sep-19 04:12 AM] digital bullion#8223
I hope that Zaddex and Redfox succeed, because I feel Komodo needs some strong success stories and reasons for optimism.

[18-Sep-19 04:20 AM] PTYX#6840
Komodo doesn't need any projects to prop it up

[18-Sep-19 04:23 AM] PTYX#6840
There's projects within the kmd ecosystem that have delivered a full working exchange, debit card, OTC desk, and mobile apps. They get basically no credit at all. Pungo has by far the most working products that are generating revenue. Verus is also another example of great projects adding value to the ecosystem that get little to no credit in the eyes of the community.

[18-Sep-19 04:24 AM] digital bullion#8223
I think they are both amazing projects üëç

[18-Sep-19 04:24 AM] digital bullion#8223
Verus and Pungo.

[18-Sep-19 04:24 AM] PTYX#6840
I commend the komodo team in focusing and delivering the atomic dex. I think that will be a game changer. That's basically what they need to keep doing. Focusing on delivering products that are complete.

the majority of small businesses in the normie world fail pretty quickly. There have been a few duds in this ecosystem. ethereum has had a multitude of outright exit scams on it's protocol. it's crypto. No one here should be discouraged, even the duds.

[18-Sep-19 04:29 AM] digital bullion#8223
I feel that the user experience of the Atomic dex is very fluid and intuitive, even with the current iteration. It is a long way from the Barterdex user experince of 2017.

It would be interesting to see the technology being used for regulated decentralized trading

For stocks and anything that is tradeable today in traditional exchanges.

` regulated decentralized` ü§î

[18-Sep-19 04:46 AM] PTYX#6840
Think about it, you can't trade regulated assets on atomicdex or Binance

[18-Sep-19 04:47 AM] PTYX#6840
There will need to be private channels for regulated exchanges but that doesn't mean they can't use dex technology which is trustless

[18-Sep-19 04:47 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe decentralized isn't the right word. Trustless exchange via the barterdex network.

[18-Sep-19 04:49 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`you can't trade regulated assets on atomicdex`

Can you turn the KDMLABS scammers offline I keep seeing random payouts to miners not even mining in the pool on .rocks  I keep not getting my share its really annoying its funny how I get paid correctly for about 3 hours then suddenly some rogue thing starts scamming coins.  Its not tricky or some programming genius its a skimmer and a joke if its not mining dont pay it coins from the mined blocks.

the person that tried to impersonate the admin, looked very genuine, however, he was not from this server, so replying back only helps if you are friends. So I just "?" to the ca dude and than I knew it was just fake.

[20-Sep-19 10:25 AM] xeonrider#3120
They are specifically targeting people, because he / she asked if I was a KMD holder.

where do you get 1440 coins

[20-Sep-19 04:22 PM] kevinkatovic#1278
It says the entire network is only about 40KS or so and there is a total of about 135KS in the pool yet everyone keeps taking more and I think the head tech is doing this buy assigning block rewards to payment address's that dont show up in the pool again why doesn't the network display all network hash and pay out properly  it must be a scam because zpool.ca doesn't work right or umining nothing works right there I tried it doesn't reward blocks properly if the block was every 90 seconds or 120 seconds it should happen that way all the time but I am seeing huge problems with your math its like you just ignore reality for 30 minutes here and there.
