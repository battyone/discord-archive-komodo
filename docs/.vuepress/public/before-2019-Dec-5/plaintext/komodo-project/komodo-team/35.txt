[09-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Audo#5667
yeah I think a dedicated page for investors/community would be good, but that's not in the scope of this website update. Instead we we are planning to rely on a welcome email / email journey.

[09-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Audo#5667
and people are focusing on developer documentation, and after we have that we can market/highlight it. The CC / 2.0 smart contract tech is in development/testing at the moment.

[09-Aug-18 08:17 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
So a page for dapps will come later, after tech, docs and wp are ready, ok üëç

[09-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Audo#5667
yeah, it's going to take some time before we can really push with the crypto conditions (CC) asset tech stuff marketing. We haven't even mentioned it yet on our blog üòÉ

[09-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Audo#5667
but that's in plans, yes, the developer community is our main audience

[09-Aug-18 08:25 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
seems fine, developers and businesses are the main targets

[09-Aug-18 08:25 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
2019 will be very exciting, most pieces will come together

[09-Aug-18 08:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
about the website wireframe, what about adding links to technical docs/github at step 4? Next to Chainzilla and Chainmakers. Or in a separate step. Like sending the message that expert developers can do it themselves, not necessarily hire a service provider

[09-Aug-18 08:38 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
This would avoid giving an impression of centralization

[09-Aug-18 08:38 AM] Audo#5667
thats very true, we need to provide links to our documentation

[09-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Audo#5667
and perhaps indeed say that anyone can do it

[09-Aug-18 08:40 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes that is important in order not to give a wrong impression

[09-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Seko#7408
@Evitor Gr√º√ü dich...;) We both are Germans and Acura, too. We can do a lot together. You know I administrate the German social media channels. If you want, you can become an admin. We can do more, we can translate in German and can try that the German channel is growing. Maybe about a German blog!? If you like, then contact me in Telegram or here in the German channel.

[09-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Seko#7408
I have seen, that you very active and and you work intensively with Komodo. I can‚Äòt program, that bit of HTML and PHP is not enough. But I can write and market. Together we are stronger.

[09-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Seko we'll be making a push to translate technical docs and some major marketing messaging into different languages. Right now, we've got Spanish and korean lined up but would love to have someone helping with German. Is that something you could help with?

[09-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Daniel CP#2020
It will be posted on the Komodo Medium page for now and then on the main Komodo website once we upgrade to the new site

[09-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Seko#7408
@Daniel CP yes, I can. I‚Äòm in contact with Ben already. My next step is an German article on Medium. Let me a little bit time, but then with pleasure...

Got some FUD going on from Marc De  Mesel on my last tweet, I don't have the time to refute any of his claims right now. If anyone who has first hand knowledge of jl777/NXT projects from 2014 and 2015 would like to jump in and do so PROFESSIONALLY, not spam, not insulting. That'd be great. We don't need FUD and we don't need twitter knife fights.

He got neck deep in NXT. Got disappointed, exited, I guess got back in with ardor. Seems nice guy, but I don‚Äôt care about his investment or tech views.

price dropped so now first. Anyway fair value is actually only a simulation - market is not reasonable and won't be reasonable anytime soon or maybe never.

kind of "manipulative marketing vaqlue " index could  be more accurate - but it's just imaginary as afar

well value is subjective of course, and the metrics used to measure it can be "beaten" or manipulated to mean or show different things. But that site does offer some interesting insights and a cool way to determine a networks value beyond a price. I think combining that with blocktivity info is a pretty strong indicator of network value, at least as a value measurement of capacity.
