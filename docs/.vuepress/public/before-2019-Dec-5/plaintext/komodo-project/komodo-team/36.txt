for example I think the monthly rewards requirement will actually positively help us in these rankings, without having any real material difference in the network itself. Just based on the increased tx's that are likely to be moving on KMD from people claiming rewards monthly as opposed to semi annually or annually.

[11-Aug-18 04:57 PM] Regnar#6164
So that is a way that we can see "beating metrics". or in another case it could be how tx are counted, and whether they measure payments vs tx for different chains. again, just showing the limitations of metrics like these, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't throw it out, just think about the model as a conceptual framework, just need to understand it's limitations.

[11-Aug-18 04:58 PM] Regnar#6164
Anyway, I like the site and their measurement methods, it's a nice take on valuing networks. I am curious how a manipulative marketing value index would work. thoughts?

[11-Aug-18 06:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
No doubt fair value index is interesting and possibly usefull.

[11-Aug-18 06:43 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
"Marketing manipulation index" is pure fantasy. My guess there is so many tricks you can do in marketing might be hard to get just few patterns. But maybe am wrong. It could be checked tough - I was suggesting to MA team to make a review of marketing efforts by top 20 coins - what they do legal and not legal actions, and those on the edge - just to see what they do and what brings most impact. Week work for someone understanding tech good enough and marketing/promotional/manipulation methods good enough, including wash trades check, specific exchanges (by location also) with big volumes (where most volume comes?), checking inside forums, coins distribution, ads bought on google, facebook, twitter, how many true and fake followers they got, and so on...

[11-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that gets pretty extensive and difficult.

[12-Aug-18 06:44 PM] joe2x4#5987
Hi guys,
Yesterday, I ran into a buddy that does programming in the SF bay area. As an original SN investor I gave him an over-view of the project. He mentioned that he developed some report generating backend software for a crypto tax accounting and law firm.
 
https://cryptofifo.tax

From their website when talking about their formatting..

"The format is exactly what is needed for tax return preparation, and the¬†"Assets Remaining" ledger is extremely useful for analyzing when to sell cryptocurrencies to maximize returns from a tax perspective."

So my thought process is that this type of thing could be useful for liquidity providers (maximizing returns from tax perspective). I know I and a few friends have put the breaks on Crypto trading due to uncertainty of tax obligations; was planning on becoming a liquidity provider. Combine this tax reporting software with tradebot technology and marketmaker portfolio management, could be rather useful.

Anyway, is there any use for something like this? What channel/ person would be a good contact for my developer friend.
Thanks guys

@PTYX Good AMA. I still wonder if a 2FA makes sense for the chain.  Or whether a cold storage such as ledger is the solution. But unfortunately without Agama connection...

@Cryptoon but it's pointless, if the private key is lost. More sense it‚Äôs make for the transactions, but then the 2FA must be implemented in the chain. Please correct me if I‚Äòm wrong, you are the technical devs...;)

I thought Komodo wasn't married to BTC but only using it because it has the highest hashrate and therefore the most secure blockchain but could swap if it changed in the future.

[14-Aug-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We funded in BTC for the ICO to pay notarization fees, but if it was needed to change, you can notarize to another chain, notarization is just a transaction with OP-RETURN.

[14-Aug-18 02:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
komodo repo would be the correct one for KMD but than again SUPERNET repo is used by notaries so its kind of revelant too and they only track master branch and also only the last 12 months so it's like statistics you can look at it in different ways.

[14-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Regnar#6164
right, I'm trying to make sure it shows activity accurately, however focusing on a single repo likely doesn't do that, and as far as I'm aware most testing and work is done on jl777 test channels and then merged to Komodo when done.

[14-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Regnar#6164
So I'm not sure I can request and update on cryptmiso, or redirect where they get their commit data from.

[14-Aug-18 02:50 PM] Regnar#6164
Only reason I bring this up is I was curious to overlay Github activity to current prices, and if I can get enough data points for it run a correlation. My hypothesis is most coins reduce github activity as prices decrease, and vice versa. I think it would be a good marketing point to show that Komodo doesn't decrease activity based on price, but has consistent activity.

[14-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Regnar#6164
and having a single location for this information like CryptoMiso would make it easily replicated so other's can see the same.

[14-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah we already got in contact with them - their metric is 1 repo.  that's now how we work unfortunately.  so if you really wanted to collect kmd stats across all repos, then you can get stats for other projects similarly and provide an alternative stats model to cryptomiso - unless you really wanted to do it and loved doing stats work - meh.


the current #1 for their latest 3 month ratings is this repo: https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo  if you then go into the packages directory, you see they load the website into the rankings, changelog.json type of files as well.  Not to be too critical, they do a lot of commits and clearly are busy - they also merge from other repos into a central project repo which is both very organised and clap-worthy and also helpful for this type of statistic.  they may also have external repos that don't get counted like we do.

Komodo has separate repos for the wallets, the dex, notary, marketmaker, scale test, notary node operator's individual scripts etc.

And if we point out and be too critical, then our own development gets put under the microscope - why we commit changes in cpp across different servers for testing smart contracts etc.

ca has his own repos as well.  at the end of the day.  if we were to put daniel and steve's notes about blog posts, all our comments/discussions/edits/opinions in git instead of google docs, then there'd be an extra 1000 commits a month from the marketing department.

If the market prices such activity, then it's about as accurate as the mythical man month, how accurate cost estimations are in relation to LoC (lines of code) output per programmer etc.  

end rant.

Well it's a smaller exchange that I've never heard of, but they are on CMC and their coin listing sign up has a "what listing fee do you propose to pay?" lol I'm not sure if its better that way? pretty upfront about it... looks like they have 300K in volume which is small but they do have 5 different fiat support EURO, USD, JPY, RUB, and CNY support. I'll just leave a TBD in for listing fee haha
