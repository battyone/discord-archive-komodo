@MR_President ?

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] shewy89#1464
Couple of questions: 
1. As a temporary measure if I can see my KMD coins are moved out of my existing wallet into a Safe address, can I just leave it there and claim once I have created a new wallet further down the line ? 
2. If j see my KMD coins still exist in my agama wallet , Just for now , as a temp measure , could I just move my funds to an exchange and then move back to a new kmd wallet or update etc ? 
3. Can I apply option 2 to other ERC20 coins I had on Agama?

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
please file a claim ASAP so we can assess the total damange

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on ETH and ERC20, instructions will be posted soon

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
most all exchanges have stopped deposits/withdraws as a preventive measure

[05-Jun-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810

I used agama in native mode ...no password...only wallet.dat....are my funds safe? Do i have to do something? Please explain it in simple words to me...i am stupid and not technicaly versed

[05-Jun-19 04:28 PM] coingirl87#6489
Thank you

[05-Jun-19 04:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@coingirl87  lite mode is the most compromised but james said to move everything, even in native mode. Better safe than sorry

[05-Jun-19 04:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I use native as well and moved everything, including Pirate

[05-Jun-19 04:31 PM] coingirl87#6489

Is there a manual how to use kmd with ledger ?

[05-Jun-19 04:41 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thanks

[05-Jun-19 05:24 PM] Helly88#3715
@jl777c  my KMD are on the address of KMD now. Was transferred there without my permission. 

I assume that I will get all my coins back otherwise I will take legal action. 

It would not be bad if someone from the KMD team would confirm that we get the 1 to 1 again.

[05-Jun-19 05:30 PM] mrlynch#5735

@Deleted User thanks...

[05-Jun-19 05:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
happy now?

[05-Jun-19 05:40 PM] coingirl87#6489
What is the pin file name in versus agama?

[05-Jun-19 05:41 PM] coingirl87#6489
And seed encrypted key?

[05-Jun-19 05:41 PM] coingirl87#6489
Will i need both?

[05-Jun-19 05:41 PM] PTYX#6840
if you had an old agama (over 6 months ago) wallet you might not have the pin file

[05-Jun-19 05:42 PM] PTYX#6840
it's just a file with your seed stored inside and it's encrypted by a password

[05-Jun-19 05:42 PM] coingirl87#6489
I usrd agama wallet 0.3.5 beta

[05-Jun-19 05:44 PM] PTYX#6840
you should have a seed

[05-Jun-19 05:44 PM] PTYX#6840
just use that

[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
I understand nothing

[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
Until now i used native with wallet.dat

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] coingirl87#6489
In agama

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] coingirl87#6489
Now i have to send all my funds to versus agama

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] coingirl87#6489
For that i need a new seed

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] coingirl87#6489
Abd seed encrypted key?

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] coingirl87#6489
Sorry...i am stupid

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] PTYX#6840
if you have a wallet.dat file, you can use that in the verus wallet

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] PTYX#6840
but doesn't using Agama to send funds risk the funds being taken?

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] PTYX#6840
i agree, generate the address on an external wallet, but what should they use to move the funds? if it's a wallet.dat then it can be imported into the verus wallet, and they can send to the new address.

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok...so now i create a new adress on versus agama and after that send all my funds via agama to versus agama

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] coingirl87#6489
Is that safe?

[05-Jun-19 05:59 PM] bitcoinstrader#6920
Can I create a new address on coinomi

[05-Jun-19 06:00 PM] coingirl87#6489
When i click to register versus agama say that encription key/confirmation field is empty

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] coingirl87#6489
So its mandatory to have this encription key?

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] gcharang#6833
@coingirl87 the name and encrypted pin are like username and password for the seed phrase, but it is stored only on your computer
this so that you don't need to paste seed everytime

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thank you...but that is really safe to have an auto fill in?

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] gcharang#6833
the encrypt pin is used to encrypt that seed phrase and store it on your computer
if you trust that computer to hold your wallet.dat, then this is similar

[05-Jun-19 06:09 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thank you

[05-Jun-19 06:09 PM] coingirl87#6489
Last question

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] coingirl87#6489
Why i have to create a new wallet in vrsc lite mode and not kmd lite mode?

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] gcharang#6833
that was old instruction.
use https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
open KMD lite mode and create a new wallet
if you get server error etc., 
follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
