Hey guys, I was contacted by a Komodo ambassador on Linkedin. Who's the best person to talk to about writing for your platform? I was invited to join this channel.

You totally right @PTYX  is time to wake up in marketing action. 
Komodo has amazing blockchain technology and one of the best in the world but nothing to make it visible. A mediocre website that works very badly on some browsers, only one good video (atomic swap explanation) made by an assetchain, BarterDEX has now over than 150 coins and I was one of the only ones to share information, contact the creators of the various tokens to be able to gain a minimum of visibility, only two posts about Komodo's scalability on linkedIn had more than 30k views in 4d... 
Komodo need marketing to keep pace with the development of this ecosystem. And right now it's not.

to make working marketing: 1. set targets with ETA 2. set KPIs reflecting targets 3. set rewards for achieving targets -> see progress or change managing persons if no progress observed üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 09:44 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
there needs to be at least some kind of org structure, otherwise some part of work is wasted... I remember there were bounties for preparing some content improvement about KMD, but I didn't see any summary of it

[28-Jun-18 09:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is there somwhere a KMD blog where one could see kind of timeline of changes / logs of imoprovements to tech , content , documents, colaborations started, people joined ?

[28-Jun-18 09:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
would be nice and informative to have such

[28-Jun-18 09:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
simple CMS can do, just need someone to keep it updated live

[28-Jun-18 09:47 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
here is good place to have live chats, but a place where informations will be stored in timline manner will be very usefull, otherwise there will be same questions over and over again -> waste of time

information and keeping it ordered is the key like libraries or internet won't exist without it, also no company or big structure can exist without structured information and info flow; ok maybe can exist üòÉ but it will be chaotic and slow down development

[28-Jun-18 10:18 AM] PTYX#6840
@Alecandro we've been waiting on marketing for the last 8 months. I can't wait any longer.

[28-Jun-18 10:33 AM] PTYX#6840
We need results and follow through. We can't blame the marketing situation on lack of planning. I sat through countless meetings to listen to the plans so I know they exist.

[28-Jun-18 10:45 AM] sœÜldat#8733
and on top of that marketing is really not the most difficult point when technology is present.

[28-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Mylo#8306
Education & Enterprise & Gamers.  We had a booth at a government and startups convention in the netherlands yesterday.

What dApps do you think are going to be built on a blockchain?
Who is going to build them?
Who is going to train the people to build on a blockchain?

People are still learning about the tech and what they can potentially do with it.
A majority of software developers still think the crypto space is full of scams.

The komodo solutions are great, and there is room for improvement.  We want to welcome people external to the crypto scene into the komodo ecosystem.

In the last 6 months, the DEX has seen 100k atomic swaps and a few dICOs.  This has been marketed.   These are historical notes of Komodo's achievements.  This technology is available to anyone.

A new baseline is being set by Komodo from it's history and tech innovation - one that needs to be delivered professionally, succinctly and at the right time.

This tech has the potential to co-exist with large cloud vendors and integrate with many other projects and solutions.

[28-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Regnar#6164
@Steve Lee I've given them your contact info Steve, They're based in Italy so there will likely be some time difference in contact hours and coordinating for skype interview. Thanks

[28-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Regnar#6164
We definitely need different terms for asset chains like OOT, BNTN, etc and scaling chains that are KMD fungible.

[28-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Regnar#6164
What are the official terms for each?

[28-Jun-18 12:35 PM] PTYX#6840
I wrote an official proposal to introduce KiC or the Komodo Independent Chain Protocol

[28-Jun-18 12:43 PM] PTYX#6840
the only term that is widely used is assetchain which doesn't have any marketing or branding value

forgot to add marketing should have some budget min 3k $ monthly; also marketing should do some wise testing of channels usage for specific targets (when targets set) so optimize money spending

[28-Jun-18 01:34 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
possibly there could be few marketing groups having few small budgets, and you could narrow down those groups with time - selecting those which bring better results, and finally increase the marketing budget for the best marketing leaders/groups which should be no more then 2-3 or maybe just 1 if proven really amazing üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 01:35 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so in 6 month a marketing budget like 20-50k $ could be reached, which should be sufficienty for longer period afterwards?

[28-Jun-18 01:37 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
obviously all spent money should be proven + results shown , someone must review that and manage, maybe a small commitee who discuss results and progress of marketing actions

[28-Jun-18 01:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also I think I have mentioned couple of months before - there should be a review of top 30 cmc coins marketing strategy = to see what actions they take and what actions are proven working; all actions should be reviewd, but only legal/moral correct/transparent should be discussed for later usage

[28-Jun-18 01:46 PM] Meyse#0952
im wondering who you want to market to

[28-Jun-18 01:47 PM] Mylo#8306
and define "results"

[28-Jun-18 01:47 PM] Meyse#0952
for me its very clear that the only people you need to market to are actual people who are willing to add value to komodo, like entrepreneurs and devs etc

üíØ 

[28-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Meyse#0952
there is no need to market to regular people like eos or vechain or whatever do

[28-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Meyse#0952
cause they have nothing to market except promises

[28-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Meyse#0952
we have actual tech to market

[28-Jun-18 01:50 PM] Meyse#0952
there is so much oppertunity for devs to make money in this ecosystem by making apps that use barterdex

[28-Jun-18 01:54 PM] jorian#4555
there are certain parts of the komodo platform that can be marketed to the plebs

[28-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Mylo#8306
once scaling is turn key, a lot of app developers will be able to make an economic system in their apps that can interact outside of the app without the operational overhead of centralised systems and built in security.  blockchain provides operational efficiency.

[28-Jun-18 01:54 PM] jorian#4555
jumblr for example, no need for devs

[28-Jun-18 01:55 PM] Meyse#0952
ok but jumblr needs user friendly apps first

[28-Jun-18 01:55 PM] Mylo#8306
jumblr requires education.  people don't know yet how much they need privacy.  they are used to getting reamed by tracking networks.

[28-Jun-18 01:57 PM] Meyse#0952
i think the plebs need education first actually, they dont understand the concept of the need for security,scaling,decentralization

[28-Jun-18 01:57 PM] Mylo#8306
Education, exactly.  Developers don't know how much they can benefit from blockchain tech that is secure, private, interoperable, scalable.

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That'll come with time

[28-Jun-18 01:58 PM] Meyse#0952
ugh i hate myself for saying plebs haha

[28-Jun-18 01:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I'm actually involved in a large kind of "blockchain development community outreach" if you will where I live

[28-Jun-18 01:59 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And I'm constantly pointing devs and the like to KMD

[28-Jun-18 02:00 PM] Beetcoin#9049
THere's certainly more out there just like me

[28-Jun-18 02:00 PM] Mylo#8306
It will come with time, just like the internet came 10 years after it first arrived.  We want their first time to be in the komodo ecosystem.  So it takes education, easy tools, and usefulness.  1m tx/s is useful.

[28-Jun-18 02:00 PM] Beetcoin#9049
There's still so much barrier to entry anyhow

[28-Jun-18 02:01 PM] Beetcoin#9049
And the first wave of crypto is more speculatory rather than use case

[28-Jun-18 02:01 PM] Meyse#0952
there are kinda 2 choices of marketing, 1. market the promise of price increase, artificial value increase by plebs buying the coin 2. market the possibilities for devs by using the ecosystem which creates real value by real usage of the coin

[28-Jun-18 02:01 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Avoid #1

[28-Jun-18 02:01 PM] Mylo#8306
at the moment, but these things we are working on making smoother, better documented, accessible

[28-Jun-18 02:02 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Education = smart marketing. Good marketing is not simply "selling the shit". Should be informative, building awarness, education.

[28-Jun-18 02:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"There's still so much barrier to entry anyhow"
Because you don't have $1.60 to buy 1 KMD?

[28-Jun-18 02:03 PM] Beetcoin#9049
The tech is what sells KMD, not the promise of the price going up

[28-Jun-18 02:03 PM] Meyse#0952
yes

[28-Jun-18 02:03 PM] Beetcoin#9049
That would actually undercut the value in most minds

[28-Jun-18 02:03 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Feels like a shill

[28-Jun-18 02:04 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Last week we ran a 2.5 hour class on atomic swaps using KMD as a model

[28-Jun-18 02:04 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Marketing results <- marketing targets. For jumbler you may like to increase user base. Same for DEX, Agama... I believe you can set up some measures, KPIs and check them different ways. KPIs example = { new downloads by IP addresses, nr of addresses in usage, ...}

[28-Jun-18 02:04 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I'd certainly focus on KMD's useful tech and market it

[28-Jun-18 02:04 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
for DEX target would be actually volume ...

[28-Jun-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
yeah but who the hell needs to jumble weekly

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also for DEX partially marketing is done by different teams doing diff UI's ...

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Meyse#0952
more volume is created by devs creating multiple dex's that users can choose from

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Mylo#8306
@Beetcoin if you are in contact with devs, could you please get some details - what languages/platforms (mobile /web/desktop etc.) they work on and keep a record of where the target market is for the people you are in contact with.  We can provide developer onboarding stuff in the future.

[28-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Beetcoin#9049
I can certainly ask

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] Beetcoin#9049
We meet up every two weeks

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] Mylo#8306
Where abouts?

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe a competition could also be done -> team that will make more succesfull DEX in 1 year gets 1e6 $ prize ? üòõ

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
success = bigger volume traded

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and more users or sth like that

[28-Jun-18 02:06 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I mean DEX UI

[28-Jun-18 02:07 PM] Meyse#0952
DEX devs are already rewarded by percentage of DEX txfees, this should be marketed cause nobody knows about this, also they can setup their own LP's in certain apps which can also make them money

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Beetcoin#9049
@Mylo I"m not sure I'm comfortable saying where with that troll CG following me around the discord, but its in a top 25 metropolitan area in the US.

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so you see what tyou can market -> earn money with KMD building DEX UI -> you earn fees. Here marketing effort needed so that the world id educated/informed well about it.

[28-Jun-18 02:08 PM] Mylo#8306
US is good enough.  Thanks

[28-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Some weeks are more tech involved than others in the meetup, and I find myself answering a lot of pretty beginner questions still, but I generally try to avoid shilling, and instead show the technology itself

[28-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Beetcoin#9049
One week I chose KMD as an example of various proofs of work and their merits.

[28-Jun-18 02:12 PM] Beetcoin#9049
Actually had a bitcoin app dev get in a pretty heated argument with me about dPoW

[28-Jun-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
