[09-Jul-18 01:23 PM] PTYX#6840
The only way, is a Tezos style buy-out

[09-Jul-18 01:24 PM] PTYX#6840
Where the project is bought out by the foundation

[09-Jul-18 01:24 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll plead ignorance here. I was just answering your quesiton why a legal entity was needed

[09-Jul-18 01:25 PM] PTYX#6840
My point is, I don't see the above solutionsin the Redfox whitepaper which is supposedly what I hear business development is working on.

[09-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I see. I don't really have any answers

[09-Jul-18 01:27 PM] PTYX#6840
If you haven't read it, then ask business development for it.

[09-Jul-18 01:27 PM] PTYX#6840

just because there is a legal entity, doesnt mean it is the open source project

[09-Jul-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the two can and should be separate as an open source project doesnt have a profit motive

[09-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Audo#5667
Indeed, in my humble opinion we need at least three things which should be kept separate

 1) the open source project (as it is)
 2) an entity or entities driving business adoption (blockchain as a service)
 3) startup incubator / accelelator

[09-Jul-18 01:46 PM] PTYX#6840
The startup incubator can be a branch of the business entity. I don't think a third entity for the incubator is necessary unless it gets huge.

[09-Jul-18 01:47 PM] PTYX#6840
But definitely, I agree with that.

[09-Jul-18 01:47 PM] PTYX#6840
It needs to be separate

[09-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You have stuff like Odoo/OpenERP which is SaaS and opensource, yet there is also a licensing model for the 'for profit' side of things.

[09-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Regnar#6164
The development of Komodo is already decentralized and open source, should remain as such, a business entity would simply be the experts that know how to leverage the Komodo open source platform for business purposes and have a close relationship with the developing team. They use that knowledge and development relationship to create products, services, for businesses that drive revenue using the Komodo platform, which is shared in the form of R&D (paying Komodo developers for continued work as "contractors" or outside sources, paying for other types of additional costs, salaries, expansions, marketing, client acquisition etc).

[09-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Regnar#6164
That's my belief on this.

[09-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Regnar#6164
That way we have a business entity that is working to leverage the Komodo team/platform by offering its products and services to other business entities (on behalf of Komodo)

[09-Jul-18 04:45 PM] Regnar#6164
@Audo any chance we can get a business development channel or something that Benny can own? There's a lot of thoughts here that aren't marketing related

[09-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Audo#5667

my understanding is KMD provides platform for other entities like Chainzilla to make business on it, right? So there can be many legal entities helping some business to utilize KMD, and KMD by itself no need to care about that legal stuff? What KMD needs to care is maybe some infrastracture and revenue stream for network supporters like notary nodes and so... just to support internal KMD existance ?

[09-Jul-18 09:55 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Ok maybe long terms it's good to have some kind of KMD board, where by voting most interested parties/entities could point out some future development ideas, but it can be little chaotic as this board or even more simply forum would allow open discussion between people enganged on different levels and with different, sometimes oposite, interests

[09-Jul-18 09:56 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
However forums/boards we have now already here, so maybe good enough üòÉ

[09-Jul-18 11:59 PM] Regnar#6164
The difference is many of these entities that will be providing BaaS to businesses can use any platform including Komodo. There are businesses out there that want to use Komodo but are hesitant to work with a decentralized group of anonymous developers. They could use a 3rd party but we would be leaving a huge hole in the market of established businesses looking to partner with a coin team. A separate but official entity provides us some means of outreach to businesses that shows we are a legitimate project and with close ties with the developing team. 

This isn't saying all businesses are going to go through this official team and not a 3rd party, but right now Komodo is in a spot where they have no way of reaching out in any official capacity. I think having an official entity will help us bridge that gap.

[10-Jul-18 12:01 AM] Regnar#6164
having the entity technically separate prevents any legal recourse from happening to the entity from Komodo actions or refusal of KYC, and any recourse happening to the business from shutting down the Komodo project. The "official" capacity should be in the closeness of the relationship, and the use of the entities revenues to hire/pay Komodo devs for their work and redistribute the remaining in a way that helps grow the ecosystem.

[10-Jul-18 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
getting some of that "bitcoin is useless" feedback from comments i left in slashdot.

tech people - with what i presume to be techy jobs (or students) with nice cushioned centralised pay checks that hold a lot of "power" being system administrators, domain administrators etc. in the safety of hierarchical gatekeepers.

They are loud and know-it-all types of techs.
I would say the software dev is more the open minded type of tech.
A network administrator, just interested in connecting things - and blockchain is "interesting" to them after they learn past the scammy parts.

[10-Jul-18 01:45 AM] Mylo#8306
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã yes.  KMD offers an DIY-blockchain-ecosystem a la chain(zilla,makers) - where every blockchain is a fork of komodo (same tech)  and inherits all of it.  in the past, komodo has blazed a trail / pioneered the tech (atomic swap DEX, dICO crowdfunding, and now crypto-conditions implementation) and made it work.  all of these tools are available to anyone to build on and create value, to themselves and to the komodo ecosystem.
stuff like notarizations to btc for security, zero-confirmation atomic swaps, jumblr for privacy, scalability - all require KMD to "make faster or make better or make more secure".  KMD enhances the tech because it's been engineered for usage - that's how i read it.

It gets really interesting when dApps are built on KMD with these strengths, and the dApps offer interoperability with other ecosystems via crypto-conditions and atomic swaps.  So hopefully that stuff can be prototyped soon.

[10-Jul-18 01:49 AM] GoldmanSocks#8569
@Mylo I think the big tech firms missed the crypto boat because they want to drive the boat and not let the boat drive itself because thats not good for profit as any Ferengi would say. I am happy to be on the KMD boat just hope that there is a lifeboat that can make it continue to drive itself no matter who trys to sink/control the ship.

We can make post several times in Telegram the Discordlink from our Komodochannel , also the link in the Newsletters - and in the description from the YoutubeChannels & Twitteraccount - this will increase the members from time to time .
But closing Telegramchann with over 8500 Members in my view not a good idea.
Many Members will join in Telegram & Discord  if the Bullmarket starts

[10-Jul-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Just because you have "members" due to signups doesn't mean that a large portion of them didn't just come, look once, turn off notifications, and go away @Acura 
It's a misleading statistic if you use "members"

[10-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Acura#2748
Correct - but if Komodo Marketing works well and the price goes up , many old members will look into the channel

[10-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Acura#2748

@Acura the idea isn't to close telegram, but to instead funnel that community into one primary location.

[10-Jul-18 08:40 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Previously it made sense to have both telegram and slack as they served different audiences and purposes.

[10-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Steve Lee#1967
The issue with our slack was the barrier to access. You had to join a wait list, wait until you get on. Then there were tons of channels and it was intimidating for a new user.

[10-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Telegram was easy to join, and had just one room to worry about. Considering Discord is also easy to join, and is being more widely adopted in this industry, we thought it made sense to consolidate.

[10-Jul-18 08:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we definitely wanted to first consult both yourself and @yorklab  as you guys are active in that community.

[10-Jul-18 08:53 PM] yorklab#7270
I understand Acura's concerns, there are certain aspects of Telegram that work well and it is much easier to monitor just one single Channel. But I do think it's a good idea to start funneling the crowd over to Discord. If eventually nobody posts on telegram you can always shut it down at that point.

[10-Jul-18 08:55 PM] Steve Lee#1967

Been thinking of an addition to HyperDEX. I posted it in their channel to see if it would be a good fit. I'll post it here too.

[11-Jul-18 03:51 AM] Regnar#6164
It's a way I've been thinking about how to resolve some liquidity problems we have with our DEX

[11-Jul-18 03:52 AM] Regnar#6164
I can't post pictures in here though

[11-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking a chat could provide some type of positive benefit especially for atomic swap powered exchanges. I'm thinking that if you were to open HyperDEX to make a trade and see little volume you might just leave. Trades can happen any time but only when someone is on and leaves the DEX is open. So a chat box might give people a reason to stay on and chat, find traders, or do something while they wait for confirmations. 

Obviously this could be done in here or telegram or something (BlackJoker mentioned Matrix servers for chat which would be really cool, I'm still reading up on how they work exactly) but to be able to access it from the DEX would be cool. A chat might be a way for people to set up direct trades also, just come for "the hanging out" and end up finding someone wanting to trade or someone telling you about a coin you didn't know of.

I think for true DEXs, liquidity will always be a problem. CEX can only have a small sample size of the population worth in volume, amounting to no more than the total people on their exchange and coins in their wallets, but CEX are very active because the people there, are there to trade. 

Because a DEX can trade from the same wallets we safely store coins in, we can have true population sized volume (every coin in every wallet), but only if people are on at the right times to find each other (makes it tougher on other sides of the globe) and actively trading. so it would only make sense to give them more reason to be active on the DEX than simply to trade and close the DEX (takes their potential volume with them)

[11-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Regnar#6164
So this might build a lot more users who are on it for trading and chat (about trading or w.e.) which can add more liquidity. Just thinking about the times a few years ago sitting in Poloniex Trollbox talking with people and then buying some pump, or learning about different projects (actually its how I learned about Komodo, someone mentioned that we should be pushing polo to add KMD) 

we'll see if it's something HyperDEX or BarterDEX likes? But seeing as this is the marketing channel, what are our thoughts on this as a marketing opportunity or way to increase liquidity??
