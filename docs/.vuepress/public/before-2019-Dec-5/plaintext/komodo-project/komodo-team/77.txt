Gamification of peer to peer economy, they have an erc 20 token. Worth approaching to poach them onto Komodo?

don't open your marketing team card. 
blockchain-world is a war zone. 
perfect strategy and proper timing are important.

few people who knew what they could know.
they spread their minds like idiots.
they showed his feelings to the crowd there.
humans have always crucified them.

[16-May-19 05:59 AM] designer#4893
It's not a very good idea to tell anyone everything you know, unless you're a believer in perfectly conventional things. 

then who are you going to tell? 
You can tell anyone if you need to, but never anyone else. 
there is actually a good standard to do so. 
the most appropriate middle road between "not telling anyone" and " telling everyone," that's the company.

the best entrepreneurs must know this. 
because all great companies are built on hidden secrets that are hidden from others. a great company is nothing short of a plan to change the world. If you shared a hidden secret that only you knew, the other party is now a conspirator.

you can't separate from society and become independent. believing that alone is enough is not a characteristic of a strong individual, but just a characteristic for someone who misunderstood public worship(or jeering) as truth. the biggest risk for a start-up is to be so convinced of his own myths that he becomes a lunatic. the same risk of penetrating all enterprises is to mistake the awakening as wisdom after losing all meaning myths.

[16-May-19 05:24 PM] designer#4893
Engineers always try to make great products that are 'sold automatically'. But if anyone says this about a real product, he must be lying. He is either mistaken (in lying to himself) or willing to sell something (without thinking so).

In the world of business, this is often said to warn of the opposite. "The best product doesn't necessarily win." Economists say it's because of 'path dependence.' In other words, certain historical environments, independent of objective quality, can determine which products will be widely accepted. True, but that doesn't mean that the key arrangement we use now is purely accidental. Rather, it is better to think of distribution as a necessary part of the product. If you have invented something new, but you have not invented a way to sell it effectively, your business will be terrible. No matter how good the product is, it's no use.

[16-May-19 05:28 PM] designer#4893
Outstanding sales and distribution can create monopoly in itself. Even if there is no product differentiation at all. No matter how powerful the product is (even if it fits into existing habits and those who have tried it themselves immediately come to like it), it should be backed up with a strong distribution plan.

[16-May-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo is an open source project that doesnt charge for the software

[16-May-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
distribution is via free downloads over the internet, which seems pretty competitive

[16-May-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
there are only half a dozen multichain platforms, and the rest are doing the most monetizations they can think of. project lockin, deposits, gas, etc

[16-May-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, it seems we are uniquely positioned

[16-May-19 06:11 PM] designer#4893
you've probably heard of the word 'first mover advantage.' a company that enters a market for the first time can gain significant market share while other competitors are rushing around. but moving first is just a strategy, not a goal. what really matters is to generate cash flows in the future.

so it's no use being the first mover if someone follows in and takes the top spot. I'd rather be a 'last mover' than that. that is, the last great development in a particular market is to enjoy exclusive profit for several years, even decades. the way to do so is to take over a small niche, then expand its scale from there and move toward an ambitious long-term vision. business is similar to chess in this respect. Jose Raul caplablanca, who became the "grandmaster" of chess players, said. to succeed, "Study the last card before anything else."

komodo is not a company

[16-May-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
we are not selling, though we do need to make sure the projects out there know komodo exists

[16-May-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
that alone should be sufficient for the intelligent teams to make the komodo decision

[16-May-19 11:13 PM] Dr Debt#0891
The best product doesn‚Äôt always win. The best presentation wins. I understand you don‚Äôt see this as a company but to average investors it is. I‚Äôm just glad that you guys work off the beaten path that others abandoned long ago.

[16-May-19 11:49 PM] yorklab#7270
@Dr Debt  You are right about the best presentation winning. I think we'll probably see something when there's product ready to present.

[17-May-19 12:05 AM] Dr Debt#0891

I agree. You want as many eyes as possible looking BEFORE any big announcement.  Like perhaps a lot of volume and price movement causing interest from outside the community. I guess we'll see how it all plays out.

[17-May-19 12:45 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I believe in terms of value kmd could easily take a top 10 position as is with a good amount of marketing be it social media or a series of press releases. Remember the average investor doesn‚Äôt understand or even want to understand how this works, but if they think they can 100x on it they‚Äôll shill it to every soul alive.

[17-May-19 12:48 AM] Dr Debt#0891

Make mountains out of molehills and get value pumped before rebrand, then when rebrand hits, roll out more amazing ‚Äúannouncements‚Äù and watch the momentum shift.

Waste of resources to focus on "marketing" that's all about pumping ur bagz. Resources are best used to drive developer talent and actual end user engagement of dapps. That's why I love how the "marketing" is done on this project. They've always had the right priorities, even tho the drive-by analysts consistently drop in insisting on a better way to do things.

[17-May-19 01:01 AM] yorklab#7270
@allbits I do actually agree with all you just stated. Only saying "when" they do some major marketing. I'm sure some marketing is part of the plan.

"establishing a strong point of value" - I don't know what that means

[17-May-19 02:13 AM] Dr Debt#0891
With the problems being solved, it is my personal opinion that this coin should be, at its lowest point, 0.001 btc at its floor. This is what I mean by point of value. Investors look at the $$

You guys just keep at it. I‚Äôm gonna start working on my investment strategy going forward.

[17-May-19 02:28 AM] allbits#5898
Yeah, might wanna choose from the many projects that are interested in devoting significant resources to raising profile among speculators. Nothing wrong with that of course. I've been here four years and that's definitely not the way it's done here.  Prices in crypto are largely dominated by short term speculation and komodo doesn't seem to interest those folks as much as other coins do.
