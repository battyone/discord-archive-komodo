@Regnar__ @PirateChain 1/ To my experience, based on the more UTXO you have for private funds, the longer it will take. Follow the instructions in help/guides. You MUST have a single UTXO in the end. Just to create that single UTXO, it will take a lot of time since it's sp...

First I will say. I like komodo. 

Here is my contribution from the German telegram Komodo chat.
Translated with Google

Just my modest opinion: In over 25 years stock market, I have often put on the best technology. In the end, I still work today.
Most of those with the best marketing have won.
Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend today in the circle of friends to buy kmd.c
We absolutely need aggressive marketing, and very quickly. The technology and the ecosystem is absolutely great, but that does not help us if nobody is interested in investing.

[26-Dec-18 01:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not to dilute your point however many times it has been the best technology that has won out in the end.  Alternating current over direct current.  Google over Many of the search browsers of the late nineties/early 2000's,  intel and amd over motorola.  FPGA over gpu .

[26-Dec-18 01:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And we give businesses the one thing they lack in other platforms : autonomy .

[26-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Regnar#6164
It's also important to establish just what we will be marketing. Is it a platform for dApp development, a dICO platform, CC contracts, the KMD coin itself, etc. So if we are going to market one as a flagship, or all (though it is difficult to "sell the world") we need to have those aspects ready for easy use, building, and some examples built in. just flat out picking the right approach is difficult and is in process with the IBN team and Komodo, the marketing should promote a type of adoption, development, and usage that will drive value for KMD and it's holders, among other things. So yes, I definitely agree with the point of increase marketing. However,

[26-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Regnar#6164
I disagree with not investing in KMD because of marketing not being aggressive yet. I'd much rather invest in a project with actual technology and increasing marketing, than a marketing powerhouse built on vapor. And if the only downside isn't the tech, but marketing, then I'd say THAT makes it a great investment in itself.

[26-Dec-18 01:40 AM] PTYX#6840
@Evitor they do look very similar

probably just a stock font

consumers have become smarter and in the use market, a good product will eventually win.

[26-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
given two technically not so far apart solutions, marketing will make the difference
against vapor tech + marketing, there is no worry in the long run.

[26-Dec-18 01:59 PM] gsnew#5366
hello together, 
i think we agree, thats we have with komodo a very good technic an a very good team. ( i admire their performance ) but some things must be advanced. to example JumbLE,  its to complicated for the masses. Whenever I use it I have problems. Only the native mode of agama is a challenge. That can not help inspire the masses.
But a anonymization tool, thats easy to use fort he masses, thats a very good argument for buy and use Komodo. A detour over another blockchain ( like pirate or whatever ), i think so, is not the right way.
I would like to give you to consider: In the past, not always has the best technology won. See Microsoft, Apple or whatever. it won the easy to use technic. technology, everyone is talking about. you know the answer of a question from the people when he say: "google this"
I think we must see komodo everywhere. In coinbase? ( thats would a big step ) , in computer newspapers... I dont know,  im not a specialist.
Also I see many interesting projects in development. Thats very good, but I'm afraid komodo gets entangled in too many of these.
i think all of the team works hard and I hope their think about my constructive criticism.

I would like to thank the team for the successful work in 2018.
and wish us all a successful 2019.
Regards from Germany

Imagine when BarterDex matures and acts as an automatic intermediary for jumblr. You put btc in one end, trades it for kmd, jumblrs, then buys back btc at the end.  üòÉ

[26-Dec-18 09:48 PM] chris#0517
The most sound investment Komodo could make would be to run ethereum on the platform. Showcase the ease of use of running nodes vs Ethereum network's peer dropping node sync failures. This will essentailly end Ethereum, bring developers and clients to Komodo and thrust Komodo's market cap close to Bitcoin.

You will have to create professional press releases and marketing materials that must be sent out to financial & news publications as well as the cheesy blockchain news websites. Komodo must be dedicated and implacable in promoting this.

It would be the biggest shakeup in recent years, and crypto is due for a heavy shakeup. Komodo will be doing the industry a huge favor by extinguishing the Eth scam and saving the devs who are wasting their lives on it.

[26-Dec-18 09:52 PM] chris#0517
then kill the eth chain after mission accomplished

[27-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes i found eth quite convoluted and layers of confusion compared to kmd.

[27-Dec-18 01:28 PM] designer#4893
The success of any crypto(ICO) depends on the actual value of the ecosystem. If an ecosystem is valuable, the token that is commonly used there is also valuable. Investors look for ideas and buy tokens in advance, expecting return on investment. As a resource to sell tokens, publishers create ecosystems. When ecosystems are created and activated, investors' expectations are realized. This is a virtuous cycle structure. It is self-prophecy reinforcement that expectation creates reality and reality reinforces expectation.

The problem is that the issuer sells the tokens while ensuring value is in conflict with traditional securities laws and investment regulations. The standard of judgment of securities does not appear. Because the issuer-investor relationship is the criterion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that most ICOs violated securities laws.

It is necessary to reverse the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãensuring the value of the ecosystem rather than guaranteeing the value of the token. If an ecosystem has value, it can collect a variety of resources through the token without having to convert it to money or guarantee its value. It is not the mileage coupons that a valuable ecosystem meets with the block chain, but currency, so the government can not prevent it from being traditionally legal.

Are we still trying to push MM atomic swap adoption prior to MM v2? I'm not really sure how far off v2 is, so should we still try or should we wait? 
Reason being is I remembered  the p2p market place Open Bazaar let's you buy crypto now too, but it is done through escrow or trusted trading. Seeing as Open Bazaar is p2p and relies on both parties being online, it makes it a perfect candidate for vendors to be liquidity providers for MM. I figured we could probably negotiate the MM backend and request KMD integration for buyers/sellers too. 
All assuming we are still pushing MM prior to v2. Thoughts?

[27-Dec-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
wait

[27-Dec-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 is already functional

[27-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Regnar#6164
oh then my apologies, I was under the impression it was still pre-release/in testing

[27-Dec-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is

[27-Dec-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
basic functionality. in testing

[27-Dec-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but from what i have seen there is no point to support 2 independent implemetations

[27-Dec-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 is the future, the future is in testing

[27-Dec-18 05:40 PM] Regnar#6164
Right makes sense to support only v2. Just wasn't sure if it was something that we could push today for integration into Open Bazaar, or if it would be best to wait.

Hey guys. Is komodo working together with resistance (ResDEX)?

[27-Dec-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
not that i am aware of

[27-Dec-18 06:37 PM] klunex#3191
They are using etomic tech. I was supprised, ivan on tech published a video today, where he announces to make a series about dexes. He also sayed he will promote resistance and that they are using etomic swaps. I was sure that is a unice komodo term. After a bit of research i found an article where is written that they use komodos etomic swap tech

[27-Dec-18 07:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it seems based on BarterDEX, just using their coin instead of Komodo

[27-Dec-18 07:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but for etomic how they secure the chain without dpow?

[27-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Hermes#6934
it's based in marketmaker?

[27-Dec-18 07:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it says based on barterdex, I suppose they customize the marketmaker with their coin

[27-Dec-18 07:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
not a trivial job I suppose

`As an added feature, users can add privacy to almost any cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, even if that currency doesn‚Äôt support private transactions natively. By harnessing the power of the Resistance privacy-oriented blockchain as an intermediary, users can enable this privacy feature at the click of a button. ResDEX will then automatically trade the coin of your choice to RES and send RES in place of the original currency, thereby adding privacy to the trade. Users can also utilize the same trading mechanism to add privacy to a non-private cryptocurrency by automatically trading to RES and then trading back to the original cryptocurrency.`

I just know they will get a lot of attention in ivans future videos about dexes.

[27-Dec-18 07:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
something tells me that they will release their coin and masternodes in 2019, while the actual DEX will be strangely delayed

[27-Dec-18 07:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the wp is quite light on tech details about the DEX improvements. 80% is about their coin

[27-Dec-18 07:43 PM] klunex#3191
Daniel:
Our consensus mechanism is different than KMD as well :) We are our own Blockchain using Proof of Reward Splitting. But yes there are indeed similarities between BarterDex and us.  Where we are different is our focus towards better UI (one step privacy, one step instant atomic swaps), fiat gateway and ensuring liquidity on our platform through onboarding market makers :)

I am sure the privacy feature works like jumblr

They copied a lot from komodo in my opinion

[27-Dec-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
they claim they raised funds in silicon valley... if they did, then why do they need to ICO?

[27-Dec-18 07:54 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the team is impressive, not sure why no one of them has this project in their Linkedin page

[27-Dec-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just because someone is listed in a whitepaper doesnt mean they actually are part of that project. i read something like one third are fake

[27-Dec-18 08:24 PM] klunex#3191
The project came out from nowhere and now big youtubers are promoting it. I think they spend a lot of money for marketing. They realized the potential of barterdex and want go ahead. My opinion.
