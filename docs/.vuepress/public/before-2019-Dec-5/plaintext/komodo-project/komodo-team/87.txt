I guess agama will get a new name now? Or was that planned as well anyway?

[09-Jun-19 02:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I believe James said there will be a path for Agama after the move to atomicdex but idk much about that

[09-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Malti#3948
Just had a look again at the anatara announcement and looks so nice

[09-Jun-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
Agama is deprecated/discontinued

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Malti#3948
Looking forward to good things coming now that the hack is getting digested

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
or maybe not, that is what I thought

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not spread false things

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it will get a severe code review

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810

dont extrapolate from a single phrase

[09-Jun-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be a plan/path for agama

[09-Jun-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will stop speaking about Agama because obviously I am not being told many things. I thought it was discontinued

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been a very crazy time and we have not had a chance to do anything other than protect peoples funds and start the refund process

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
anything else that is going on, or is assumed to be, etc., it likely is very different than when things were in a panic mode

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Malti#3948
Got it

Komodo Project is Open Source Software Project.
It is not a company, or an organisation.
Just a software.

project and "KomodoPlatform" are different things and not "interchangeable"

Does anyone know how to claim staking rewards using the Komodo Ocean QT wallet?

[09-Jun-19 02:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Send a transaction to your self

[09-Jun-19 02:40 PM] habship#2279

Please post on social media if you can about the reimbursement ,  still people out there who may not have heard about what happened and it helps combat the trolls and fudders

will do as soon as I get em

[09-Jun-19 04:49 PM] habship#2279
Just wanted to clarify something about the Agama security issue. My funds were in a wallet.dat file when I used Agama in the past. I installed Komodo Ocean QT, generated a new address, and sent all my funds to myself. Is that sufficient to keep my funds safe?

[09-Jun-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is good

[09-Jun-19 05:41 PM] gcharang#6833
@habship 
for further peace of mind,
get the privatekey of that address, delete wallet.dat and start wallet again to creare new wallet.dat
then import that address

only do this if you know what you are doing

[09-Jun-19 07:05 PM] beavis#0898
Hey guys, I am a college student taking intro to blockchain class. We are using komodo platform for the class. I was wondering if there was a way to create test coins in komodo so that I can test transactions.

what's the best wallet today to import private keys from paper wallet and transfer funds?

A system maintained by sacrifice, not profit, cannot last long.

[11-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Malti#3948
Your point being? @designer

[11-Jun-19 06:01 PM] RJF#6619
A system such as KMD that is maintained by integrity, honesty and intelligence will thrive.

[13-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I have sent three transactions to myself trying to claim the reward using the Komodo Ocean wallet but it doesn't seem to be claiming. Is there a limit to the amount of KMD that has to be sent for the claim to perform?

[13-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Rewards claim. Should have mention that.

[13-Jun-19 03:15 PM] gcharang#6833
amount > 10 and age > 1 hour
send the whole balance to the same address and wait for two hours
then send to the same address again
that should show you if it is working

[13-Jun-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Kitchen Table do you not have any new change addresses with some amount in them? what address/txid are you looking at?

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was only sending 1 KMD at a time. All the funds is on one txid and address since it was moved after the hack notice.

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
1 is less than 10

[13-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
need 10 or more

[13-Jun-19 03:19 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Figured as much but wanted to make sure and also some imposter jl777c sent me a message so everyone make sure to check the users ID number.

actually it is possible to construct an account with same id also, make sure the id matches and the color is green!

[13-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I give him credit that his ID was close, 5801 instead of 5810. Of course I've been dealing with imposters for years dating back to slack so I question everything.

Why would your seed not work? Have you used the verus agama gui?

Pinned a message.

[14-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@REKT Queen did you check the seed for spelling errors or spaces at the end? Normally the same seed will always generate the same address
