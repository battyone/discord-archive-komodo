I should be more careful

[14-Jun-19 10:47 PM] REKT Queen#6380
No a seed and a password is what I had I only used seed when I first set up

[14-Jun-19 10:48 PM] REKT Queen#6380
I‚Äôve since bought a ledger last week and have double checked that seed

[14-Jun-19 10:48 PM] REKT Queen#6380
Yes it‚Äôs all lower case

Hey Komodo team

[16-Jun-19 05:18 PM] apooler805#4087
Hey can you apply for your blockchain to be listed on Trust Wallet? Because theres QTUM and other blockchains in there andI would like it if you add Komodo on there because not only will it be more known but we can add all Coins on the Komodo blockchain on the trust wallet so that means we can have Pirate Chain on there too!!! For example all ERC20 coins can be added and same for other blockchains listed, so if Komodo applies to be on there all the coins and tokens on the Komodo blockchain can be added!!!

[16-Jun-19 05:33 PM] PTYX#6840
@apooler805 no need to apply

[16-Jun-19 05:33 PM] PTYX#6840
The team can add it themselves

[16-Jun-19 05:41 PM] apooler805#4087
Oh, have you guys ever thought about it? I want komodo on there and Pirate

What rules apply for having a fork? Terms and conditions.

[19-Jun-19 04:06 AM] PTYX#6840
@suit&tie there isn't a rulebook of forks

[19-Jun-19 04:08 AM] suit&tie#8031
But like nxt if you want to fork you have to give 10% to the nxt community.

komodo is a tax free platform

[19-Jun-19 05:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
does nxt still have a community?

Does anyone know when the kmd team is going to finish crediting wallets that were swept as a result of the potential hack?

 I‚Äôve been a Komodo supporter since the beginning and luckily had moved 95% of my kmd out of Agama before the sweep.  

However, I‚Äôm still very disappointed that this happened and it‚Äôs made me lose confidence almost entirely in the project.  The fact that their was a vulnerability and kmd team was able to gain access and sweep my kmd even though everything was offline.

[20-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the hacker stole the passphrases, we took it from him
over 90% of the funds have been returned, alternative was to just let the hacker take it permanently
if your refund is not processed yet, let me know the address and i will look into it

[20-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if it werent for the hacker stealing the passphrases, we wouldnt have any access. unfortunately, hacks happen across this space on a regular basis and we were specifically targeted with a long term attack. At least we will make everyone 100% refunded. how many other projects have done that?
also, the blockchain was not hacked. it was an upstream library (npm) for one of the half dozen wallets that was. we are definitely tightening our security review process and this was a big wakeup call. not just for us, but all wallet providers that use node.js

Indeed

[20-Jun-19 06:25 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@jl777c I understand the blockchain itself wasn‚Äôt hacked but Agama was supposed to be the safe wallet for kmd storage.   It would be like someone being able to steal private keys from an electrum wallet and then sweeping the bitcoins out of them.  Appreciate the team‚Äôs honesty and transparency.  I‚Äôll be in touch w info about my kmd address.

@OriginalBitcoin  Electrum was hacked not too long ago as well. It's something that could have happen to any team and it was dealt with the best way possible.

[20-Jun-19 06:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Does it make you question where you leave large amounts of funds? It should. Users need to start using cold storage wallets as opposed to hot storage for these same reasons. It's a cold shower for investors and developers alike.

[20-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
firefox had a zero day vuln targeting crypto

[20-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
dozens of other crypto related hacks

[20-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and the new trend is to attack the development pipeline

[20-Jun-19 06:31 AM] PTYX#6840
More attacks will come

[20-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a universal attack, not just KMD specific

[20-Jun-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
hardware wallets or nodes that are airgapped seems to be the best way

[20-Jun-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but even hardware wallets if the hacker gets access to it, the privkey can be extracted

[20-Jun-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not saying this makes the agama incident ok

[20-Jun-19 06:32 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@PTYX  are you referring to the recent Electrum botnet at the end of April?  If so that was different because it was user error and users were tricked into downloading an infected version of electrum

the more moving parts, the more attack surface

[20-Jun-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
cli wallet has much less attack surfact

[20-Jun-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
a GUI adds a lot more surface, even if all it does is access the cli

[20-Jun-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
usually it is the big projects that are targeted

[20-Jun-19 06:36 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@PTYX unfortunately true

[20-Jun-19 06:38 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@jl777c yeah cli are less prone to attacks but in order to get kmd mainstream, a GUI is a must.  It has also bothered me since day one that you don‚Äôt need to enter a password to send kmd from agama.

[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
well, i added the ability for KMD to have a walletpassphrase end of last year

[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that feature is not in the GUI yet

[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Yea in the GUI

[20-Jun-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure oceanQT supports walletpassphrase

[20-Jun-19 06:43 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Ok thanks. Always just stuck w Agama.

[20-Jun-19 06:44 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
But I‚Äôll look into oceanQT

[20-Jun-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i think oceanQT has much less attack surface than node.js and it should be a familiar interface with walletpassphrase

[20-Jun-19 06:49 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
So for my own learning, how is it possible for a hacker to sweep my kmd coins when the wallet itself is physically offline.  Why is the paraphrase to the wallet stored online?

[20-Jun-19 06:51 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@jl777c I always thought that wallet seed is not broadcasted?

[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs not, that was the hackers malware he snuck in to the dependency

[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
So there was malware inserted into Agama?

Pretty sure I was logging in w an earlier version.  Maybe 0.3.1?

@OriginalBitcoin did you check your address in an explorer?

[20-Jun-19 06:56 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Yes that‚Äôs how I knew kmd team had swept the coins

[20-Jun-19 06:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Unlikely, SPV servers wouldn‚Äôt have connected

[20-Jun-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@OriginalBitcoin if you ever used the agama 3.5, even once, that could have been enough

[20-Jun-19 06:59 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
The version I was using had a d or b at the end of the number but maybe I did use 3.5 once one another computer

[20-Jun-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, unfortunately that is all it takes

[20-Jun-19 07:02 AM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Thanks for your help everyone! @jl777c will message you the address tomorrow.  Off to bed! Nighttime here

[20-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c is right here. For those who are not necessarily a developer, you still have to know that the code review of blockchains projects are certainly the most difficult ones that exist. There is a lot of money in this industry, so a lot of people want to take advantage of it. The projects that will have the most rigor or those who will manage this kind of attack will emerge in this industry. In my personal opinion because of the javascript package manager, do not use this language, too risky.

[20-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Slyris#2880
Well, this is not the first time that the JavaScript ecosystem is really dangerous, I say banning a specific programming language in a specific industry.

I work at Chainzilla. It's a blockchain consulting and development company. We've looked at browser extensions similar to Tezbox but that's something that we will likely work on towards the end of the year if we finish all the expansions in Chameleon Pay wallet.

[21-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds like very danger

[21-Jun-19 01:53 PM] PTYX#6840
That's exactly what I was about to type. There's security concerns with the extensions that we need to address before actually making it.
