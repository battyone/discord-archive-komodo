BET balance shows 0

[07-Jun-19 08:00 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@dsalinas79 ok your balance is 0, that's why you can't send them out, but I see on dextats that you have about 186 BET, so first you have to make your balance display correctly first, can you try doing these steps first ? <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers>

[07-Jun-19 08:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530
if that doesn't work, please try this: revert those change above, then head to settings by clicking on the droplist on top right > then SPV servers list > choose another server from BET list > OK , I hope this could make your balance display correctly

[07-Jun-19 08:04 AM] adamanto75#5195
hey I seen my funds were sent to two different addresses (Not the safe addresses) RScDbKw2X9WMSRxen6kX35YSU7T3d3gWDg and RLzzWkLYbxyv8MWD13X43KnsnDufkCxnQZ
what do I do in this case?

[07-Jun-19 08:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
@adamanto75 they ended up in RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF fill out the form

[07-Jun-19 08:05 AM] adamanto75#5195
ok for the tx Id I put both transactions?

[07-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Tantale#1431
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Yes, thats what I am trying to do. I have Verus Agama, new adress, I am logged in compromised seed but I cannot send : cannot synch transaction histor y for an ApiElectrumTransaction error...

[07-Jun-19 08:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is "use proxy" disabled in settings?

[07-Jun-19 08:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Tantale try this <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers>

[07-Jun-19 08:07 AM] Tantale#1431
Ok! I’ll look at it

[07-Jun-19 08:07 AM] CHMEX#0686
@adamanto75 If you have multiple addresses or multiple coins, please fill out form separately for each tx or each coin

[07-Jun-19 08:08 AM] adamanto75#5195
ok yea just kmd

[07-Jun-19 08:08 AM] adamanto75#5195
I had one address of kmd and 2 tx were used to send the kmd out

[07-Jun-19 08:09 AM] adamanto75#5195
1tx was just like .14 kmd

[07-Jun-19 08:09 AM] Zerkon21#3586
In the claim form :"How and when did you last accesst Agama and on which Version/OS did this take place?" what does one mean by that?

[07-Jun-19 08:09 AM] SHossain#0007
@dxer666 if you have already submitted your claim, for your addresses(es), you should be OK. any further claim on those addresses will be denied. but, how come you sent those info to an impersonator when you had chat history with me? 
Please never send any seed, or personal info to anyone.

[07-Jun-19 08:09 AM] SHossain#0007
I banned the impersonating account

[07-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Zerkon21#3586
I mean by how and when

[07-Jun-19 08:12 AM] SHossain#0007
it means how did you use Agama last and when

[07-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Zerkon21#3586
what if i don't remember the last time exactly

[07-Jun-19 08:14 AM] Zerkon21#3586
i mean i logged in once to claim KMD reward, but after that i might logged on just to check in on my balance

[07-Jun-19 08:15 AM] Zerkon21#3586
anyway I filled out the form i hope correctly

[07-Jun-19 08:16 AM] Tantale#1431
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator yes proxy was already disabled in settings. Weired as I have sent ZEXO, but I am unable to moove OUR.

[07-Jun-19 08:16 AM] pooler#1851
How can an impersonator can have the same name AND id ???

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] pooler#1851
discord exploit or what?

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] SHossain#0007
that's not same name

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] pooler#1851
ah right, saw it now

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] SHossain#0007
`SHossein#0007` is not same as `SHossain#0007`

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] SHossain#0007
`a` and `e` is different

[07-Jun-19 08:17 AM] pooler#1851
is unicode allowed in discord names?

[07-Jun-19 08:20 AM] pooler#1851
(I think it's best to click on the user in TEAM section and write a test message)

[07-Jun-19 08:22 AM] Zerkon21#3586
by the way, the team will contact us here on discord or on the given e-mail address before the reclaim to verify, right?

[07-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Zerkon21#3586
not sure how the whole procedure will happen

[07-Jun-19 08:46 AM] nocturnal#2177
hey guys, my wallet wont load... just keeps hanging. Re-install?

[07-Jun-19 08:48 AM] nocturnal#2177
v0.3.6b

[07-Jun-19 08:51 AM] nocturnal#2177
Before it hangs balance shows as 0

[07-Jun-19 08:51 AM] nocturnal#2177

[07-Jun-19 08:52 AM] nocturnal#2177

Question regarding  my Agama wallet. Keep getting errormsg : 'blockchain.address.get_balance'. Followed the guide from a few days ago; proxy is off

[07-Jun-19 10:02 AM] TimTim#2040
Hi. Can I please  confirm that if I havn't typed my seed into ANY wallet for over a year I have nothing to worry about?? Many Thanks, Tim

[07-Jun-19 10:09 AM] TimTim#2040
This suggests I'm fine >> "While the backdoor was added to the electron-native-notify library on March 8, it only made it in the main Agama wallet on April 13, when Komodo released Agama v0.3.5."

[07-Jun-19 10:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Correct

[07-Jun-19 10:12 AM] TimTim#2040
Few, thanks chief!

[07-Jun-19 10:20 AM] TimTim#2040
If anyone  could provide some hints on getting the new OceanQT wallet to sync it would be appreciated. Don't need spoon feeding (honest). It's just stuck syncing headers with 16 network connections. Left overnight......... nothing. Restarted 3/4 times...no joy.

[07-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Ocean#6938
you can use bootstrap for qt: https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
place it extracted in the same folder as komodo.conf

Hi, there, i filled out the first version of the reclaim form, without the last question (when last access, which os), should i fill it out once again or am i good?

[07-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Buddz1993#5380
One question how to acess or edit my process claim form?

[07-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Anyone knows?

[07-Jun-19 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
what do you need to edit?

[07-Jun-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@sopho if you filled up the first version, that's ok. don't resubmit same claim

[07-Jun-19 11:04 AM] sopho#0122
thanks^^

[07-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I just need to check the address which I put to send the funds

[07-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Buddz1993#5380
nothing more

[07-Jun-19 11:05 AM] general_grievous#6992
i created a new seed and transfered all my funds.. i did this using the new version of agama that was mentioned in the official announcement.. is there still any risk?

[07-Jun-19 11:05 AM] general_grievous#6992
still pretty confused about whats going on

[07-Jun-19 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
@general_grievous if you used Verus Enhanced Agama, you are safe

[07-Jun-19 11:09 AM] general_grievous#6992

They say i need to deposit at least 0,1 KMD(and if transaction lower than 10KMD a 0,1KMD fee will be taken) or Funds will be lose and dont appear in my Account there. do i need to change the Information in my form or will there be sent more than 0,11 KMD???

[07-Jun-19 11:14 AM] sopho#0122
@Keppie thanks, nice hint, i will look at that dark hole called browser history 😃

[07-Jun-19 11:26 AM] SHossain#0007

[07-Jun-19 11:51 AM] sir#6225
Try %appdata% in your windows explorer it'll be in the directory for agama

[07-Jun-19 11:52 AM] Louis#8450
With the new Agama v0.5.6a-Beta using KMD lite version, it cannot connect to kmd server - I’ve tried selecting the second server from the list but same issue?

[07-Jun-19 11:56 AM] bartwr#6773
Is the `electron-native-notify` repo with malware code still available to see (i.e. on GitHub)? I'm curious how the white hat hackers of Komodo secured some of the funds by sending it to a safe address

[07-Jun-19 11:58 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Louis try disabling proxy server <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers>

[07-Jun-19 12:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis unless for other specific assetchains, 0.6 version woeks best with KMD

Thank you @PHBA2061 and @gcharang - would a vpn cause the issue?

[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis it might
make sure you are running 0.6 version and disabled proxy in settings and restarted the app

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Louis#8450
Will do thank you

My coins are in a private address - will that matter?

hello, readying about the issue, i have some q: i can send safe my coins from agama  v.0.3.4-beta to any new adress?

@Louis what do you mean private address?

[07-Jun-19 12:37 PM] alcar#2907
@Yoewhen you say import old agama seed, what do you mean. I dont see anyway to "import"

[07-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Oszy#5734
@alcar  in which wallet do you not see import?

[07-Jun-19 12:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
is there more info out by now? I am still wondering how not all addreses were affected. My funds were not sweeped, but I did use agama several times within the last 4 months. Sending receiving and also claiming funds. Somehow I was not affected though?

[07-Jun-19 12:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@alcar import means just use the old compromised seed to login

[07-Jun-19 12:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@bpkdasbaum you aren't targeted by the hacker yet, there's still a possibility that you will be, so it's better so create a new address and send your funds there

[07-Jun-19 01:12 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i already moved it yesterday to my ledger

[07-Jun-19 01:12 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
cheers though. Just wondering why my address wasn't sweeped

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
sucks though, because there is no save option to claim :L
