ok let me get my team on this

[21-Jun-18 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
sometimes what helps is to increase the price a bit

[21-Jun-18 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
barterdex will pick the cheapest price anyway, but it helps to match the orders

Are you sure they are on the latest version of hyper?

someone needs to do a TweenDEX that looks like hyper and functions like barter

[21-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
yeah I see it on hyperdex

[21-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
still cant swap but we will figure it out.

[21-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Try increasing a little bit on the price it almost always works

[21-Jun-18 04:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah increasing the price a bit should work, the trade itself should go through at the listed price, but it helps matching the order

[21-Jun-18 04:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[21-Jun-18 04:16 PM] Dr Debt#0891
We will get it figured out

Is there an easy way to see all the interest we've claimed since the start with our agama?

[22-Jun-18 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no

[22-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
well fuck LOL

[22-Jun-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
to do so would require adding a secondary scan of the entire chain, since interest is based on time codes that aren't always included in every tx

[22-Jun-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as well as the fact that even with locks, any UTXO under 10 gets no interest

[22-Jun-18 12:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it could be added in (in theory), but it would significantly increase time to live on every wallet opening

[22-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I gotta just go through the explorer and see whenever I've sent my whole balance of coins into another address and use that as reference to see how much interest I've earnt and then write them down? ðŸ˜‚  or something like that Im guessing

[22-Jun-18 12:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
i've been claiming a few kmd daily and tax times comin but eh guess I could just not tell them about it, then sell it otc for cash or something along those lines

[22-Jun-18 12:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
also how long is interest going to pay out? I remember someone said 7 years or so, but recently saw someone put it at 2030 or something

[22-Jun-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
dump them through a z addy and tell the tax man to fek himself ðŸ˜œ

Hi support, can you u guys lend a hand setting up ' canbind:1' on my Win BarterDEX? I am getting the 'swap never started' issues, and according to JL the 'canbind' may be the solution. I am using a compiled BarterDEX, starting with 'npm start', but I can make a batch or something if needed.

[22-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Hermes#6934
You are on the CLI right ?

[22-Jun-18 05:46 PM] jansako#3330
no, GUI 1.0.7

[22-Jun-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> problem is that canbind:1 only works if you have a public-IP, no NAT, and no firewall active

[22-Jun-18 05:50 PM] jansako#3330
OK, I do have a static IP. Don't know what is NAT. I do have Firewall, of course, but I can see inbound rules that 'something' put in

[22-Jun-18 05:51 PM] jansako#3330
DEX TCP, DEX UDP, marketmaker,

[22-Jun-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> when "ifconfig" shows you a public IP, reachable from the internet, then you have a public IP, if it shows something like 192.168.x.x,. then you don't have a public IP. 99% of home internet does not have public IPs

[22-Jun-18 05:52 PM] jansako#3330
komdod, Agama. I am familiar with how to open a port, so I can do that if need be. Or just put a program exception.

[22-Jun-18 05:53 PM] jansako#3330
ah, I can see a 'block' rule in place on the firewall for MM. Is that put in by the installer, and why?

[22-Jun-18 05:53 PM] Hermes#6934
Market maker has to be unblocked

[22-Jun-18 05:54 PM] jansako#3330
it must have been put in by the installer, cause I sure did not touch it until now

[22-Jun-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> sure, but you would have to open all ports, because mm selects one free port and tells the other side to connect to that port

[22-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jansako#3330
that is why I am looking at a program rule. It allows the program to use any free port

[22-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jansako#3330
as opposed to a port rule, that opens one port (or a range) to any programs

[22-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jansako#3330
in theory at least ðŸ˜ƒ

[22-Jun-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
when doing a swap a random port is used

[22-Jun-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if bob cant bind any randomly generated port, canbind cant be 1

[22-Jun-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> i don't think this will be sufficient, since the router that does the NAT from the public IP to your private IP must do port forwarding for all this ports too

[22-Jun-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
>that is why I am looking at a program rule
feken winduhs users ðŸ¤¦

[22-Jun-18 05:58 PM] jansako#3330
@cipi OK, I see what you are saying

[22-Jun-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> easiest thing to do is get a VPS with linux, install mm on it and be bob -> problem solved and it also works :-)

[22-Jun-18 06:00 PM] jansako#3330
yeah, it is, and I have one, only use it as a mining stratum

[22-Jun-18 06:02 PM] jansako#3330
I may fire up another one or something... I just like GUI, I am weird that way, what can I say... ðŸ˜ƒ

[22-Jun-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> you could use the GUI to connect to the mm running on your VPS... don't know if that feature is already implemented in the GUI, but you could do it by hand (forwarding requests to 127.0.0.1, port 7783 to your VPS, same port, but you would have to know how to setup ssh forwarding stuff

[22-Jun-18 06:06 PM] jansako#3330

Tried making several swaps on there all of which failed. I have downloaded the latest version but have not tried it since some funds were lost last time

[23-Jun-18 03:50 AM] TomiDCat#6017

Small amount lost, not that worried about it. More interested in helping the team identify an issue if possible

[23-Jun-18 03:52 AM] TomiDCat#6017

That's what we call "stuck swap".

So you do have a stuck swap.
