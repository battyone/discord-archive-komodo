Closing the Linux window doesn‚Äôt close the wallet right?

[21-Sep-18 04:00 AM] jasonabis#8549
Is there a command to check to see if it‚Äôs staking?

[21-Sep-18 04:00 AM] jasonabis#8549
Also, if I do the python splitter, will it be easy for me to get the keys?

[21-Sep-18 04:01 AM] jasonabis#8549
Or should I just leave the splitter alone? Don‚Äôt know that I need to be editing the config cause I know thing about the asset chain settings.

[21-Sep-18 04:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe @Hermes  can help üòÑ üëÜ

[21-Sep-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
@jasonabis you definitely want to use that splitter, you won't stake very efficiently if you don't

[21-Sep-18 04:22 AM] jasonabis#8549
Ok. I will try. Can I screw anything up? Do I need info from MGNX dev first?

[21-Sep-18 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
no it's really simple, just make sure you keep that file safe

[21-Sep-18 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
it will have all the privkeys in it

[21-Sep-18 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
ping me if you need anything else, not going to be checking this channel for a bit

[21-Sep-18 04:32 AM] jasonabis#8549
@Gordon Komodo I accidentally stopped the process. Do you know what command I need to run to restart it?

[21-Sep-18 04:33 AM] jasonabis#8549
I think I got it started

[21-Sep-18 04:40 AM] jasonabis#8549
I think I‚Äôve lost all my coins. Getbalance showing 0. Just reimported key. Can anyone help?

[21-Sep-18 06:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @jasonabis Could you please describe your steps which you've performed to import the privkey?
Also are you checking balance for MGNX like a `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX getbalance`?
What also you get for `./komodo-cli validateaddress %komodoaddress%` (address whcih you see in Agama and tried to import)
Your coins should be safe if you just wanted to login  use in Linux same WIF for wallet which you using in Agama.

[21-Sep-18 05:24 PM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Hello, any info on how to use multisig for Komodo?

[21-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Hermes#6934
You could use the same procedure as you do when you use bitcoin , but you will need to use the Komodo parameters

[21-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Hermes#6934
Here are a list of the commands in the Cli it includes some for multisig use https://support.supernet.org/support/solutions/articles/29000013922-komodo-platform-command-line-on-windows

use this zip. it has `komodod & komodo-cli` binaries

[21-Sep-18 06:41 PM] SHossain#0007
compile from source https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[21-Sep-18 06:45 PM] gef#9796
I was downloaded from here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/download/multios-0.2.41d/Agama_installer_linux_0.2.41d.tar.gz and follow this steps to run it https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/20086807/How+to+Install+Agama+Linux

[21-Sep-18 06:45 PM] gef#9796
Is not ok ?

[21-Sep-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Yes this guide is correct you should be able to go through the set up . After you complete it Agama should launch.

[21-Sep-18 06:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@gef what exactly you are trying to achieve or perform?

[21-Sep-18 06:52 PM] gef#9796
to run the komodo daemon , import the WIF key  and staking

[21-Sep-18 06:53 PM] xRobeSx#5136
do you mean, run MGNX, and stake?

[21-Sep-18 06:53 PM] gef#9796
yes @xRobeSx sorry üôÇ

[21-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Remember that you need to enter the location of the file. If the installer file is in downloads you need to use the terminal and type cd Downloads and run the installer with the Sudo command in order for the installer to start.

[21-Sep-18 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
@gef have you installed Agama?

[21-Sep-18 07:03 PM] gef#9796

if you can't run the installer version, use the portable

[21-Sep-18 07:07 PM] gef#9796
ooooo , so i start again the installation but with a normal user ?

[21-Sep-18 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
you can try this portable version as well https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/download/multios-0.2.41d/Agama_portable_linux_0.2.41d.tar.gz

[21-Sep-18 07:16 PM] gef#9796

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
then, follow this guide to compile komodo first, then run MGNX https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[21-Sep-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama is a GUI product. Not for CLI environment

[21-Sep-18 07:40 PM] gef#9796
can you tell me from here ?

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
Do you see lite mode for MGNX ?

[21-Sep-18 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
Only Native mode available for MGNX

[21-Sep-18 07:45 PM] gef#9796
I don`t see it even in Native the coin MGNX , or i chose Komodo coin ?

[21-Sep-18 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
Which coins you see when you click on Activate Coin?

[21-Sep-18 07:49 PM] gef#9796
i see alote of coins but not MGNX

[21-Sep-18 07:52 PM] gef#9796
is the Agama (v0.2.41d-beta)

[21-Sep-18 07:52 PM] gef#9796
but i don`t see the MGNX

[21-Sep-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
it is because, Agama v41d doesn't have MGNX listed

[21-Sep-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to use CLI.

[21-Sep-18 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
compile Komodo manually, get the MGNX start command and use it.

[21-Sep-18 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to use only Agama for MGNX, you need to wait for the next version

[21-Sep-18 07:58 PM] gef#9796
hmmm , from here ? https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

after full sync, you can use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX importprivkey UXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` to import privkey (WIF) and `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX setgenerate true 0` to start staking

[21-Sep-18 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
those are normal printouts

[21-Sep-18 08:14 PM] gef#9796
when i will now that is full sync ?

[21-Sep-18 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
when you see `blocks & longestchain` has the same value using this command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX getinfo`

[21-Sep-18 08:16 PM] SHossain#0007
MGNX community doesn't have any guide?
