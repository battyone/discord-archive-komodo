@Nitego there's no kmd trezor integration yet in any existing wallets (inc. the official one from trezor) to my knowledge

Not sure if this is the right place to ask but does anyone know the config settings to use in knomp to make your own pool compatible with Nicehash ? The docs on the nicehash site are a bit vague. I know i have to set up min difficulty and ports but not sure of the syntax to use in the pool config file. Thanks

[10-Mar-19 02:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@vulcan set the max diff very high or ask in #talk-mining

hello, how do i set my UTXO in agama wallet so i can start receiving rewards?

Hello is it poosible to add erc20 coin with the contract add on agama wallet?

[13-Mar-19 09:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure what you're asking @Matlemac  but Agama does have ERC20 coins supported in the wallet already. Adding a new one is possible, but needs some collaboration with developers.

[13-Mar-19 09:18 AM] Matlemac#4687
Can t find the way

[13-Mar-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[13-Mar-19 11:06 PM] gilardh#8348
@radix42 The latest Raspberry pi 3 (model B, B + and, A +) uses an ARMv8. Why would you try to port  the Komodo version on ARMv7? I will try to install soon a full node and a block explorer on a raspberry pi 3 but I do not have as much knowledge as you.

[13-Mar-19 11:20 PM] radix42#3743
They do not have all of the arm v8 crypto extensions, which cost extra to license for the processor, and are effectively arm v7 for things that use cryptographic instructions

[13-Mar-19 11:20 PM] radix42#3743
Your install Will fail

@Draeth you have to create a wallet seed, and then paste that seed in the page that you screenshotted earlier. Then it will give you your xpub

[15-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Draeth#3300
still nothing, it doesn't show any xpub

locktime needs to be green check, so you should send all to your self same address

[17-Mar-19 09:12 PM] Max21#6308
The tool is supposed to do that for me right ?

[17-Mar-19 09:12 PM] Max21#6308
I don't understand why locktime is red

[17-Mar-19 11:01 PM] LeshAft9#0083
whatever sent the original transaction that created that utxo did not include locktime, so it has not been accruing the reward. you have to make a utxo with a wallet that sets the locktime correctly. (also the utxo has to be >= 10 KMD). if you send it to yourself and you see green check there then it should be good to start accruing, then you can come back in a month

[17-Mar-19 11:04 PM] LeshAft9#0083
btw withdrawals from bittrex seem to set the locktime correctly

[17-Mar-19 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
@Max21 previously if you sent coins from the ledger, the change output that would be sent back to you would not have nlocktime set. This meant as soon as you spent a UTXO from the ledger, the change back to it would not accrue rewards. This issue is fixed in Ledger Live 1.5. If it's still not set, update then send your full balance back to yourself. It will begin to accrue rewards.

[17-Mar-19 11:40 PM] Alright#0419
@lukechilds fixed it üòç

[18-Mar-19 02:15 AM] Memz01#1775
Is there a reason why exchanges have a 120 + confirmations for deposits or withdrawals to be completed for KMD?

[18-Mar-19 02:16 AM] Memz01#1775
It's extremely high compared to others

[18-Mar-19 02:40 AM] LeshAft9#0083
lack of confidence in dpow? i have no idea actually though

[18-Mar-19 09:33 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Binance is 120 confirms bittrrex is 20 , Binance went extreme after equihash 51% attacks and never changed it back even though kmd is the most secure coin available on binance

[18-Mar-19 11:44 AM] Max21#6308
@Alright I was not running Ledger Live 1.5 Indeed. Just sent my full balance back to myself, hope it is resolved now. Thanks üòÉ

[18-Mar-19 11:46 AM] gcharang#6833
you can check the newer utxo in the claiming tool to see if the locktime is set properly

[18-Mar-19 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards this will work as well

[18-Mar-19 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
to check utxo

[18-Mar-19 11:48 AM] Alright#0419
You generally want to check this after withdrawing from an exchange. If the exchange doesn't set it, just send the full balance back to the ledger with LedgerLive 1.5

[18-Mar-19 11:50 AM] Max21#6308
Yes I can already see from Lukechild's tool that it worked. Locktime is green now üòÑ

[18-Mar-19 11:51 AM] Max21#6308
Very releaved we can finally claim rewards easily from the Ledger now.

[18-Mar-19 01:02 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Has anybody experienced this? I was going to use the Ledger KMD Reward Claim website on github, and all the addresses and amounts look correct, but when the ledger nano device showed the fee it was some absurd amount like billion+ KMD

[18-Mar-19 03:08 PM] phideas#8309

[18-Mar-19 03:22 PM] phideas#8309
I managed to claim, but there something weird going on for sure. I have 5 KMD accounts on Legder so i tested 5x the claim process.

This bug popped up  when I waited couple of seconds while reading the adress on Ledger display before first confirm. After 1st confirmation,
the second confirm (output #1) never showed up on Ledger and the claim timed out with the bug screenshoted above. Tested on multiple accounts.

Bug didn't showed up and I was able to succesfully claim rewards when I was confirming the address immediately (couldn't even read).
After quick 1st confirm (address) the Output #1 and Output #2 showed ok and the claim was successful.

[18-Mar-19 03:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I haven't tested claiming on the atomiclabs app but i'll try it out later

[18-Mar-19 05:49 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Ah, I think the reason the ledger nano s display shows a bajillion KMD fee for the claim is because the fee in the transaction is negative. Maybe this is the mechanism it uses to pull the reward "out of thin air", a negative fee.

[18-Mar-19 11:34 PM] Alright#0419
@LeshAft9 you need to update the firmware of the device

[18-Mar-19 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
As far as I know, that bug was cosmetic only, but it's fixed now if you update the firmware

[19-Mar-19 12:57 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Ah, right. I'd been avoiding that because of the loss of space on the device issue. Thanks. ButI did notice on the block explorer that it shows a negative fee rate and fee which I was wondering about

[20-Mar-19 07:00 PM] DmanXX#2257
Hey guys I think Agama is calculating rewards wrong

[20-Mar-19 07:02 PM] DmanXX#2257
It comes to be 4% not 5.1

Agama 0.3.4 Mac OS

[20-Mar-19 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
5.1% is if you claimed it once per month for a year

[20-Mar-19 07:14 PM] DmanXX#2257
It‚Äôs not 5.1

[20-Mar-19 07:14 PM] DmanXX#2257
It‚Äôs little over 4

[20-Mar-19 07:15 PM] DmanXX#2257
I do claim every month

[20-Mar-19 07:15 PM] DmanXX#2257
Maybe there is a glitch in the software
