@SHossain I'm guessing the verus agama version doesn't use the security flawed library ?

[05-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Fever√¢n#9166
Well before I ask some questions here about the missing funds.. wouldn't it be better to make a pinned post with FAQ?

if you are confident Binance address will not change, that is ok

Agama 5th June Missing Funds Claim
Thanks for submitting your claim info details! Please keep an in our Discord server for new announcement as there is not ETA yet.

[05-Jun-19 11:00 AM] jeffjam#9765
When post mortem?

[05-Jun-19 11:01 AM] crumb#2550
i have a question regarding the claim. right now as i understand it i should give one new address to receive the temporarily moved funds. what if i don't want to mix different addresses? if claims from different addys all lump into one big pot then part of my opsec just flies out of the window

[05-Jun-19 11:01 AM] TS#7923
@jeffjam Friday the earilest I think

[05-Jun-19 11:02 AM] _lua#5803
Once Agama fixed, will it be possible to use it securely with our newly created Verus Agama seed?

[05-Jun-19 11:03 AM] crumb#2550
i will be exposed for future chain analysis probes

[05-Jun-19 11:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@_lua yes
we will have a secure way to hold your KMD very soon

[05-Jun-19 11:03 AM] jeffjam#9765
Could agama be used at some point again or will you dump it for good?

[05-Jun-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 5 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. We recommend moving all funds (all different coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected - https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD, all assetchains and 3rd party chains.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. Use the same Verus Agama wallet to send your funds to your new address
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

Wtf is a versus Agama seed?  This is a problem when all KMD wallets are in Beta, plastered with warnings that funds are not Safu and then the team starts telling people to move funds around between them.

[05-Jun-19 11:04 AM] LordTricky#7840
So what do i do on windows 7, i do not want a full chain

[05-Jun-19 11:05 AM] munhenhos#3463
i think that assumption of  "If you have already used Agama in the last 5 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds."

[05-Jun-19 11:05 AM] munhenhos#3463
is not true

[05-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
To be clear:

When filling out the claim form, after the coin name, am I entering my OLD agama address the coins were swept from, or the address they were swept *to*?

[05-Jun-19 11:05 AM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 11:06 AM] fern#2676

is this a real thief, or also a team safu address?

small amount would be accrued rewards
