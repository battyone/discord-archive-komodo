cannot use pi/password as it comes pre loaded with a different password

[16-Jul-19 04:03 PM] stricrypto#3482
How do I change my pin/password? It looks fixed on the interface

[16-Jul-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
you can't change pin password

[16-Jul-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if you already encrypted

[16-Jul-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
pin file will stay there

[16-Jul-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
unless you remove it from the settings

[16-Jul-19 04:04 PM] stricrypto#3482
ok how do I do that

[16-Jul-19 04:05 PM] Exile13#4458
@TonyL I've asked for the binaries

[16-Jul-19 04:05 PM] Exile13#4458
@gcharangwill do

how i can find my pub key in agama?

@stricrypto https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027655-change-pin-file-and-password

[16-Jul-19 04:10 PM] stricrypto#3482
This tells you how to unencrypt a password once the wallet is open. My whole issue is that I can't open my wallet!!!

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] stricrypto#3482
I have the seed, the pin/password and the password and I still cannot open the wallet....

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
you don't have the seed

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have seed, that is not the right one

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
same seed = same address always

[16-Jul-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
right seed = right address

[16-Jul-19 04:12 PM] stricrypto#3482
I do have the seed in front of me here

[16-Jul-19 04:12 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no exception

[16-Jul-19 04:12 PM] SHossain#0007
you have the seed but that is not the right one

[16-Jul-19 04:13 PM] stricrypto#3482
I have a number of words 24 to be correct

[16-Jul-19 04:13 PM] SHossain#0007
either you changed something on it (like character or space), or you used a different one initially

[16-Jul-19 04:13 PM] popcornbag#4039
hi , old notaries that was not elected cant mine anymore , but can still notarize until end of  month , is that correct ?

[16-Jul-19 04:13 PM] stricrypto#3482
I have spaces between all the words

[16-Jul-19 04:13 PM] stricrypto#3482
is that not correct?

[16-Jul-19 04:14 PM] SHossain#0007
@popcornbag please check my last pinned post in priv-nn channel

[16-Jul-19 04:15 PM] popcornbag#4039
ok

[16-Jul-19 04:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@stricrypto what address you get from your seed?

[16-Jul-19 04:16 PM] SHossain#0007
and, what is the address you have balance in?

[16-Jul-19 04:18 PM] stricrypto#3482
balance is in RFoTEZPDScVbXrkN1WytMv6SUC3DcRsBxA

[16-Jul-19 04:19 PM] SHossain#0007
does your current seed generates this address?

[16-Jul-19 04:20 PM] stricrypto#3482
seed generates this address RUpZzrhUJwe6Lf26rXZZtVTdmwTSCSBxAb

[16-Jul-19 04:21 PM] SHossain#0007
does this current seed always generates this address? `RUpZzrhUJwe6Lf26rXZZtVTdmwTSCSBxAb`

[16-Jul-19 04:21 PM] stricrypto#3482
I close the wallet and try again.....2 mins

[16-Jul-19 04:22 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[16-Jul-19 04:26 PM] stricrypto#3482
tried again and it's the same RUpZzrhUJwe6Lf26rXZZtVTdmwTSCSBxAb

[16-Jul-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
so, that means, that seed will always generate `RUpZzrhUJwe6Lf26rXZZtVTdmwTSCSBxAb`, it can't generate `RFoTEZPDScVbXrkN1WytMv6SUC3DcRsBxA` because, this seed is not for `RFoTEZPDScVbXrkN1WytMv6SUC3DcRsBxA`

[16-Jul-19 04:29 PM] stricrypto#3482
This is the seed I received when I opened the wallet! i don't have any other seed.

[16-Jul-19 04:30 PM] stricrypto#3482
If you can tell me how to get in via the pin/password combo I will try that too.

[16-Jul-19 04:30 PM] stricrypto#3482
I say again that when I download the wallet via the link you gave me I get a different pin/password already pre loaded

[16-Jul-19 04:31 PM] stricrypto#3482
if this was empty i could manually enter my pin/password and password

[16-Jul-19 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
the pin/password is pre-loaded becaused you created/encrypted your seed

[16-Jul-19 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
it would never be there automatically

[16-Jul-19 04:32 PM] stricrypto#3482
Yes that was my mistake on the new wallet I created when following your instructions after the hack.

[16-Jul-19 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
you didn't use this seed to generate address. maybe you encrypted the seed with a password, but instead of passowrd in the password box, you may have used the password in the seed box. so, i already asked you to try entering the password of encrypted PIN in the seed box and try to login

[16-Jul-19 04:32 PM] stricrypto#3482
Ok I'll try now....

[16-Jul-19 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
`Yes that was my mistake on the new wallet I created when following your instructions after the hack.`
so, it wasn't there magically

[16-Jul-19 04:33 PM] stricrypto#3482
I followed the instruction I received from you guys to create a new wallet.....

[16-Jul-19 04:35 PM] stricrypto#3482
I get this address when I login in using my password in the WIF/Seed box RGx8aRLVP1VHBiDpngGGN5SoPgybEAryoq

[16-Jul-19 04:35 PM] stricrypto#3482
What a mess....

[16-Jul-19 04:36 PM] stricrypto#3482
Are you sure you know what your doing? Could I deal with someone else please?

[16-Jul-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
are you sure what you have done and what are you doing now?

[16-Jul-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
it's your mess

[16-Jul-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
you created it

[16-Jul-19 04:36 PM] stricrypto#3482
Can I deal with someone else?

[16-Jul-19 04:37 PM] stricrypto#3482
Yes I probably did create it but thats not the point

[16-Jul-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
and, the point is?

[16-Jul-19 04:37 PM] stricrypto#3482
The mess is there and I need help to solve it which you are not providing

[16-Jul-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
hah.....

[16-Jul-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i've just wasted my time on you

[16-Jul-19 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
someone please help him

[16-Jul-19 04:38 PM] stricrypto#3482

I made a transaction yesterday and if I check my address the kmd is visible, but on my agama wallet only the kmd that I had from before is visible. Tried to close and open the wallet. How comes?

Yes I am.

[18-Jul-19 07:30 AM] Rudolf Nansen#0199
To me it looks like the wallet is online and working.

[18-Jul-19 07:34 AM] Rudolf Nansen#0199
I encrypted my wallet yesterday using cli response: encryptwallet <passphrase>

[18-Jul-19 07:34 AM] Rudolf Nansen#0199
but that should not stop incoming transactions.

[18-Jul-19 07:47 AM] Rudolf Nansen#0199
If I look up my address the amount is correct using kmdexplorer.io, but the wallet is not.

[18-Jul-19 07:48 AM] gcharang#6833
@Rudolf Nansen if you are comfortable with cli,
do the following:

[18-Jul-19 07:48 AM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
check what block you are in. use `getinfo`
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use `getblockhash 1444008`
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use `invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH>` without <> like the command below
once that is done, use `reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2`

[11:48 AM] SHossain: wait for the daemon to get on mainchain which might take some time
