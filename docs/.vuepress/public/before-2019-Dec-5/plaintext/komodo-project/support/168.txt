I have two missed payments. One for 27.10 ARRR with transaction ID d5f3c485bcb9f0aa3175813d6bd3d7297864c8634a02610e818a0864d4f3d026 realized on 7/21/2019 the second for 25.52 ARRR with transaction ID d7e5400b007f27d39c5febc0438832a45e93baea2ab5a1daabab10917e89b7cd realized on 7/22/2019. I was hoping you can investigate what is going on so I can receive them.

[27-Jul-19 09:41 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
anybody here?

[27-Jul-19 09:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
what do you mean by missed payments? you sent a transaction and it hasnt arrived in your wallet?

[27-Jul-19 09:50 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
yes

[27-Jul-19 09:51 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
I received 2 payments from luxor to agama wallet

[27-Jul-19 09:51 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
when I checked my agama wallet there were no sign of  the 2 payments

[27-Jul-19 09:52 PM] actionslacks#4072

[27-Jul-19 09:52 PM] BigLouis1971#1114

I mined to agama version of arrr wallet

[27-Jul-19 09:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
did you already have an arrr balance in that address and were previous payments recieved with out issue? there was a network update on the 15th. if the payments stopped coming after that then you may need to update your wallet

[27-Jul-19 09:57 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
I did received some payments

[27-Jul-19 09:57 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
and yes the payments were on 7/21 and 7/22

[27-Jul-19 09:58 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
I also have a balance

[27-Jul-19 10:03 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'm just a lurker and not part of the team, but your issue is probably related to the recent update

[27-Jul-19 10:05 PM] BigLouis1971#1114
where can I find the link?

[27-Jul-19 10:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'm not sure if they're recommending PirateOceanQT or the verus agama wallet for Pirate but you can check in either of their discords or perhaps someone will chime in here. In any case, your pirate is likely completely safe and you just need to update the wallet and do a rescan

[28-Jul-19 01:10 AM] msg768 ‚ö°#4220
@cipi I don't think keccak is used for signing with smart or swift only addresses and private keys as well as mining. I think smart hashes the tx once before signing it and that's why you get that error. Whereas bitcoin and almost any altcoin I'm aware of hashes the tx twice with sha256 so does swiftcash. I'll try to test swift see if I can swap it with something. What do you suggest I try to swap it with? RICK?

For @gcharang    with regard to ticket: https://support.supernet.org/helpdesk/tickets/13531  my last post was:  " Unfortunately the QR code gives me a seed that I allready have so my situation is as previously described. If indeed you are unable to access those funds it seems that I am unable to access them either & so unfortunately it seems that they are lost." I am not sure if there's anything more that I can do. Is there anything further that you can suggest?

I got some issues with magnum wallet. Since 2 days now that I can not login. I tried to clear cache and restore from backup but no way. I tried on multiple computers, browsers, android app.. Nothing happens when I put in my password. If I put a wrong one, It tells me. When I restore my wallet, and proceed, the webpage don't go to the next step. My request is only taken into account if I go to the previous page. But Still doesn't work when asking for login. Anyone?

Does anyone know if Namecoin (NMC) is still supported by the Agama wallet? Getting a server connection error  at the moment. Got the 0.5.7-4 version installed.

@hutchstock for coins other than KMD and smartchains that are part of the ecosystem, you will get faster answers regarding the latest version of Agama in the VerusCoin discord

I have some KMD on a paper wallet for about 2 years now. I want to sweep the paper wallet into the AGMA wallet v0.5.7-4 using an offline signing transaction as described below.
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama
If I do this, will I loose my staking rewards for that 2 year time period ?
Or will the offline signed transaction automatically add in my staking rewards for the time period so that my new address where I send my KMD to will have my initial send amount plus my staking rewards ? I do not want to enter my private key directly into AGMA due to any potential key logger virus.
thanks in advance for the help.

[30-Jul-19 04:37 PM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A do you want to abandon the paper wallet and use Verus Agama from now?

[31-Jul-19 03:15 AM] PacificK2A#4591
Yes, I want to abandon the paper wallet and use Verus Agama from now on. But I wish to get my staking rewards for the past 2 years from my paper wallet before I abandon it.

[31-Jul-19 03:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
if it was 2 years ago I think you'll only have accumulated rewards for 1 year. rewards stop accruing if the coins dont move for over 1 year.

[31-Jul-19 03:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can check your address at atomicexplorer.com

[31-Jul-19 06:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A what actionslacks said is true
you will get 1 year worth of rewards and after that

you need to claim once per month
you don't need to do all that offline signing

just login into VerusAgama using seed/wif from the paper wallet

Install https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.5.7-4
Login using old seed phrase: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed

which OS are you using?

I am a member of Hempcoin/THC and we are now associated with KMD and on a smartchain/assetchain with them. We have two bots on our Discord. One is the THC bot, and the other is the KMD bot. I got a deposit address from the KMD bot and then deposited 3x's, one for 5 thc, 5thc, and 295 thc. The transactions did go through and were deposited into the deposit address I was given:  RHYMXfzg5UGbeMySMhfYei81PNTgmTEYHy . On the new Hempcoin Block Explorer/https://thc.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RHYMXfzg5UGbeMySMhfYei81PNTgmTEYHy the three Trx are shown with a balance of approx 305 coins, the sum of what I sent. However, the KMD bot does not show these deposits, and they are not available. Is this bot for KMD coins only? Did I simply lose these coins? Any help would be appreciated, thanks. Happy to be aboard, btw.

[31-Jul-19 01:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@gregmcgolf you must contact the developer of the THC bot
ask the admins of the THC discord for the contact
only that person has control over those coins

[31-Jul-19 01:32 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
Hmm, this was the KMD bot, not the THC bot. The deposit address I have for the THC bot works fine and I have access to those coins. The KMD bot is the same one that is on this Discord.

[31-Jul-19 01:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@gregmcgolf ok, I was confused
@sclear is the dev for the KMD bot

[31-Jul-19 01:36 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
Thx, @sclear can you offer a suggestion for me? If the coins are gone, then I understand as it was my mistake, but if possible can they be sent to the THC bot address: BOTTHC TIPBOT

Thanks. But I don't want to put my private key online due to a potential virus. It is an unacceptable security risk for me. So my question again. If I use the offline method to sign a transaction for the paper wallet, will I also get the 1 year of staking rewards when the paper wallet is swept to a new address ?

[31-Jul-19 02:38 PM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User he is talking about using Verus Agama

[31-Jul-19 02:38 PM] PacificK2A#4591
No I'm not being scammed. The support person is telling me to input my private key into Agama.

[31-Jul-19 02:39 PM] PacificK2A#4591
I want to sweep my paper wallet using the Agama offline sweep method. It is safe. I like it. But my question is still, will I get the staking rewards if I sweep the paper wallet.

[31-Jul-19 02:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@PacificK2A yes, you can use the offline signing method and use two Agama wallets in different computers
1 in a online computer another in an offline one

[31-Jul-19 02:40 PM] PacificK2A#4591
But will I get the staking rewards using the offline method ?
