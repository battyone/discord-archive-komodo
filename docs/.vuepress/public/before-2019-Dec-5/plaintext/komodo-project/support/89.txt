@Alright it seems that some people are in a situation where their old agama doesn't work but there is no agama releases to download currently

[05-Jun-19 01:55 AM] CryptoFungus#5816
yep in that situation

[05-Jun-19 01:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@private guy i have no more info than you. I am just here to help people with wallet stuff

[05-Jun-19 01:55 AM] meatspoon#7860
wait until the news actually hits that KMD wallets are not a safu place to store KMD

[05-Jun-19 01:55 AM] Tek#5253
that sucks man. I got the new wallet last week luckely or I would be stuck too

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
just a day ago antara looked like it was going to finally give KMD the valuation it deserves. A real bull run. But now this. Detracting from it all

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is doing the right thing, but notifying people of a potential problem. It's obviously not an easy thing for a company or organization to do

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Tek#5253
yeah true

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
But it's the right thing to do

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Tek#5253
yeah well done

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Tek#5253
apprecaite it

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
if this is an npm or electrum issue it's way bigger than kmd

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto working on a solution

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] private guy#0631
@dukeleto oh Wallet downloads are down right now?

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Tek#5253
is binance notified? are exchanges safe? its just the agamgay wallet rite?

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] meatspoon#7860
they need to make their wallets easier to use.  Ocean even makes Agama look user-unfriendly

[05-Jun-19 01:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@private guy agama downloads were removed from github so no more people can download affected versions

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] private guy#0631
ouch

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Tek#5253
i have a tarball for linux from it

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
does anyone know how binance stores it? is it a mega-wallet for all coins or an agama generated seed? is binance going to be affected by this issue

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
is my mobile agama fine?

[05-Jun-19 01:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
been using that mainly

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
Binance doesn't use agama

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Tek#5253
all agamas r probably fucked

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
very glad binance doesnt use agama

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Tek#5253
same

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
and Mobile Agama is based on android stuff, which I guess is not affected in the same way

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
what about the verus agama?

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Tek#5253
if its an unsafe seed generation, the unsafe code might be in the mobile wallet too

[05-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Tek#5253
there has been unsafe seed gens in other mobile wallets

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] Alright#0419
Agama Mobile doesn't seem to be affected, but best to move funds anyway

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
The desktop is written in Javascript (nodejs), while android mobile apps are different stuff

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright are we recommending agama desktop AND mobile users sweep funds?

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] Alright#0419
Verus Agama also doesn't seem to be affected, but I'm not 100% sure so I also cannot recommend this

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] zaius333#5338
I have kmd in agama pc wallet... will I be able to send it out?

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] Vertigo#0439
Does exchanges use Agama?

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] Tek#5253
can we get some details on what exactly the issue is : ? did multiple people report stolen funds?

[05-Jun-19 01:59 AM] actionslacks#4072

[05-Jun-19 02:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Vertigo no, exchanges don't use Agama

[05-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto yes, mobile is not likely affected, but it *might* be

[05-Jun-19 02:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a GUI wallet for users. Exchanges use the full node

[05-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[05-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Alright#0419
if you cannot send from current wallet, we're working on a solution for dumping keys from the seed phrase

[05-Jun-19 02:02 AM] CryptoFungus#5816

If your coins are "stuck", please just have some patience.

[05-Jun-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô you need to run ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh

[05-Jun-19 02:06 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
From where

[05-Jun-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
