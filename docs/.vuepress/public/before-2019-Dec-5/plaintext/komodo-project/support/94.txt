Had the problem been described?  Is this a wallet issue from the last few releases?  Or since day one

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Move funds to new address, ideally in Native mode. Issue affects Lite mode seeds generated over last (up to) 4 months.

[05-Jun-19 03:44 AM] DLT Novice#2835
So if my seed was generated one year ago then all good

I generated my seed more than 4 months ago

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] DLT Novice#2835
Everyone rushrushj ng to move funds to new addresses in a new wallet with no servers working?

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

[05-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Jcharming#2693
As long as I used my seed to access Agama desktop, restored and old seed to it, or used it to generate a new seed, in all these situations it's important I move funds correct? (Clarifying understanding before I message other people)

[05-Jun-19 03:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Use webwallet to move funds, or CLI.

Does this apply to any particular version of agama or all versions?

any version coded in the last 2 maybe 3 maybe 4 months

I have a seed account created one year ago and login every month to claim interest,  is my account vulnerable? If yes, then every account is vulnerable

So I should send from web  wallet to new account but cannot see success due to new wallet no accessing servers

[05-Jun-19 03:56 AM] cipi#4502
Agama from VRSC can't be used to send the funds with electrum, because it does not support the new electrum protocol
to send the funds, use webwallet, or native

What good is the new agama 5.6a from verus if it just says connection error.  Switch  to another server but the other server not working

[05-Jun-19 03:59 AM] cipi#4502
only good for generating a new address to send funds to

Just to be clear. Seeds not generated in litemode over the last four months are safe?

yes

[05-Jun-19 04:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is agama mobile affected too?

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] digital bullion#8223
I can leave my funds where they are?

My seed was generated over 1.5 years. So they can remain?

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes as long as you haven‚Äôt typed it into agama in the past 4 months

[05-Jun-19 04:01 AM] cipi#4502
@siu - Chainmakers i think yes

[05-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Ranma103#8958
So if I have imported my seed in the last 4 months it is no longer safe

CEX or a newly generated address (not with Agama)

send to another address generated by Verus Agama, exchange (if you want)

[05-Jun-19 04:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be cycling all mine later today once others are safe and have had a chance to shift funds. Fortunately most is on Ledger!

[05-Jun-19 04:05 AM] DLT Novice#2835
What sucks is the solution,  new agama new addrss send to it and hope, , because you cannot get lite access to your new created address because no servers working

[05-Jun-19 04:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Anyone who has entered  or generated wif/seed in last 4 months should move funds to new address as a priority.

[05-Jun-19 04:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so it means the issue is not in npm packages or any javascript compromise?

[05-Jun-19 04:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
native mode unaffected, unless seed/wif imported or used to login to Lite mode

Why is the web wallet considered not safe?  It seems the easiest and simplest to use?  Client side pin encryption of seed.  What's the problem

[05-Jun-19 04:09 AM] cipi#4502
@Ranma103 yes... as long as you haven't used the seed/WIF to login to SPV servers in Agama

[05-Jun-19 04:10 AM] Ranma103#8958
Nah never use the light mode only use native

I always use latest agama portable version. I use lite with every coin, if supported. My kmd seed is over 1 year old and I access it weekly to get my 5.1%. It's compromised now too? I use agama lite for Zaddex and Verus too. I think those are younger than 4 months. Only Pirate in native mode for me. It's not affected as there is no seed? Somebody can see my seeds if I use them now and can access them? How is this possible? Seed is not random after all?

If you have already used Agama in the last 5 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. We recommend moving all funds (all different coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected - https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD, all assetchains and 3rd party chains.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. Use the same Verus Agama wallet to send your funds to your new address
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
