I don‚Äôt want to compromise my saved funds

[24-Jun-19 08:45 PM] SHossain#0007
once you have all funds, just send a normal tx to a new (your) Ledger address

[24-Jun-19 08:45 PM] SHossain#0007
all will be combined

[24-Jun-19 08:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@SHossain how does the claim website finance themselves, now that it is free O_o? I read the setup of the website cost 10k or so. Did you guys sponsor them from community project funds?

[24-Jun-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the cost was development costs

[24-Jun-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
now it is developed, i dont think there is a lot of ongoing costs

Hey @SHossain just checked all of the addresses from my transactions that were pulled from my old Agama private key and all balances were 0. What are next steps here?

[25-Jun-19 01:36 AM] just_xu_it#3246
And sorry for following up on this so late. If you want me to DM, that may be easier

[25-Jun-19 01:39 AM] just_xu_it#3246
Also none of the funds went to the 2 addresses in the article so I‚Äôm not sure what to do here

[25-Jun-19 02:02 AM] just_xu_it#3246
Ahhh sorry I just found the addresses with my KMD but any idea on why I can‚Äôt access from my private key? I‚Äôve read through all pinned messages...

[25-Jun-19 02:07 AM] just_xu_it#3246
I previously moved my KMD within my old Agama wallet to other address created within Native mode. Not sure if that helps

[25-Jun-19 07:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@bpkdasbaum I saw people basically revealing their ledger seed just to get around the fee. So i thought it would be better to give it  free to the community to use and will work on finding other ways of funding more development for Komodo. Cost was a lot more than 10k btw üòõ

[25-Jun-19 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If anyone finds it useful, please consider a donation to jl777's donation address for the 500k he chipped in the recent hack.

Hi Guys, is the Ledger S Komodo app ok to use? The hack didn‚Äôt effect it?

[26-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Its safe

[26-Jun-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@framewood https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/ yes it is safe. Just verify the wallet address you see on the site is the same as on the ledger. To be on the safe side, you can also open the ledger app and check the receive address matches up with the one on the claim site

Hello,

When trying to open komodo-qt-mac I'm getting the error: 
Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and then restart.

I've manually downloaded the 5 files and placed them in application support/ZcashParams and am not sure how to get the wallet running

[27-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Rick Trades#9644
