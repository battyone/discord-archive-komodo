[15-May-19 07:03 PM] SergeF#8827
Old or new?

[15-May-19 07:03 PM] SHossain#0007
if possible both

[15-May-19 07:05 PM] SergeF#8827
One moment. An by the way at web wsllet the same situation

*wallet

[15-May-19 07:05 PM] SHossain#0007
the point is, do you have HUSH3 in your R address that you have. please post the address or check by yourself in explorer

[15-May-19 07:12 PM] SergeF#8827
In explorer at new address zero balance. Now checking old address in explorer

[15-May-19 07:14 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can't find your balance, please seek support in HUSH discord https://discord.gg/SsJuhU

[15-May-19 07:20 PM] SergeF#8827
So at old wallet explorer say "no mayching records found!" WTF?!

[15-May-19 07:22 PM] SHossain#0007
seek support in HUSH discord. invite link above

[15-May-19 07:22 PM] SergeF#8827
And what for this support?

[15-May-19 07:25 PM] SHossain#0007
this is not HUSH discord. you have issues with HUSH, better to use their discord as their team member can help you better on this situation

[15-May-19 07:45 PM] SergeF#8827
In that chat where you send me where are no team members. I repear my question - what forvthis chat?

[15-May-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
First you need help with migration which they can provide. then, if you need help using Agama you can get help here. They are already answering your question in their discord.

[15-May-19 08:10 PM] SergeF#8827
Already answering that they are used condoms? I download wallet from OFFICIAL site at 23.04.19. And it generate me old address. So what i must do now? Lost 3 weeks mining?

[15-May-19 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
HUSH is a different project who has their own discord and support. You have issues with HUSH > HUSH3 migration. Why don't you use HUSH discord to get support rather than using bad language there?

[16-May-19 07:40 AM] SergeF#8827
Cause they are not answer. And bad words at same reason too.

I tried running `komodod &` from terminal, but it fails with an error related to Zcash
Error: Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
`/home/<home-dir>/.zcash-params`

[16-May-19 01:12 PM] krtk6160#3131
Do I need to install Zcash before I'll be able to run komodod?

[16-May-19 01:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
run 
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
That will download the params files ( a few gigs of data )

[16-May-19 01:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain @Cryptoon thanks for sending Hush users to the right place, much obliged 😃

[16-May-19 01:18 PM] krtk6160#3131
@CHMEX But there's no `zcutil` directory. The docs say I just need 2 files, `komodod` and `komodo-cli`

[16-May-19 01:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
hmm ok which docs?
you need it to run a local node
github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/zcutil/fetch-params.sh

Maybe download above chmod +x fetch-params.sh  and run it

[16-May-19 01:29 PM] krtk6160#3131
@CHMEX  https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/basic-instructions.html#installing-basic-komodo-software  These docs say no installation is required, just those two files.
Anyway, I'll try to download the script and run it.

@Bryan_Beus ^^ please add that devs/users need to download zcash params before they can use komodod if they prefer to download pre-built binaries.

@SHossain 

Happy to do so. 

Can you please show me where specifically the error in the docs is found, and give me a general idea of what needs to change?

For example, do we need to say that users should download the Zcash params separately? Or will the pre-built binaries invite the user to download the params, and they must click 'yes'? etc.

[16-May-19 04:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
looking through gcharang's issue now...

[16-May-19 04:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

So, as gcharang says, we just need to add something along these lines, correct?

"Download and run the script: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/zcutil/fetch-params.sh"

[16-May-19 04:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can rephrase.

[16-May-19 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can do that. we are also planning to put these scripts in the pre-compiled binary zip in the future

[16-May-19 07:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay. 

I will do it now. Please let me know when we should delete it.

[16-May-19 07:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

How would a Windows user execute this script?

[16-May-19 07:55 PM] SHossain#0007
windows zip already contains `fetch-params.bat` file

[16-May-19 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't think many blockchain developer will choose windows OS to start developing. but, it's already there

[16-May-19 07:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, thanks

[16-May-19 08:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain

I'm installing komodod on a vps, it's been a few hours and I'm not sure if it's close to done. If I interrupt my ssh connection for 20 minutes from my laptop while I commute home, will the installation on the vps be interrupted?

[16-May-19 10:51 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe interrupted. use `screen`. so you can detach the session

[16-May-19 10:51 PM] SHossain#0007
and re-attach when you are at home

[16-May-19 10:52 PM] wookie#7663
how do I do that? It's in the middle of installation

Apologies to bring this up. I'm just a fellow member of the Hush community.

@SergeF, I don't know how you can claim to download an old version of the Hush wallet on the 23/4/19. I made the suggestion to the Hush team to remove all links to all old Hush files on the 20th so as not to confuse those that are newbies. 

If you check the Hush github repository, the website had been updated almost straight away. 

You also failed to read the "News" page on the Myhush website that was very clear what was going to happen regarding Hush > Hush3 upgrade. This was posted months prior to the upgrade.

As for your claims that nothing was on the "main" page of the Hush website. Please scroll to the section on their website labelled "News" or click on the red "News" link at the top menu. 

Any mining that you did after the snapshot at block 500,000 was a failure on your part of doing your research and a failure of your own due diligence. 

It was clear that the Sapling upgrade will mean public Hush addresses will start with an R. 

If you somehow incorrectly downloaded an old version of the Hush swing wallet and generated a t1 address and mined to it using the old Hush blockchain after all the information provided, then that mistake was on your part unfortunately.

[17-May-19 09:49 AM] SergeF#8827
Yeah. HUSH is a SCAM HUSHITCON.

[17-May-19 09:54 AM] SergeF#8827
And i'm by they words is guilty that they give me they hushitcoin wallet from they official site

[17-May-19 09:55 AM] Pixelised#9067
They didn't give it to you. You downloaded the old version. Like I said before, there's a nice red link "News" at the top of the myhush page. 

Cheers,

Bye.

[17-May-19 09:58 AM] SergeF#8827

@SergeF This is not an appropriate place to be speaking the way you are.

[17-May-19 10:02 AM] SergeF#8827
From 18$ to 0.08$. Best choice!

[17-May-19 10:04 AM] SergeF#8827
I'm sorry dudes. But they angered me so much!

[17-May-19 10:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
I did not read the whole conversation but if you bought at 18 and stored it on a address you have the seed to then they are on the new chain

[17-May-19 10:07 AM] Pixelised#9067
Mined to a public t1 address for three weeks, after the snapshot at 500,000.

[17-May-19 10:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
which pool is still running old HUSH?

[17-May-19 10:08 AM] SergeF#8827
I don't buy this shitcoin. Read my messages higher. 18 to 0.08 is a marker of coin quality

[17-May-19 10:09 AM] Pixelised#9067
See https://miningpoolstats.stream/hush

I personally have tried to contact a couple of pools listed here.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator at what here pool? I download fake wallet from they official site. Do you reat that i wrote higher?

[17-May-19 10:10 AM] SergeF#8827
If i download normal wallet i can't mine to wrong address.

[17-May-19 10:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you mine on updated pool, cant mine to wrong address either. I'd like to try and make sure the pools not updated dont let other people make the same mistake

[17-May-19 10:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Hush wallet issues need to be dealt with in HUSH discord or #hush

[17-May-19 10:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but realisitcally, if you were mining a depracted fork vs mining the updated chain, your block reward count would be significantly lower because deprecated chain would have minimal hashrate

[17-May-19 10:15 AM] SergeF#8827
Did you read that i wrote?

Is there a proper way to close the `komodod` daemon? Everytime I close it by pressing Ctrl+C /Ctrl+Z/typing exit etc I can't restart it. It fails saying a lock over the `.komodo` directory cannot be acquired.
After that if I delete the .lock file, it fails with a different error.
I have to delete the entire `.komodo` directory, and that causes me to re-download the entirety of the chain again.

[17-May-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
for KMD `./komodo-cli stop`

[17-May-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
for assetchains `./komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN stop`

[17-May-19 11:10 AM] krtk6160#3131
Okay, thanks

[17-May-19 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
if you don't close `komodod` properly, it will corrupt database. then, you either need to reindex or resync

[17-May-19 11:14 AM] krtk6160#3131
also, is there no way to test an assetchain on a single node (something like ganache for ethereum). I know the docs say we need 2 nodes, but was wondering if there's still a way

[17-May-19 11:20 AM] SHossain#0007
`-testnode=1` will allow you to run a network with a single node for testing.

[17-May-19 11:25 AM] krtk6160#3131
Okay I'll try that, thanks
