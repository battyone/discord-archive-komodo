@Bryan_Beus which version of Agama and on which platform are you using?

[22-Sep-18 04:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ubuntu 17.10 
Agama 0.2.41d, I believe (the update before block 1M)

[22-Sep-18 04:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Now I'm getting that "dashboard update" error again within Agama.

[22-Sep-18 04:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it a Native or SPV mode?

[22-Sep-18 04:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
native

[22-Sep-18 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Don't have Ubuntu with gui atm to check :/ Have to download some image 
41 is obsolete so it might be a good idea to wait for stable 42 release and check if problem is actual on it to not hunt on ghosts

[22-Sep-18 05:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sure. 

I've had this dashboard error now for months.

I usually just use CLI now, but I needed Agama to connect to some existing asset chains for me...

[22-Sep-18 05:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The error I keep getting is "getDashboardUpdate"

[22-Sep-18 05:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Any time I make a call for `getchaintips` on an asset chain, the chain crashes soon thereafter.

[22-Sep-18 05:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Just tried on my fresh chain:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 getchaintips
[
  {
    "height": 41,
    "hash": "06eb69667409cf69a9e9227fc02205a2ae9633cb4e5b041eb8fb80d391f769c0",
    "branchlen": 0,
    "status": "active"
  }
]
```

[22-Sep-18 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus if you need native mode solely for testing, it is better to download the compiled binary of Komodo or compile Komodo locally from source. 
for Agama, re-check if you have these packages installed `sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4libcurl3` or not?

On telegram an user asked, whether dapps are possible. Blockchain companies can get their own chains, but if they like create a dapps platform, is it possible? Make it sense?

[24-Sep-18 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
@Seko Sure, crypto-conditions opens a lot of possibilities for dAPPS building: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/all_chapters.md#chapter-15---rpc-based-dapps
It's possible to build dAPP on existing CCs or create very own CC smart-contract and build dAPP on it

@gef Hi! Seems you are out of sync for MGNX chain by some reason. 
What is the full output of getinfo - do you have a `connections` ?

[24-Sep-18 08:17 AM] TonyL#3577
You can try: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX stop``` and start MGNX chain again to check if it syncing

Hmm @gef , try this:
1) save your MGNX privatekey by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX dumpprivkey`
2) `stop` MGNX daemon again. 
3) Remove MGNX folder `rm -rf ~/.komodo/MGNX`
4) Run MGNX daemon and try to sync chain fully
5) Import your privatekey by `importprivkey`

[24-Sep-18 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
@gef also please backup wallet.dat from ~/.komodo/MGNX forlder

[24-Sep-18 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you have any MGNX coins? If yes you have to use it like a: `dumprivkey "walletaddressonwhichyouhavecoins"`

[24-Sep-18 08:40 AM] gef#9796

Hi - I am noticing in Agama, using Lite for EQL that my balance is not reflecting transactions that are on the block explorer and balance is incorrect. Seems nothing showing after Sep 14th - any ideas?

[24-Sep-18 10:19 AM] miles#6381
other coins on the same seed working fine

[24-Sep-18 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @miles ! 

Please ensure that you have a latest Agama wallet version installed and try again.

You have to download and install the latest version for your platform here: https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ 

Before re-installation please be sure that you made a backup of wallet access info:
- Save your seed/passphrase in a safe place If you're using SPV/Lite mode
- Backup your wallet.dat file if you're using Native mode (location of wallet.dat on different platforms: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024435-location-of-wallet-dat-file)

thanks Tony - I am running v 0.2.41d - i thought this was the latest

[24-Sep-18 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, yes it's the latest release atm

[24-Sep-18 10:23 AM] miles#6381
could it be their spv servers?

[24-Sep-18 10:23 AM] miles#6381
or their spv - as there are two in the list in settings, but only one is working it seems

[24-Sep-18 10:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, according to information which I have EQL have problems with their Electrum servers

[24-Sep-18 10:27 AM] miles#6381
ok - shall i just hang tight whilst they fix? assume they are working to fix?

[24-Sep-18 10:27 AM] miles#6381
or is there anyway i can access that address in native mode?

[24-Sep-18 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@miles  I don't have such info at the moment. I think it best idea to contact EQL team directly on this matter.
You can access your address in native mode: for this at first get your WIF Key in lite mode in `Settings -> Export keys`
Then open EQL in native mode, sync chain and in `Settings -> CLI` execute `importprivkey <yourwifkey>`

[24-Sep-18 11:00 AM] miles#6381
Hi @Tony - thanks - i have reached out to them for an update. In the meantime I have accessed via Native - but the balance is not the whole that is showing on the block - just transactions since 9th Sep - all very strange

[24-Sep-18 12:34 PM] jasonabis#8549
Hi, MGNX shows up in 0.2.42a, not  0.2.42b.

[24-Sep-18 01:00 PM] Nabob#5004
@miles  please compare your blocks with explorer blocks to check you are correct height
spv seems not working atm

[24-Sep-18 01:04 PM] miles#6381
hi @Nabob - can you help me as to how i check that?

[24-Sep-18 01:04 PM] miles#6381
run Agama EQL in native?

[24-Sep-18 01:07 PM] miles#6381
if i looks at Agama EQL Native vs EQL Block Explorer - the transactions match from now back to 9th Sep - then there is nothing in my Agama transaction history before that but block explorer goes back to July 31st

[24-Sep-18 01:08 PM] miles#6381
does that mean my local block is incorrect? I though native would have everything once it was 100% synced, which it is

[24-Sep-18 01:09 PM] miles#6381
looking in Agama in info tab - block heigh is one behind the EQL explorer

[24-Sep-18 01:09 PM] miles#6381

[24-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Nabob#5004
type getinfo if you are aware of cli or on agama dasboard you can see blocks count

[24-Sep-18 01:10 PM] miles#6381
got it - i am GUI person 😃 Agama info panel for me

[24-Sep-18 01:11 PM] miles#6381
blocks match at 141690

[24-Sep-18 01:12 PM] Nabob#5004
ok you are good

[24-Sep-18 01:12 PM] miles#6381
but why is balance different in native mode to what is in block explorer for same address?

[24-Sep-18 01:12 PM] miles#6381
my local block is missing a load of transactions from July to Sep 9th

[24-Sep-18 01:13 PM] miles#6381

I'm trying to install the latest agama on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS. I'm using Ubuntu in live mode. By following the install instructions from the website, I am unable to get the agama Linux installer to work.  From the step by step guide,
the instructions about the dependencies specifically libconf-2-4libcurl3 doesn't work. 

Portable version works fine
Installer version won't load, specifically the sudo command  returns a no such file or directory error.
