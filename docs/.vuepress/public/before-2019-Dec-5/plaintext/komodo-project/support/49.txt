Is Hush handling support for BarterDEX now?

[29-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Hermes#6934
You mean if they are running a BOB for Barterdex?

[29-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Hermes#6934
I see some orders in Barterdex

[29-Oct-18 09:59 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I still can't see the small amount of Denarius I sent to the DEX for my new wallet, it is not a huge amount, but it concerns me.  I have raised this issue before, my MonaCoin I can see fine, I don't see my DNR balance with either Barter DEX or Hyper DEX.

[29-Oct-18 09:59 PM] Hermes#6934
Using the latest versions ?

[29-Oct-18 10:00 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I believe so, downloaded the installer.exe like 3 days ago.

[29-Oct-18 10:00 PM] agnewpickens#7393
For Agama, just downloaded latest Barter DEX and Hyper DEX as well.

[29-Oct-18 10:02 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Denarius says empty wallet, I can go to Cryptopia and dig up one of the deposits of DNR from there.  It was only like 4 or 5 DNR, was a test deposit.

[29-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Hermes#6934
Strange ...I am seeing my Denarius balance in Hyperdex

[29-Oct-18 10:06 PM] Hermes#6934
you are using Windows right?

[29-Oct-18 10:07 PM] Hermes#6934
Have you checked the address in the explorer?

[29-Oct-18 10:07 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Win 7 Pro, it is strange, I'm the one who has the two wallet issue, one of your devs helped me, this tx goes back to April of this year:

3a907ef872bc3859de130dc3f5e1aea47fd7bbe177b370de0e309bf702184872

[29-Oct-18 10:08 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Withdrawan from Cryptopia.  My original wallet, done with a Waves seed in Mar/Apr 2017 shows my DNR balance, but this newer wallet won't

[29-Oct-18 10:09 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Shows completed here.

[29-Oct-18 10:10 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I forget where I sent the 2nd deposit from, was another small one since the first one never showed.

[29-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you seeing the same address in the explorer as the one in your Hyperdex Portfolio or Barterdex smart address ? I ask this because a Waves seed is different than the Iguana based seed that is used in Agama and in the DEX

[29-Oct-18 10:16 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Nope, the address doesn't match, hmm, maybe I pulled the wrong TX, let me go back thru my Cryptopia withdrawals again.

[29-Oct-18 10:18 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Ugh, looks like I sent it to wrong address, wow, sorry about that, must have grabbed the wrong coin address off Cryptopia, going to try a small deposit now.

[29-Oct-18 10:18 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Damn DGB address looks almost identical to DNR.

[29-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Hermes#6934
no worries let us know if you need any more help

[29-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Hermes#6934
I will use Hyperdex is quicker and more user friendly

[29-Oct-18 10:20 PM] agnewpickens#7393
You guys are great, my Mona is back, was more worried about that, will see how my DNR deposit goes, but this was my user error, glad it was only a small tx.

Hello, I have still have an old wallet 02.31 and I want to update it to the latest. Can I just install the latest wallet version without losing my funds?

[30-Oct-18 04:28 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes you can.... by updating the wallet there is no risk of loosing your funds.

[30-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Hermes#6934
Please update to the latest version of the website https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/

[30-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Canon#7690
@Hermes Thank you

[30-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Canon#7690
@Hermes Can KMD still be mined? And what is the best software to do it with?

[30-Oct-18 08:17 PM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, this time I did send DNR to the right address, the blockchain explorer saying that the DNR is not yet redeemed, is this something wrong on DNR's side or with my tx?  Here is the link:

https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dnr/tx.dws?5d1170c99036ee3093804f0edd4e7249693b34133cfe849084179a5200dd6b9b.htm

[30-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Hermes#6934
I am testing a transfer right now a tx to Hyperdex wallet

[30-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Hermes#6934
I am having a similar issue but still I will wait for a while and see if the balance gets updated @agnewpickens

[30-Oct-18 08:47 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I sent that TX last night after I last posted here, been stuck for a while.  Will go ahead and report to DNR chat as well.

[31-Oct-18 07:24 AM] lhedwin#7568
Hi. I updated my BarterDEX app and now i get and error with LTZ.

[31-Oct-18 01:19 PM] kriptek#7720
Hi. I'm having a terrible time loading any of the coins on the Agama wallet in Native mode. SPV is fine. Cannot get the komodod to run! I've uninstalled/installed, cleared files, checked firewall, downloaded bootstrap for #ARRR, reindexing, gen, background process, default...nothing. I get a cannot connection to server error most instances.

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I was turning someone onto Pirate and through onboarding they began a transaction with 108.7 instead of 107.8 KMD. Are those coins lost forever?

[31-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Hermes#6934
The correct amount is 108.78

[31-Oct-18 05:21 PM] Hermes#6934
did you missed the last 8?

[31-Oct-18 05:35 PM] Hermes#6934
@KSanJuan

[31-Oct-18 05:47 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I’m checking with him.

[31-Oct-18 06:46 PM] KSanJuan#9608
Either way, his question is, Is it gone? He wasn’t in front of a computer and was reciting the question from memory.  If it is retrievable, what is needed to accomplish that?

[31-Oct-18 06:51 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Hyper DEX just crashed on last two attempts to launch, I am on a Win 7 Pro.

[31-Oct-18 06:52 PM] Hermes#6934
I have not used the onboarding page to buy ARRR that webpage is handled by CHMEX still has he confirmed he ddn't got any ARRR from the transaction he made?

[31-Oct-18 06:54 PM] KSanJuan#9608
This was 2 days ago... I told him that I thought it would just bounce back as a rejected transaction, but apparently I’m wrong.

[31-Oct-18 06:54 PM] Hermes#6934
@agnewpickens do you have the exact error or it only shuts down? Also make sure that the market maker process is launching in the task manager...maybe the AV or Firewall could be blocking it's launching

[31-Oct-18 06:55 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Failure to connect marketmaker

[31-Oct-18 06:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Haven't seen this error , could you verify if it's being blocked by the AV or Firewall in your PC?

[31-Oct-18 06:57 PM] Hermes#6934
@KSanJuan  I will check on this , if he can please tell him to send me the tx id

[31-Oct-18 06:57 PM] KSanJuan#9608
Getting it now.

[31-Oct-18 06:59 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Where did my message go, Hyper DEX launched fine yesterday, I use MSE for my AV, so nothing should be blocking it from there, Win 7 Pro.  It keeps trying to relaunch and gives me the could not connect to marketmaker error.

[31-Oct-18 07:00 PM] agnewpickens#7393
DMed you a screen snip of my error @Hermes

[31-Oct-18 07:01 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Also get a flag that the DNR Electrum server is down, probably why my DNR hasn't shown up.

[31-Oct-18 07:01 PM] Hermes#6934
have you tried restarting the PC? I have seen this error when you get low connection speed or some type of issue with the ISP

[31-Oct-18 07:02 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Let me try that.

[31-Oct-18 07:02 PM] Hermes#6934
DNR servers were taken down yesterday

[31-Oct-18 07:02 PM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, let me try to restart the computer and see if error persists.

[31-Oct-18 07:21 PM] agnewpickens#7393
That fixed the problem, any word on when DNR Electrum servers will be back up, or should I ask that in their chat?

[31-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Hermes#6934
The dev team took a decision based in the issues that users have been experiencing with DNR

[31-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Hermes#6934
We are dropping support of Denarius (DNR) in Agama wallet and BarterDEX due to their electrum (SPV) servers are outdated most of the time which doesn't allow users to use DNR in Agama and BarterDEX properly. Anyone using DNR please contact the DNR team for any further support on that coin.

[31-Oct-18 07:28 PM] agnewpickens#7393
How do I withdraw my DNR from the other wallet that did work fine?

[31-Oct-18 07:28 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I have like 37 DNR there.

[31-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Hermes#6934

Here is a quick guide on how to get your private keys.

[31-Oct-18 07:34 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Thx, will bookmark that and try it later, need a nap, old man syndrome.

[31-Oct-18 07:49 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Do I only get the one WIF key for all my coins?

[31-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Hermes#6934
No , for each set of coins you have a WIF, for Komodo Assetchains it remains the same because they use the same public address but for other non KMD based assets you need to extract them separately

[31-Oct-18 08:20 PM] lhedwin#7568
is  BarterDEX having problems all cryptos locks like this: undefined(LTZ)?

[31-Oct-18 08:27 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you using the latest version ?  https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/releases @lhedwin

If you see the coins as undefined I will recommend doing a fresh launch of the app.

[31-Oct-18 08:29 PM] Hermes#6934
If that still doesn't help I will recommend going to the userdata in %appdata%Barterdex and erase the coins.json file and restarting the app

[31-Oct-18 08:29 PM] lhedwin#7568
@Hermes Ok, thank you, i'll try that.

[31-Oct-18 10:29 PM] _lua#5803
Hi guys, sorry if the question has already been asked, I am not able to claim interest in SPV mode with the latest version of Agama. When I try to claim it stay stuck on "Verfying transaction data..." (Locktime is set and I have more than 10 KMD to claim). Does anyone has an idea about this?

[31-Oct-18 10:32 PM] Hermes#6934
Is this happening with version 0.2.43d ?

[31-Oct-18 10:32 PM] Hermes#6934
Try sending your balance to your same public address

[31-Oct-18 10:33 PM] _lua#5803
Yes, I just noticed after a while I have an error : "cant get the current height"

[31-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Hermes#6934
you are using SPV mode right?

[31-Oct-18 10:35 PM] _lua#5803
yes

[31-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Hermes#6934
Try changing the server as showed in this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024494-how-to-change-spv-server-to-another-in-agama-lite-wallet/en

[31-Oct-18 10:41 PM] _lua#5803
hmm I get "server unreachable" when changing the server, and now both servers seems unavailable, I don't see my balance anymore.

[31-Oct-18 10:42 PM] _lua#5803
ok it's back online, but same behavior :/

[31-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Hermes#6934
it could be related with ISP issue

[31-Oct-18 10:44 PM] _lua#5803
did the electrum servers changed with the new Agama version? It worked perfectly two months ago with the oldest Agama version so that's weird.

[31-Oct-18 10:45 PM] Hermes#6934
haven't seen this error with version 2.43d

[31-Oct-18 10:46 PM] Hermes#6934
still you can import your private key into native and try claiming from that version of the wallet as showed in this guide  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024488-import-private-key-in-agama-native-mode/en

[31-Oct-18 10:47 PM] Hermes#6934
I have claimed recently and haven't seen this ...the strange thing is that when switched servers it threw that error ...could it be any change in your network?

[31-Oct-18 10:48 PM] _lua#5803
If I want to sent KMD I have issues too :/ It might be related to the electrum server, or my network but I am on the same computer and network as usual so that's weird. 
I will retry tomorrow and if it still not work I'll try in native mode. Thank you for your help @Hermes 🙂
