is all that is required is to install and run agama wallet 0.2.43d-beta for windows for the upcoming hard fork or will there be a new win wallet released to install before dec 15th?

[03-Dec-18 06:09 PM] Nabob#5004
Yes, There will be upcoming Agama release  this week. stay tuned.

[04-Dec-18 01:55 AM] AdaMiner#4212
I'm using the hte agama winsows wallet. I want to transfer my wallet from one PC to another. How would I go about that making the transfer and keeping my address?

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Hermes#6934
I will recommend backing up your wallet.dat file , do this once your wallet is shut down...you can save it in a usb or encrypted folder inside this device. Once you are in the new computer you can locate this same wallet.dat file inside the userdata directory ... this is also explained here https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000025198-how-to-backup-restore-komodo-or-assetchain-wallet-dat/en

[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Hermes#6934
If you have more assetchains aside from Komodo you should also back up the wallet.dat files for those assets as well.

[04-Dec-18 02:18 AM] AdaMiner#4212
@Hermes Thank you

[04-Dec-18 02:19 AM] Hermes#6934
ok let me know if you need any other help with the guide....also is recommended to save the private keys of the addresses that hold your funds just in case...

[04-Dec-18 04:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've been getting this error for about a week now while trying to manually install Komodo.

```
checking whether bswap_32 is declared... yes
checking whether bswap_64 is declared... yes
checking for MSG_NOSIGNAL... yes
checking for visibility attribute... yes
checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... no
configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)
Makefile:556: recipe for target 'config.status' failed
make: *** [config.status] Error 1
```

I've repeatedly done `git clean -f` and repeatedly run the `./zcutil/build.sh` file, and I've also done the `sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgtest-dev libqt4-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate vim software-properties-common curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake clang` command to make sure I have all libraries installed.

No luck, yet. 

The daemon was working fine before attempting to update.

Hello, I'm currently using Agama OSX wallet. I recently downloaded the most recent one (0.2.43d) and transferred a wallet.dat backup from my USB to the appropriate filepath. However, it's been taking forever to synchronize (balance is zero, Komodo daemon is finding the "best chain"). Am I doing something wrong? How long does this take to synchronize fully?

[04-Dec-18 04:33 AM] Hermes#6934
@habship  This depends mainly in the resources of the machine , has it already loaded some blocks or it is still loading the best chain ? How long has it been since the daemon started?

[04-Dec-18 04:33 AM] habship#2279
I restarted the wallet, but before it was on for almost 24 hrs. When I quit it was cycling through various blocks

[04-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Hermes#6934
cycling through various blocks...that means it had already loaded some blocks...so it got stucked and it went back to activate the best chain?

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] Hermes#6934
if you left the daemon open for 24 hours it should have already loaded the full chain ...unless you had an ISP issue ...while it was running .

[04-Dec-18 04:35 AM] habship#2279
I think so, unfortunately I don't remember exactly what the message was since I quit. Right now the wallet is saying "Komodod is down!"

[04-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Hermes#6934
that seems to be a corrupted data issue...when you close down Agama make sure you close it in the correct way  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024522-how-to-shut-down-agama-native-mode-to-avoid-corrupted-data/en

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] habship#2279
Okay, I will try that, thanks!

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] Hermes#6934
You could try doing a reindex of the blocks  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024520-reindex-komodo-blockchain-with-agama/en to see if that helps...if not you will need to do a resync from scratch  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024513-agama-windows-guide-how-to-resync-from-scratch/en as showed in this guide.

[04-Dec-18 04:38 AM] habship#2279
resyncing from scratch will not erase my wallet right?

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Hermes#6934
no...you will only in that erase the blocks and the chainstate files...the wallet.dat file doesn't need to be touched.

[04-Dec-18 04:39 AM] Hermes#6934
@Bryan_Beus  that's a little strange...so you haven't been able to upgrade to the new version

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no

[04-Dec-18 04:40 AM] Hermes#6934
you seem to have downloaded the correct dependencies..and  you are using the dev branch right?

[04-Dec-18 04:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
correct

[04-Dec-18 04:56 AM] Hermes#6934
the error appears when you try to execute  ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)?

[04-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Hermes#6934
trying to see what could be the issue here....you have already tried erasing everything and doing a fresh installation basically...

[04-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Hermes#6934
it seems this can be the issue : checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... no

[04-Dec-18 05:22 AM] habship#2279
Hi Hermes, I attempted to resync (deleted all coin data) but the error message ‚ÄúKomodod is down‚Äù still appears.

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Hermes#6934
Can you check if komodod is being blocked by any AV or Firewall ?

[04-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Hermes#6934
Try to see it  in the Activity Monitor

[04-Dec-18 05:38 AM] habship#2279
What am I looking for in the activity monitor?

[04-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Hermes#6934
the process komodod...should launch when you launch the native mode of the wallet.

[04-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Hermes#6934
if that process is not running it means it could be blocked by another program.

[04-Dec-18 05:43 AM] habship#2279
Okay I don‚Äôt see it on the activity monitor

[04-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Hermes#6934
after launching native mode right?

[04-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Hermes#6934
if that's correct then something could be blocking komodod from starting .

[04-Dec-18 05:49 AM] habship#2279
Yes, I‚Äôm going to see if anything is blocking it. It may take awhile so I‚Äôll have to follow up tomorrow. I appreciate all your help though!

[04-Dec-18 05:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes 
The error happens even if I do `make clean`.

It happens also when I do `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`

[04-Dec-18 06:12 AM] habship#2279
Blocks are downloading! Had to reinstall Agama

[04-Dec-18 06:15 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus which OS are you using?

[04-Dec-18 06:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ubuntu 17.10

[04-Dec-18 06:16 AM] gcharang#6833
That might be a problem. All our linux testing is done in 16.04 and some in 18.04. Also 17.10 is deprecated

[04-Dec-18 06:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm...

[04-Dec-18 06:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Apparently, for my distro that requires a full USB reinstall. Will have to look into that another time. Usually, updates that large cause lots of issues at first.

[04-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Hermes#6934
Hmmm didn't knew that about 17.10 that could be the issue...yeah also VPS are running only 16.04 and 18.04

[04-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Hermes#6934
@habship  Alright let us know if you have any more questions you should be ok just remember how to close the wallet correctly while using native and you should be fine.

[04-Dec-18 01:09 PM] criptobear#6402
hello

[04-Dec-18 01:09 PM] criptobear#6402
i have a doubt about sapling upcoming upgrade

[04-Dec-18 01:12 PM] actionslacks#4072
are you feeling bearish about it üòÄ

[04-Dec-18 01:15 PM] criptobear#6402
unfortunately it's all the market to feel bearish i feel just you know poorer for now at least! i have agama lite with KMDs and pirate  is native so i should export the wallet of pirate and import after i upgrade to new agama?

[04-Dec-18 01:15 PM] criptobear#6402
with sapling implemented will be possible immediately to have pirate in lite mode?

[04-Dec-18 01:17 PM] criptobear#6402
i read about a guy who lost thousands of kmd because of formatting pc while he did not notice that native wallet sends the rewards to a new wallet so puff he lost all and i would not really do the same.

[04-Dec-18 01:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
if you collect the rewards for kmd in lite mode it goes to the same address. pirate has no lite mode afaik

[04-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Nabob#5004
@criptobear i have discussed with him, he doesn't know difference between native and lite mode, he keeps on playing with his funds without proper backup.

[04-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Nabob#5004
funds are safe in wallet, and you need to know good practices how to safe guard wallets

[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Nabob#5004
we have chain of testers in komodo, we are taking proper care before we release build.

simple funda, if you have private key/ seed you are safe in wallet, not in komodo any btc compatible coins it applies üòä

[04-Dec-18 01:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
@criptobear write your seed phrase down with a pen on a piece of paper. practice logging out of and into your wallet with that phrase. if you make one typo it will generate a completely different address and may freak you out a little. but that phrase will give you access to your funds even if you lose wallet.dat, computer, nuclear bomb, whatever. you can always rely on the phrase.

[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Nabob#5004
if you not know, Agama wallet provided us four different ways to safa guard wallet and ppl still overlook those life saving features.

1 ) Seed
2 ) password pin using encrypt seed
3 ) private key
4 ) Qr code of private key for your address

[04-Dec-18 02:07 PM] Ilyas_617#1439
Hi! I would like to know if my KMD coins remained on the Binans exchange, then after December 15 they will not be reset?

[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] SHossain#0007
they will not reset.

[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] SHossain#0007
it is ok to leave them there

[04-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Ilyas_617#1439
ok, thanks, and in other exchanges, for example, in Polonix everything will be all right too?

[04-Dec-18 02:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[04-Dec-18 02:19 PM] SHossain#0007
but, poloniex doesn't have KMD listed

[04-Dec-18 02:19 PM] SHossain#0007
so, it is other exchanges

[04-Dec-18 03:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
is there a way to fix having only 1 connection with Agama instead of 8 ? version 0.2.43d on Windows

[04-Dec-18 03:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's not happening to me, it's a guy in the italian channel

[04-Dec-18 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
remove `maxconnections=1` line from komodo.conf file and restart the wallet
komodo.conf file is located in `%appdata%/komodo/` directory

[04-Dec-18 03:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok thanks!

[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Nabob#5004
recommended way, is to keep `maxconnections=1`  only on windows untill wallet is fully in sync, after restart it will automatically rests to default

[04-Dec-18 04:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
he says synching was 8% in two days and he has fiber connection

[04-Dec-18 04:13 PM] Nabob#5004
if you remove that setting it would be high on bandwidth usage, this is known windblows issue somehow acts weird. May i know about his system resources?

[04-Dec-18 04:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I asked, he says it seems to work much better now

[04-Dec-18 04:16 PM] Nabob#5004
alternative way to overcome this scenario,  is Bootstrap way

yes, its normal. ssd disk performance is better than hdd

[04-Dec-18 08:34 PM] criptobear#6402

[05-Dec-18 04:20 AM] habship#2279
Hello, I am a little confused about the Komodo rewards. When do rewards stop accruing? I‚Äôve been told that rewards are address specific. So if a single address generates the 5% return in a year, does this mean you need to send the balance to a different address to continue a accruing the 5% interest?

[05-Dec-18 04:33 AM] Hermes#6934
You need to claim your reward once a month , if not the accruing will be capped until you claim again, you can claim the reward with the same address. The reward mechanism works with the spending of a UTXO . If the UTXO meets the requirements the reward can be claimed. The claim button is just a shortcut to making a transaction to your same public address. And also when the UTXO meets the requirements you can claim it by sending your chosen balance to an address of your choosing. @habship

[05-Dec-18 04:34 AM] Hermes#6934
Here is a guide on how they workhttps://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000025304-how-rewards-work-dev-notes-/en

[05-Dec-18 04:35 AM] habship#2279
I see, so as long as I claim the rewards once a month I can collect them indefinitely without making any additional transactions?

[05-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Hermes#6934
You don't need to make any additional transaction just use the claim reward button.

[05-Dec-18 04:36 AM] habship#2279
Thanks!

@SHossain ```"code": -4,
"message": "Change 0.32 not allowed. When protecting coinbase funds, the wallet does not allow any change as there is currently no way to specify a change address in z_sendmany."```

[05-Dec-18 01:44 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the exact command you are using?

[05-Dec-18 01:47 PM] SHossain#0007
use 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_shieldcoinbase "*" zcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
change `zcxxxx` with your a addr and PIRATE with any coin you are using.
