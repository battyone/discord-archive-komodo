How  long will it take to receive my kmd after claiming it?

[09-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Malong010#8939
I am talking about the funds sweeped from agama on june 5th

[09-Jun-19 08:21 AM] farl#9964
Below 7777 KMD they expect around 15 june

[09-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Hansie#5439
Sorry for maybe asking a dumb question, but when typing in my seed in the Agma Verus v0.5.7 on MacOS, the last character is not accepted. I cannot use the wallet to send a small transaction to my new address. Is there any solution to this?

[09-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Hansie#5439
Or can I use the sweep function to send kmd from my old wallet to my new one?

[09-Jun-19 11:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Try typing seed in notepad and copying it over

[09-Jun-19 11:18 AM] Hansie#5439
Thanks, I tried that but it did not work. I just fixed the problem by downloading the v0.6.0-13 version

[09-Jun-19 11:49 AM] almasya#0676
Great job! Return KMD received! Support answered instantly, thanks. With you, I first used the discord.))

[09-Jun-19 11:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Great to hear @almasya Glad we could help!

[09-Jun-19 12:02 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
Guys , I logged a support ticket yesterday via the Komodo website. I did not receive a reference number or anything like that. What is the General response time and how do you follow up on the support request?

[09-Jun-19 12:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@DigitalPunk  was your support request in regards to the incident or for another issue?

[09-Jun-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
@DigitalPunk we have your ticket. since you botched up your natural refund process, you have to wait a bit until we finish up with normal refunds. don't worry. please just be patient.

[09-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Fabio Ferreira#9032
Wanna say thanks to the BEST TEAM in the Crypto Space , all coins are back...HODLL KOMODO !!

@SHossain been having issues trying to move my last bit of ETH from KMD Agama to Verus Agama address. Any idea of known issues ?

[09-Jun-19 12:18 PM] SHossain#0007
i used Verus Agama to move my ETH

[09-Jun-19 12:19 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
Ok I‚Äôm trying to send it there from my compromised Agama wallet  but the transaction hangs and then fails. No TX is provided...

[09-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Malong010#8939
Where do i have to enter my old private key? It was not required until now?

[09-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Malong010#8939
So I sent discord ID, adress (old and new from verus agama, and amount) what are the next steps?

[09-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done.

[09-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So once you see a small tx come in on your old address, use that small amount and send it to your new address so you can prove you owned the old wallet and want it to go to the new wallet.

@SHossain Error API.apiEthereumsend is the error message  I get when trying to send ETH from compromised Agama to Verus Agama address . Any suggestions ?

[09-Jun-19 01:19 PM] SHossain#0007
which exact version of Agama you are using?

[09-Jun-19 01:19 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
v0.3.6b

[09-Jun-19 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure why. but, you can extract ETH privkey from your seed and use any ETH wallet https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029942-get-an-ethereum-private-key-from-agama-

[09-Jun-19 01:28 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
@SHossain so to confirm I extract the ETH privkey for my os and would then be able to use any ETH address to send my ETH to new Verus address?

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
send ETH to your own secure ETH address

[09-Jun-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
wherever that might be

[09-Jun-19 01:30 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
@SHossain üëçThanks again

[09-Jun-19 01:40 PM] kp#3190
if i want to change my receive address for my KMD claim (my own addr instead of binance deposit), can i just fill in the form again?

[09-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, @kp just fill the form again

[09-Jun-19 01:43 PM] kp#3190

if you already submitted a claim and you got verification tx sent out to your original address, submitting another claim with new refund address will not fix that instantly. you will have to wait.

[09-Jun-19 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007
when you want to change your refund address, your claim will be disputed for further verification and will be processed at the end of all normal refund

Will do!

[09-Jun-19 02:02 PM] kp#3190
@SHossain the thing is, i entered my binance deposit address as refund address (i was early using the old form). now binance has closed deposits, so i cant even send the 0.0001 to that refund address to prove it. is there anything else i can do to get my kmd earlier than after everyone else?

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Pwnz#4150
Think everyone wants it earlier than everyone

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007
you can send to that Binance address, it will be visible to explorer. once verified, rest of the funds will go there. when binance resumes operation, you can get your funds back

[09-Jun-19 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007
@kp ^^

[09-Jun-19 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
or, if you don't do that, it may take longer for you to get back funds if you resubmit claim with different address

[09-Jun-19 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
the choice is yours

[09-Jun-19 02:05 PM] kp#3190
i will have to wait until binance opens up deposits

[09-Jun-19 02:05 PM] kp#3190
as i dont have the deposit address, since its currently suspended

[09-Jun-19 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
did you not put a refund address already?

[09-Jun-19 02:06 PM] kp#3190
i did, but can i see the form?

[09-Jun-19 02:06 PM] kp#3190
i thought its not accessible for me now?

[09-Jun-19 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
was it a binance address?

[09-Jun-19 02:06 PM] kp#3190
yeah

[09-Jun-19 02:06 PM] kp#3190
and now deposits are suspended so i cant see the address üòÉ

In an earlier thread we were told to uninstall Amaga versions.  Now they are saying we need the transaction ID, private keys, etc and to receive a transaction.  Where are these transactions being sent if we already uninstalled the Agama?  How do we retrieve the private keys ifs it uninstalled?

[09-Jun-19 02:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@PD you can do it with Verus Agame, it's safe <https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview>

@SHossain   Prohashing can't pay in KMD because they claim that all the exchanges (Binance, Bittrex, and HitBTC) have the Komodocoin wallets locked.  Is that true?  Can you guys do anything to convince them to unlock them?

[09-Jun-19 03:05 PM] PD#1377
@PHBA2061  i went with the komodo ocean option.  I sent them my receiving address for that wallet.  But now they want address of wallets i don't have installed anymore.  Am i looking at this he wrong way?ü§™

[09-Jun-19 03:06 PM] spudboy999#5256
@PD   Use your compromized public key and associated WIF or seed in Verus wallet to send the confirmation amount to your new wallet

[09-Jun-19 03:07 PM] PD#1377
Ok that info i still have

The new address submitted had to be from a Verus Agama address? If it was a different wallet we don't get refund?

[09-Jun-19 03:10 PM] spudboy999#5256
@Duat_Yurtold   It can be from any wallet that isn't compromised.   You need to send the confirmation amount from your old public key to a new public key to get your safeguarded coins back

[09-Jun-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
it can be any KMD address

[09-Jun-19 03:11 PM] SHossain#0007

Also used my discord ID but haven't seen funds or been contacted about an error with my claim. Not sure if I did something wrong but noone has told me so

@Duat_Yurtold  from what I understand they have reimbursed about 20% of the claims so far

KMD first, assets will take longer as it is almost as much work as KMD for each assetchain
the number of addresses doesnt matter
what matters is if you did the proper steps and didnt submit conflicting data
i get daily claims data
i will process daily
not setup for assets yet

[09-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Yassin#3685
@jl777c you can check @WK ‚úå

[09-Jun-19 04:37 PM] WK#7119
Dust has not arrived but bitpanda must send at least 0.1 KMD. Is that my mistake? How do I get out of this situation?

[09-Jun-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if dust is still unspent 'U' in the explorer, send ALL funds from old address to new address

[09-Jun-19 04:46 PM] WK#7119
Dust I got to old address. Then I sent dust to the new address.  The new address is Bitpanda address. Nothing arrived. Explorer shows U. Does nothing mean arrived? I also have an address at Guarda. If I now make form for Guarda? Or better not?

[09-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what is your txid of the dust
