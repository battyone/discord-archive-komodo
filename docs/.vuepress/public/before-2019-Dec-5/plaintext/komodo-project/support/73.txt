hey there! just to confirm the sapling issue. I won't have to do anything if I use agama in lite mode with a "r" or "R" in my address?

[14-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Angelina#6231
That's right

[14-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Fischershans#2984
great, thx!

[14-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Angelina#6231
Only correction - the address should *start* with R

[14-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Fischershans#2984
right! thx again

Just want to double check - Coinomi has confirmed they have already updated and are ready for today?

[14-Feb-19 04:21 PM] Sothega#0494
Coins on binance ok or better to transfer to leder?

[14-Feb-19 05:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
it's always better to own the coins your paid for.
on a exchange anything can happen

[14-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The fork already happened back in december @CryptoFungus @Sothega

[14-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It just activates today

[14-Feb-19 05:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But as CHMEX says, it's better to have your coins in a wallet you own the private keys to instead of an exchange wallet (re. Binance wallet)

[14-Feb-19 05:41 PM] CryptoFungus#5816
Ah good @Cryptoon, Coinomi updated then. Always get a bit sweaty on update days

[14-Feb-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the update happened last Dec

[14-Feb-19 06:29 PM] Vince#7063
I received a message  "If your funds are in a z-address please move them to a transparent address". But how do I know what type of address I am using?

[14-Feb-19 06:29 PM] Angelina#6231
Which wallet do you use?

[14-Feb-19 06:31 PM] Vince#7063
I don't know exactly. I have a public address, is there a way to tell what type of address that is?

[14-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Vince#7063
I converted by KMD from BTCD. In that process I received a brainwallet private sentence that goes with a certain public address.

[14-Feb-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
public address starting with R is not z-address

[14-Feb-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
to have made a zaddress you would have had to go out of your way, maybe even using command line

[14-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if the address starts with a Z, its a Z address, if it starts with an R, its not

[14-Feb-19 06:38 PM] Vince#7063
My address starts with an R. So that is a public address. Thanks for the info! Regards, Vincent

Hi

[14-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Angelina#6231
Hello

[14-Feb-19 07:16 PM] jctomic#3970
Hello. My funds are in Agama wallet. Do I have to do anything?

[14-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Angelina#6231
If there funds are in the address starting with R, no need to do anything

[14-Feb-19 07:17 PM] jctomic#3970
I don‚Äôt have access now so I don‚Äôt know.

[14-Feb-19 07:18 PM] jctomic#3970
(Far away from my pc)

[14-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Angelina#6231
Do you remember which mode you generated it in - Lite or Native?

[14-Feb-19 07:18 PM] jctomic#3970
Lite

[14-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jctomic#3970
It‚Äôs ok. I can‚Äôt do anything anyway so... thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[14-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Angelina#6231
If Lite, then you're fine - no need to move the funds

[14-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jctomic#3970
Thanks!!!

[14-Feb-19 07:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ledger is fine

[14-Feb-19 07:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If your public address starts with an R then its a transparant adress

[14-Feb-19 07:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Z- adresses start with a z

[14-Feb-19 07:37 PM] Angelina#6231
if you have coins in Ledger Nano S, your coins are safe and fine.

[14-Feb-19 09:00 PM] veronica#2208

Binance and all the other exchanges does support only transparent adresses for KMD - so yes, all is fine

Was just trying to send some KMD out of my Ledger, but it wouldn't let me. Comes up with an Error. Does anyone know what might be going on?

[17-Feb-19 11:57 PM] PTYX#6840
The error shows up @mrdotboson on the ledger live but it's working

You'll notice the transaction just a few seconds after you press ok

Hello,
In Eth, you have one wallet which holds your private keys and it gives you full access to all the tokens. I mean that I don't have to create a new wallet for each "asset" hosted on Eth. The main drawback of that is that it's quite confusing.
With KMD, AFAIK, each new project means a new system priv/public key. In other world I have to create a new wallet (by "wallet" I mean "a set of public/private keys")  if I want to hold some pirate coins....and to create a new wallet if I want to hold some verus coins... and so and so

[18-Feb-19 08:54 PM] riseandfall#3726
The use of Ledger hardware wallet with agama wallet is so useful only for using Komodo....and we will have to wait for the moment there is a ledger app for pirate coin and a ledger app for versus coin...and so and so

[18-Feb-19 08:55 PM] riseandfall#3726
Am I right saying that ?

[18-Feb-19 08:57 PM] riseandfall#3726
Could someone confirm that even if I can well store my keys on a ledger and use Agama wallet, I unfortunately can't use ledger to store the keys for pirate coins for example.

[18-Feb-19 08:59 PM] riseandfall#3726
I would need for that to wait for a pirate coin ledger app

[18-Feb-19 09:03 PM] PTYX#6840
Magnum wallet supports chainzilla and Komodo with the same ledger keys

[18-Feb-19 09:03 PM] PTYX#6840
So same addresses

[18-Feb-19 09:03 PM] PTYX#6840
We can integrate more assets. We are working on the same with Chameleon

But they need SPV
