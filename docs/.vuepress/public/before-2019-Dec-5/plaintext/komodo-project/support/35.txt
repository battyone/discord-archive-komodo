[12-Sep-18 06:37 AM] SHossain#0007
Hey @kmdkrazy welcome back. what do you need help with? komodo or barterDEX?

[12-Sep-18 06:38 AM] SHossain#0007
you can check https://docs.komodoplatform.com for all the documentation

[12-Sep-18 02:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i need to tail komodod and run some wallet commands for Staked

[12-Sep-18 02:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
i forget where to start ./komodo  -tails ahhhhh?

[12-Sep-18 02:09 PM] TonyL#3577
@kmdkrazy Hi! Did you build daemon for Staked according to Github instructions (https://github.com/StakedChain/StakedNotary) ?

[12-Sep-18 02:11 PM] TonyL#3577
If you want to tail daemon logs you may use something like a 
`tail -f ~/.komodo/debug.log`

[12-Sep-18 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Or `tail -f ~/.komodo/%assetchainname%/debug.log` for a specific assetchain daemon

[12-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Nabob#5004
start komodod with daemon param, if you want to run daemon in bg, and can execute wallet commands

`komodod -daemon`

[12-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Hermes#6934
does the call has to be done with kmd-daemon or just with the Stake parameters with ACname=STAKE?...I remember it doing it with the using the cli getinfo using the AC name

[12-Sep-18 03:12 PM] TonyL#3577
In case of Staked assetchain usage there will be also parameter like a -ac_name=STAKED in komodod (Komodo daemon) start call

[13-Sep-18 03:04 AM] gt#2812

Ole Hastrup on Telegram asks: 
‚ÄûDo anyone know how involved komodo is in syscoin? I see they list supernet as a partner‚Äú

[13-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Seko#7408
on the official website below Supernet is listed as a partner and linked to Komodo.

[13-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Hermes#6934
Just saw it , we haven't released any official announcement on this , not that I have seen.

[13-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Hermes#6934
it could be better to ask on #komodo-team , but from my side I haven't heard of it and it's also not in our ecosystem nor it has an official channel on our discord

[13-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Seko#7408
Thx, I do it...

[13-Sep-18 08:27 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hi there, somebody with clues on why ondemand blocks might not generate on a chain wiht several nodes connected?

[13-Sep-18 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
New blocks will be created once there is any tx.

[13-Sep-18 08:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes the problem is im making some tx and no blocks appear...

[13-Sep-18 08:43 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however nodes appear synced

[13-Sep-18 08:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
on same block

[13-Sep-18 08:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
will try exporting privkey and doing from another node

[13-Sep-18 08:47 PM] SHossain#0007
which chain? is any node mining?

[13-Sep-18 08:53 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
should be, how to make sure?

[13-Sep-18 08:54 PM] SHossain#0007
you can check using `getmininginfo` call for the chain.

[13-Sep-18 08:55 PM] SHossain#0007
also, you can try mining with a local node to see if new blocks are being mined or not.

[13-Sep-18 08:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mm checking

[13-Sep-18 09:00 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right stupid me last time I re-started the node forgot the -gen "-"

[13-Sep-18 09:02 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

Hi People
I have setup a barterDEX instance following the instructions at github as best as possible, though there seems to be several different/similar sets intertwined. I have imported and exported assets and seeds, saved a local coins database, can find and trade into open orders, have broken coin piles of all assets using the inventory tool, even tried using Hyperdex. However every single order that i place fails or is cancelled when the computer sleeps (usually much longer than 4hours).
I have run all the code applicable to Win-64 from this page including installing the prerequisites.

Any thoughts on how to fix the trades?

[14-Sep-18 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @chilo ! 
What exactly do you mean by "sleeps" - is it a sleep mode or you turn off your PC?

[14-Sep-18 05:15 PM] JUR4J79#4798
Hi everyone, I've been using this KomodoWallet for macOS: https://github.com/SuperNETorg/komodoWallet

But now it cannot launch, it is stucked on the loading screen. For hours. I found the blogpost about mandatory komodo blockchain upgrade from Aug 27. I understand that this wallet was not updated for a year and that's why it cannot connect.

So I downloaded Agama wallet, setup a new KMD wallet. But, there is no option to import private key from my previous (mentioned) wallet. Yes, I've backed up my private keys.

How do I sweep my old wallet into Agama? What will happen to my interest that accumulated in the old wallet? When I check my address on KMD block explorer, there is only original amount without the interest.

[14-Sep-18 05:17 PM] SHossain#0007
@JUR4J79 click on the **Import key** and enter your passphrase or privkey to import

[14-Sep-18 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have your privkey you can login and access your funds using the privkey

[14-Sep-18 05:18 PM] JUR4J79#4798
@SHossain There is no such option, only wallets tab

[14-Sep-18 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
did you start native mode or lite mode?

[14-Sep-18 05:19 PM] JUR4J79#4798
lite

[14-Sep-18 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you can't import privkey in that mode. but, you can use your privkey to login

[14-Sep-18 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
you can only import privkeys in native mode

[14-Sep-18 05:22 PM] JUR4J79#4798
Ok, I've switched to native mode and now waiting for blockchain to sync

[14-Sep-18 05:22 PM] JUR4J79#4798
What about interest from previous wallet?

[14-Sep-18 05:23 PM] JUR4J79#4798
Is it gone?

[14-Sep-18 05:24 PM] JUR4J79#4798
that's strange, probably agama found the old komodo wallet.dat and imported it automatically

[14-Sep-18 05:24 PM] JUR4J79#4798
because now i see it

[14-Sep-18 05:24 PM] JUR4J79#4798
also with interest

[14-Sep-18 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
once the chain is fully synced you will see your balance and reward

[14-Sep-18 05:24 PM] JUR4J79#4798
great, thanks @SHossain

Hi guys - is there an issue with KMDexplorer.io ? i am  trying to check out a transaction from the transaction details link in agama anfdwhen the web page loads i get the following error :   Backend Error. Bitcoin JSON-RPC: Request Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8232

[14-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Hermes#6934
Noted it seems to have this error only from being directed to the wallet.

[15-Sep-18 02:46 AM] jspook16#3059
A heads up. In barterdex when you go to the Speed Mode Settings tab, and click on the "Please click here for more information", there are several references to the word "interest". May need to get cleaned up at some point.

[15-Sep-18 03:34 AM] Hermes#6934
Thanks for the information already noted

[15-Sep-18 07:09 AM] chilo#0578
@TonyL Thanks for your reply. Sleep i think everything is still on, just at a low rate. In any case it is well after four hours after initiating the trade. How long does it take to action a trade, one where i am just taking from an existing order? I would have thought almost instant?

[15-Sep-18 07:12 AM] chilo#0578
@Hermes Thanks for your reply. Mine keeps pending regardless, but trades never take. Is there an error report i can upload to you guys?

[15-Sep-18 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@chilo This time should depend of `setconfirms` trade parameter (from 1 to 6 confirmations). 
If you've noticed that there is some bug/error - It may be good to drop it with as much info as possible to #dev-tradebots so developers will see it

[15-Sep-18 12:19 PM] chilo#0578
@TonyL Thanks Tony. Not sure its a bug. I have probably got some settings wrong, or run the scrips in the wrong order, or maybe setup to wrong directory. The process is not very clear for someone w no programming skills. I hqve followed the process outlined in the barterDEX github, and can do some rudimentary things. It seems like everythings ok, but i know nothing of Alice etc.

[15-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Elmis#0347
I cant syncronize my ledger devices, I have tested in different devices and in different computers, someone  knows about this?

[15-Sep-18 06:58 PM] PTYX#6840
It could be a connection issue

[15-Sep-18 06:58 PM] PTYX#6840
Have you reached out to ledger?

[15-Sep-18 07:31 PM] Elmis#0347
I  have send a message to support but they are not online until monday

[15-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Elmis#0347
I had a syncronation error before that I repare  uninstaling and installing again but this time is not a solution and the error is in two computers using ledger live and ledger crome

[15-Sep-18 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@Elmis this could be Ledger's backend server. sometimes, it goes offline. wait for sometime, it should be back online. otherwise, please contact Ledger support.
