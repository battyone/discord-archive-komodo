Hi everyone, I tried entering my seed from the old agama into verus agama but I hit that field's character limit. Any other ways to get my keys moved over? I've backed up my WIF key but don't see how to import it.

[21-Jun-19 04:28 AM] mattm213#1366
Nevermind, figured it out. The v0.5.7-1 release fixed this  issue anyway.

@jl777c @Deleted User  well m happy to report after sooo many hours wallet finally synced fully and my coins are here no tx out of my wallet .  but i want to ask something about the bonus we earn , do i need to make txn's in wallet to earn bonus or it just as long as balance i kept on a address ? i never really understood it properly .

[21-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Mastermind#1578
and does it matter if i claim any amount or longer i wait to claim the better it gets or something

[21-Jun-19 01:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@Mastermind claim once a month at least

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Mastermind#1578
@gcharang and which does what ? or is it needed to be claimed once a month to keep earning them ?

[21-Jun-19 01:17 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, if you don't claim atleast once a month it will stop growing

[21-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Mastermind#1578

[21-Jun-19 01:53 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
@Mastermind Which version are you using?

[21-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Mastermind#1578
v0.6.0-13

[21-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Mastermind#1578
it just keeps flashing "KMD is shutting down please wait"

[21-Jun-19 01:57 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Ah, yes, that one does do that. consider changing to 0.5.7-1, which is the latest release. In the mean time you can stop it by opening `Agama-win32-x64\resources\app\assets\bin\win64\`in your command pompt and running `komodo-cli stop`

[21-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Mastermind#1578

Or if you want to be safe: download, download checksum, check file, extract & run. 😎

Hey, guys

[21-Jun-19 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@BitSource AML Solutions did you send all the smart dust from your address to new address where you want to get your funds back?

[21-Jun-19 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's important step

[21-Jun-19 09:14 PM] BitSource AML Solutions#1766
No, I didn't send anything

[21-Jun-19 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that is most important step

[21-Jun-19 09:14 PM] BitSource AML Solutions#1766
I just filled out a google form that asked for my old address and email

[21-Jun-19 09:15 PM] BitSource AML Solutions#1766
Is there complete instructions anywhere?

[21-Jun-19 09:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's good. You need to access your old address, and send all the funds from it to that new address where you want to receive your funds.

[21-Jun-19 09:15 PM] BitSource AML Solutions#1766
oh, ok

[21-Jun-19 09:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are instructions

[21-Jun-19 09:15 PM] BitSource AML Solutions#1766
I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything

[21-Jun-19 09:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
