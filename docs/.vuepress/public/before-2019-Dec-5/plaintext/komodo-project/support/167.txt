I have 2 missed deposits that I made to my ARRR Agama wallet from Luxor. The first one was 3 days ago and was for 27.10 ARRR with transaction ID: d5f3c485bcb9f0aa3175813d6bd3d7297864c8634a02610e818a0864d4f3d026. The second one was 2 days ago and was for 25.52 ARRR with transaction ID: d7e5400b007f27d39c5febc0438832a45e93baea2ab5a1daabab10917e89b7cd. I hope something can be done. Thanks in advance!

i have seen the same issue, but dont know the solution. the build process doesnt see the right gcc, maybe a brew install gcc@8 will fix it

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] BlackMarket#6984
something with ruby and not having the right GCC package?

[24-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know if you figure out how to fix it

without C compiler that is found, well, it wont build

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] BlackMarket#6984
"Actually, you’re explaining the process of installing llvm-gcc which is actually not the actual gcc. Its a modified version made by Apple to compile C/Obj-C programs.

Although this is fine for most purposes, some other tools (I think its Ruby, not sure) require the original gcc package. Not the llvm one."

[24-Jul-19 04:51 PM] Spaid#3606
I guess I need some additional help... have tried the instructions in the pinned message multiple times, including leaving the wallet overnight afterwards to see if it would sync with the mainchain at some point, but no luck.  I, like others, am using the latest Windows Ocean wallet v2.0.15-rc2 64bit, have 16 connections, and am stuck at block 1444268, so my console looks like this:

> getblockhash 1444268
< 000000010bffc32b1452a6cd5fdb6715845c505e94b93ae6325b9684c503a80b
> invalidateblock 000000010bffc32b1452a6cd5fdb6715845c505e94b93ae6325b9684c503a80b
< null
> reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2
< null

The wallet then sits in "Synchronizing with network..." until I shut it down.  It has been in that state for 4 hours now.

for the reconsiderblock command I also tried using the value 000000010bffc32b1452a6cd5fdb6715845c505e94b93ae6325b9684c503a80b but it did not work.  The pinned message does not specify if the block that was invalidated is what is supposed to be reconsidered, so I tried both.  There are no further instructions on the pinned message, but my wallet has yet to get past this block when I wait all night or restart.  I also tried a restart with a 'maxreorder = 300' but did not get any results.  What am I missing?

please use only the version i posted above and delete any existing version from your computer

[24-Jul-19 04:57 PM] SHossain#0007
`'maxreorder = 300'`

this should be `-maxreorg=300`. if you used what you posted, would not work as that is wrong parameter

[25-Jul-19 04:03 AM] Tropical Miner#8650
Hello everyone, I am trying to figure out whether or not my funds were taken in the hack, but facing a problem: I can't seem to get the wallet to sync at all so I can't really see my balance

I keep seeing this in he debug: 
Please help, human!
if you launch with -maxreorg=169 it might be able to resolve this automaticallyError: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 159 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

how do i try to launch with -maxreorg=169 to try and sync? Is it safe to try given they say it shut down for my safety?
is this the right place to seek help? I am in native mode on v0.3.6

[25-Jul-19 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make sure you have the most up to date wallet, then launch with `maxreorg=180` as a command line arg.

[25-Jul-19 04:05 AM] Tropical Miner#8650
@blackjok3r How exactly do I go about doing that, command line arg... sorry am very unsavvy about this. I think my version was the last agama i saw on kmd site

[25-Jul-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No idea that is how I fixed mine, uopdated and did reconsider block, Maybe there is a pinned message in another channel

[25-Jul-19 04:10 AM] Tropical Miner#8650

[26-Jul-19 05:43 PM] akaneo#3021
dont know about OSX, but i think would be better and safer to sync it inside a vm

[26-Jul-19 05:44 PM] akaneo#3021
just get oracle vm and create a VM with lubuntu or something similar, give 4GB ram to the machine and 2-4core and sync it inside of lubuntu

[26-Jul-19 05:45 PM] akaneo#3021
get the wallet from https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/download/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4/komodo-qt-linux.tar.gz

[26-Jul-19 05:45 PM] akaneo#3021
run first fetch parameters files

[26-Jul-19 05:45 PM] akaneo#3021
then run the komodo-qt and thats it

Atomic swap. Dex.

[27-Jul-19 02:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@msg768 ⚡ first it needs to be tested to work with the Marketmaker software: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html
then added here: https://github.com/jl777/coins

after that there is some listing fee to be added to the AtomicDEX app, 

but if it is added to the coins repo I posted above, any GUI will be able to list it, so that is the first step

may I know the coin name?

@msg768 ⚡ I would advise you to first get in contact with @cipi to make sure  SwiftCash has the necessary features for integration

[27-Jul-19 02:21 PM] msg768 ⚡#4220
We recently forked and added BIP65 which is all that is needed I believe if I am not wrong. Maybe @cipi can correct me if I'm wrong.

[27-Jul-19 02:22 PM] msg768 ⚡#4220
But we're not SHA256. We're Keccak :/

[27-Jul-19 02:23 PM] msg768 ⚡#4220
Not sure what the implications of that could be. Since even our pub and private keys are based on Keccak and not SHA256.

[27-Jul-19 02:45 PM] cipi#4502
Hi. The code https://github.com/swiftcashproject/swiftcash looks good, afaict
If  Keccak is only used as a mining alg, it doesn't matter, we have integrated many different coins with different minig algos. If Keccak is also used for transaction signing, we will run into this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/462 (SMART is also using Keccak)
If so, we will need to wait till this is fixed/added to mm2, which will happen for sure.
