[28-Jun-18 06:17 PM] And1_89#6578

Hello support.  I have Agama wallet working in Windows. At least I did until some hours ago! Now I am getting the following message: Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server.  I tried to change to the alternative server but no improvement.  My wallet is version 02.39 but when I tried to download .41 the download failed in both Chrome and Firefox. What can I do please?

[28-Jun-18 10:07 PM] Hermes#6934
You should be able to download from our website I just tried and its working

[28-Jun-18 10:08 PM] matspb#7829
That's what I did but it fails for me.

[28-Jun-18 10:11 PM] matspb#7829
Trying again. The download starts then ceases prematurely.

[28-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Hermes#6934
windows version?

[28-Jun-18 10:16 PM] matspb#7829
64. The machine is brand new.

[28-Jun-18 10:17 PM] matspb#7829
Agama downloaded OK when I first got the machine about 3 weeks ago.

[28-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Hermes#6934
use this source

[28-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Hermes#6934
https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/

[28-Jun-18 10:22 PM] matspb#7829
Also fails. Download starts but crashes out after 15-20 secs. The checksum file here downloads OK. The download also just failed on my old laptop.

[28-Jun-18 11:17 PM] matspb#7829
I tried the download in Microsfot Edge (I suppose that's a fancy name for internet explorer?) This time I saw the download start, then there was a security scan and it stopped. Clearly security features are blocking it but I have no idea how to fix that. Solutions found in Google search haven't helped much yet.

[28-Jun-18 11:23 PM] PTYX#6840
Do you have any antivirus?

[28-Jun-18 11:23 PM] PTYX#6840
Windows defender

[28-Jun-18 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I tried the download in Microsfot Edge (I suppose that's a fancy name for internet explorer?)"
No, edge is it's own creature and much shittier than ie; if any part of it can be compared to ie, think ie 3.1 but prettier

[28-Jun-18 11:29 PM] matspb#7829
Yes I just turned Defender off for a moment. No difference.

[28-Jun-18 11:35 PM] matspb#7829
For the moment, I'd also be happy just to get the previous Agama wallet working again. It opens OK but cannot make a connection. This time yesterday it was fine. Is that likely to change or is that version now kaputt for ever?

[28-Jun-18 11:48 PM] PTYX#6840
Try chrome

[28-Jun-18 11:58 PM] matspb#7829
Thanks. Yes I tried Chrome, Firefox and IE. None worked.... until  in IE I tricked the defender (I think). I paused the download after  every 10% then restarted.  This seemed to stall the security scan. I got through in stages. Installed  new Agama and can now see my coin again. No connection problem. Thanks for suggestions people.

@matspb  You  can add an exclusion to Windows defender so you won't run into that issue again:

Great thanks. I knew that path must exist but have been stuck in WINXP  so many years until now that I could not find it!

You will continually get that error, it's benign. Ignore it

[29-Jun-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
For a 90% POS chain, it's very important to start staking immediately

[29-Jun-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
too many consecutive POW blocks will raise the diff to unminable levels

[29-Jun-18 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
also if you're creating a POS chain, it's vital to use the jl777 branch on github
