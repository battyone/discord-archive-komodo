..appdata/roaming/komodo not in there? (in Windows)

[24-May-19 02:56 AM] ehehron#9616
I’m on a Mac

[24-May-19 02:57 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
macOS/OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo

[24-May-19 02:57 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
is it not there?

[24-May-19 02:58 AM] ehehron#9616
That’s a negative no wallet.dat file

[24-May-19 02:59 AM] ehehron#9616
I’m thinking my precious KMD is Gone

[24-May-19 03:00 AM] ehehron#9616
I’m usually on top of backing up wallets. This time doesn’t seem that way

[24-May-19 03:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
when you installed , did you tick 'Delete user data' ?

[24-May-19 03:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that's the only reason i think your wallet might be gone

[24-May-19 03:05 AM] ehehron#9616
Nope

[24-May-19 03:06 AM] ehehron#9616
I’ll wait and see if the wallet ever loads the blockchain but it seems it doesn’t want to do that

[24-May-19 03:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It takes time

[24-May-19 03:08 AM] ehehron#9616
seeing this in the debug

[24-May-19 03:28 AM] ehehron#9616
the daemon doesn't want to load properly

[24-May-19 03:38 AM] ehehron#9616
I might be getting somewhere...I found the address that has all of my KMD and went to the Wallet.dat keys and see the matching WIF...that should be all I need to load up SPV to be able to import it and send the KMD right

[24-May-19 03:41 AM] ehehron#9616
Phew...Ok I'm in...Learned my lesson on that one...Love all the stuff Agama can do and glad the new update forces you to write a seed phrase....Thanks for your support

When restoring a wallet on new version of agama should encrypt key (PIN) be the same set of passwords  as the old version or something  new?

[24-May-19 06:38 AM] TonyL#3577
For pins saved from old versions you have to use pins which you used before

[24-May-19 06:39 AM] Tac#1954

[24-May-19 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@Scarborough Can you confirm that you are using latest version Agama on desktop? (current version is 0.3.6b and can be downloaded here:  (https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/)

There was electrum protocol update recently and if you're not on latest - it might cause problems. On latest 0.3.6b desktop Agama I can use Lite mode without issues. 
But I can confirm mobile wallet connection error and our team investigating it at the moment

[24-May-19 06:44 AM] Tac#1954
Thanks  @TonyL have a good day

[24-May-19 06:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Glad to help @Tac ! Feel free to contact us 😃

[24-May-19 09:44 AM] Bram4#2807
will there be an mobile update to fix the electrum server issues? My desktop agama works fine btw..

[24-May-19 10:04 AM] figgy132#7531

[24-May-19 10:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
hi @SHossain what is the 'wallet name' for wallet restore? or do i just make one up?

[24-May-19 10:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
i dont think i set a pin etc to use the lite version?

[24-May-19 10:55 PM] SHossain#0007
use any name to identify the wallet without any space or special characters

[24-May-19 11:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
pin decrypt error

[24-May-19 11:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
wrong key

[24-May-19 11:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
is the key the seed? the seed is correct, have been using it for the last month

[24-May-19 11:03 PM] SHossain#0007
check the pin/password you used

[24-May-19 11:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
ok sorry

[24-May-19 11:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
allgood

[24-May-19 11:03 PM] nocturnal#2177

👍🏽 

[25-May-19 12:12 AM] Alecandro#1179
So I have same issue. What is the PIN?

[25-May-19 12:12 AM] Alecandro#1179
SEed?

[25-May-19 12:13 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's the password you created after entering the seed the first time

[25-May-19 12:13 AM] Alecandro#1179
so keeps showing my KMD balance as 0 even though I am in

[25-May-19 12:14 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i think lite mode still being updated, let me check real quick (spv server is being updated)

[25-May-19 12:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
error: unknown method "blockchain.address.get_balance"

[25-May-19 12:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
oh okay

[25-May-19 12:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, i am facing the same issue as well 😄

[25-May-19 12:19 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I try using agama wallet from komodo now, it's working

[25-May-19 12:20 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Earlier i used agama from verus and the spv server not connecting

[25-May-19 12:21 AM] Alecandro#1179
Also, before I could launch Pirate Native mode with all my others on the side in lite mode? now I cant?

[25-May-19 12:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I am using 0.3.6b , If I am using native mode, i can only activate other native mode coin and can't activate lite mode. The same happens if I activate a lite mode coin, then I can only activate other lite mode coins but not native mode.

[25-May-19 01:03 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yes exactly. Is that just how it is now ?

[25-May-19 04:06 AM] gcharang#6833
```
I am using native mode, i can only activate other native mode coin and can't activate lite mode. The same happens if I activate a lite mode coin, then I can only activate other lite mode coins but not native mode.

thats how agama works right now, guys

I am preparing a support guide right now, but for people facing the ` "blockchain.address.get_balance"` error,
goto settings -> app config -> Toggle off the button beside "Use Proxy" -> save settings -> restart agama

[25-May-19 04:45 AM] gcharang#6833
https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers
try the above fix if facing electrum connectivity issues on Agama Desktop SPV/Lite mode.

[25-May-19 12:46 PM] pooler#1851
Hello, atomicexplorer.com isn't working properly since a couple of days.
Balances are randomly missing, also for the API.

[25-May-19 03:51 PM] TonyL#3577

updating Agama wouldn't touch wallet.dat

[25-May-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
if he has wallet.dat backed up, he can try putting that .dat file back

[25-May-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
`why those addresses disappeared?`
maybe he removed wallet.dat

[25-May-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
need more info and debug.log

[25-May-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
i haven't seen anything like that to happen just out of nowhere

[25-May-19 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[25-May-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
wallet.dat is not encrpted by default

[25-May-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
it can be encrypted using Settings > CLI for only coins that are `-ac_public=1`

[25-May-19 08:55 PM] SHossain#0007
those are not installed apps. macOS uses `.dmg` file which works like a .iso or something like that.

[25-May-19 08:55 PM] SHossain#0007
all installed apps reside in Applications

[25-May-19 08:55 PM] SHossain#0007
even with all those, 2 Agama versions will use the same data dir

[25-May-19 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

How do I activate the BTC address in Agama? I have the WIF imported.

[25-May-19 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can't see the option in the Activate Coin menu.

[25-May-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
close and start agama 2-3 times

[25-May-19 10:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, trying

[25-May-19 10:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
there we go

[26-May-19 06:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm using the Agama wallet in SPV mode. I looked in the .komodo folder for a folder to backup my wallet.dat file, but did not find any file. 

How do we backup our files in this mode?

[26-May-19 09:25 AM] gcharang#6833
there is only the seed you would have already written down @Bryan_Beus 
or you can goto settings -> exportkeys -> type pin
to get both seed and wif
wallet.dat is only for native mode

[26-May-19 10:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@SHossain silly question how do you remove a account from agama?

[26-May-19 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to go to `~/.agama/shephard/pin/` data dir and delete the `.pin` file you want.

[26-May-19 10:50 AM] Nabob#5004
You  can also delete going to settings > encrypt seed > delete the pin

[26-May-19 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007

[26-May-19 11:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
cool thanks guys

[26-May-19 02:08 PM] RallyMonkey#3596
hello guys, is there a way to earn passive income via KMD?

[26-May-19 02:11 PM] yorklab#7270
Hold your KMD in the Agama wallet to get rewards. Must claim it at least once a month.

[26-May-19 02:13 PM] RallyMonkey#3596
any minimum amount? and when do you mean by  claim it once a month?

[26-May-19 02:16 PM] yorklab#7270
at least >10 KMD

[26-May-19 02:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
The utxo has to be > 10kmd so make sure you have all set in one utxo and claim it once a month

[26-May-19 02:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
Agama will tell you if yoy dont accrue

[26-May-19 02:19 PM] yorklab#7270
You will see a "claim" icon appear when you have started accumulating rewards. It's very simple. Claim anytime, but at least once a month or it stops accruing.

[26-May-19 02:20 PM] RallyMonkey#3596
ok good, i have 70 so should work thanks!
