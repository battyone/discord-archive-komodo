In Agama am I meant to active a coin everytime I launch it?

[28-Sep-18 08:18 AM] Cabey#3299
Or should it save

[28-Sep-18 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Cabey ! Agama will remember your activation choice and show chosen coins on next login (in light mode)

[28-Sep-18 08:43 AM] Cabey#3299
Wierd, mine always reverts to the activate coin screen

[28-Sep-18 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cabey Are you using native or lite mode?

[28-Sep-18 09:00 AM] Cabey#3299
Both

[28-Sep-18 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cabey Please use these features for activation choice saving: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000025529-how-to-save-coins-activation-selection-in-agama-

Hi, Just a quick question regarding crypto conditions.. When was the hardfork done (I suppose it was a hardfork?) Like it was activated in blockheight 1mil but it must have been present in the source for a long time since older versions of komodo are on a correct chain and working fine

[30-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
only chains that set -ac_cc will have CC available

[30-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the code for it was hardforked at the 1 million height fork for master

[30-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
dev branch has had it of 6 months or so

[30-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810

Hello!

[30-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Urakawa#7114
How can i access the "cli" option from within Agama.. I look in settings and nothing.

[30-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Urakawa#7114
Also when input komodod.exe it freezes in NOTARY_PUBKEY  why?

[30-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Nabob#5004
goto Agama settings> cli tab > 
you can  input cli commands there

what does  bad-txns-oversize mean?

[02-Oct-18 06:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@Gordon Komodo Never faced this issue but I guess it means that your transaction is to large to meet consensus rules.

There are at least three reasons a transaction may be too large (as guy in zcash github writing: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1970):

a large number of transparent outputs - caused by a large number of recipients
a large number of transparent inputs - caused by a large amount of transparent value
many JoinSplits

did you get that error while z_mergetoaddress in pirate chain @Gordon Komodo

[02-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not me, somebody else trying to send me coin and he got that

[02-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Nabob#5004
ok, while merging  txns we get that error,  one who is miner those address usually have that issue. so, he needs to combine bit of txn to one periodically

[02-Oct-18 06:52 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, he is a miner 😄

[02-Oct-18 09:39 PM] DCAL4#9381
Good evening all. Quick question on the interest feature now that it has changed to monthly. Do I need to send my KMD to a new wallet each month or does that mean I need to claim the interest in the same wallet each month? Thanks for your help

[02-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Hermes#6934
You will just need to claim the reward in the wallet each month. A reward is generated each time an utxo is spent so if you send to a new address is the same as claiming the reward in your own address. The reward button only automates the sending of your balance to your same public address inside your wallet.

[03-Oct-18 12:20 AM] DCAL4#9381
@Hermes Thank you for the clarification👍

https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024854-agama-javascript-error-windows-version/en Here is a guide that can help with this error @qmc

[03-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Hermes#6934
try erasing the config.json file inside the Agama folder as showed in the guide.

[03-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Hermes#6934
and restart the wallet.

[03-Oct-18 10:29 PM] Hermes#6934
Let us know if it helps

[03-Oct-18 10:33 PM] qmc#4355
agama == barterdex ?

[03-Oct-18 10:33 PM] qmc#4355
will look

[03-Oct-18 10:33 PM] qmc#4355
but that error (in the link) is regarding some other JS

[03-Oct-18 10:44 PM] Hermes#6934
I thought you were seeing the error in Javascript with Agama , still the procedure is the same go to the Barterdex folder inside %appdata%Roaming/ but in this case erase the coins.json file @qmc  ,if this still doesn't help you can also do a fresh installation of Barterdex. You can do this procedure if you don't have any pending or stuck swap. You will only need to delete the Barterdex folder located in the same %appdadata%Roaming/  directory as showed in the guide above 👆   and restart Barterdex again with the latest version.

[03-Oct-18 10:46 PM] Hermes#6934
We will be updating this in knowledgebase also for Barterdex users 👍

[03-Oct-18 11:01 PM] qmc#4355
Looked there, there was only an empty barterdex folder

[03-Oct-18 11:02 PM] qmc#4355
Just came back to update you - this doesn't happen with 1.1.1.0

[03-Oct-18 11:04 PM] Hermes#6934
This happened to you with 1.1.2 right? ..I have seen sometimes that if you have a couple of Barterdex folders lets say the portable folder that we have each time we download  ...it can maybe make some type of issue ....just in case try only leaving in your PC the 1.1.2 version and try a reboot when you time and let us know if that helped. Also maybe erase that Barterdex empty folder while doing this to get a fresh launch.

Hi guys, I downloaded the  agama v0.2.42c and it's been downloading blocks for nearly 24hrs is this normal?
