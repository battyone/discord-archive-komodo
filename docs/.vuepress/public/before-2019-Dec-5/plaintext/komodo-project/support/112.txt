I hope they were but I checked their dexstat

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] bemmmie#5891
hi, I've already sent your form the first time without TXID, sorry
the second time with a wrong address (because I created it in the KMD lite mode)

Can I fill out the form a third time and submit it with my correct address? I have created this in VRSC Lite mode.

Sorry but I am extremely nervous and must go to work.

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
@üî•Xüî• check your address in explorer and see where funds were sent

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] OsTa#2589
take time to fill the form. Personally I didn't do it yet. It needs to be filled carefully

[05-Jun-19 04:19 PM] üî•Xüî•#2583
ok @mrlynch

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
@bemmmie if you secured your funds we can sort out the form later

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] beetfarmer#6689
This is a mess üò≥

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well imagine if an attacker hit first

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] alen#3721
@StrikerBurns if you are looking just to send funds elsewhere..use magnum mobile wallet...its easy

[05-Jun-19 04:21 PM] alen#3721
And they have claim reward button too

[05-Jun-19 04:21 PM] K.M#8111
@beetfarmer this is an excellent work by support, we should thank these guys

[05-Jun-19 04:21 PM] JUJU3#6975

Hi there

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Kaed#8040

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Kaed#8040
They're missing because they've been moved and secured by the team ?

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Depends what address

[05-Jun-19 04:22 PM] K.M#8111
@Kaed probably, follow steps here to find the address

[05-Jun-19 04:23 PM] beetfarmer#6689
@K.M it's a mess that it happened. It's gonna be a nightmare sorting through all this. What was stolen, what was secured by team, etc.

[05-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@CryptoNinjaa Thanks

[05-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Mewnzter#0237
Hmm... Binance wallet maintenance while my coins are "confirming". I guess that means they¬¥ll end up at Binance when wallet maintenance is done?

[05-Jun-19 04:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Mewnzter yes the tx will be recorded on the chain and binance will update balances etc when they are out of maintainence

[05-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Mewnzter#0237
Thanks

@mrlynch After transferring all funds, is it enough to move the old Agama to the trash bin (in macOS)?

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes.. that would uninstall it

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
@CarloP you're safe

[05-Jun-19 04:52 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch No hidden files, user settings, wallet-files etc. that should be cleared?

[05-Jun-19 04:52 PM] flick#6039
@Deleted User Why? I transferred the funds to the new address. Isn't that enough?

[05-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Number32#2621
