Trying to switch to another server... Versus wallet issue, have tried different servers and proxy off? Firewall ok - any ideas?

How does one do this?5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode.

[07-Jun-19 09:50 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes

[07-Jun-19 09:53 PM] fern#2676
I did it another way - created new wallet with custom seed and use the old compromised seed, i assume this a safe option? I used the version Jimm B recommended a few posts above, as i could not get the versus wallet to work

[07-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it is fine as long as you don't use the old agama to access the new created seed

@1CryptoTrader create new address in Verus Agama
submit the form as soon as you can 
and send the 0.0001 KMD from old address to new address

[07-Jun-19 10:05 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
verus is a different coin, isnt it?

[07-Jun-19 10:05 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543

[07-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Jimm B.#9993
No

[07-Jun-19 10:08 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Maybe wait longer than others.

[07-Jun-19 10:10 PM] Jimm B.#9993
the team first works on Tx's under 7777

[07-Jun-19 10:13 PM] bushtea#4656
Is there a way to sync headers any faster?

[07-Jun-19 10:19 PM] Tantale#1431
I have received the special transaction for adresses with more than 7777 KMD. Should I send it back now or wait ?

[07-Jun-19 10:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@Tantale you can do it right now
but don't send it back
you have to send 0.0001 kmd to the address you mentioned in the form as reclaim address

[07-Jun-19 10:20 PM] bushtea#4656
thank you

[07-Jun-19 10:20 PM] Tantale#1431
Ok, I‚Äôll do that. Thanks!

[07-Jun-19 10:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@bushtea first shutdown the wallet, then do this

[07-Jun-19 10:22 PM] RNI#2666
hi. got the special tx too. sent it to the reclaim adress i mentioned in the form . now i only have to wait?

[07-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Jimm B.#9993

[07-Jun-19 10:33 PM] crumb#2550
i filed the claim form on the 6th, but since i would like to receive the funds to multiple addresses, i didn't give an address. 
now before sending the dust amounts to new addresses, i'd like to let the Komodo team know that these new addresses are in fact mine. can i PM someone on the recovery team and list my new addresses?

[07-Jun-19 10:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@crumb dm shossain

[07-Jun-19 10:35 PM] crumb#2550
thank you

[07-Jun-19 10:43 PM] SHossain#0007
@crumb how about you receive them in 1 address and you can transfer afterwords?

[07-Jun-19 10:43 PM] SHossain#0007
it would help us process faster

[07-Jun-19 10:43 PM] SHossain#0007
we already have tons of work

[07-Jun-19 10:44 PM] SHossain#0007
or, you could've just specified the addresses when you made the claim

[07-Jun-19 10:45 PM] crumb#2550
i don't want to mix certain addresses

[07-Jun-19 10:46 PM] SHossain#0007
do you mind submitting the claims again please? just add address where you had funds and where you want to receive them and submit each of them separately

[07-Jun-19 10:46 PM] crumb#2550
let's continue in DM

[07-Jun-19 10:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i already have neck pain just going through the claims

[07-Jun-19 10:52 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
i cant confirm "sign transaction" on my offline computer?

[07-Jun-19 10:52 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
do i have to do it online=

[07-Jun-19 10:54 PM] gcharang#6833
@1CryptoTrader if you are signing the txn using the compromised seed, it won't cause any more harm if you just login using the seed directly and sending the transaction

[07-Jun-19 10:54 PM] blubbi#0643
someone knows when binance will open deposit/withdrawl kmd again?

[07-Jun-19 10:54 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
it says balance = 0 tho

[07-Jun-19 10:55 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
should be 0.00018931 - 0.0001 = 8391 kmd?

[07-Jun-19 10:55 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
so 0 is correct?

[07-Jun-19 10:56 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
shell i manually change the utxo?

[07-Jun-19 10:57 PM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
so 8391 appears?

[07-Jun-19 10:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@1CryptoTrader send me a dm

[07-Jun-19 11:00 PM] blubbi#0643
if u got less amount than transation fee, ur not able to move them

[07-Jun-19 11:00 PM] blubbi#0643
if that was the question

[07-Jun-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
in the claim form there is a balance field, where i should put the amount that was stored in an address. my question is that there was initially one amount, which got swept, and then there was a reward that was swept in the second round. do i add these two together?

[07-Jun-19 11:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@crumb its just approximate, add them together

[07-Jun-19 11:32 PM] crumb#2550
will do

[07-Jun-19 11:38 PM] akaneo#3021
