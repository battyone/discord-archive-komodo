[14-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Hermes#6934
Go to Settings > Select the CLI tab > and enter the command validateaddress (YourKomodoAdress) You should look for is valid = true and ismine = true

[14-Dec-18 11:31 PM] Hermes#6934
if it says ismine= true it means that you have the address in your wallet.dat file...but maybe you need a rescan of the wallet.

[14-Dec-18 11:31 PM] Hermes#6934
so check on the three wallet.dat files for the address that currently holds your balance

[14-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Hermes#6934
remember only changing and touching the wallet.dat file while Agama is shut down

[14-Dec-18 11:36 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
ok , ill do that as soon as the wallet get's synced cuz i restarted it few mins a go

[15-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Hermes#6934

@ABP brewmaster 
`\"name\":\"ABP Network\"` is wrong
if the config file is located in ~/.abp/abp.conf then name should be "abp"
if you use a non-standard location, you neeed to additionally specify confpath parameter

Hey, is it too late to transfer KMD out of my Ledger wallet? I am not able to make transfer KMD out because of synchronization issues.

[15-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Acura#2748

Is there any way I can still access my KMD with the recovery seed?

pinme 

[15-Dec-18 08:47 AM] mrdotboson#5783
I've imported the seed phrase to Agama in the light version but no luck unfortunately. Balance shows as 0 and its not my address.

[15-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think you have to wait for ledger to update to latest fork changes

[15-Dec-18 09:05 AM] mrdotboson#5783
Yeah, that's what I'm probably doing now. But I was under the impression I'd be able to get access by using my seed phrase on Agama. Maybe I'm doing something incorrectly?

[15-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to wait for @Hermes or @Nabob to chime in

[15-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or @SHossain

Komodo service disruption
Ledger will suspend its Komodo service on December 14th, 2018 in order to evaluate the feasibility of technical upgrades for the Komodo hard fork on December 15th. KMD users may transfer their KMD ...

[15-Dec-18 09:39 AM] Nabob#5004
your funds are safe on ledger devices,   if you want to send funds from ledger wallet to other kmd address you can do so with offline transaction signing tool

Accounts generated by a Ledger Nano S device can be recovered on any (third-party) hardware or software wallet that supports the same¬†standards as Ledger (BIP39/BIP44).

"...I've imported the seed phrase to Agama in the light version but no luck unfortunately. Balance shows as 0 and its not my address..."
that can't function. the seed is from ledger, for all your coins there. its not a agama seed.

[15-Dec-18 12:26 PM] coiin#0708
or, do it like this:
Using Agama:

    Start Agama > Select Komodo Lite wallet > Login using any passphrase
    Go to Settings > BIP39 Keys
    Input your 24 words recovery phrase from ledger
    Enter the KMD address of Ledger Nano S which contains the funds that you want to get privatekey for
    Click ‚ÄúGet key‚Äù
    Copy the WIF (wallet import format) key
    Logout from Agama and login using the privatekey for the specific address

Hi guys, I have following problem: I'm using BarterDEX and had made a security deposit (Speed Mode Settings). In Deposit History I do see my Transaction which has already expired. I wanted to reclaim it, but when I clock on "Claim Deposit" it shows me an empty list of claimable deposits...can someone help me?

[15-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Hermes#6934
Please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will get back to you shortly @Soaky

[16-Dec-18 02:15 PM] Soaky#3711
@Acura That was the advice I've received from the support, but it didn't change anything, the list of claimable deposits is shown empty

[16-Dec-18 02:15 PM] Acura#2748
@Soaky for me this guide have worked fine

[16-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Soaky#3711
had you the same problem that the list was empty?

[16-Dec-18 02:18 PM] Nabob#5004
are you make sure you loaded your same kmd address while when you earler deposited the funds

[16-Dec-18 02:20 PM] Nabob#5004
DM me screenshot of file content you kept before claiming

[16-Dec-18 02:24 PM] Soaky#3711
I have only one...the guide says I have  to make sure to have barterDEX running, do I have to click on something / be somewhere before I do these changes?

[16-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Nabob#5004
Nothing, just edit two files and click on claim

Hi guys! does anybody know addresses of public electrum servers for TYSLIN coin?
Or maybe they have their own discord channel?
lack of info in internet((

[18-Dec-18 11:07 AM] Jammer#5360

[18-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Nabob#5004
@Jammer We never added TYSLIN coin to our repository

[18-Dec-18 11:17 AM] Jammer#5360

[19-Dec-18 12:58 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Hiho, logged in to my wallet just now. I am little bit late to claim rewardsm 3 days or so. Says there is nothing to claim? Got an old agama version though, can new coins only be claimed in 0.3? Also when I attempt to install 0.3 says, pc at risk. Normal?

[19-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Hermes#6934
You can proceed with the installation there is no risk
