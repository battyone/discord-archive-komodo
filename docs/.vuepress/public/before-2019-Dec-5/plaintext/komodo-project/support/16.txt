just checked out komodo from jl777/komodo - i cannot get it to compile. it dies with ```configure.ac:129: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
```

[18-Jul-18 06:36 AM] 0x03#8822
it's a recent debian with all updates installed.

[18-Jul-18 06:36 AM] 0x03#8822
what am i doing wrong here?

[18-Jul-18 06:37 AM] 0x03#8822

i just installed 0.2.41 beta the other day on windows machine to replace 0.2.3x, everything works fine, claimed my interest üòÉ

[18-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Hermes#6934
Nice to know that , devs are looking on integrating an automatic update for the wallet for future releases.

[18-Jul-18 01:53 PM] sbucks#9553
have a question, i think i read that one needs to claim their interest at least every 30 days once past block 900k and that if you dont, no further interest accrues on your balance after the unclaimed 30 day period.  is that true?

[18-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Hermes#6934
is recommended to do so because the network rules changed , it's recommended to do so as you are saying.

[18-Jul-18 01:55 PM] sbucks#9553
@Hermes then i will comply with the new network rules. thanks.

Hello I am trying to get my KMD and EQL that are stuck on barterdex

[19-Jul-18 04:49 AM] Bing#9724
I followed the agama WIF extract methods

[19-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Mylo#8306
Is that these instructions?  https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/447873027/How+to+retrieve+WIF+key+of+your+BarterDEX+seed+using+Agama+wallet

[19-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Bing#9724
yes

[19-Jul-18 05:01 AM] Mylo#8306
OK I've just tested it.  So do you have your WIF?

If not, 
1. You have your seed (the passphrase / words) you used in BarterDEX
2.  You have agama open (SPV/lite mode is fine)?
3.  Tools -> "Seed to key pair"
4.  Enter seed/passphrase
5.  "Get WIF"

And the addresses are there, `WIF` and `pub`

At this stage you have your WIF.

You can then follow these instructions to open Agama in SPV/LiteMode if you want:  https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/74317839/Use+a+Privatekey+or+Seed+to+access+funds+in+Agama+Lite+Mode

1.   Log out of Agama
2.  Use shortcut Lite(SPV) Mode dropdown, pick KMD
3.  Put your WIF where it says "Wallet Seed / WIF"

[19-Jul-18 05:01 AM] gcharang#6833
You can directly use your barterDEX seed in Agama. For the coins supported on Agama

[19-Jul-18 05:01 AM] Mylo#8306
üëÜ or that!

[19-Jul-18 05:02 AM] Mylo#8306
oh heaps quicker

[19-Jul-18 05:12 AM] Hermes#6934
@Bing  Just to confirm you don‚Äôt have any funds stuck in a swap right ? Also I will recommend to use the latest version of Hyperdex EQL is already there to trade and its way user friendlier than BDex , here is a link

Hello,  I am not seeing the GLX Token in BarterDEX or HyperDEX (latest version installed)  running on Mac Sierra, can anyone advise please?

[19-Jul-18 10:23 AM] Nabob#5004
@ramtony pls check to see,  your valid address shows on bdex, also you can cross verify balance on glx explorer

[19-Jul-18 11:39 AM] ramtony#6925
Yep, checked my address for the seed I have and the coins I own are showing in the explorer.

[19-Jul-18 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you dont see the coins

[19-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or you are not seeing the option to buy glxt?

[19-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if the second you need to add it in settings

[19-Jul-18 11:57 AM] ramtony#6925
l cant see GLXT in the settings list either...... üò¶  this is the latest version of HyperDEX

[19-Jul-18 12:22 PM] Nabob#5004
You need to add Glxt tokens explicitly from Hyperdex Settings Pane

Launch Hyperdex > Click On settings tab  >  Enabled Currency section drop menu You have to select  GLXT

@ramtony

[19-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought a little bit of glxt with hyper earlier

[19-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it should be there

[20-Jul-18 05:43 PM] j4ys0n#3189
i'm sure everything is fine but just wanted to double check - i just tried to claim my interest by clicking "claim now" in the agama wallet and it sent all my kmd out and then back but it's been sitting for 15 minutes and hasn't been confirmed yet... is this normal?

[20-Jul-18 05:43 PM] j4ys0n#3189
looks like the tx hasn't been picked up yet

[20-Jul-18 06:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if you are using SPV mode, it can take some time. you can check your address in the explorer. if the funds are there, you have nothing to worry

[20-Jul-18 06:13 PM] j4ys0n#3189
yeah, i did that. figured it would just take some time but wanted to check üòÉ

[20-Jul-18 06:13 PM] j4ys0n#3189

[20-Jul-18 06:15 PM] SHossain#0007
Native is fast. SPV is bit slow but easier to use.

[20-Jul-18 06:16 PM] j4ys0n#3189
oh, wait. this is native

[20-Jul-18 06:16 PM] j4ys0n#3189

[20-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Hermes#6934
the transaction may have not been propagated so that won't be needed

ok. that sound about right. going to try installing the new version now
