So it's not safe to even send funds using the old Agama?

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
not sure you'll be able to

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Bitcoinandy#5018
Thanks Mr. Lynch.

[05-Jun-19 08:33 PM] Moody#9910
how can i move my chips? Verus Agama Lite mode says invalid pub address if i want to send them to a new address...

[05-Jun-19 08:33 PM] QuadraQ#5617
What's the easiest way to create a new address, which I can then send to, before importing into the new Agama?

[05-Jun-19 08:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@QuadraQ if your old agama is working, just send to the new address created in the Verus agama

[05-Jun-19 08:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Moody please read this <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers>

[05-Jun-19 08:35 PM] QuadraQ#5617
Once I open the new Verus Agama though, won't it pull in my old wallets since I had the old Agama wallet on the same Windows PC?

[05-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Moody#9910
@mrlynch  proxy is off...

[05-Jun-19 08:35 PM] gcharang#6833
no, click create new wallet.
that will let you create a new address. save the seed

[05-Jun-19 08:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Moody did u activate chips?

[05-Jun-19 08:36 PM] flequillo1986#5387
And how do we obtain private key from current Agama wallet if we do not have the seed (mnemonic)? Is there a way to do so?

[05-Jun-19 08:37 PM] Moody#9910
yes and i see my balance, but when i try to send there is a wallet notification "Invalid Pub Address"

Hello! Tried to log in agama desktop kmd wallet. Says 'connection error, try switching server'

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] Micah68#5652
I inadvertently sent RFOX to an "R" address in KomodoOceanQT wallet, and it does not show up there. RedFox explorer shows the transaction & confirmations, etc.  Is there a way to recover RFOX from KomodoOcean wallet?

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@armands are you aware of the issue with Agama going on now?

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
@armands please see pinned posts

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@Micah68 later you can use the privkey of the address in a wallet that supports RFOX

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Micah68 your rfox funds are safu

[05-Jun-19 08:44 PM] armands#8683
i heard about it. Would like to move coins away.

[05-Jun-19 08:45 PM] armands#8683

@gcharang I'm not sure that I have a private key for the KomodoOcean wallet. I downloaded and activated it today.  Is there a wallet.dat file that is associated with it as well?  Thanks.

[05-Jun-19 08:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@javita which error

[05-Jun-19 08:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@Micah68 if you got the address from komodo ocean, you can get privkey as well

[05-Jun-19 08:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Micah68 yes.. create a new address and backup privkey

Thanks @gcharang

[05-Jun-19 08:54 PM] gcharang#6833
just importing the compromised seed in the verus agama doesn't cause harm
just empty it anyway you can

[05-Jun-19 08:56 PM] QuadraQ#5617
So just create a new KMD address in verus Agama and then send everything to that new address from the old address(s) that it imported from the old (compromised) Agama, correct?

[05-Jun-19 08:57 PM] javita#1621
Getting ready to send funds but one concern is that the new Agama wallet does not say Versus it just says v0.6.0 - PBaaS -Cross-chain-Technology-Preview. I want to make sure K downloaded the Versus wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@QuadraQ yes

[05-Jun-19 08:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@javita thats right

[05-Jun-19 08:59 PM] QuadraQ#5617
Thanks for the clarification. Is there a way to mark the old addresses as "bad" so it never uses them in the future (such as when claiming reward)

[05-Jun-19 09:00 PM] gcharang#6833
if you are creating a walletfile and pin name you can just name it whatever you want
if you are just logging in directly with seed, it won't save it

[05-Jun-19 09:01 PM] Fabio Ferreira#9032
@gcharang  i made today afternoon . Ceived my address from where my komodos have been transferred, the TXID, the amount and a new address to book back the funds. It is a ledger kmd adress okey?

[05-Jun-19 09:02 PM] gcharang#6833
yes  a ledger KMD address is OK
just make sure you haven't imported the ledger seed into agama before

[05-Jun-19 09:03 PM] QuadraQ#5617
So for KMD assets should I send those first? (Don't they require some KMD to send?)

[05-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Fabio Ferreira#9032
@gcharang No, i doesn't. I only used the webwallet to access the data to add it to the form claim

[05-Jun-19 09:04 PM] gcharang#6833
then its fine

[05-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Fabio Ferreira#9032
hope the best for everyone in the KMD family..@gcharang üôè

[05-Jun-19 09:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
@QuadraQ no... we don't work with gas here.. each asset is independent

[05-Jun-19 09:07 PM] flequillo1986#5387
When I enter v0.6.0-13 wallet, in Lite Mode there is a Menu

[05-Jun-19 09:07 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Should I select VRSC there or KMD?

[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] bouch#7580
Glad that is done, found out about it early in the work day and had to wait until I got home.  Created a new wallet and sent funds. Submitted form and will hope for the best.

[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] bouch#7580
Select KMD

[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flequillo1986 kmd

[05-Jun-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
@bouch did u have your funds swept?

[05-Jun-19 09:09 PM] flequillo1986#5387
In many posts here appears VRSC logo...quite confusing haha

[05-Jun-19 09:10 PM] armands#8683
ok. created new kmd wallet on agama 0.6.0.13. I see no Import button...

[05-Jun-19 09:11 PM] jspook16#3059
You don't import. You create new address and then log out. Login with old seed and send funds to new address

[05-Jun-19 09:11 PM] armands#8683
thanx. got it

[05-Jun-19 09:12 PM] jspook16#3059
SAVE your new seed!!

[05-Jun-19 09:12 PM] davsal#6873
Hi, if I create a new seed and address in Verus Adams wallet, can I then import this into the Agama mobile wallet? Is this considered safe?

[05-Jun-19 09:13 PM] davsal#6873
I guess put another way: is it only seeds generated by Agama mobile wallet that were unsafe?

[05-Jun-19 09:13 PM] gcharang#6833
no @davsal agama mobile is not safe

[05-Jun-19 09:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
@gcharang do u have a solution for the chips invalid pub msg?

[05-Jun-19 09:14 PM] davsal#6873
Is the plan for Agama mobile wallet to provide a patch or fix?

[05-Jun-19 09:15 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Other options are Waves and NXT

[05-Jun-19 09:15 PM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 09:15 PM] bouch#7580
mrlynch - Yes, my KMD was swept

[05-Jun-19 09:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@davsal you will have an option for a mobile wallet soon, but not right now

[05-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Capone__44#8936
