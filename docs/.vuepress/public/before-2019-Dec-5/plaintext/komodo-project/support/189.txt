>to support KMD rewards, the trezor formware itself needs to be updated
required changes were merged somewhere in august/september @gcharang no further update is needed
@SHossain reported that kmd claiming is working on the latest trezor firmware
I've added Trezor support to Atomiclabs' web KMD claiming tool https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim. If anyone would like to be an early beta tester please follow these instructions https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-reward-claim/wiki/Don't-trust.-Verify. Report any issues you come across.

@pbca26 I just checked. Ledger is working too

[19-Nov-19 02:13 PM] SHossain#0007
only thing is there is no GUI support for Trezor to generate new address, send

[19-Nov-19 02:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
Does the sending of funds via leder and there app ledger work atm?
There is somebody who wants to send ( not claiming)

hey, can you please send me  a DM?
this is regarding a claim you might have submitted

[19-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Arno#3334
@pbca26 Thanks for the info and the new tool which, to be honest, I'm a bit scared to use (I mean verifying a raw transaction is not something I'm feeling comfortable with). Isn't it possible to have a tool similar to https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/ where it was quite convenient and automatic to claim the rewards with the ledger hardware wallet?

one question to my old address: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RFTKtQUNUHpZqxsLXpRrzYdnmpJQ26wBAh   I see 9000 coins received and also sent..but I never had that much..is that explorer right and its for making it anonymous?

[19-Nov-19 08:20 PM] phm87#7395
9000 is the overall total. If I have 1kmd and I sent it from myself to myself many times, explorer will say total received is huge whatever I played with 1 coin

@Arno the guide i wrote is entirely optional if you don't feel like doing it. I made it for users who want to verify addresses/amounts, it's a pretty advanced way of checking for correctness I agree on that. However, I saw several people asking here on discord how to verify addresses KMD claiming tool is generating for rewards claim transactions. http://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim is pretty much identical to the original version with the exception to style changes.

[20-Nov-19 11:17 AM] Arno#3334
@pbca26 The only uncertainty is when new, unknown addresses are involved in the claiming process, and thus the need for the complex address check via the XPUB as you described. If it would be possible to simply claim to the same, known and trusted address that you're sending from via the Trezor, that would be great. Can this be done?

[20-Nov-19 11:52 AM] Charlotte#6447

How staking our KMD?

[20-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Acura#2748
There is no staking on kmd.
I get rewards on hodling my kmd on my own wallet - my keys - my coins - my rewards - simple as that

[20-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Acura#2748
Maintenance is no joke - Hardupdate is coming

[20-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Charlotte#6447
Hardupdate? Excuse what does it mean, even gg doesn't know really üòá and I'm not Dev. 
The issue : I can't transfer my KMD from binance to Atomic or other wallet to have my rewards. It's a bit annoying... üôÑ

From telegram 

`I lost many coins by using Barterdex and Agama wallet. I would like to know whether I have a chance to get them back? 2 years ago I sent 2000 KMD to use the lightning "faster". But when I claimed those coins back I was directed to a page on "How to claim 0conf deposit after expiry date". All I manage to do was to wreck my computer after trying this for days. I got so frustrated, that I quit trading anything related to KMD. I have also many Supernet tokens... Any idea where I can trade them?`

[21-Nov-19 02:39 AM] Regnar#6164
passed along this <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/mmV1/guides/manual-claim-legacy-0conf-deposit.html#manually-claim-0conf-deposits-using-linux> 
But not sure if there are other ways?

[21-Nov-19 08:16 AM] Hember#5341
I talked to Jason on Telegram and he told me to present my problem here.
So, after the Agama attack we needed to get our privkeys out of the Agama.
Do I remember correctly that there was some page or even Agama wallet itself that added some colour or something to the address that had something on them? Well, anyway, the problem is that I went through all my privkeys in the end, but none of them gave me access to a number that was showing on a list... I am sorry that I can't remember this more accurately.
Anyway, I now tried all these addresses once again in the explorer and none of them gave any result. I was thinking that maybe the Agama gui had some mirage numbers on it or something. I still have my wallet.dat from Jan 24th 2018. Could that help us somehow?

[21-Nov-19 08:21 AM] Hember#5341
So I don√§t have the Komodo Agama on my computer anymore. I had forgotten this mirage number thing and had got rid of it at some point. I remember thinking I would go back to it and trying to solve this, but now it seems I didn't.

[21-Nov-19 08:22 AM] Oszy#5734
Only seeds / WIF keys were compromised, if you ever used them in Lite mode.

[21-Nov-19 08:22 AM] Oszy#5734
Native wallets weren't

[21-Nov-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
Are you missing funds from one of your addresses? Were they sent somewhere? (see on explorer)

[21-Nov-19 08:41 AM] Hember#5341
Sorry, I have trouble explaining this as I cant myself recall everything..

[21-Nov-19 08:45 AM] Hember#5341
Is or was there a page that used colour coding to point out addresses that have/had coins in them?

[21-Nov-19 08:58 AM] Oszy#5734
Where? In Agama on the Receive tab?

[21-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Hember#5341
Well, that is what I can't remember. I think it has had to be in Agama or be a site on internet that is linked to retreiving what one had in his Agama. But if it was in Agama, then it was in that gui and I don't have it anymore.

[21-Nov-19 09:37 AM] Oszy#5734
Someone else might know what you referring to, I don't recall it.

OK, so now I scanned all my addresses with komodo explorer, with Barterdex assetviewer and finddeposit, and it looks like that number doesn't exist anymore.
As I was trying to find this address I started to remember that the number that I found was KMD and it was on assetviewer where it showed up. All the amounts there are marked red, but zero amounts are grey. I had something like 634 KMD, but it was grey. Now that number doesn't exist anymore. I am quite sure which one of the addresses it was as I had made some kind of mark in a document where I had all these addresses.
Weird stuff.

@Arno added address selector where you can select one of the "known" addresses. I guess it shouldn't be too hard to memorize them. Default is the next unused address.

[21-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Arno#3334
@pbca26 I had to click five times because of blocked popups, but the claiming actually worked! One question though: In general, is the change address a vulnerability with hardware wallets or is the hardware wallet making sure only an internally known change address can be used? Simple example: Let's say we write a "malicious" wallet software for a hardware wallet, and we have a balance of 1000 KMD. Then we send 1 KMD to an external address. Now where do the 999 change go? Would it be possible for the malicious software to hand a return address to the hardware wallet that is different from the hardware wallet's internal addresses? I mean is the change address simply a parameter that can be freely chosen by the (malicious) software wallet, and if so, would the hardware double check it against it's internal addresses and deny such a transaction? Just wondering.

[21-Nov-19 04:36 PM] Alright#0419
To simplify, the device knows whether or not it can spend from a change address. If it can, it does not ask the user to verify it with the device

[21-Nov-19 05:01 PM] pbca26#5430
>I had to click five times because of blocked popups
this is how trezor connect operates, have to allow popups
this requirement is mentioned when you select trezor in vendor menu
change address can belong to your seed or can belong to another entity
that's why it's very important to check on your hw device every address that's involved in a transaction
if addresses you see in a wallet software differ from hw wallet then something is wrong and you should stop using the wallet immediately
this could be either an app logic problem or tampered/malicions wallet software
i can't say about ledger but on trezor a user need to verify each output that's marked with a PAYTOADDRESS flag
however if another flag is used it can "not ask the user to verify it with the device" as @Alright wrote above

[21-Nov-19 05:01 PM] pbca26#5430
@Arno

[21-Nov-19 05:03 PM] Arno#3334
Hmm, you say it's important to check on the hw wallet every address that's involved in a transaction. However that's not possible, because the hw wallet only displays the primary recipient's address, not the change address.

[21-Nov-19 05:05 PM] Arno#3334
@pbca26

[21-Nov-19 05:10 PM] pbca26#5430
as i said it depends on the wallet sw
i have an experimental piece of code that asks to confirm the primary recipient's address and the change address for both trezor and ledger

[21-Nov-19 05:10 PM] pbca26#5430
@Arno

[21-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Arno#3334
I didn't expect that with a hw wallet that there's the need to trust the software in that regard.

[21-Nov-19 05:14 PM] pbca26#5430
that's why i wrote the guide
no need to trust, verify

[21-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Arno#3334
I really think that the trezor generally would double-check the change address and would reject it if it's an unknown one.

[21-Nov-19 05:14 PM] pbca26#5430
you're trusting hw manufacturer anyway
