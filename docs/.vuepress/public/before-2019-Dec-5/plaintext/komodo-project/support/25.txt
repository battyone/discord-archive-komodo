Agama appears to be fully broken... Hmm...

[14-Aug-18 05:02 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
can't interact with anything in the interface

[14-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Nabob#5004
Did you change any parameter In agama Userdata folder ? @Bryan_Beus

[14-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nope

[14-Aug-18 05:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Was just using it like normal..

[14-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm looking to see if I can export privkeys using komodo-cli

[14-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Nabob#5004
So, You are using komodod cli version not gui right ?

[14-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was using GUI, but it's not working anymore.

[14-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Trying komodo-cli to see if I can find out what's happening.

[14-Aug-18 05:21 AM] Nabob#5004
is komodo cli version works  ?

[14-Aug-18 05:22 AM] Nabob#5004
if yes, Move agama userdata folder  to backup and relaunch Agama if it helps

[14-Aug-18 05:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the cli version works

[14-Aug-18 05:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but I don't know what you mean by moving userdata folder to backup...

[14-Aug-18 05:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
which fodler?

[14-Aug-18 05:34 AM] Nabob#5004
~/.Agama

[14-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Hermes#6934
@Bryan_Beus  Are you still unable to use Agama? that message that you received is from  the CLI right?

[14-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Hermes#6934
What is the error that the GUI presents?

[14-Aug-18 04:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Agama still doesn't work. The error I posted above writes to the console when Agama is running

A red box shows up in the bottom right saying 'unable to update dash' or something. I can take a look later when I have time. Working right now.

I think CLI is working fine, it's just Agama.

[14-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Hermes#6934
thanks for the input are you still using linux 18.04?

[14-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
indeed

[14-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Anyone having trouble sending kmd out of agama? I‚Äôm getting the error message ‚Äúinvalid pub address‚Äù

[15-Aug-18 04:47 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Checked the address more than once and then scanned the qr code as well. Still no luck

[15-Aug-18 04:48 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Using most recent agama wallet 2.41-beta on Mac

[15-Aug-18 04:51 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Doh nvm

[15-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Nabob#5004
invalid pub addreess is you keying address wrongly or it has missing character,  check in explorer once

[15-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Nabob#5004
or dm here address

[15-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Hermes#6934
@Elmis  Por aca podemos conversar, recomiendo que verifiques si Agama ha sido bajado completamente osea que el archivo que bajaste esta completo . Y por ultimo una pregunta para ver si puedes aplicar una posible solucion. Utilizas el pin para poder entrar a Agama o un seed?

[15-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Hermes#6934
Si utilizas un seed para entrar entonces quizas una solucion sencilla sea borrar totalmente la carpeta de Agama

[15-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Hermes#6934
en appdata

[15-Aug-18 03:25 PM] Elmis#0347
utilizo el seed y ya he probado  borrando  agama de appdata, tambien he probado borrando los parametros ZCash y al instalar de nuevo sale igualmente el mensaje

[15-Aug-18 03:32 PM] Hermes#6934
hmm ok si es posible envianos un ticket a support@komodoplatform.com con la imagen que nos enviaste y tendremos que hacer una prueba

[15-Aug-18 03:33 PM] Hermes#6934
no he visto ese error anteriormente

[15-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Elmis#0347
he vuelto a instalar descargando de nuevo la ultima versi√≥n por si las moscas y el resultado el mismo, nada mas clicar en el icono de agama en el escritorio aparecen los mensajes

[16-Aug-18 04:57 AM] crypto-zoe#1154
I have an issue with my Agama wallet. I sent two transactions to an address 3 days ago.  1st transaction was 825 KMD and the 2nd transaction was 25 KMD ... I should be getting 5% on 850 KMD which amounts to about 0.12 KMD per day.  HOWEVER!  I am only earning 0.003 KMD per day which is obviously not 5% on 850 coins, but it is 5% on 25 coins, meaning I am only getting rewarded for my most recent (smallest transaction) in my wallet.  Is this a know issue?  What is the solution?

[16-Aug-18 04:59 AM] crypto-zoe#1154
The atomic explorer shows my larger transaction "locktime field is not set" ?!

[16-Aug-18 05:07 AM] Hermes#6934
Currently this could have happened if you sent that transaction from a cold storage as ledger or an exchange because they are not using locktime on their internal wallets, what you can do in order to set the locktime is to send your balance to yourself by sending it to your own public address. After this procedure is done in Agama your locktime will be set

@Hermes simple solution, which worked.  Looks like the whole balance is now unlocked.  A lesson that cost me about .3 KMD over the last 3 days (could be much worse) ... Glad I caught it now rather than checking my balance a year from now expecting to claim 5% and learning I had accrued almost nothing.  Thank You!

Electrum server software doesn't support all the coins that are available in BarterDex. There is a full list of supported for now: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/blob/master/gui/js/electrum_list.js
UPD Looks like I have to play with BarterDEX more))

For what I see in your screenshot @AkiraX  it seems that you may need to do a fresh insallation, by erasing the Barterdex folder located in %appdata% , only do this if you don't any pending swap or stuck swap and after this perfom this procedure as shown in the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVziQQvjb-I

You are not able to see your coin icons and that have solved it for me in the past

I'm still getting that Agama error. It's something about 'unable to update dashboard"

[17-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
CLI is not affected by the error, so it's just GUI related.

[17-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Have some time right now to work on it, if anyone's available.

[17-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Nabob#5004
have you refreshed agama userdata folder and relaunched ?
