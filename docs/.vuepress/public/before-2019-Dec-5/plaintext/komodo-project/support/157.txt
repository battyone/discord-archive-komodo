@haerry13 ^^

[01-Jul-19 07:00 PM] haerry13#0044
Alright, That's great. I have not synchronised my wallet until 2day, cause I waited for the smartdust. But there it is. Thank you very much!

[01-Jul-19 08:56 PM] SHossain#0007
he didn't get any smartdust

[01-Jul-19 08:57 PM] Chimalis#2318
But the funds in the Komodo wallet now. So the funds aren¬¥t on my old address

[01-Jul-19 08:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@Chimalis you still have funds in your compromised address. just send them to your specified refund address

[01-Jul-19 08:59 PM] Chimalis#2318
Ah i have to send the 0.44 KMD to the new address, that the balance on the old address is 0?

[01-Jul-19 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
just send them to your specified refund address

[01-Jul-19 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
and, don't use your compromised address with any funds in the future

[01-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Hopecrusher#2468
I'm confused with the wallet. Where do I give my address?

[01-Jul-19 11:00 PM] Hopecrusher#2468
I had Komodo set up in the Magnum wallet and never received anything from the tipsm

[02-Jul-19 09:20 AM] deckard78#7892
I've filled  out a missing funds form roughly about a week ago and haven't received my kmd in my new agama address, is this a normal time period to wait or did I perhaps do something wrong when I filled out the form? Thanks

[02-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Poldi-1#5469
I got an email from komodoplatform.com regarding the claim from a compromised Agama address. The email tells me the sent smart dust to the old address from where I should send it to the new on to prove ownership. Problem is: I deleted the compromised wallet including the seed so I would not accidentally re-use the address. They never mentioned we would need the compromised address again. What can I do now?

[02-Jul-19 01:26 PM] private guy#0631
after last months vulnerability I switched to Version 0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview-Tech-Preview-02 (0.6.0) wallet, its not claiming interest, its fine, I think I just have to change a toggle in settings. Anyone know what I need to adjust?

I just filled in a claim with 'safe' address as RPVRttmUM8dVebFWV6vZvh6hzKf2GF7EEz. I also sent the smartdust there which shows on the explorer. Unfortunately the seed words are now taking me to a different wallet. My compromised address is R9ngK4u9HXocykUU4LVwj4LdQvrJb4paDh. Please halt all transfers to this account. I need to work out whats going on. Thanks.

[02-Jul-19 08:32 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I didn't make a PIN with password or export any private key. I was intent on getting the form filled out., and was going to do the full backup afterwards. So I'm having to do the Native route. Is there a blockchain download available?

[02-Jul-19 08:41 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
This isn't happening without a blockchain/bootstrap download.

Did your funds actually get swept? Check explorer

[02-Jul-19 08:45 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Cheers Cryptoon. Yes... the old wallet I can access OK. I just didn't expect any auto-change address if thats what it is.

[02-Jul-19 08:54 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
WARNING: If installing Verus Agama MAKE a PIN and password when prompted otherwise risk a 10.9GB download which will take 4 hours and then with no guarantee of success. I'm pretty sure I could choose to create a new address all by myself. Nightmare!

[02-Jul-19 09:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you run native it will just read wallet.dat and not use passphrase

[02-Jul-19 11:08 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I haven't checked for other coins bar KMD. Were there any airdrops or anything into Agama? Where do they show up?

[02-Jul-19 11:38 PM] -Hegemon-#3867
Hey guys, would I need to migrate my keys from Komodo to Antara? Or the format is the same and no action is necessary?

[03-Jul-19 01:39 PM] deckard78#7892
When I go into my agama wallet it says that there's no history available and I can't see any kmd even though if I put the wallet address into kmd explorer it says there's kmd connected to that address.  Any help appreciated?

[03-Jul-19 01:46 PM] deckard78#7892
Problem solved!

[03-Jul-19 02:16 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I've sent my dust to an address I cannot regain access to. I have the Seed Words and  Seed Encrypt Key (PIN) plus agama-seed.png only. I have  got Native Mode synced. Imported the Seed and only see 2 addresses neither of which are the dust address which is  RPVRttmUM8dVebFWV6vZvh6hzKf2GF7EEz. I've tried multiple arrangements of the seed in case it somehow got pasted in error with no joy. I'm at a loss to know what to do now.

[03-Jul-19 02:19 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I still have access to my compromised account though but now, of course, there's no dust available for sending to a new address.

[03-Jul-19 02:20 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I filled out the claim form yesterday with RPVRttmUM8dVebFWV6vZvh6hzKf2GF7EEz as the 'safe' address. I had definitely logged in that one time to an account with that address showing, but cannot do it again.

[03-Jul-19 02:25 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I now see the KMD has unfortunately been returned to that supposedly safe address despite me requesting a halt on that yesterday.

I'm currently sinking the the Komodo Ocean wallet.   Is it a stretch to think this will import the Agama wallet.dat automagically?

why don't you just skip the step to create a new address and get your wif for existing address?

[03-Jul-19 03:25 PM] CryptoPope#3579
can you walk me through were to identify the wif key?

take that wif key and import into Komodo Ocean?

[03-Jul-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have a wallet.dat inside data dir, KomodoOceanQT or other native wallet will use that by default without having to change anything

[03-Jul-19 03:29 PM] CryptoPope#3579
ok, I'll move it over once the DO wallet completes the sink.

[03-Jul-19 03:30 PM] CryptoPope#3579
After the wallet.dat file is moved over and restart the wallet will the ZEX and ZEXO coin be present or just ZEXO?

[03-Jul-19 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
ZEX and ZEXO are different coins. you need to export key from ZEX and import into ZEXO
