How can we help you ?

[01-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Hermes#6934
You mean Arrr ?

[01-Nov-18 07:37 AM] lhedwin#7568
@Hermes I did all you recommended, but now i can not add any coins, i did all the "How to add coins/assets/tokens to BarterDEX GUI for trading" and did not help. The coins list is not there.

[01-Nov-18 07:39 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok if you donâ€™t have any pending or stuck swap try erasing the Barterdex folder located in %appdata%Roaming and launch Barterdex again. See if that solves the issue. @lhedwin

[01-Nov-18 07:40 AM] lhedwin#7568
i did that too, and did not solve the issue.

[01-Nov-18 07:42 AM] Hermes#6934
Were you able to use the previous version of Barterdex with no issues or is this the first time using Barterdex on this machine ?

[01-Nov-18 07:42 AM] Hermes#6934
You are using Windows right ?

[01-Nov-18 07:44 AM] lhedwin#7568
the previous version of Barterdex was working just fine. yes, windows.

[01-Nov-18 07:45 AM] lhedwin#7568
i did an installation on ubuntu too, but i have the same problem.

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] Hermes#6934
After deleting the Barterdex userdata folder you restarted the machine ?

[01-Nov-18 07:46 AM] lhedwin#7568
no

[01-Nov-18 07:47 AM] Hermes#6934
Please send us a ticket to look into this at support@komodoplatform.com in case that doesnâ€™t fix it with the specs of your Windows and Ubuntu machine ...and we will test it shortly .

[01-Nov-18 07:48 AM] lhedwin#7568
perfect, thank you.

The project swiftcash.org wants to get listed on Barterdex, where they can find information about how to do it?

[02-Nov-18 10:58 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi there , here is a document on how to add your coin or token in Barterdex https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/get-listed-barterDEX.html?highlight=how%20get%20coin%20listed ,

[02-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Hermes#6934
Still the Github repository is open for requests if they sent the complete information after it's vetted.

[03-Nov-18 03:32 AM] Ignacio Figueroa (FIG)#4221
Thanks @Hermes

[03-Nov-18 04:47 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Can only voice my disappointment at the drop of DNR support, I am a Dash Mod, have a few people there who like DNR, I know they have problems, but they didn't deserve this.  Have talked to their devs, two sides to every story, they came thru for me on the DNR I lost sending to the KMD DEXes.

[03-Nov-18 04:48 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I know nobody's perfect, I haven't sold any of my KMD, but I AM disappointed.

[03-Nov-18 05:56 AM] cipi#4502
DNR is still available in BarterDEX, we only removed the electrum servers because they have problems... and you also can configure whatever you want in BarterDEX, so if you know some working electrums for DNR, you can use them

Hallo
How can i see my last transactions on agama wallet?

[03-Nov-18 11:30 AM] Nabob#5004
On agama , You can see on transaction tab

[03-Nov-18 04:07 PM] Masterroshi#4478
hello here i am trying to do the command line update of KMD but when i try to update it says that the file is not a github repo.

[03-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Masterroshi#4478
I was going to try and redownload the binaries from github and replace the new wallet.dat file with my old one but the resources all have dead links or the repo does not have komodod komodo cli and komodotx in it.

[03-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Masterroshi#4478
i was going to try with agama but i cant find any references on how to import my wallet.dat file

[03-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Nabob#5004
Try to Download binaries from here
https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/

also, while reinstalling agama wallet, no need to replace wallet.dat file, For safety reasons, we ask users to take backup of wallet.dat.
reinstall process never touches wallet.dat file @Masterroshi

with this link i just download the agama wallet?

[03-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Nabob#5004
Yes

[03-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Masterroshi#4478
ok

[04-Nov-18 05:32 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
Is this the right place to talk to someone who can give support for the AGAMI wallet ?

[04-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Hermes#6934
yes

[04-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Hermes#6934
@Franky_Bones_79  how can we help?

[04-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
i just downloaded the chain for the native (not lite) wallet

[04-Nov-18 05:51 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
and it shows a small balance, i was moving it from my imac at another location, but at the other location i also got a seed phrase for a lite version, and transferred coin into that

[04-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
when i try to use the seed phrase for the light version, the other balance does not show

[04-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
and im not sure what im doing wrong

[04-Nov-18 05:53 PM] Hermes#6934
You made two seed passphrases?

[04-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Hermes#6934
Native runs the blockchain and your private keys are stored in your wallet.dat file inside your userdata folder

[04-Nov-18 05:54 PM] Hermes#6934
Lite mode gives you access to the blockchain with a SPV server

[04-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you seeing the same address that you had in your IMAC in the new computer you are using?

[04-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
why would the seed phrase for the lite wallet not work to bring up that second balance ?

[04-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
for the native full download, yes, everything lined up

[04-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Hermes#6934
you are referring as second balance  to the native mode balance?

[04-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
no, on my other computer it would give me two options when i firtst clicked on it

[04-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
pin file locations

[04-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
the 2nd pin file location was the lite wallet option

[04-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
i cant seem to get this one set up the same way, where i have an option for a pin file for both the lite and full

[04-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Hermes#6934
if you are referring to full as native mode ...native mode doesn't have a pin option

[04-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
ahhh , ok

[04-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
yes i was

[04-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
will the lite version of the wallet still be operable on my imac at the other location ?

[04-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Hermes#6934
only lite mode has the pin file option to be accessed at the beginning of the start screen

[04-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
should i reinstall the lite version usng the seed phrase and see if it works

[04-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
'?

[04-Nov-18 06:00 PM] Hermes#6934
Lite mode version uses in this case the pin password that you are using...locally in that machine but most importantly the pin is stored locally. What you should always have is your 24 word seed passphrase that was created when you first created the wallet.

[04-Nov-18 06:00 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
i do have both sets of works

[04-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Hermes#6934
Just in case here is a guide on how to export your seed and private keys for that particular address that you have in lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024493-how-to-use-agama-lite-mode-and-export-wifkey/en

[04-Nov-18 06:01 PM] Hermes#6934
If you have the seed or the private key for that particular address you can access them from any computer in the world

[04-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
i also never got a WIF for my seed phrase on the lite wallet

[04-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
or is my password the WIF ?

[04-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Hermes#6934
no ...your password is just a personal pin

[04-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Hermes#6934
your seed and WIF are different...these two are your entrance to the wallet

[04-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
if i have one, but not the other (for the lite SPV wallet) i should be able to retrieve it right ?

[04-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Hermes#6934
In the guide you will see how to extract your WIF

[04-Nov-18 06:05 PM] Hermes#6934
if using lite mode...

[04-Nov-18 06:07 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
thanks for your help

[04-Nov-18 06:08 PM] Hermes#6934
Just to make sure ...try learning a little bit more about how to use the wallet with these set of guides...I think they can really help if you are using Agama . Here are the ones for Native mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/folders/29000054289 and here are the ones for Lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/folders/29000054290

i already have a WIF for the wallet download that reqs the whole chain, but i cant find a way to use my seedphrase to import the lite wallet with coin in it in order to follow the steps and get a WIF

[04-Nov-18 06:40 PM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
its a different seed phrase

[04-Nov-18 07:21 PM] nognu#8194
I want to do an atomic swap between a ERC20 coin and bitcoin

[04-Nov-18 07:21 PM] nognu#8194
is this possible using barterDEX

[04-Nov-18 07:21 PM] nognu#8194
?

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Hermes#6934
@Franky_Bones_79  You should be able to export the WIF key in your Lite mode with the guide above ðŸ‘†  what do you mean by a different seedphrase?

[04-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Hermes#6934
You need to use the same seedphrase that you use to enter the wallet.

[04-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Hermes#6934
@nognu  Here is more information on how this works https://komodoplatform.com/soft-launch-of-hyperdex-user-interface/ I will recommend using Hyperdex for better user experience

[05-Nov-18 01:42 AM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
if i have a pin file name, and a seed phrase, a password and a public recieve address, is it possible to retrieve a lite version of the agama wallet and find my balance of kmd ?

[05-Nov-18 01:43 AM] Franky_Bones_79#9986
since when i tried to do that, and entered the seed phrase, the brand new wallet it opens is empty with different addresses. and im at my Imac in Pennsylvania, the other lite version runnning with a balance is on my imac in IL

[05-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Hermes#6934
This seed passphrase that you have is the same that you used in your Mac in IL?

[05-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Hermes#6934
if it's the same make sure you don't have any typo or extra space at the beginning or end of the phrase. Also in between any of the 24 words.

[05-Nov-18 05:44 PM] TorJado#3802
Really dumb question, I have a UTXO from rewards that is <10. How do I merge it with my main balance

[05-Nov-18 05:45 PM] gcharang#6833
Send the whole balance to yourself
