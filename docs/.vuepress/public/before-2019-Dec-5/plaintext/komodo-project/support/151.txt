[20-Jun-19 06:46 AM] peddycb#5889
I got that back

[20-Jun-19 06:50 AM] peddycb#5889
4682 CHIPS are still missing

[20-Jun-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
did you send the dust from the oldaddresses to RP8q2GmdFdFEv4MRqDbberEwdGZSXhJmWV for all the coins?

[20-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see any for DEX

[20-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the refund processor is looking for specific (old address -> new address) transfer of the smartdust

[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for CHIPS, i just manually processed it and must have miscounted. I will send the balance

[20-Jun-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
sent the CHIPS

[20-Jun-19 06:53 AM] peddycb#5889
yes, I did everything

[20-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
then for DEX, why is https://dex.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RP8q2GmdFdFEv4MRqDbberEwdGZSXhJmWV blank?

[20-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there should be sends of the small amounts from the various old addresses to RP8q2GmdFdFEv4MRqDbberEwdGZSXhJmWV

[20-Jun-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if you look at the old address, you will see a small amount transferred, with the second output going to RWXL82m4xnBTg1kk6PuS2xekonu7oEeiJG
https://dex.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/a06180a2ce06664941ce7201f18db05f2b2f4052f70345a6879f9f0a7700afe5

[20-Jun-19 06:57 AM] peddycb#5889
do i have to ship for dex dex or kmd?

[20-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
notice the first output is still U, that means you didnt send this smartdust to the destination

[20-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
dex for dex

ahhhhhhhhhhh ok

[20-Jun-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
each chain is totally independent

[20-Jun-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once you get all the (U)nspent dust (S)pent to the RP8q2GmdFdFEv4MRqDbberEwdGZSXhJmWV then the blockchain processor for refund will pick it up and send it

[20-Jun-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know when you have it done and i will run the refunds for all these coins

[20-Jun-19 06:58 AM] peddycb#5889
then I have the mistake with me
I will do it today and tomorrow with the assets

[20-Jun-19 06:59 AM] peddycb#5889
thanks for the information

[20-Jun-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry for the confusion, glad we figured out why it was all stuck. at least the CHIPS is done

[20-Jun-19 07:01 AM] peddycb#5889
I thank you now I am smarter

[20-Jun-19 11:20 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
No KMD refund for that 3.004KMD I mentioned before. I am concerned that I appear to be losing data from Agama installations at this point. My new agama installation has address RBVJC2B3QMGu6Bs48pn6Kg9r6bTiY17A8D and no longer shows any transaction history. My old agama address was  RUxGgzuoKqdWoXqzrbKLddCdPWhtNp6kKv. One of the addresses had the claim information and  the dust was sent to RFriua5mCN2HiDvP5Wo6TjupTWPi4wNQSV.

[20-Jun-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see that address in the claim data

[20-Jun-19 11:25 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Which one don't you see?

[20-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
when did you file the claim form?

[20-Jun-19 11:30 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
RUxGgzuoKqdWoXqzrbKLddCdPWhtNp6kKv contains the 3.004 KMD and  RFriua5mCN2HiDvP5Wo6TjupTWPi4wNQSV shows the dust transaction.

[20-Jun-19 11:30 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
yesterday

[20-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
when did you fill out the claim form?

[20-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
two parts

[20-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
fill out claim form AND sending the dust

[20-Jun-19 11:31 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
both done yesterday

[20-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i have not gotten todays claim data yet, when i do  i will process it

[20-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
plz realize this is a daily process

[20-Jun-19 11:32 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
OK... No worries. I thought it might be a tad early.

[20-Jun-19 12:47 PM] StrikerBurns#3846

can someone help recover my kmd. I did filed the form but i still haven't got replay.. RLVbbWz2JrCJzzEXaDEAPz8qZopMsVQc6T

[20-Jun-19 01:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@saby send the small balance available in that address to the new address you have filled in the form

[20-Jun-19 01:27 PM] saby#6409
okay 1 min

[20-Jun-19 01:30 PM] saby#6409
i gave huobi wallet but they not allowing deposit right now... what to do

[20-Jun-19 01:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@saby it doesn't matter, 
you have the seed phrase for this address: RLVbbWz2JrCJzzEXaDEAPz8qZopMsVQc6T
just send to the new address, it will be recorded on the blockchain
you can verify in an explorer: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RLVbbWz2JrCJzzEXaDEAPz8qZopMsVQc6T

only do this if you are sure huobi will honor the deposit of the refunded coins when their wallet comes back online

[20-Jun-19 02:16 PM] V9k#8074
hi, I ask just in case: does it exist a CLAIM form for OVAL (old asset from NXT asset exchanges) ?

[20-Jun-19 04:50 PM] peddycb#5889
@jl777c I'm through with all the chains and have sent dust :troll_king:

[20-Jun-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jun-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jun-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry for all that trouble. it really helps to keep everything onchain

[20-Jun-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have any JUMBLR payouts? i had some troubles with the JUMBLR scan

[20-Jun-19 05:00 PM] peddycb#5889
I learned myself have kmd now on ledger

[20-Jun-19 05:01 PM] peddycb#5889
no I did not JUMBLR

[20-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810

Guys , I submitted a claim form for KMD. Could you please check when can I get the claim. Original address is : RLS95JaEx1X7fD8EsyZjN3oQB9QbiHYMPr

[20-Jun-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@Tarun send the small balance available in that address to the new address you have filled in the form

[20-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Tarun#9230
@gcharang  Done : Tx ID : 4e81bb6cd24d99cb761c9962116b16004498617b171852dacf9d86f7713a78e8

[20-Jun-19 05:16 PM] spudboy999#5256
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   Are you the operator of Chickenpool?  If so I have a question about KMD payments....

[20-Jun-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@spudboy999 yes

[20-Jun-19 05:19 PM] spudboy999#5256
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   I have been mining KMD on your pool so far I love it!  However this has been showing for well over 24 hours now:   Immature coins: 1.92583812
Balance of all coins: 3.06329361   Usually Immature coins move to balance after a few hours  is something stuck?

[20-Jun-19 05:20 PM] spudboy999#5256
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   RHbirfvaUPPQuLHq5gnJ8s39dKgrko8LrP  I am this worker

[20-Jun-19 05:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
the min payout is 10

[20-Jun-19 05:21 PM] spudboy999#5256
yeah but usually payments move from immature to balance pretty quickly...I understand I am not at the payout minimum yet

[20-Jun-19 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
immature = your part of the x blocks that haven't yet hit 100 confirms

[20-Jun-19 05:21 PM] spudboy999#5256
how long does it take to get 100 confirmations?   typically....

[20-Jun-19 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
100 blocks = 100 confirms
I will check after lunch to see if actually stuck or just seemingly stuck

[20-Jun-19 05:23 PM] spudboy999#5256
ok thank you very much.  The other KMD miner has had his immature payment showing for over 24 hours as well.... FYI...

[20-Jun-19 05:25 PM] spudboy999#5256
I meant to say immature coins....not immature payments  btw...

[20-Jun-19 05:50 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@spudboy999 there seems to have been a 1 block reorg ~ 48 hrs ago that stuffed up the payment processor
I apologize for not having kept a better eye on it

[20-Jun-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@peddycb i processed them, let me know if any slipped through the cracks

[20-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Mastermind#1578

[20-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Mastermind#1578
alright ill try that

[20-Jun-19 06:58 PM] spudboy999#5256
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢   No problems  Thank you for looking into that.

[20-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Mastermind#1578
@Deleted User when i launched verus and activated in native it says missing zcash params and asking to select resource any specific i should select here ?

[20-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Mastermind#1578
also activating verus gona replace my old agama kmd wallet.dat locally ?

[20-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Mastermind#1578
but i do need to run verus once so it can make files in tho so i can replace ?

[20-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Mastermind#1578
what location verus uses to store data in can you tell ?

[20-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Mastermind#1578
gona have to run it first then

[20-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Mastermind#1578
so i had around 4 gigs of chain downloaded in previous agama can i move that kmd chain data to skip some time ? for syncing (assuming everything works out)

[20-Jun-19 07:23 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I have the location. Tell me if you‚Äôre on Windows, Linux or Mac

[20-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Mastermind#1578
windows

[20-Jun-19 07:24 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
`%AppData%\Komodo`

[20-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Mastermind#1578
so it uses same folder ?

[20-Jun-19 07:24 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Any asset chains have seperate folders in Komodo

[20-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Mastermind#1578
i have old agama installed still

[20-Jun-19 07:25 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Yes, indeed... It should even use the same Chain data on your drive

[20-Jun-19 07:25 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
As long as the old Agama is closed, you can run Verus Agama... Make sure to make a backup for your wallet.dat, just tp be safe

[20-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Mastermind#1578
i hope i did correct backup

[20-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Mastermind#1578
its scanning now

[20-Jun-19 07:26 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
If you are unsure, compare the size of the backup wallet.dat with the one in Komodo

[20-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Mastermind#1578
its same for now

[20-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Mastermind#1578
