delete old agama when done

[06-Jun-19 09:14 AM] gcharang#6833
deleting agama means the program - the installation
not the keys?
also they must have a backup of their old seed?
I will make this clear in the pinned posts

good call @Deleted User

[06-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Malti#3948
maybe add a "READ CAREFULLY" notice at the top as people tend to rush in when they think they are hacked @gcharang

I filled out and sent all the information! What to do now - is it necessary to provide some more information, for example, the phrase seeds? And how much time does it take to resolve the issue?

[06-Jun-19 09:20 AM] klein#5233
Just wait for now

[06-Jun-19 09:21 AM] dxer666#8963
verus agama is safe?  and new version without connection problem is also safe?

[06-Jun-19 09:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@lion you don't need to provide more info now
also never share seeds
we will have detailed instructuins soon

[06-Jun-19 09:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@dxer666 all versions of Verus Agama are safe

[06-Jun-19 09:23 AM] VE#4584
I did the steps

[06-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Malti#3948
ok, what is the outcome

[06-Jun-19 09:23 AM] almasya#0676
How do you understand what my funds are? In the block several addresses from which funds were withdrawn. If someone says that these are all his addresses, to whom to return?

[06-Jun-19 09:23 AM] VE#4584
but in the 5 step, i cant send the funs to new addres

[06-Jun-19 09:23 AM] VE#4584

[06-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Malti#3948

[06-Jun-19 09:24 AM] VE#4584

I filled out the form. How do you understand what my funds are? In the block several addresses from which funds were withdrawn. If someone says that these are all his addresses, to whom to return? I thought the seed needed. But the seed of the Agama is compromised. I installed a Komodo Core wallet (OceanQT). On the computer was the configuration files Agama, on the basis of their new address was generated?  I have provided this address for return. How will the communication on the return (if any)?

[06-Jun-19 09:26 AM] VE#4584

then you're done for now

[06-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Dochteur#1751
I have PIRATE, HUSH and BTCH in my agama wallet, can I send HUSH to my HUSH adress in Hushmate wallet, or should I follow the instructions here? What about BTCH I cant think of any other wallet to support it, but it is bound to my HUSH adress.

[06-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Malti#3948
@gcharang I believe you are more suited to answer for @Dochteur

[06-Jun-19 09:36 AM] VE#4584
For fill the form is need the txid of the funds leaving wallet? Have i to enter in agama for take it?

[06-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Malti#3948
txid of funds leaving the wallet is good

[06-Jun-19 09:37 AM] almasya#0676
I installed a Komodo Core wallet (OceanQT). On the computer was the configuration files Agama, on the basis of their new address was generated?  I have provided this address for return. Did you need this address on the form? is it reliable? how to access it if something happens to the computer. Do I need to save the key files? What files?

[06-Jun-19 09:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@Dochteur I have posted the general guidelines that help secure Komodo and many other assets
if you know of a wallet other than the official Agama that works, then you can definitely use it to move funds

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Dochteur#1751
I have a new adress in HUSHmate 1.0.1 so I cant transfer funds there but Im now sure about BTCH

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya did you use lite mode before, or native mode?

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Dochteur#1751
*can

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Dochteur#1751
lite

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Dochteur#1751
only

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Dochteur#1751
I used native for PIRATE

[06-Jun-19 09:40 AM] almasya#0676
Lite , txid  from kmd explorer?

[06-Jun-19 09:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@Dochteur I am not sure about Hush and BTCH, I haven't iused them, are you able to move them using any wallet?

[06-Jun-19 09:42 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya if you used  a seed before to access your funds, then you used litemode
Ocean is native mode and can cause confusion to you in the future

[06-Jun-19 09:43 AM] almasya#0676
Explain whether I filled the form correctly.

[06-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Malti#3948
@almasya  if you have provided according to the examples that are given in the form, then you probably have filed it correctly

[06-Jun-19 09:45 AM] almasya#0676
7d666294ab1e57aff5e7acb14c84fc81b8a9fd7ffec99cc37c1ca3df5bf76461     txid  from kmd explorer?

[06-Jun-19 09:45 AM] Malti#3948
that is indeed a txid that ends up in de safe address

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Malti#3948
if your full amount was sent in that txid, then that is the one to provide in the form

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] VE#4584
Fill form send it. How many time aprox to recover the founds?

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Malti#3948
if your funds were moved in more than 1 txid, please provide all of them

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya we will ask you to confirm you can access the claim address you have provided before sending the funds
at that time, please create a new seed in Agama verus wallet https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
and send that address to us

I installed a Komodo Core wallet (OceanQT) new address was generated?

[06-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Malti#3948
@almasya it would be easiest if you just follow the instructions that Gcharang is providing to you for the verus wallet

[06-Jun-19 09:48 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya yes, I understand you have already done it, but using it is difficult for a new person
Agama verus wallet https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview has the same interface as komodo agama wallet and is safe to use and you can use with a new seed

doesn't matter

[06-Jun-19 09:57 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya were you able to backup the privkey of the address created from OCeanQT?
if you want to access this address from another computer, can you do it?

[06-Jun-19 09:57 AM] almasya#0676
How are you going to contact me, I usually use email, not discord?

[06-Jun-19 09:57 AM] gcharang#6833
which contact have you submitted in the form? @almasya

[06-Jun-19 10:00 AM] almasya#0676
only discord is offered in the form

[06-Jun-19 10:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya you can look at our website once a day
or submit the form again with the email if you wish 
anyone of these options is OK

Hi again,
Include "Coin Name - Address - Amount - TXID of the funds leaving the wallet".
Just to be sure the address is my own not the one it was sent to, right?

[06-Jun-19 10:08 AM] lion#5837
@shaquiry  they beat the hacker who discovered the vulnerability in the agama wallet. The blockchain itself is safe - the vulnerability is in the old version of the wallet - the developers used the same vulnerability to save the tools and not give them to the hacker!

[06-Jun-19 10:08 AM] almasya#0676
were you able to backup the privkey of the address created from OCeanQT?
if you want to access this address from another computer, can you do it?           dumpprivkey <your R-address> ????????

[06-Jun-19 10:09 AM] almasya#0676

[06-Jun-19 10:12 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
But they lost over 400k kmd correct?

[06-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Malti#3948
unconfirmed

[06-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Malti#3948
and potential losses will be covered by komodo community

[06-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Malti#3948
in ways that are not yet defined

[06-Jun-19 10:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@almasya then it's great! the privkey you have saved starts with "U" correct?

[06-Jun-19 10:14 AM] almasya#0676
then its great! the privkey you have saved starts with "U" correct? yes     for the second address, is it different?

[06-Jun-19 10:15 AM] istante#3749
@malti all loses ? Is it confirmed? Nothing we lost?

[06-Jun-19 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
no, all KMD ecosystem privkeys are "strings without spaces and start with `U`" @almasya

[06-Jun-19 10:17 AM] Malti#3948
@istante amount of losses are unconfirmed, but I already saw a lot of goodwill from community members to be able to cover lost funds so that nobody will be 100% wiped out. Let's wait on further communications, but you can be sure that you won't be wiped out

[06-Jun-19 10:19 AM] almasya#0676
uno, all KMD ecosystem privkeys are "strings without spaces and start with U"         start from "U", but at the second address I received another answer "U" to the request, both addresses of ONE wallet. It's right?

[06-Jun-19 10:21 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, native mode has a file called `wallet.dat` which holds multiple addresses
please read: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000025198-how-to-backup-restore-komodo-or-assetchain-wallet-dat if you haven't already @almasya 
every address starts with `R` every privatekey starts with `U`
