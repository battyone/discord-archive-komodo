Newbie here. Installing komodo manually on debian.  Komodod had crashed twice in a row for me. It stays up for a while and then stops. I'm also running a pirate chain and it's fine. Hasn't stopped. First question. Where do I look to see what's happening to komodod

[12-May-19 05:53 AM] Pixelised#9067
If for example you're running a Hush3 node, you'd look in "/home/pixelised/.komodo/HUSH3/debug.log". Where "pixelised" is your current logged in user and "HUSH3" is whatever coin or assetchain you are using.

[12-May-19 05:53 AM] Pixelised#9067
@allbits

[12-May-19 07:27 AM] zatJUM#9924
Where do you run komodod? If in background it won't be easy, just the logs

[12-May-19 07:27 AM] zatJUM#9924
If you run it in a screen/tmux, just fire it up

[12-May-19 01:06 PM] allbits#5898
I'll look at logs. Thanks

[12-May-19 04:27 PM] allbits#5898
"Error: out of memory. Terminating"

Meanwhile pirate chain soldiers on

[12-May-19 04:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
And what about "free -h"? Do you have swap on?

[12-May-19 04:44 PM] allbits#5898
No I don't

[12-May-19 04:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
Perhaps you should!

[12-May-19 04:46 PM] zatJUM#9924
I think if you run komodod only it will be fine, and pirate only too, but both without swap is not possible unless you buy more ram üòâ

[12-May-19 04:49 PM] allbits#5898
Ok. Thanks

[12-May-19 04:50 PM] zatJUM#9924
You can create a swap with a file

[12-May-19 10:09 PM] 27aume#8635
I was wondering, does the komodoelection website was kept up to date with the github repo of proposals? Seems like some proposal changed seen the beginning of the election and theres 2 different proposal for some candidates.

Just curious and letting you know.

[12-May-19 10:13 PM] phm87#7395
@27aume  you can check the changes (mostly server location) performed to the proposals on the PR list:

Hello, is there a chat room to get updates on Barterdex?

[13-May-19 01:36 PM] Chief Crypto#2529
Still have some KMD there and cant seem to withdraw it.

[13-May-19 01:45 PM] SHossain#0007

[14-May-19 03:16 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249

[14-May-19 03:18 PM] phm87#7395
I think that you should replace komodoplatform by jl777

@SHossain for komodo and pirate

[14-May-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can

[14-May-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
or better use `beta` branch

[14-May-19 03:39 PM] SHossain#0007
beta should be more stable

in a few months you will be able to launch a stablecoin denominated in any fiat, backed by any crypto, with just a few extra -ac options

[15-May-19 01:10 AM] allbits#5898
So what's best practice for shutting down the test asset chain permanently

[15-May-19 05:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@allbits if you have shared the chain launch params with anyone, the chain will live on depending on what they do with the params (it's out of your control now)
If only you know the launch params, do:
```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=<NAME OF ASSETCHAIN> stop
rm -rf ~/.komodo/<NAME OF ASSETCHAIN> 
```

on all the nodes the chain has been launched. Now the chain is gone permenantly

How can i convert my HUSH to HUSH3? When i try send  HUSH to exchange my local wallet say me "incorrect address" and exchange support say that i must to convert my HUSH to HUSH3. How can i do this? Thx.

[15-May-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@SergeF do you have your HUSH address private key? if so, just use restore wallet function of Agama 0.3.6 with that private key

[15-May-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto did HUSH team create any guide on how to migrate their coins from HUSH to HUSH3?

@SergeF if you need to create a new HUSH3 address, just use the Create new wallet function to create a new address using 24 words passphrase. that will generate an R address which is compatible with HUSH3 , KMD and all other KMD assetchains.

[15-May-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain i need to sell my HUSH i don't need HUSH3 address, but thx

[15-May-19 03:02 PM] SHossain#0007
you can't sell HUSH anymore i believe. you need to convert them first to HUSH3

[15-May-19 03:03 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have your HUSH address private key? if so, just use restore wallet function of Agama 0.3.6 with that private key

[15-May-19 03:03 PM] SHossain#0007

you can use our paper wallet to get hush/hush3 keys

[15-May-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the exact curl command you are using? please post here along with full komodo.conf content. (edit the user and pass value on both)

[15-May-19 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
it seems, you are binding the daemon to use local only `bind=127.0.0.1`

[15-May-19 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
remove this line or comment it out in the conf file and restart daemon

[15-May-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
i hope this could be the reason for not allowing any other ip other than 127.0.0.1

[15-May-19 03:46 PM] SHossain#0007
both

[15-May-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
also, you may want to comment out `rpcconnect=127.0.0.1`

[15-May-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
not exactly sure if this is causing any issue. dont' think so

[15-May-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
have you tried any other method or rpc call?

[15-May-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
```
curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbestblockhash", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/
