make a new raw xtn and try again

[11-Jun-19 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus since Overwinter network upgrade (part of Sapling stuff), transactions are valid until `nExpiryHeight`, which defaults to 60 blocks in the future, or ~ 1 hour  with KMD. in raw xtns, you can set it to any value you want, not sure all RPCs allow modifying it

@jl777c hi, i'm wIting for refund. Can i know if it is all right or there is any problem with my claim?

[11-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you didnt get it yet, there was some issue with your claim, most common problem is that you didnt send the smartdust from the old address to the new address

[11-Jun-19 02:45 PM] angrygnat#7242
I did it

[11-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
then contact @SHossain to resolve the claim discrepancy

i have create a new adress with the new wallet but i dont understand difference between PIN (i cant copy this one for save it,  password, and seed

[11-Jun-19 04:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
Any webwallets I can use?

[11-Jun-19 04:00 PM] gcharang#6833
seed is the most important
pin and wallet name are tools for convenience
@trankil

[11-Jun-19 04:01 PM] gcharang#6833
you must backup the seed

[11-Jun-19 04:01 PM] gcharang#6833
do you have the seed from old wallet?

[11-Jun-19 04:01 PM] trankil#0217

Hi .. will u b contacting us that you'll b refunding us, so we  know when to send back the dust kmd?   or will we need to constantly check in the explorer of our old compromised address that a dust amount was deposited to it..?   Thanks.

[11-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
dust has already been sent

[11-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to send the dust before the refund is processed

[11-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jass#7796
my compromised address has over 7777 KMD.

[11-Jun-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i already processed all refunds that have been properly claimed

[11-Jun-19 04:17 PM] gcharang#6833
@jass dm me old address will check

[11-Jun-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but that requires sending the smartdust to the new address

[11-Jun-19 04:19 PM] jass#7796
ok. thanks.   I'll check the old address in the explorer.   I created my new address using the Komodo-cli command line.    How do I send the dust amount?  I can't use Agama wallet to send the smartdust to the new address.

Hello everyone, hello team-komodo.  Just a question.  I startet Verus-agama. So when i generate the seed and put in the new Pin and Pin File name, the  registerbutton is still not clickable. Any ideas? Thanks

Ahh, good to know. Thanks!

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] ETcrypt#3306
I have filled out the form received the smartdust in old agama on the 7th, sent it to new agama on the 9th, haven't received my tokens as yet. How can i find out if there is any issues with my claim or if anything else is required from my end

[11-Jun-19 06:21 PM] RJF#6619
Question: I received the "dust" and sent back 0.0005 but now see the new instructions said to send it all back. Is this a problem?

[11-Jun-19 06:33 PM] kalfster#2695
@RJF you should not send it back, you should forward 0.0001 to your new safe address

[11-Jun-19 06:35 PM] kalfster#2695
more precicely; your whole balance if there is more

[11-Jun-19 07:15 PM] RJF#6619

When I tried to send the Chips dust to the new R addr I got this msg " invalid pub address "

I see my KMD in Agama wallet . Can I just send it to my Ledger?

[11-Jun-19 10:13 PM] matspb#7829
Getting a little worried. I sent the dust to the address  as required. No KMD restored yet.  I made things more complicated by asking you to change the address after I had already submitted one. (I sent in a 2nd claim form with the new address, which is what I was advised to do here.) I'm worried this has caused a mess-up.

@SHossain  Compromised address: RHafdDeTXkhchFKiMRDfUdHDF6JMWqjsW9     original request to send to Ocean qt wallet:  RA3mQoH4VaW9VMH58KhFE6kQYF7C6mkXrv    (I think it was this: I seem to have 2 receive addresses in the qt wallet.)  There is no KMD in either of them. In the end I actually sent the dust to new Verus Agama wallet: RD7PbypjtkD6TLLgerbTtegWsA8r7Y85Lt and would like the KMD to go there too.  You will have two claim forms from me, the Agama one 2nd a couple of days after the other one. I'm sorry I also forgot, I think, in the 2nd claim to mention that there were two amounts of KMD that needed restoring. They seem to have been moved from the compromised wallet in 2 separate transactions. I neglected to mention the smaller amount when I set the 2nd claim form in. You can find both amounts mentioned in the original claim. Thanks for your help. Sorry to make hassle. I should have left it alone and moved the total to the Agama myself later.

[11-Jun-19 10:32 PM] SHossain#0007
@matspb wait for next batch of refund to be processed for you.

[11-Jun-19 10:32 PM] SHossain#0007
