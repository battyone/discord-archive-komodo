@richardt anything used from a lite mode seed in the past ~3 months

[05-Jun-19 02:06 AM] zaius333#5338
What about if I have 0.3.4?

[05-Jun-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
cd komodo; ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh

[05-Jun-19 02:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
using native takes longer and it's a kind of a pain to wait for the chain to sync every time but shit like this makes it worthwhile.

[05-Jun-19 02:07 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Can't find it

How do I transfer out coins without using lite or native mode?

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
@Petrus you don't need to wait for it to sync. You can create an address immediately.

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô yes but there is no user friendly way to do it

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
Can we import our seed in a different wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Petrus#8039
@Alright but how can i send them to  this new address?

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Tell me the unfriendly way

[05-Jun-19 02:12 AM] dudezmobi#1945
how about inputting WIF in agama? is it affected?

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] zaius333#5338
I have my secret phrase

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Alecandro#1179
hopefully this all blows over quickly and easily

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Petrus#8039
@Alright my plan is to load my corrupted seed in kmdocean and then send it to my ledger

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Alecandro#1179
FUD to shake out the weak hands lol

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Alecandro#1179
jk

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
@Petrus can we do this ?

[05-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Alright#0419
@dudezmobi if you used it in lite mode, it's affected. If you simply imported it to native mode wallet, it is not

[05-Jun-19 02:14 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
So open native mode and import the seed ?

[05-Jun-19 02:14 AM] Petrus#8039
@gixxerfrog i think it should work, but the syncing takes at least 24 hours

[05-Jun-19 02:14 AM] SHossain#0007
@Dark download the zip from here which already contains `fetch-params.bat` and double-click on it to download zcash params https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/download/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-3/komodo-qt-win.zip

[05-Jun-19 02:15 AM] dudezmobi#1945
is verus agama affected?

[05-Jun-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
VRSC's fork seems unaffected. You should still move coins to a native address or paper wallet.

[05-Jun-19 02:16 AM] zaius333#5338
What to do after installing versus wallet?

[05-Jun-19 02:16 AM] SHossain#0007 (pinned)
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Please remain clam and move your funds securely. Exchanges are not affected.
PROTIP: You do not need to sync any of the blockchain to make an address. Just start native mode, use `getnewaddress` call, after you get the address, use `dumpprivkey` with the address.

**What wallet can I use?**
0. Use Verus version of Agama to create new seed and address first, then login using your old seed to send funds to the new address you created https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Paper wallet (best to use in offline computer) - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024508-paper-wallet-guide
2. Use native mode from source - https://github.com/jl777/komodo
3. Use pre-compiled binary for native mode - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/beta-multios-0.3.3b-2 
4. KomodoOceanQT wallet - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ - guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet
5. Ledger
6. Send to Exchange (if you trust CEX)

[05-Jun-19 02:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
For example, I recently used a BTG WIF to log into BTG lite mode. I just moved the funds out of Agama

@criptobear yes, if agama knows that seed

[05-Jun-19 02:19 AM] SHossain#0007

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] criptobear#6402
can i keep pirates in verus agama?

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you have a seed phrase for KMD and ARRR, and you used that seed phrase in agama lite mode....

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
I would sweep funds

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
