I have a suspicion that I still have some funds in a zeroconf address from using BarterDEX a while ago. I remember there were some issues with withdrawals using the GUI at the time.  I

Is there an easy way to check on this, with barterdex being deprecated?

[06-Jul-19 09:42 PM] njappboy#7808
I submitted the recover request form and followed the directions to send the SUPERNET from the team, here: https://supernet.kmdexplorer.io/tx/bf640849ba086d7df79a38134092104df98feec5cff1b7bf37e084c652c74a1b

I then sent the full amount to the new destination address I used when submitting the recovery request form RUW4AS3wwSfF1dN4S7Re3HW3ukMj1tj9ww
Here is that transaction: https://supernet.kmdexplorer.io/tx/8ebeb68a8221288383dc12e2079d93f6c21df6a084237bbc4e4eb6b4f2242966

I want to send some chips from agama, but always get wallet notification: Invalid pub address.
Although the address is correct. What is the reason of this notification?

If I use my seed to login to verus agama Lite mode I get an address. If I log in using the pin name and password I get a different address. Is this normal behaviour?

[07-Jul-19 10:21 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
An unrelated query... agama sometimes shuts down in a few seconds. but sometimes takes 4 - 6 hours. Any clue as to why?

[07-Jul-19 10:25 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Are you saying native mode CAN take that long to shut down and its normal?

[07-Jul-19 10:40 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I reckon there's another one and it goes like this. Create a new wallet in Lite Mode (KMD). Copy and paste seed into notepad and save notepad. Repaste seed into confirm field. Type a seed encrypt key into notepad and save notepad. Enter encrypt key into agama field and confirm field.  Save QR code. Toggle custom name off. Hit register.  It's very difficult to make a mistake when done like that. The account will open. Copy the address and save in notepad.  This will be the address that seemingly cannot be got at again. Logout. Now login using the PIN and password and I can get a different address. The trouble is this happens only 'sometimes'. The very first account setup seems to be involved. Possibly  'Toggle custom name off'. I have repeated this a number of times now and as I'm trying to recover an account I'm being extremely careful. Reddit posts show a few other users having similar difficulties and komodo seem to bellieve its always user error. I beg to differ. I think there's a bug.

[07-Jul-19 10:41 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
My system is windows 7, updated with all 'important'  updates. There's a whole slew of other updates not installed. Java is fully updated if that matters and so is .NET. I've reproduced this on 2 computers.

Hey Guys. I send 2 Transaction to my Agama Wallet today but on only 1 is the locktime set.. any ideas? :/

[08-Jul-19 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
if the transaction came from an exchange the nlocktime wouldn't be set

[08-Jul-19 03:17 PM] palfrun#5361
Both transaction came from an exchange but different ones

[08-Jul-19 03:18 PM] palfrun#5361
How can I achieve setting up the locktime?

[08-Jul-19 03:19 PM] palfrun#5361
I've read here somewhere that i should send it to myself, is that correct?

[08-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Malti#3948
Yes that is correct

[08-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Malti#3948
Send your full balance to yourself and then the full amount will get into locktime

[08-Jul-19 03:39 PM] palfrun#5361
thank you!

[08-Jul-19 03:41 PM] Malti#3948

But in versus wallet in Android it's not showing claim option

[08-Jul-19 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no claim button in Verus Mobile wallet. if you sent all your funds to your same address, most likely that accrued all rewards

[08-Jul-19 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your address?

[08-Jul-19 05:43 PM] PTYX#6840
@Naveenkhichar you should be able to use the Verus wallet seed in Chameleon Pay and claim your rewards on mobile

Ok thank you sir and please tell me how many times can I accrued rewards in a month

[08-Jul-19 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no limit. but with 28 KMD in your wallet, you should claim only 1 time a month
