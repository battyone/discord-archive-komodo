round about the time I realized that the "public release" was a perpetual beta and left the insiders program

[02-Jul-18 02:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
just run a vm and do it right 
there's only so many layers of shit you can stack before the base gets squishy

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, are you using NOMP or znomp classic?

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
kmd-nomp

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
k

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
all that seems to work fine

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
i have zero issues in the environment

[02-Jul-18 02:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
just this one thing when I reach current block height

[02-Jul-18 02:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
""sh: 1: cannot open user: No such file" comming from kmd-nomp?

[02-Jul-18 02:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
no

[02-Jul-18 02:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
from the console running komodod

[02-Jul-18 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
regardless of nomp running or not

[02-Jul-18 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
nomp throws the getblocktemplate error

[02-Jul-18 02:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
did you check the komodo debug log?

[02-Jul-18 02:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
which makes sense if komodod is choking

[02-Jul-18 02:26 AM] xRobeSx#5136
If youre running kmd-nomp which is probably from my repo, and is outdated. I should delete it

[02-Jul-18 02:26 AM] xRobeSx#5136
z-nomp is more current and includes komodo @daemonfox

[02-Jul-18 02:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
well ty

[02-Jul-18 02:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
but my issue occurs before nomp

[02-Jul-18 02:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
that is the first occurence of an error in the log

[02-Jul-18 02:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
happens over and over

[02-Jul-18 02:27 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Oh okay. I’ve just had others tell me of issues with the kmd-nomp repo and I haven’t used it in a while

[02-Jul-18 02:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
got it to take shares for a bit but stratum fails everytime the getblock fails during this komodod error

[02-Jul-18 02:29 AM] xRobeSx#5136
In your komodo.conf is blocknotify setup as <user> like you posted above or your real username?

[02-Jul-18 02:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
i was just thinking i must have pasted yours instead of the edited line from my text file

[02-Jul-18 02:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
yup

[02-Jul-18 02:30 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Yes my example was setup as <user>

[02-Jul-18 02:30 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Hopefully changing that fixes it for you

[02-Jul-18 02:31 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Make sure to restart komodod

[02-Jul-18 02:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
already killed it

[02-Jul-18 02:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
ill check back in shortly to let you know for sure... other than the super long compile and block load... I almost have a whole pool living on Win 10 no VMs

[02-Jul-18 02:35 AM] xRobeSx#5136
That /home/user directory was for Linux though. If you’re on Windows @daemonfox it will be a bit different

[02-Jul-18 02:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
im on the Win 10 embedded Ubuntu 16.04

[02-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
If we have encrypted seed

[02-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
we only have 1 address right? Is there still an option to claim interest using that method

[02-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I really need to safeguard my kmd now LOL.

[02-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
and where is it located if I want to save it? 

\Roaming\Agama/spv-cache.json doesnt exist

[02-Jul-18 05:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Putting in my wallet seed in the bottom part without inputting password takes me to the same address as my encrypted one, whats the use of a password if the phrase still logs in? Sorry a bit confused 😛

[02-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Acura#2748
how can I increase the value of MAX UTXO Size ?

[02-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Acura#2748
I had deposited via Speed Mode in BarterDex  V1.10  - but now i don´t see it if i click on the Deposit History, same with a another account - Anyone that can proof if this working in the V1.10 ?

[02-Jul-18 10:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User your seed will always work. The encrypt+password option is a quality of life feature where agama stores your seed in a text file and encrypts it with your password. Now you don't have to type/copy-paste seed everytime. Because typos when typing the seed will generate different addresses and user may not notice and lose funds. If your encrypt password is weak and an attacker got access to your seed file(created by agama and encryped), he can brute force your seed file by trying passwords again and again until one works.

[02-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ah makes sense. Are there any limits to wrong attempts? Or unlimited

[02-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
also where can I find the .pin file? Cant find in the komodo folder

[02-Jul-18 10:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
and copy pasting the location in explorer doesnt seem to find it either

[02-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
So safest method is saving the .pin file somewhere secure like an encrypted usb (no need to store the seed phrase anywhere at all) and use that to access funds

[02-Jul-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <gcharang:matrix.org> no safest method is to save your seed written on a paper and storing it securely. Digital data can be lost in any number of ways. The encrypted text life is just for making users's life easier

[02-Jul-18 10:54 AM] gcharang#6833
Don't backup your agama encrypted seeds in cloud services

[02-Jul-18 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
@Acura if the tx is in blockchain it is there and your speedmode should be working

[02-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Cox11#1791
hi guys tonight ive tried to log into agama spv lite and its keeps telling me  "connection error, trying to switch to other server"

[02-Jul-18 10:58 AM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User also the .pin files are not supposed to be handled by the end user. But if you want to know, in ubuntu: ~/.agama/shepherd/pin

[02-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Acura#2748
@Cox11  which Agama version ? Latest is 2.41

[02-Jul-18 10:58 AM] gcharang#6833
If someone gets access to your .pin file, they can try unlimited times

[02-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Cox11#1791
@Acura 2.38

[02-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Acura#2748
@SHossain Speed Mode is working, but it´s not showing me the deposit - that´s a little bit strange - but its ok 😄

[02-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Acura#2748
@Cox11 please update

[02-Jul-18 10:59 AM] gcharang#6833
.pin locations:
```
OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Agama/shepherd/pin

WINDOWS: %appdata% → Roaming →  Agama → shepherd → pin

LINUX: ~/.agama/shepherd/pin/
```

[02-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Cox11#1791
@Acura thanks, will try now

[02-Jul-18 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
@Acura i don't know the exact reason. it works, but doesn't show tx history.

[02-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Acura#2748
Ok no problem 😃

[02-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Cox11#1791
@Acura i updated. now it works. thanks

[02-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
where in windows? @gcharang  sorry!

[02-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
got it

[02-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks!

[02-Jul-18 12:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
Morning! @xRobeSx  thought it wouldnt be long but komodod is still validating notary txes to activate the best chain. At ht 481K and counting! Cloned z-nomp so just waiting.

[02-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
If im ever inactive for a long period of time or gone for a while, theres no chance there will ever be an update to agama that changes how seeds or encrypt work, or anything that could go wrong right? @gcharang 
Hypothetically if say I dissapear for 10 years and come back, there would still be a way to get into my pin file? 😛 Just gotta make sure

[02-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
securing all my funds on all my wallets and coins today

[02-Jul-18 12:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Morning @daemonfox you’re about halfway there, blockheight is at 903661

[02-Jul-18 12:57 PM] xRobeSx#5136
And you should be fine @Deleted User. You could always use paper wallets though

[02-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gonna be extra paranoid from today on 😂

[02-Jul-18 01:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
Did anyone piece together a vanitygen for equihash?

[02-Jul-18 01:01 PM] gcharang#6833
Even if the then latest version had different settings and ways to save/encrypt seeds, your current pin file can always be able to be decrypted by you if you know the password @Deleted User

[02-Jul-18 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alright appreciate it! Just wanted to double check, seen a few coins where shit like this happened and people got fucked LOL. So good to know

[02-Jul-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
vanitygen has nothing to do with mining algo

[02-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Hermes#6934
@Deleted User  I will suggest to store your seed in a safe space or vault , is always good to have a back up for any scenario

[02-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Hermes#6934
a vault is always good

[02-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, stored a copy in my safe, but in the case that it gets damaged, I have a usb hidden somewhere with the pin 😛 Heres to hoping I never have to use it haha!

[02-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Hermes#6934
nice

[02-Jul-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you didnt safe the actual passphrase?

[02-Jul-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
then you are assuming the encrypted file will be intact

[02-Jul-18 02:00 PM] Hermes#6934
Yep just in case decrypt the seed in the wallet and save it ...and you should be fine. Storing the seed in the encrypted file can be also a liability if the PC gets damaged or of any data corruption that can occur

[02-Jul-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I would safe the full seed or wif in the secure safe place

[02-Jul-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
that way it doesnt rely on any file to never get corrupted

[02-Jul-18 02:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_has the wifs of his cold storage wallets in an encrypted USB and the encryption key is the SHA-256 of the 1st ISO he ever downloaded from MSDN_

[02-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yep seed on paper, laminated and ordered in a way no one else would understand 😛 Next to a usb. Just in case you know 😂  maybe rats would get in and eat it hahahaha

[02-Jul-18 04:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
the binaries are from March sadface

[02-Jul-18 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[02-Jul-18 04:48 PM] AngelaTrishia29#1877
hello, i download the latest release of your platform and its not working i used to open the exchange with passphrase and this always happens "starting barterdex, please wait..."

[02-Jul-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it takes a while to load on winduhs

[02-Jul-18 04:50 PM] AngelaTrishia29#1877
aww okay so i need to wait?

[02-Jul-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, can take up to 5-10 mins on some win10 builds
