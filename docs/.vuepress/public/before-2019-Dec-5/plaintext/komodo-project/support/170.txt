Good Morning, I had a question for Komodo Devs here, Have the PrePackaged Windows Binaries Been Compiled Yet For HempCoin THC?

[05-Aug-19 02:10 PM] BlackMarket#6984
The windows wallet binaries have to be prepackaged in linux, then updated on the KMD github. There was a pull request, and a beta fix was created, but it has to be approved by KMD before it can become an official release.

[05-Aug-19 02:11 PM] BlackMarket#6984
The windows users over at hempcoin would be very greatful if you guys can check this out üòé

[05-Aug-19 04:46 PM] Mastermind#1578
so every one facing issues with sync ? with new version of wallet v0.5.7-4

[05-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Mastermind#1578
i might have missed something earlier read this on release page *annual notary election fork is scheduled for July 15th, at Komodo block 1444000* what does this means ?

[05-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Mastermind#1578
i am stuck on block 1444001 üò¶ with grey white text

[05-Aug-19 04:59 PM] arkiii#7710
im getting this error and not sure how to resolve. "A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 267 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety." any help would be appreciated..using (Komodo Ocean Linux )

[05-Aug-19 05:01 PM] scotts#5859
My Agama Wallet repeatedly gets stuck activating best chain upon opening , despite throwing away everything in the komodo application support folder as you recommend. It will open to around 98-99% and the information  about my komodo tokens is always correct although not functioning. It opened to 100% once. In addition, when I close or quit Agama, it never re-opens. I get a message: "Error starting KMD daemon. Port 7771 is already taken!"  Can you help?

[05-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Mastermind#1578
:PeepoThink:  no one here who can help ?

[05-Aug-19 05:45 PM] phm87#7395
@scotts when I have this error msg, usually it means that kmd daemon is already running (or another process is using 7771 port). You should check your process list to make sure kmd is turned off before relaunching it (windows: ctrl alt del. Linux: ps aux | grep komodod     or     htop)

[05-Aug-19 05:46 PM] phm87#7395
If you never did this, maybe it is easier yo reboot computer before starting kmd. If ghe issue occurs again, maybe it is another process using 7771 port, we can help you to identify the process

[05-Aug-19 05:49 PM] phm87#7395
@Mastermind please make sure you use an uptodate version (I don t know verus wallet versions sorry). In worst case, tufn off kmd, check it is turned off (see my msg here above to scotts) then delete everything in .komodo folder except wallet.dat (make a secure backup of it). Then restart the sync. You can download and "unzip" (in .komodo folder) a bootstrap to save some hours

@phm87 i am on latest version so you saying i should redownload the whole blockchain and try again ? uff ill give it a shot lets see

[05-Aug-19 05:59 PM] phm87#7395
Use a bootstrap it can be quick.

[05-Aug-19 06:00 PM] phm87#7395
Abt your pb, I am not 100% sure. If I search the error in discord I think that I will find solution

[05-Aug-19 06:02 PM] phm87#7395
And youmust use a new version of kmd. After the hardfork of NN

[05-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Mastermind#1578
all this forks are forking me up ::troll_lol:

@phm87 all good its working fine now properly synced

[05-Aug-19 07:04 PM] Mastermind#1578
@nick21 you can try the same thing as me download bootstrap and resync wallet

[05-Aug-19 07:04 PM] phm87#7395
Osx is a different beast

[05-Aug-19 07:05 PM] phm87#7395
Yeah it is the reorg stuff. It can be quicker to use the param and restart wallet instead of downloading everything

[05-Aug-19 07:06 PM] phm87#7395
@nick21 I think you can stop the wallet then restart it with this param https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/459072527323365390/601368753325735936

[05-Aug-19 07:08 PM] phm87#7395
If it does not work, you can do as @Mastermind did but be careful to backup securely wallet.dat (after wallet stopped). It can take a while but it can be speeded up with a bootstrap that you download then "untar", see explanations and links above

[05-Aug-19 07:09 PM] nick21#7094
okay thanks

Hello Support.
Hello, I could not make my KMD claim for reasons of time yet. I can not access the new KMD address that I entered in the form because I can no longer find the seed. Did it over smartphone with Chameleon made. Then I generated a new address via the Agama Desktop wallet and filled out the form a second time. I have also installed the Agama Pbaas Versus Wallet according to instructions and can not get any further. Problem is the given address in the first form. I need help. I hope it is not too late.
