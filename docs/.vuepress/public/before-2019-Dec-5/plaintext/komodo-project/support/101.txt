if the seed was compromised in the last 4 months it is already insecure. you using it onemore time won't increase the risk

I had obtain private keys via Ledger seed to enter in agama lite, Am I affected?

[05-Jun-19 09:08 AM] gcharang#6833
@cypto yes. move to another address in ledger that hasn't been touched by agama

[05-Jun-19 09:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@cypto if you entered the ledger seed in agama, then that is considered compromised too

[05-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Is it my old adress that I should type in the form or this adress that all my coins were sent to?

[05-Jun-19 09:09 AM] cypto#6248
I did it about 6+ months ago

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Can I use my ledger adress as a destination ?

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Mr.Cryptodude yes, if you didn't use your Ledger's 24 word seeds on Agama

[05-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Anyone else cant update ledger 1.4.2 to 1.5.5?

[05-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
deleted all apps, cant see the update on ledger live or ledger manager

[05-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
just says 1.4.2 is latest

[05-Jun-19 09:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@cypto you entered ledger seed in agama 6 months ago? its not considered compromised, but better be safe than sorry
https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement
follow instructions here to secure them

[05-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Nika.gavvafa#8034
if my seed more than a year, I can use Argama app continue... on phone?
use "receive only
It's safe...?

[05-Jun-19 09:13 AM] figgy132#7531
What the fuq is happening??

[05-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Brian_Crypto_Vulture#9591

[05-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Brian_Crypto_Vulture#9591
This project is toast

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Warkid#2117
Is this the exit-scam?

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] TimC#3334
So I created a new seed using the veruscoin agama and sent the unmoved coins to new address. I see two TXs out large one to  RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF and a the rest (small TX) to this address RWXmNq2EgDgknZs2uaJ3ETs2nnhwqczAtQ

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] cypto#6248
@gcharang Thanks, I'll generate a new seed then.

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Warkid#2117
transactions do not work

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Brian_Crypto_Vulture#9591
So you have to be a computer genius to get your funds out

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Brian_Crypto_Vulture#9591
Great

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Guys, you literally just log in then send out into any other place thats not the latest komodo agama

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Its not an exit scam and you dont have to be a genius üòõ

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Brian_Crypto_Vulture  what version or what agama

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
@SHossain   My ZEX is now showing up.   Can I send my ZEX to  my new ARRR address (that I created on VRSC agama)?

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Brian_Crypto_Vulture#9591
V0.3.4

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] justpip#5610
Hello. I downloaded the Verus version of Agama as suggested. Generated new Lite mode wallet and on the page where you write your Wallet Name  and Encrypt Key (PIN). Keep getting an error message however **Seed storage error. Pin name can only contain alphanumeric characters, dash "-" and underscore "‚Äì"**  I have only entered a mix of letters and numbers (nothing else) but keep getting this error message.

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] SHossain#0007
@Brian_Crypto_Vulture  read the 2nd pinned post from this channel carefully

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Crypto Rich  i think kmd address only, arrr might be z address and zex needs the regular ones

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
make a kmd litemode address is safest i believe

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
ok @SHossain

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] gcharang#6833

@Crypto Rich tx need to be confirmed. as long as you sent the ZEXO to the new KMD address. all is good. You can't send ZEXO to ARRR address

@Nika.gavvafa if you haven't entered it in agama in the last year or used the wallet at all in the last year
they are most probably safe and leave them alone for now

[05-Jun-19 09:19 AM] DakuS#8750
I'm trying to send rfox from agama to coineal exchange address but it gets stuck on processing transaction message.
