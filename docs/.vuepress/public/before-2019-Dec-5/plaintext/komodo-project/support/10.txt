I believe so yes. Until there is another tx

[03-Jul-18 07:27 AM] adaptive_action#2809
ummm

[03-Jul-18 07:27 AM] adaptive_action#2809
very interesting

[03-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If the funds are in your wallet, then you have the funds

[03-Jul-18 07:28 AM] adaptive_action#2809
*another tx from the exchange

[03-Jul-18 07:28 AM] adaptive_action#2809
?

[03-Jul-18 07:28 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i sent from an exchange

[03-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Hang on one second, let me double check all this to makee sure I'm not giving you bad info

[03-Jul-18 07:29 AM] adaptive_action#2809
okay

[03-Jul-18 07:29 AM] adaptive_action#2809
thnks bro

[03-Jul-18 07:30 AM] adaptive_action#2809
pls also ask the exchange status

[03-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
No problem

[03-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And OK, will do

[03-Jul-18 07:32 AM] adaptive_action#2809
if so, i guess the exchages status will stay as processing for years :))

[03-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Daniel CP#2020
OK so I messaged @SHossain , who is the head of support and an all-around KMD wizard so he'll provide definitive answers when he comes online

[03-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But I just logged into my AGAMA wallet to double check what I told you and i'm pretty sure it's correct. For example, transactions from early April are showing over 100K confirmations

[03-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Whereas more recent tx only have a few thousand confirmations

[03-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think it just keeps going up indefinitely. If the funds are in your wallet, you shouldn't have anything to worry about

[03-Jul-18 07:46 AM] adaptive_action#2809
okay many thanks Daniel CP

[03-Jul-18 07:47 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i ll try to sent them back for checking guess it will help

[03-Jul-18 07:47 AM] adaptive_action#2809
me to clarify more

[03-Jul-18 07:47 AM] SHossain#0007
Which exchange did you send from @adaptive_action ?

[03-Jul-18 07:47 AM] adaptive_action#2809
binance

[03-Jul-18 07:49 AM] adaptive_action#2809
if the balance is okay it is okay for me but regarding to new comers if someone send from binance to AGAMA the tramsaction status will be forever as processing and that is not a nice view i  guess

[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] SHossain#0007
what is your Agama KMD address? 
when did you issue the withdraw?

[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] SHossain#0007
how do you access Agama? Native mode or Lite mode?

[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] adaptive_action#2809
lite mode

[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] adaptive_action#2809
it s been nearly 2 hours i huess

[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] adaptive_action#2809
guess

[03-Jul-18 07:51 AM] SHossain#0007
have you seen the balance in Agama wallet?

is that ?

[03-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Acura#2748
That's an issue for Binance - we can't influence that.

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
it is about users

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i ll also ask to binance

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] SHossain#0007
Is that happening in Agama?

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
and i ll send some kmd to binance wallet

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
from AGAMA

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
lets cross check

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i ll check now

[03-Jul-18 07:57 AM] SHossain#0007
Is that happening in Agama?

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
or Binance?

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] adaptive_action#2809
Binance

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i wrote above

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
this is not binance support

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] adaptive_action#2809
ohh my god

[03-Jul-18 07:58 AM] adaptive_action#2809
that s the community i guess

[03-Jul-18 07:59 AM] adaptive_action#2809
i just wanted to warn you about a problem but look what you are saying

[03-Jul-18 07:59 AM] SHossain#0007
if you send KMD to Binance wallet from Agama, that will need 120 block confirmations, about 2 hours.

[03-Jul-18 07:59 AM] adaptive_action#2809
it is for your good guys

[03-Jul-18 07:59 AM] adaptive_action#2809
never mind

[03-Jul-18 08:00 AM] adaptive_action#2809
have a nice day

[03-Jul-18 08:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@adaptive_action This really is not a problem. In normal financial transactions, if your bank says transaction is being processed and it is taking  a long time then that is a problem. But here you can verify that your address has the expected amount of funds in both your own agama wallet and in a block explorer which are the reliable sources of information. So whatever the Binance webpage shows, if you got your funds, you got your funds. Their servers might have been busy or buggy. As long as you only you control the private key of an address, only you own the funds in it, irrespective of binance website shows.

Regarding confirmations: It is the number of blocks that have been added on top of the block which had your transaction. Therefore the more confirmations your agama is showing, the more secure your funds have become. This is also not a problem with KMD(because of dPOW).  The number of confirmations in agama is increasung because that is how blockchains work.

what is the unique identifier for a user's trading profile on BarterDEX? couldn't a user just create different wallets and escape poor trading behavior marks? i understand that a user is probably incentivized to want to build their reputation.

[03-Jul-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, rep isn't currently fully functional

[03-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Hermes#6934
There  have been requests for a KYC version of Barterdex to identify users for the moment is not developed we may see more in the future also

[03-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Acura#2748
KYC ? üòÑ Who wants a KYC on a Dex?

[03-Jul-18 05:55 PM] KevinS#0577
^agreed

[03-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Well those are requests it can happen in the future

[03-Jul-18 05:55 PM] KevinS#0577
just wondering, thanks

[03-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Acura#2748
If that happens that KYC is obligatory on barterDex , then i will dump all my Dex Assets

[03-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Acura#2748
Thanks anyway for the info

[03-Jul-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as will many of us

[03-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Hermes#6934
No, I am  talking about Barterdex users requesting information to make their own version of a Dex

[03-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Hermes#6934
There is no point for it in Barterdex

[03-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Acura#2748
Thx4clarify hermes

[03-Jul-18 05:58 PM] KevinS#0577
is the BarterDEX GUI going to get continuing support or is it all HyperDEX now? is there a differentiation between the two platforms if both are getting continued Komodo team support?

[03-Jul-18 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
both GUIs have separate audiences and teams and both will continue separately

[03-Jul-18 06:01 PM] KevinS#0577
got it, i assume BarterDEX pro users vs HyperDEX grandma users?

[03-Jul-18 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
They share the same backend
BarterDEX is meant to be a full reference implementation
Hyperdex is meant to be lighter and more beginner friendly

[03-Jul-18 06:03 PM] KevinS#0577
much appreciated üçª

[03-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Hermes#6934
Yep that‚Äôs correct they are just two different GUIs

[03-Jul-18 06:54 PM] PTYX#6840
@Acura a KYC layer on a Dex is possible and I can think of several use cases

[03-Jul-18 06:56 PM] PTYX#6840
It might not be something Komodo will focus on but it's interesting for several industries to implement KYC-enabled atomic swaps of assets and contracts.

[slack] <kso> Hi Komodo support, regarding the creation of a Komodo AssetChain using the komodod command  with the -ac_supply switch, we want to start off with 270 Million supply then increase to 270 Billion coins. However in the guide it says keep the max coin supply to 1 Billion to avoid 64 bit overflows. So I just want to confirm is it not possible to configure for 270 Billion coins? Thanks.

[04-Jul-18 08:17 AM] StakeSourcePoS#8603
@Hermes Can I just install new wallet and choose not to erase old info?

[04-Jul-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a limit on the ac_supply, if coin emissions gets you to 270 billion, you will need to avoid having all the coins in a single utxo as that would create overflow issues

[04-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <kso> Thanks very much @jl777c. So to confirm it is possible to set -ac_supply with 270 billion when creating the Komodo AssetChain as long as later on we don't have any single utxo that exceeds 1 Billion?

[04-Jul-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[04-Jul-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_supply is basically the premine

[04-Jul-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you can start with ac_supply=270000000

[04-Jul-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
then your ac_reward would presumably be big to reach 270 billion
