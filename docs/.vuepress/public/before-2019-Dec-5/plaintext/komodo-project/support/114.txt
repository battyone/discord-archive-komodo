@Kay Gee the seed that was used in old agama is compromised

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
you should create a new wallet in verus agama and generate an address

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Ok

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Kay Gee#2313
I‚Äôve just googled magnum crypto

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Kay Gee#2313
And that is another wallet

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Do I need this to transfer funds?

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
once you have that address you can close verus and re-open it to import old seed or i found magnum or chameleon pay to be quicker as you don't need to close, re-open etc

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Is that what the fellow above was saying

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Ok

My plan is to install Verus on two machines. On my crypto only wallet laptop I'm going to create a new seed which will generate a new address. On a different PC I'm going to install Verus again and import my compromised seed and transfer funds to the new Verus generated address on my laptop. I will start with a small amount and check it went through, both via the laptop wallet and the block exploer: https://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/ Once I get my KMD back, I'm likely going to move it to a ledger address.

on a positive note: ocean wallet seems to have improved greatly since I used it the last time. zero issues, which was not the case for me in the past!

[05-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Can somebody please help me import key on verus?

[05-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Can‚Äôt find option, or even where option might be

[05-Jun-19 06:03 PM] mato121#5963
How safe is to store funds on magnum wallet untill agama is fixed

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] TonyL#3577
@Kay Gee Are you using native or light mode?

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Think i worked it out buddy

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Kay Gee#2313

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] bamby#5307
I cant move my KMDice coins. It says
Error:

Going to import w private key

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Feels very dodgy

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Ugh

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Fuck

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Private key is not seed, is it?

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] ionstar#5362
This Verus agama is taking a very long time to close... it's been sitting here in "Please wait" mode for over an hour.

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] blubbi#0643
Agama (v0.5.6a-beta) safe?

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] bitcoinstrader#6920
Is coinomi safe???

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Apparently the seed is an invalid private key

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Kay Gee#2313

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] blubbi#0643
@bitcoinstrader  nothing is safe if u used it in agama

[05-Jun-19 06:08 PM] blubbi#0643

Seed = mnemonic phrase?

[05-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Mische#6695
yes

[05-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Apparently invalid mnemonic

[05-Jun-19 06:10 PM] StrangerHereMyself#7652
was there any ETA given regarding post-mortem publishing?

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Kay Gee#2313
It keeps coming back with invalid mnemonic...

Any reason to not use komodo web wallet ? The pinned post doesn't say

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
it means that's not your seed.. or there's something missing

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] crumb#2550
i used Verus version Agama v0.5.6a-beta. and created VRSC addresses in light mode. was it confirmed safe? also used  https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/ to move coins from my old addresses. do i need to redo with latest verus version?

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] TonyL#3577

here I was having problems starting up the Agama wallet to move my funds out. I was able to use the https://guarda.co/ web wallet to enter my pass phrase and import the wallet. I was then able to move my funds.

[05-Jun-19 06:15 PM] osyed#0739
@crumb No once you move the funds using the Guarda wallet, you don't have to redo it.

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
@crumb Verus Agamas are safe, and thats ok that you used web wallet to send out

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Most important that you not used it for new seed creation and not logined with new seed into it

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Kay Gee#2313
@mrlynch hi, what could be missing? It is one hundred percent definitely my seed

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Kay Gee#2313

For Lite mode users:
https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview download that
it is safe
first create a new wallet (new seed)
note down the address
then import the old seed (compromised), send all funds to the new address
if "electrum error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
