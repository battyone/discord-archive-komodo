What is jl777' IQ level?

[21-Jul-19 04:53 AM] Drunk#0496
Is he a genius?

[21-Jul-19 05:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[21-Jul-19 06:08 AM] Drunk#0496
What is his IQ?

[21-Jul-19 06:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
777 petaflops. The Networked AI construct known as JL777 is not measured in IQ points

blind followings lead to tragedy.
jl777 is just C programmer.

[21-Jul-19 07:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He is, just like Linus Torvalds was just a programmer or Katherine G. Johnson was just a mathematician.

Please don't confuse following someone like Justin Sun and following someone like jl777.  It is like in crypto, you trust but you verify. For most that have been following James for years now, he has proven that he is not just a regular C programmer. He has the foresight to see what will be coming years down the track and is building what is needed today for that eventuality.

[21-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
@kmdkrazy plz stop polluting my channel with nonsense. there are far more innocent people trapped in KYC nonsense than the few bad guys doing bad things. if the logic is to prevent all bad things regardless of the cost to others, it seems putting everybody in prison is the only solution. i believe in freedom, not police states and imprisoning people. if you want to be able to control what everybody does, you are in the wrong place

[21-Jul-19 09:39 AM] acidbird#7266
Hi James, initially i thought that antara is free of charge but when i tried to launch a chain i ended up on the cart page where i had various options with the total cost of almost 9000 usd a year. Who is getting the money and how are they used?

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] acidbird#7266
There is even a yearly price for atomicdex listing..

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the fees are for server costs and integration fees, it goes to pay for servers and integration costs, any profits go to the team

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you do not have to use composer

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have more time than money, you can do it all yourself

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have more money than time/expertise, you can use composer

[21-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810

[21-Jul-19 09:42 AM] acidbird#7266
Ic, ok, thx. As for the atomic dex listing listing is not free of charge? Projects will have to pay every year?

[21-Jul-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought it was a onetime charge, maybe mislabeled. if there isnt any fee at all, then it seems atomicDEX gets flooded with a bunch of spam coins. and tell me how the listing fee compares to listing fees for other exchanges? it seems for the typicaly listing fee at most exchanges you can pay for years of server costs

[21-Jul-19 09:45 AM] acidbird#7266
It says atomicDEX listing $700 per year, atomicDEX Mobile Wallet Listing $1500 per year

[21-Jul-19 09:46 AM] acidbird#7266
Ok, thx for the info.

[21-Jul-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if a project cant pay $1500 do we really want people trading it? this is for brand new projects without any existing chain

[21-Jul-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if it is annual or onetime, i am not directly involved with pricing things

[21-Jul-19 10:00 AM] acidbird#7266
Well, it depends, there are exchanges which do charge, others have rules for listing (for ex. liquidity pools, tokens for trading competitions, etc.). and don‚Äôt charge. The same goes to dividends. With all these new approaches i still can‚Äôt get the benefit of holding KMD and it is possible future value, it is more like a brand cost which depends on overall visibility of the ecosystem. 5,1% is a good thing but it doesn‚Äôt help if the token has no value or its value depends on some indirect things. Hopefully we will see more kmd trading activity with dex launch but really i don‚Äôt see key or main value proposition here for KMD or still missing smth.

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins! - jl777 - Medium
I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform ‚Äúwhy should anybody hodl KMD‚Äù. Implicit in the‚Ä¶

[21-Jul-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
by your logic only coins that charge taxes have any value

[21-Jul-19 10:01 AM] acidbird#7266
Yeah, i read all your posts, checked it already

[21-Jul-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
people in the KMD ecosystem use KMD, therefore as the ecosystem grows, so does the usage of KMD

[21-Jul-19 10:01 AM] acidbird#7266
Nah, it is a mixture of different things in my opinion not only taxes

[21-Jul-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
DOGE, LTC, they have no value according to your logic

[21-Jul-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the benefit of holding them?

[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] acidbird#7266
So you see KMD more like a LTC or DOGE tokens?

[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
let us imagine an atomicDEX that is doing significant amounts of trading, with every coin having a KMD pair

[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
with the best spreads

[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] acidbird#7266
No benefit really, i don‚Äôt hold them and never will üòä

[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
then having KMD is equivalent to having the best price for all the coins it trades against

[21-Jul-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought a long time about why LTC has such value

[21-Jul-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
my conclusion was that it was due to it having liquidity and not much else

[21-Jul-19 10:04 AM] acidbird#7266
This is true hopefully we will get good market share and liquidity

[21-Jul-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
by making KMD the default currency in atomicDEX, it will become the currency people park funds in, waiting for good prices on other coins

[21-Jul-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
while they do this, they get 5% APR

[21-Jul-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it has never happened before where a high liquidity coin that you can have orders pending, is also paying 5%

[21-Jul-19 10:05 AM] acidbird#7266
So you see it more like a stable coin then
