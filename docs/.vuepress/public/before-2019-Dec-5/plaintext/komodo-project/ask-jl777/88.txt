There are examples of KMD miners that have both burnt fees by not collecting them as well as "burning" some of the block reward (not really burning but not creating the full expected supply)

[19-Sep-19 01:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
One of the defining features of centralized vs decentralized virtual currency is the ability to remove from circulation  ( according to fincen at least )

[19-Sep-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
a miner can burn the txfees, just by not spending them. those will be gone forever

it's a more elegant solution

[20-Sep-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not just elegant, it's the only way to have real financial privacy. Transparent addresses reduce the privacy of zaddrs drastically

[20-Sep-19 08:49 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Doesn't trading into or out of ARRR reduce privacy as well?  Can't you send to or from your own zaddrs without anything but the transparent outcome being visible?  I guess I don't understand the superiority of this trade off.

[20-Sep-19 09:37 PM] costa2439#3771
When atomicdex is at full capacity do you think it can cause a swelling of the non-scalable blockchain until it is inoperative?

¬† Taking into account that in atmicdex all transactions are in the blockchain and in centralized exchanges they are out

[20-Sep-19 10:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@peritonlogon Pirate transactions can have no transparent outputs, unless it's to send data for dpow protection. Only notaries can send taddr xtns, and only miners receive coinbase taddr. Mined finds must immediately be sent to zaddr and can never be sent back to a taddr by normal addresses

[20-Sep-19 10:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@costa2439  KMD has a baked in belief of making new chains and compressing UTXO history, so I don't see AtomicDEX causing unfixable problems with scaling

@dukeleto   I get that.  But if I'm trading into ARRR, the account I'm trading from IS transparent.  And if I'm trading out of ARRR the account I'm trading to IS transparent.  afaik most uses of crypto require transparency.  So, explaining to me how dividing zk-transparent into two chains is better than one requires more than just telling me how ARRR works, it requires explaining to me why it is better than being on 1 chain.

[21-Sep-19 04:59 AM] Regnar#6164
@peritonlogon because of Z pool size and the fungiblility differences. When it's on one chain, someone can see 10 coins go into Z address, and 10 coins go out. If the pool is small enough (and it almost always is with t and Z chains) then this analysis is very effective at beating privacy.

Z pool size is a good way to protect against this, but still is only really effective if people send into the Z pool uniform amounts and leave them in the Z pool for random amounts of time. Jumblr was designed to do this actually, break balance into specific amounts (100, 10, etc) and send into z pool, and send out at random times, this way everyone's "in" and "outs" were the same sizes... but even still, the pool was too small to effectively mask transactions.

[21-Sep-19 05:01 AM] Regnar#6164
Having it on a different chain means that not only is the Z pool nearly 99.9%, coins going "in" ie. Buying ARRR, don't have to come out as the same coin. 

So instead of KMD going to Z and the same amount of KMD coming out. Now you have N amount of BTC going into ARRR Z, and coming out as ETH, or KMD, or any other coin.

[21-Sep-19 09:21 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
And why it needed and unique to kmd

[21-Sep-19 11:25 PM] Regnar#6164
@mrtzmp3 nSPV - is a wallet type that is exclusive to the Komodo ecosystem. Traditional SPV wallets (lite wallets, like mobile, or websites) don't download the whole blockchain, but download the headers from the whole blockchain, if the headers all line up, it can be pretty sure that it's address/transactions are correct. This however downloads ALL the block headers, which can actually become quite a bit of data, especially as blockchains grow longer, and a wallet might handle dozens of coins.

nSPV does the same thing as SPV, except instead of downloading ALL of the headers, it pays particular attention to Notarizations (exclusive to Komodo) The wallet treats the notarization basically as the beginning of the chain, as it is infeasible for anyone to change the info before a notarization. This means nSPV wallets are hundreds, if not thousands of times more efficient than SPV wallets. It uses a tiny amount of RAM to verify transactions and makes it ideal for IoT and low computing power devices like watches.

Apollo is NXT fork and you know NXT better than anyone else. Is it even possible for Apollo to be private?

[22-Sep-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
not unless they added a totally new privacy method, like zcash did to bitcoin

[22-Sep-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
without a team of skilled privacy devs, this would not be possible

adding to @Regnar 's explanation, one other major benefit of nSPV is that, a normal komodo full node can serve the data required by a nSPV wallet
this is in contrast to normal SPV wallets which need dedicated Electrum servers which can only take so much load (as the number of concurrent users increase, more Electrum servers are needed)
so nSPV tech helps in scalability(not in tps but in number of lite clients supported) too

p.s: Testing the capacity of the various Electrum servers used by AtomicDEX is one of the objectives of the upcoming stress test

[22-Sep-19 01:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@gcharang there are 2 types of SPV clients
- Electrum based SPV clients as you explained. this doesn't need to download data, and only send queries to the Electrum SPV servers on the IP:PORT list they have.
- SPV clients which directly connect to the blockchain's p2p network and download required data.

[22-Sep-19 02:40 PM] gcharang#6833
@grewalsatinder got it
but no one seems to use the second kind because of the current sizes of the major blockchains?
any wallet that says lite/spv seems to be using the electrum version

the libbtc repo james forked for libnspv seems to have the second type of SPV but I don't think many people use that flavour of SPV for BTC 
it became a good tech for KMD solely because of Notarizations

[22-Sep-19 02:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
breadwallet uses that, and the bitcoin mobile wallet, and I guess Mycelyum too uses the SPV client method connecting to p2p network.

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there must be more

[22-Sep-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c here is a crypto unrelated tech question-
what IDE do you use?
I know there is a spectrum from vim/gcc up to stuff like clion and this is an interesting fundamental question..
I used pycharm for some stuff in python and I sort of really hated it (bloated container ship that could hog your whole computer just to tell you that your code style was not according to pep1217 or whatever), but it had some features I did not want to miss-
what about c programming?
sublime is a cool text editor with syntax highlighting, but these bare bones things usually only work for 'helloworld'
Do you use some make or automake?
I was exposed to makefiles 15 years ago and it is rather an art, not an exact science...

[27-Sep-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i usually just put #include "sourcefiles" to avoid linker issues

[27-Sep-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
IDE... if vi is considered IDE.
