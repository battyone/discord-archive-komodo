yes he can, its at regular intervals

[26-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
It's not every X blocks

[26-Jun-18 10:31 PM] ProficieNt#3097
jl told me ðŸ¤” however, on demand assetchains are notarized every 2nd block so this attack becomes way way less effective (censorships would be hard to pull off for longer than a few blocks)

[26-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Alright#0419
You and I can test your theory if you like, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort. I don't believe notarizations happen every x amount of blocks

[26-Jun-18 10:34 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c aren't notarizations at regular intervals?

[26-Jun-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
They happen at regular intervals, but it's not easy to predict when *exactly* one is about to happen

[26-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
broadcast your selfish chain a block too soon and an honest miner can mine the next block

[26-Jun-18 10:36 PM] ProficieNt#3097
you can predict which block but ofc not time

[26-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
broadcast too late, and the public chain is already notarized

[26-Jun-18 10:36 PM] ProficieNt#3097
no, you know which block height the chain will be notarized at

[26-Jun-18 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
I'll have to wait for jl to chime in on that, but I don't believe that's true

[26-Jun-18 10:39 PM] ProficieNt#3097

will wait for jl to confirm if its the case for this discussion

[26-Jun-18 10:45 PM] ProficieNt#3097
but like I said, the more often the blocks are notarized the less likely a majority miner completes his chain faster

[26-Jun-18 10:56 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization rounds start for heights that are 0 mod duration

[26-Jun-18 10:56 PM] jl777c#5810
duration being 2, 5, 10, etc

[26-Jun-18 10:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"The BadMinerA can reject the GoodMiner blocks and outpace them. This way, if they dont comply with his censor list, they wont get their blocks mined"
@ProficieNt How do you propose that happens?
If you imagine that BadMinerA  is rejecting the blocks from "good miners" then you have to assume that BadMinerA is, factually accepting NN blocks or mining a dead fork
In any other situation, at the point of notarization, BadMinerA would have to *always* get the next block in order to continue the attack and that's simply against the Law of Averages

[26-Jun-18 10:59 PM] ProficieNt#3097
The bad miner only needs to build X blocks faster than a good miner

[26-Jun-18 10:59 PM] ProficieNt#3097
It's not a simple statistical chance

[26-Jun-18 11:00 PM] ProficieNt#3097
If notarizations are infrequent, the chance that the bad miner finishes first grows exponentially with hash power and duration in between notarizations

[26-Jun-18 11:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The only way the "attack" would work is if BadMinerA had 100% of the hash
even if BadMinerA "outpaced" the other 40%, "good miners" would have to ignore both BadMinerA and NNs in order to never get a block

[26-Jun-18 11:00 PM] ProficieNt#3097
The bad miner is mining privately

[26-Jun-18 11:01 PM] ProficieNt#3097
A hyperbole example:

- Notarization every 100 blocks
- Attacker has 99% hash power

[26-Jun-18 11:01 PM] jl777c#5810
oliver is right

[26-Jun-18 11:02 PM] ProficieNt#3097
The good guys don't have a 1% chance of winning the race

[26-Jun-18 11:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if BadMinerA is working on a private chain, then BadMinerA is working on a higher diff in order to complete the attack and the 60% becomes < 50% effectively

[26-Jun-18 11:02 PM] ProficieNt#3097
They have an immensely small chancd

[26-Jun-18 11:02 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie howd you figure that?

[26-Jun-18 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
reorging each time so his chain gets notarized allows a censorship attack. not a double spend, but censorship

[26-Jun-18 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
reorging right before the notrization happens

[26-Jun-18 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
like "my blocks are genuine" ?

[26-Jun-18 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for a pure PoW assetchain

[26-Jun-18 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
making it have a PoS component would avoid this

[26-Jun-18 11:03 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Basically the chance and duration of a successful censorship depends on the frequency of notarizations and the percentage hash power that is byzantine

[26-Jun-18 11:04 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c are we talking Casper FFG style hybrid or how do we do this?

[26-Jun-18 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think at 5 blocks it is not very practical

[26-Jun-18 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=50

[26-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c How can I predict a notarization? Don't they sometimes take a couple blocks for notaries to "agree"?

[26-Jun-18 11:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not saying that it's not possible to do, I'm saying that it's economically infeasible and impossible to sustain.

[26-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
could you tell me block heights for DEX, for example

[26-Jun-18 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the height of the notariztion is at known heghts

[26-Jun-18 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
not the block the notarizztion gets confirmed in, but what is being notarized

[26-Jun-18 11:06 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie please go research selfish miner attack, there are plenty of economic games to be played in pure PoW

[26-Jun-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
then the random block +/-1 ntrz could just fuck that prediction

[26-Jun-18 11:06 PM] ProficieNt#3097
At 5 blocks per Notarization you need to have a serious chunk of the hash power to do this successfully

[26-Jun-18 11:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so the censorship attacker gets his private chain being notarized by publishing it when he is ahead of the public chain

[26-Jun-18 11:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@ProficieNt I've literally done what you're suggesting; I don't need to "research it" ðŸ™„

[26-Jun-18 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems it is a matter of time before bad luck makes you unable to reorge

[26-Jun-18 11:07 PM] ProficieNt#3097
But if you can add a pos component you can potentially negate all this

[26-Jun-18 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=<perc> sets the PoS percentage to the specified amount

[26-Jun-18 11:07 PM] ProficieNt#3097
The problem is that probability scales exponentially in this scenario. So with each % more hash power I buy the time it takes for chance to process a successful how at notary goes up by a big multiple

[26-Jun-18 11:08 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Pure pow chains won't work unless they are notarizing almost every block or have a decent chunk of hash power

[26-Jun-18 11:09 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c where can I read up on the stake mechanism?

[26-Jun-18 11:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a utxo based staking

[26-Jun-18 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Also, of note:
by the time there is any probative economic incentive to carry out such an attack at any sustained level, I have faith that we'll be far moved on from the current things.

[26-Jun-18 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
all addresses are hashed to be in one of 64 segments

[26-Jun-18 11:10 PM] ProficieNt#3097
That's like saying it's okay to build a flawed system because we'll build a better one in the future

[26-Jun-18 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
each block, one of the segments will be eligible first, every 2 seconds the next segment becomes eligible

[26-Jun-18 11:11 PM] ProficieNt#3097
All addresses refers to what pool of addresses?

[26-Jun-18 11:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"That's like saying it's okay to build a flawed system because we'll build a better one in the future"
No, that's saying that you're imagining a scenario in tech that, literally, changes every day

[26-Jun-18 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so based on coinage and stake you get chance to win a block, but the frist 2 seconds only 1/64th are eligible

[26-Jun-18 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
100 blocks age before can stake

[26-Jun-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this 64 way segmenting makes it hard for majority stake to dominate

[26-Jun-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this 64 way segmenting makes it hard for majority stake to dominate

[26-Jun-18 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it is possible for a small minority stake to get disproportionate blocks if the others are not paying attenction

[26-Jun-18 11:13 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Thanks @Alright

[26-Jun-18 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
basically we get 64 different staking battles

[26-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
A new block is eligible to be staked 1 second after median blocktime. For example, segid0 for a given height will be eligible to submit a block 1 second after median blocktime, whereas segid1 will be eligible to submit a block 2 seconds after median blocktime. For the next block, segid0 from the previous block will now be segid63 and will be eligible to submit a block 64 seconds after median blocktime. This means by 64 seconds after the median blocktime, all segids are eligible.

Should this say 2 seconds?

[26-Jun-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
I remembr  it as 2 seconds. let me check

[26-Jun-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 2 seconds

[26-Jun-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
proper allocation of funds in segments becomes like a mining

[26-Jun-18 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to see how each segment is distributed and your incentive is to move coins to the underweight segnents

[26-Jun-18 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is what everybody might do, so maybe better to wait and see

[26-Jun-18 11:16 PM] ProficieNt#3097
I have to read how staking works

[26-Jun-18 11:16 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Does staking actually mint blocks or give you an edge at mining?

[26-Jun-18 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it mines a block

[26-Jun-18 11:17 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Hopping off now, will look into staking tomorrow. If it's safe, seems like a great solution to the PoW censorship problem

[26-Jun-18 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the PoW diff adjusts very quickly to the specified percentage

[26-Jun-18 11:18 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Is it based off any existing staking mechanism?

[26-Jun-18 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the previous 100 blocks are used to see what it has been and the PoW diff multiplier adjusted

[26-Jun-18 11:19 PM] Alright#0419

Does staking just award blocks or do stakers have to process blocks?

[26-Jun-18 11:20 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Like do stakers have to be online?

[26-Jun-18 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just like being a miner

[26-Jun-18 11:20 PM] ProficieNt#3097
If so, would a miner on a private chain have his private chain halt or would he be on a higher diff

[26-Jun-18 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact the staking does mine at easy diff

[26-Jun-18 11:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
PoS = ultra low diff PoW that 1st requires existing coinage

[26-Jun-18 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
mining on a private chain without stake will be difficult

[26-Jun-18 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
on average 64 second time delay

[26-Jun-18 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
hard to have the longest chain

[26-Jun-18 11:22 PM] ProficieNt#3097
So, on a public chain, if 1 in 10 stakers is offline

[26-Jun-18 11:22 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Does diff adjust to speed up for the other stakers

[26-Jun-18 11:23 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Or does the chain just become slow as people go offline

[26-Jun-18 11:23 PM] jl777c#5810
diff adjusts if the blocks are coming in too slow

[26-Jun-18 11:23 PM] ProficieNt#3097
And why doesn't it adjust for private chains?

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, sure it will adjust but to a 2 minute ave blocktime

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Or does it take a bit of timd
