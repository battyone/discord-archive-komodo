@jorian that existing projects are written in jumbles of js doesn't mean that it's useful for them to stay that way
imo, we would truly benefit from a move away from reliance on electron and the need for 200+ modules towards apps that have code that is necessary

And maybe go to C right after?

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] jorian#4555
ok, QT could be one

[17-Jan-19 04:48 PM] jorian#4555
python - C is maybe a leap, but possible

[17-Jan-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you want to "jump in" on an existing project, then js is a "need to know"
If you want to create lasting apps that appeal to users, there are many GUI options that work cross-platform with different backend languages
Full disclosure: My answers are colored by my bias against the fad of using glorified web pages as "apps"

[17-Jan-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found C fine... After learnign it first, it made JS hard... It really depends on what you want to do. Python comming from C is like talking english.

[17-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Ocash#5347
So, can someone learn QT as a first programming language or get there after learning C or Python?

[17-Jan-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
learn C first, if to pick. most other languages are derived from C

[17-Jan-19 05:20 PM] Ocash#5347
Great! I guess C is the way to go.
Thank you all. This discussion was very helpful. I really appreciate all the information  You all have a great day!

I see WebAssembly as effort to replace JavaScript with core languages....
so for better programming stack, C/C++/Rust/Go ... any core language should be fine... better start learning them today if new to programming... but sure, just get the concepts clear from HTML/CSS/Js too

Hi, what happens with JUMBLR after "Z-Transaction Functionality Is Moving To A New Interlinked Chain". It will working with the new chain?

[18-Jan-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will work on KMDCC chain

[18-Jan-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and its revshare from DEX is still intact, so not a big change to JUMBLR

Hello @jl777c  I have a question it is not directly  linked with KMD but linked to the blockchain. I am testing one competitor  of KMD they claim to have 2 sec block time what I did is to send 5000 transaction via script and I have noticed some steange things:
1 - the sender wallet ballance was jumping up  and down it goes 0 then 2min later to 1000 then 0 then 500 and eventually it went to 0 
Same thing with reception adress
2- my script log the response when sending transactions and i have notices that after some time is start to respond  with not enought funds and later it was send a teansaction and then not enoughr funds and send 5 or 6 trabsactions later

[18-Jan-19 04:32 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
My question is , do you think that it is the normal behaviour of blockchaon or there is something worng and my trabsaction are causing forks

[18-Jan-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
likely it is due to change utxo

[18-Jan-19 04:33 PM] jusoaresf#3291
if it's utxo based it can be normal

[18-Jan-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
to do a more controlled tx throughput tests make 1000 (or 5000) utxos

[18-Jan-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
of the required size

[18-Jan-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
cant rule out reorg issues, but it could just be unconfirmed change outputs

[18-Jan-19 04:51 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
No it is not . It accounting based. True POS based on nxt code

[18-Jan-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, then it does seem strange, but do the balances end up what it should

[18-Jan-19 04:54 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
Yeah it does because the block reorg but as i sent all the transaction to the same address it is ok but what if i was sending to an exchange and and to my slef it could endup with double spending no

[18-Jan-19 04:55 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
?

[18-Jan-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if enough confirmations are not waited for so the amounts converge, then yes it is a problem

are there anyinfo if kmd coins were hacked also in cryptopia?

[19-Jan-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
havent heard about that, not that I have any hotline into cryptopia. my understanding was that their ETH wallet was hacked, another advantage KMD ecosystem has with the independent chains, which also have independent wallets. with ETH wallet hacked, all the ERC20 were accessible.

Staking KMD - Using similar methodology to that mentioned in "Z-Transaction Functionality Is Moving To A New Interlinked Chain" would it be possible to add staking to KMD?

Usability and we’re into mass adoption.  I think getting games involved will be tipping point.
With chain migrations testing in #kmdlabs its not too far fetched to embed coin daemon into pc games.  Mobile will rely on lite mode integration somehow - proxy rpc or via web service and a bit of trust for roaming fun

Crossposted from ccgeneral to have jl777 thoughts on this system

[30-Jan-19 06:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Wow, I just realised something, but I'm having 1 problem of certainty. A company my company works with uses a system called LPS for supply chain management of car parts and to make sure each part individually goes through all the processes by making a log of when it goes from station to station with an attatched anotator  of whether the part passed or failed the previous process based on parameter window limits. A blockchain is literally keymade for this type of part of tracking but would decentralized nodes holding the database fair better than a Centralized super computer server managing this kind of push/pull query. Honestly on second thought it definitely has to be better, because of the local data holding over a Centralized server having to do pushes and pulls whereas a blockchain only has pushes.

[30-Jan-19 06:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Is my logic sound at the end

[30-Jan-19 06:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Having local databases that are queryable should be infinitely faster than having to do pulls from a central server that is also managing every pull and push of multiple machines that are integrated into this system(every cell has a LPS drop to log and pull down info of said process and to check if said parts previous process was successful based on an independent review of parameters against hard coded limits{not able to be edited by low level programming personnel}).

[31-Jan-19 07:35 AM] Mylo#8306
hi @BlackJesus 
This tech tuesday has a supply chain scenario.   have a look at the json data structure, and see if something similar will fit in your car part scenario.   if it's just checking somethiing off, it's changing the state of some json object maybe.   each tx to blockchain just adjusts state.   just becomes a GUI integration with object's state changes i guess...

@jl777c 
The info under ```nextblockhash``` from ```komodo-cli getblock <hash>```, when available, is looked up  (not included in the block we are looking at) right?
Like, the node replies with info from the block we asked for and, this bit, from what it currently accepts as being the next block?

it will show nextblockhash but that info i not on that block  itself (?)

[01-Feb-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```$ komodo-cli help getblock
getblock "hash|height" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for the block.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about the block.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about the block and information about each transaction.```

[01-Feb-19 01:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jusoaresf The nextblock hash cannot be on block itself as blocks are not modified when next block arrives. That info is shown from the deamon as it knows for each block which one is previous and which is the next.

[01-Feb-19 01:14 PM] Mihailo#5902

result.push_back(Pair("previousblockhash", blockindex->pprev->GetBlockHash().GetHex()));
