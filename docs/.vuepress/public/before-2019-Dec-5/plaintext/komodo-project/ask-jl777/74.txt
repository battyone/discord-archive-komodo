that gets me a 3x, and then i work 16hr days when i am coding, and also weekends, so that is 140% of 2x, so almost 10x more than typical

[26-Jun-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so just my time in crypto, maybe it is approaching 77 years worth...

[26-Jun-19 07:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if you followed that habit of working 10x and if that is like treated as 77 years of coding experience, 
77 / 10 = 7.7 yrs :abusedsmily: 😅 
you are too damn young James!

what are you thoughts on this 
miketout Yesterday at 5:18 PM
at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.

Ive just seen that komodo only has EMC2, GAME and GIN as 3rd party dPow projects. Ive arrived to that info asking me why any projects are interested in joining kmd platform. Are we doing commercial tasks with this objective? Is there any protocol or guide to help us making the first contact with other devs currently working on eth to swipe to kmd?

[27-Jun-19 03:06 PM] tese#3502
If I'm not wrong, we're trying to get more users in the network with new projects and this is working every time better. I imagine that there are more people developing i eth rn that looking to develop in kmd or another tech, so the best way to get traffic could be taking projects from eth as we tried some months ago

More to the point... are the Barterlly and other tools performing the swaps paying into these three?

when one of the revenue earning assets achieves about 1 million USD worth, i process the revshare and it goes out proportionally

[27-Jun-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
there was about 2 mil worth paid out in dec 2017 to CRYPTO (SuperNET, REVS)

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  i thought barterlly was using atomic swaps and not escrowing the coins temselves...

[27-Jun-19 05:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thanks @jl777c I have one old SUPERNET just hanging out.  I remember there being an info graphic on how these revenue assets flowed. I want to pick up more of each and would be looking for more info on that.

[27-Jun-19 05:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@daemonfox barterlly and barterdex are different things, the former is a third party service, an automatic escrow for otc trading. barterdex is the atomic swap dex.

@tese SIN, CHIPS and HUSH also integrated DPoW into 3rd party coins (Hush later became an asset chain but it was the first Zcash fork to add DPoW). Other coins are also working to add DPoW to their external codebase. This is a guide geared towards devs for adding DPoW to an external coin: `https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md`

@jl777c here is some more info about the project :i would like to build on Komodo.I really think it can be of value for Komodo as it will show that projects can be build in a better way than,lets say eth. For my project i need a governance  platform.In order to govern members have to integrate their smart contract into the platform.The DAO will act in the physical world .The coin is the asset or represents a part of an asset in the physical world.Tangibles like land,water,food,rare earth minerals a.s.o.The smart contract should be the certificate of ownership the coin the representation of the asset.Through the platform the DAO members make proposals and vote on using the ownership mass to create wealth.Benefits from using the ownership mass in the physical world would be paid out 100% to the participants .The platform should include also a DEX where members can swap their benefits ,if they want to ,into other cryptocurrencies. The platform should also include the possibility of staking the coins at a yearly rate.Also it has to be able to offer lending at best rates for the members.To include some fun members should be able to play games.Komodo's documentation shows that all this can be done on a Komodo asset chain.We already have assets in place but in order to implement a first proposal we have to partially crowd fund.I would like to use the Komodo white label crowdfunding  dApp for this purpose.To be able to implement this we need the participation of dev's knowing their way around the Komodo Blockchain.For benefits of course.

nobody wanted to sell in any volumes

[28-Jun-19 11:44 AM] crumb#2550
interesting... as volumes even on DigitalPrice have dried considerably. Graviex and CryptoBridge having issues. all this should be a good opportunity for miners to clear out some of their holdings OTC.

it wont be hard to do the daemon side supporting rpc/p2p calls, the most of the work is the nSPV client software

it will only work with notarized chains

yes 100x to 10000x more efficient than normal SPV, after struggling to read https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf

[30-Jun-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810

flyclient i am sure is a fantastic thing, but the deep math, and complex logic... i prefer something so simple a 2 minute blog post can explain it clearly

[30-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@jl777c can you explain the implications this new solution offers? Both for kmd and for other coins? For a non tech person 😛

[30-Jun-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
SPV wallets allow lite wallets to only download header data (and a little bit more per utxo)

[30-Jun-19 11:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Lite clients are lighter now 😛

[30-Jun-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but for a blockchain with a million blocks, that is a million headers (2GB)

[30-Jun-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
which isnt so lite... non-equihash coins have 80 byte headers so the problem is really bad for equihash coins

[30-Jun-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that means for a normal SPV wallet, you would need to sync 2GB+ of headers before you can validate the utxo, and each utxo needs merkleproofs on top

[30-Jun-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV, on average each utxo needs 20kb of headers and the usual merkleproofs

[30-Jun-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so a wallet with 10 utxo would need 200kb vs 2GB of headers

[30-Jun-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
10000x difference in bandwidth and it is so small, it doesnt even need to be stored locally

[30-Jun-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the issue of attacks is dramatically mitigated as only a single honest node is needed and all dishonest nodes are immediately found out as the notarizations cant be forged

[30-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this is called superlight clients

[30-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it will basically achieve the same performance level of electrum servers, without any servers

[30-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the scalability issue quite completely

dPoW required for nSPV

[30-Jun-19 11:17 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I was reading because of PBaaS. PBaas chains get notarized... So your solution may very well work there.

[30-Jun-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it will. the MMR used for pbaas is a different thing

[30-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV is just a simple solution for superlight client that leverages exiting dPoW data

[30-Jun-19 11:55 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Will this new tech add value to the KMD ecosystem or will it just help blochchain in general adoption

[30-Jun-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you tell me. it applies only to komodo based chains that are dPoW notarized

[30-Jun-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont work with non-dPoW chains

@jl777c How can this nSPV be made available on mobile clients? Right now there are 2 types of mobile lite clients:
- Electrum SPV based, which uses a user specified Electrum Servers
- Native SPV clients, like Mycelium or BreadWallet or Bitcoin Core wallets which directly connects to the p2p network of blockchain, as I understand,

So, what would be the way for making these nSPV clients available on mobiles? What kind of development needs there are in implementation?

[30-Jun-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, do you think you can do something with this BreadWallet SPV C code to enhance it to adopt nSPV?
