as it has the notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
chain B would never get above 1 "confirmations" as it never got a notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so anybody on chainB wouldnt honor any payment

[08-Dec-18 08:27 PM] sgp#7572
that's a local user config though

[08-Dec-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you are ignoring the part of following whether a tx is notarized or not

[08-Dec-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if the user (exchange) allows deposits after 1 confirmation, then maybe you can double spend on the non-notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 08:28 PM] sgp#7572
I understand there are limitations that are put in place, but these simply make the attack harder, they do not make it impossible

[08-Dec-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you are only talking about attacking the non-notarized chain, which doesnt have a notarization, so doesnt have the notarization protection

[08-Dec-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW protects the notarized chain, not the non-notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt be misrepresenting that notarization doesnt prevent double spends

[08-Dec-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you can clarify that non-notarized chains can be double spent

[08-Dec-18 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking what exchange credits altcoins after 1 confirmation??

[08-Dec-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i would say the attack even on the non-notarized chain is MUCH harder

[08-Dec-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and for the notarized blocks, not possible

[08-Dec-18 08:30 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c that's semantics though, since you could replace the notarized chain with a non-notarized or even a different notarized one. That argument is basically saying that you can't double-spend if you only use one chain, which we know is false since an attacker spins up a different chain

[08-Dec-18 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only one notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it is either notarized or not notarized

[08-Dec-18 08:31 PM] sgp#7572
unless collusion, which we discussed

[08-Dec-18 08:32 PM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User you could say the same for a 51% attack

[08-Dec-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that attacker can spin up a different chain, but it is either notarized or not

[08-Dec-18 08:32 PM] Alright#0419
What's the proposed attack vector of the day?

[08-Dec-18 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
he has some chart that shows impossible states and claims it shows a double spend

[08-Dec-18 08:33 PM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User how about this: VPS / server infrastructure providers colluding?

[08-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
Can someone link to chart please? Did you make a new medium post?

[08-Dec-18 08:33 PM] sgp#7572
@Alright I did not make a new post yet

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
chainB was never notarized

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] sgp#7572
It is in figure 2

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so it never gets the protection from notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you finally agree that in figure 1, there is no double spend?

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
chain b would never get notarized

[08-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
that is indeed an impossible state

[08-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
Your "what if" is a chain split due to differing consensus rules

[08-Dec-18 08:35 PM] sgp#7572
Figure 1 is a double spend to people who do not require a notarization, or simply count the # of block confirmations. It is not a double spend for people who count notarizations

[08-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
@sgp

[08-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Alright#0419
you get it now

[08-Dec-18 08:36 PM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User not 100%, that was just the example

[08-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
transactions aren't truly secure until they're notarized

[08-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
so don't accept them as a deposit until they are

[08-Dec-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but even if figure 2 happens, where is the double spend? each node is either on chain A or chain B

[08-Dec-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is a massive chain split event for the community to resolve

[08-Dec-18 08:37 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c if an attacker makes a payment in chain A that is notarized (and therefore confirmed), then creates chain B with no transaction included

[08-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
chain B doesn't exist

[08-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't matter at all

[08-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
it's orphaned by the entire network

[08-Dec-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
he is talking about the impossible state of figure 2, where there are two notarized chains

[08-Dec-18 08:38 PM] sgp#7572
"improbable", but even there would be issues with figure 1

[08-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Alright#0419
Again, your "what if" is based on a chain split due to differing consensus rules

[08-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but the evil notaries would have an easier time to attack a chain if it wasnt notarized at all

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[08-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
what if *all* BTC pools colluded to break BTC?

[08-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
oh what, they have no reason to do that?

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[08-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so even by this fantasy scenario, dPoW is making it harder to attack a chain

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜„ 

[08-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
that'd be them working against their best interest, huh

[08-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
weird

[08-Dec-18 08:40 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c sure, but they could need it for a deposit, or a number of other scenarios, such that it was after a recent notary election, etc

[08-Dec-18 08:42 PM] sgp#7572
in this case, the attackers could use the notarization to their advantage, since services look for one notarized block confirmation rather than several normal blocks

[08-Dec-18 08:43 PM] sgp#7572
gives a 51% attacker an easier time since they need to produce fewer blocks

[08-Dec-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
again you dont understand and leap to conclusion

[08-Dec-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the number of confirmations stays at 1, until there is a notarization, after that it is normal

[08-Dec-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so if an exchange makes no changes to the existing confirmations, it only makes it wait for notarization and never any easier

[08-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
back to work, excited to see tomorrow's proposed attack vector ðŸ˜„

[08-Dec-18 08:44 PM] sgp#7572
I understand that. My point is that instead of waiting for 10 or so blocks, they only wait for 1 notarized block, which is less total work to attack

[08-Dec-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[08-Dec-18 08:45 PM] freakbros#9074
How is this guy holy sheep shit Batman

[08-Dec-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
they should wait for 10 confirmations as normal, it just stays at 1 confirmation until a notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so 10 is still 10

[08-Dec-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is more than 10 if the notarization took longer

[08-Dec-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
a notarized "10" is NEVER less than 10

[08-Dec-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you are so eager to find some horrible flaw

[08-Dec-18 08:46 PM] sgp#7572
can you explain again the conditions where the software reports 1 or 2 confirmations?

[08-Dec-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
which is fine, but if you are not basing it on facts then it is fantasy

[08-Dec-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the logic is that it reports as 1 confirmation until it is notarized

[08-Dec-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it might never report 2 confirmations

[08-Dec-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 12

[08-Dec-18 08:47 PM] sgp#7572
thanks @Deleted User, I take my point regarding reducing total work back

[08-Dec-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so for chain B it stays at 1

[08-Dec-18 08:48 PM] sgp#7572
it could still be an issue of elections or some other situation though

[08-Dec-18 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what does elections have to do with anything?

[08-Dec-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the worst that happens with new notaries is that maybe there are not enough and there are no notarizations until they are

[08-Dec-18 08:49 PM] sgp#7572
the elections would change the pool of notary node participants. if someone is not currently a notary node but knows they will be one in a few days, they could attempt this

{Reactions}
ðŸ¤” 

[08-Dec-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
attempt what?

[08-Dec-18 08:50 PM] sgp#7572
figure 2, where they make a deposit on chain A, then attempt to notarize chain B

[08-Dec-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
convince all the others to do a difficult to do chain split, dual notarization, combined with a double spend and convince the community to adopt the chain where they didnt deposit to the exchange that was 51% attacked? that scenario?

[08-Dec-18 08:51 PM] sgp#7572
You asked why someone would do so after creating a false notarization, and I'm giving some examples

[08-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
@sgp best to just ask us how the election works instead of making assumptions about it then basing attack vectors on those assumptions

[08-Dec-18 08:51 PM] sgp#7572
I never claimed they were practical

[08-Dec-18 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so impractical and uneconomic fantasy attacks?

[08-Dec-18 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what you are making a big deal out of?

[08-Dec-18 08:52 PM] sgp#7572
no, I still find figure 1 concerning, since even if an attack isn't successful, it would severely slow down the network. there are other considerations, but you only seem interested in talking about a 51% attack

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] freakbros#9074
Quit spamming the channel then

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] sgp#7572
I have shown situations where they are possible, though they are unlikely

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] sgp#7572
Fine, I will leave

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
slow down the network?

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
having competing chains is normal

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] sgp#7572
I appreciate this conversation, I will write up another article later. Have a nice day

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
how does it slow down the network?

[08-Dec-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810

what situations did he show were possible?

[08-Dec-18 08:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Off topic question : can the burn protocol be used as many to one  or is it limited to 1 to 1

[08-Dec-18 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries collude to do chain split, dual notarization, combined with a simultaneous double spend and convince the community to adopt the chain where they didnt deposit to the exchange that was 51% attack.

[08-Dec-18 08:55 PM] freakbros#9074
