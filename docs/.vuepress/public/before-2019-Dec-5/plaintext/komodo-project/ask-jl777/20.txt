There is whitepaper released of that.

[31-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Mark81#4505
It needs pow blocks to work.

[31-Aug-18 12:10 PM] Mark81#4505
I am thinking that as something genuine in this sphere. Quite intresting iniative.

[31-Aug-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems similar to DCR tickets, just with a more fun name bees/hive

[31-Aug-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
In DCR you purchase a ticket, which then can vote on a PoW block, it lasts for a finite time, during which it can vote and voting earns some DCR

[31-Aug-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
creating a time limited PoS mechanism on top of a PoW, maybe it is a bit different than other things and not sure how these bees will prevent the attacker from having their own hive of bees

[31-Aug-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but i just quickly looked at the whitepaper so dont believe anything I say about it has any depth of thought

[31-Aug-18 12:15 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
@jl777c jihan wants to use wormhole to reduce supply of bch and increase value of BCH...its pegged to it ...one BCH will always be worth 100 whc

[31-Aug-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
why not just launch masternodes then?

[31-Aug-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont have much of a supply reducing effect,

[31-Aug-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is pegged to BCH, what is the point?

[31-Aug-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810

i see, it is a buzzword haha. well how about the machine economy being for example, your car being automated to transact with a parking garage without you doing anything...you just enter and your car pays automatically....

seems dangerous if it is all automated. what prevents a hacker from pretending to be a garage and charging cars for parking?

automated things are dangerous

[31-Aug-18 02:46 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I was thinking what if the garage was hacked and they raised the price x100. I'd be pissed if my car automatically paid 2000$ for a 20$ garage spot

[31-Aug-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but you would have 100 days/months/years of prepaid parking

[31-Aug-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the machine economy would be where machines earn money on their own, then if they spend it, it is ok

Hey James, are you following this BCH drama? CSW says he isnt going to do replay protection and theyll fight it out based on who has the hashpower. How do you see it playing out?

[02-Sep-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not good

[02-Sep-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
replay protection is about protecting the users for a planned chain split

[02-Sep-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is no concern over users

[02-Sep-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I will refrain from using BCH until dust settles. hopefully the sum of the two will be about what BCH is now, but likely over time it will degrade. it almost never makes sense to split something into weaker pieces

[02-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c do you see Bitcoin SV ever having significant trade value ? i was thinking about getting more bch to get sv and then sell.

[02-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
hard to predict. i doubt the two BCH forks will add up to much more than current BCH price

[02-Sep-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but it will be volatile, so present trading opportunities

@jl777c what do you think about masternode investing?

[03-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
as in, getting rewards for holding coins and using them as collateral

[03-Sep-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
any coin that relies on masternodes to lock up supply and inflate prices... it seems it is on shaky ground and its price could be quite unstable. I made the rewards CC that does the locking up of funds in exchange for rewards, so chains have the option to do this

[03-Sep-18 08:43 AM] paddycy t.me/totemtribe#4865
Hi guys. I would like to know if komodo platform is suitable for my project kryptoloop.com

Based on peoples accuracy of prediction they gain reputation/points, which these points can then be used to cash out in a native token. (the reason for the reputation not being directly converted into token is a logistical, legal reasoning).

So what is needed is a chain with:
- Almost zero or zero tx fees
- Hi volume of tx/s

The reason for putting the idea on the blockchain, is to be able to prove immutably that people have earned their reputation without cheating the system.

Thank you for your time. please tag me if you reply

[03-Sep-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a prediction based CC contract is possible, that is the only part not already in place

[03-Sep-18 09:35 AM] paddycy t.me/totemtribe#4865

@jl777c to be honest, what i am dealing with is that: 

- Have a client, with a good working product
- The client wants to know what blockchain platform to approach and use for his project.

I have not gone through this procedure before, and i assumed each platform would have some sort of business ambassador to help people like me through such a process

[03-Sep-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
