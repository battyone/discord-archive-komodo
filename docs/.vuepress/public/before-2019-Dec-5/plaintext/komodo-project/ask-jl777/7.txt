assetchains can use anything, yes. VRSC made their own hashing and PoS

[27-Jun-18 12:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and regarless  of the massive hashrate, it wont give any big advantage to attacker

[27-Jun-18 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright it would be good to see how high you can push up the diff on a PoS chain

[27-Jun-18 12:07 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Do you envision most asset chains not using Kmd for pos @jl777c ?

[27-Jun-18 12:07 AM] ProficieNt#3097
But being third parties plugging in?

[27-Jun-18 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, 10 should be good max for PoS, CURE normally runs 4-7

[27-Jun-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the question

[27-Jun-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
what is CURE?

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
similar to PEER, but it has a penalization factor for PoW miners

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] ProficieNt#3097
If you have everyone staking Kmd, it becomes easy to dump a big stake in an asset chain

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD doesnt have staking

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Asset chains do

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] ProficieNt#3097
What token are the using

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
each assetchain is its own blockchain

[27-Jun-18 12:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
asset chains use their own coin

[27-Jun-18 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses itself

[27-Jun-18 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant dump KMD into an assetchain

[27-Jun-18 12:10 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay, so no one will run neutral sidechains

[27-Jun-18 12:10 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Komodo will just be security for other chains

[27-Jun-18 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
what is a neutral sidechain?

[27-Jun-18 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is needed for the cross chain proofs

[27-Jun-18 12:11 AM] ProficieNt#3097
An asset chain with the purpose of scaling Komodo's throughput

[27-Jun-18 12:11 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Yep, komodo links up chains

[27-Jun-18 12:12 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay fair enough, komodo is a utility hub

[27-Jun-18 12:12 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Not aikong to be a scalable Chain itself

[27-Jun-18 12:12 AM] jl777c#5810
when we make a 1:1 KMD sidechain cluster, then you get effectively KMD tx throughput

[27-Jun-18 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but it wont be the real KMD

[27-Jun-18 12:13 AM] ProficieNt#3097
I'm saying 1:1 KMD clusters are at risk if a stake can choose exactly what chain to join

[27-Jun-18 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, that makes sense

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] ProficieNt#3097
But komodo is a-okay for other chains

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] ProficieNt#3097
And maybe with some randomization method for clusters could be stronger

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt seem a need for KMD sidechain cluster for a while

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Yep

[27-Jun-18 12:14 AM] ProficieNt#3097
By then there will be plenty of scaling examples to take inspiration from

[27-Jun-18 12:15 AM] ProficieNt#3097
New techniques and stuff üòÄ

[27-Jun-18 12:15 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay, goodnight for real

Kmd won't need natural throughput for a while

[27-Jun-18 12:17 AM] ProficieNt#3097
But asset chains need to be solid

[27-Jun-18 12:18 AM] ProficieNt#3097

if i do an atomic swap of two ERC-20 tokens on barterdex, what happens to the fees collected?

[27-Jun-18 07:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
the fees will eventually be paid a revenue to DEX holders

[27-Jun-18 07:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
ERC-20 -> Converted to KMD -> KMD 50% Disctributed to DEX Holders

[27-Jun-18 07:44 AM] Spiderman#3141
how is it converted to KMD? what if there is no liquidity? what's a DEX holder?

[27-Jun-18 07:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
it will be sold  on a exchange like BarterDEX. if there is no liquidity it might not worth doing it for that token erc20 token.
DEX Holders are Owners of the DEX coin it's an assetchain with receives dividends from the fees

[27-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Spiderman#3141
so what happens to the fees collected if there is nobody trading the ERC-20 for KMD? just sits there until liquidity comes?

[27-Jun-18 07:51 AM] Spiderman#3141
by DEX coin do you mean InstantDEX?

[27-Jun-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
fees will sit there,unless it is so big it is worth using a differnet exchange to convert

[27-Jun-18 07:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes it was called instantDEX on NXT

[27-Jun-18 07:54 AM] Spiderman#3141
okay cool. and once it's converted to KMD, 50% goes to instantDEX holders ?

[27-Jun-18 07:54 AM] Spiderman#3141
what happens to the other 50%?

[27-Jun-18 07:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
15% to JUMBLR 15% to BOTS 5% to REVS 5% to MGW 5% operating costs 5% Promotions
that is the info I have but it might change

[27-Jun-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
are you relying on a P2P node running to store the data, or is it encoded in the transactions?

stats.log only for now afaik

[27-Jun-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810

it compiles on my more recent system so some sort of compiler version issue i think

@Regnar where will you be documenting our discussion?

[27-Jun-18 02:42 PM] Regnar#6164
@ProficieNt not sure yet. I'll likely just save and clean it up and use it as a reference to this conversation if any changes come from this discussion.

[27-Jun-18 09:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Is there anywhere detailing the attacks (or lack there of) that malicious notaries can perform on Komodo? It seems the worst they can do is stop notarization of Komodo? Is there anywhere detailing why a minimum of 13 online notaries is needed?

[27-Jun-18 09:57 PM] ProficieNt#3097
If all the notaries got together and colluded, they could at worst simply refuse to notarize the chain?

[27-Jun-18 09:59 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Also, what percentage of blocks are mined by notaries?

[27-Jun-18 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the power of notaries is to notarize, but these have to be valid, so yes, the worset appears to be a witholding of notarization, which is a degrading of security, but visible to all.

[27-Jun-18 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
13 is based on the experimental results of needing a majority to be in sync to be able to get 13, it is quite a complex stochasitc process to choose the random 13 of 64 eah round

[27-Jun-18 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries mine approx 75% of blocks

[28-Jun-18 05:12 AM] NNoperator#3835
My node (karasugoi_NA) has an older version of GCC and it failed to build GCC 6.3  so I think I am stuck with the "array used as initializer" error with this latest komodo upgrade.  Do you think you will be able to get the upgrade to work on older versions of GCC, or should I attempt an OS overhaul ?

[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] gcharang#6833
Regarding the discussion that happened with @ProficieNt :  Mostly the scalable asset chains are going to be used for utility/app tokens. The main function miners provide are validation(Checking the transactions are valid and making blocks), security based on decentralization(i.e., if one miner is bad(submitting invalid blocks), the rest of the miners won't accept his blocks), redundancy: some miners go offline - others can continue mining making the system resilient and large hash power (to protect from 51% attacks). 51% attacks are mainly double spend attacks - can be ignored for dPOW if the last notarizid block is considered as valid. As resulted from the  above discussion, a miner with large hash power can only attack by censoring transactions. Can the other miners simply block and stop accepting his blocks? For other block-chains this won't be feasible because the large hash rate is required for protection, but with dPOW this is less of an issue? 

Another conclusion was that by splintering into a huge number of chains, we are breaking up POW and POS security both by breakung up hash power and stake/wealth , I don't know about POS, but can't all the asset chains be merge mined so that all of them get the combined hash power?

[28-Jun-18 06:36 AM] ProficieNt#3097
The problem is, who decides when the chain gets notarized? How will the user know which chain to guest?

[28-Jun-18 06:51 AM] gcharang#6833
I think that the success of blockchains to provide trustless transactions and all the desirable properties is due to equal parts technical things and social/behavioral/game theoretic things. So for this problem too I think some form of hybrid social+technical solution exists and we just need to think it out.

[28-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jorian#4555
math decides when the chain gets notarized, right? after around 5 blocks of the chain that is being notarized, a notarization happens

[28-Jun-18 10:18 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@gcharang the core problem here is that Komodo uses PoW (only true consensus algo atm) and that you cant split PoW and still enjoy your security unless you have randomized assignment

[28-Jun-18 10:18 AM] ProficieNt#3097
that said, as a security platform for independent PoW chains it's pretty cool

[28-Jun-18 10:33 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c How does Komodo's difficulty algorithm work? It actively tries to award notaries 75% of the blocks, right? What happens if all notaries stopped mining, or if notaries started attempting censorship attacks / short range attacks?

[28-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Regnar#6164
I've always looked at the starting of an asset chain, not as splitting and pulling hash power away from Komodo, but adding hash power to the asset chain that didn't exist in the Komodo ecosystem yet. I thought when you set up an assetchain, it is your chain, all mining operations you must provide, or create incentive for others to mine the chain. So in this way it's not sharding Komodo and its mining power, but is simply adding a new chain that notarizes its blocks to Komodo, and in this way isn't like an ERC20 token. The asset chain could have small hash power and susceptible to censorship but the dPoW mitigates this threat by requiring the censoring party to either time their 51% control with notary hashes, or maintain it indefinitely. I'm not too sure on how the inclusion of PoS hybrid to prevent this (though I assume it's to create more mining power to supplement few miners on the chain). but beyond that it's over my head

[28-Jun-18 11:34 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Choose one of two:
 - Komodo is the world's most scalable blockchain through its asset chains.
 - Komodo is a hub providing security and interoperability to independent chains.

It appears the team is working towards number 2 but it seems the community is claiming Komodo has achieved point 1

#FalseDichotomy

[28-Jun-18 11:35 AM] ProficieNt#3097
how so?

[28-Jun-18 11:36 AM] ProficieNt#3097
im not presenting these as competing ideas, just saying the focus of the team appears to be misaligned with what the community is claiming

[28-Jun-18 11:36 AM] ProficieNt#3097
i dont think dPOW is a viable standalone scaling solution as is

[28-Jun-18 11:37 AM] ProficieNt#3097
and everyone is telling me that asset chains have their own currency, which makes sense. so why claim Komodo is doing 100k tps?

[28-Jun-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Choose one of two" implies that both can't be true and/or there can be an nth option

[28-Jun-18 11:38 AM] ProficieNt#3097
unless you're saying its adding a layer of security to 100k tps worth of blockchains but that is not the same as enabling 100k tps

[28-Jun-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
- Komodo is the world's most scalable blockchain through its asset chains. 
AND
- Komodo is a hub providing security and interoperability to independent chains.

[28-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Beetcoin#9049
What @ProficieNt is saying, CG, is that enabling 100k tps is not the same as securing, and that there's some confusion over this publicly.
