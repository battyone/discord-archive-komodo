and test it

[06-Oct-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
then no matter how strange the behavior, i know what change caused it.

[06-Oct-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
think about it. how often is the cause for a bug in a totally different area of code than made sense based on the bug? Quite often. So if you have two or N such bugs at the same time, it becomes  unknowable what code change led to what bug

[06-Oct-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and most of all keep the code as simple as possible, everywhere possible. complexity is the enemy

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
even with that the entire system will become quite complex. better to have a lot of simple components, than one giant complex beast

Question: (I know you have said KV is being replaced by Oracles CC but I'd still like to use it for something..) I've talked to a few members that stated that KV values used to be printed to stdout from mempool before the actual block was mined. It was disabled at some point. Would you be able to point me in the right direction to re-enable them?

[06-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo_kv.h 175?:                 //fprintf(stderr,"KV add.(%s) (%s)\n",ptr->key,valueptr);
uncomment that line

[06-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it will show new KV entries being added

[06-Oct-18 05:10 PM] jspook16#3059
Sweet ..... thank you very much!!

[06-Oct-18 05:46 PM] jspook16#3059
I uncommented and rebuilt and no joy. I'll keep poking around. Thanks

[06-Oct-18 06:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jspook16 try a `make clean` before rebuilding again, then try it again

[06-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jspook16#3059
trying now

[06-Oct-18 06:53 PM] jspook16#3059
i tried it but only getting the following in stdout

[06-Oct-18 06:53 PM] jspook16#3059
duration.1440 flags.0 current.27506 ht.9013 keylen.5 valuesize.36

[06-Oct-18 06:54 PM] jspook16#3059
only see the KV after the block mines

[06-Oct-18 07:07 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 are you getting the above print as soon as the tx hits mempool of your node?

[06-Oct-18 07:08 PM] jspook16#3059
yep immediately

[06-Oct-18 07:09 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright

[06-Oct-18 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
and what is the print that shows the actual value?

[06-Oct-18 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
after it's mined that is

[06-Oct-18 07:12 PM] jspook16#3059
couldnt find (test7mytest)
KV add.(test7) (mytest)

[06-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
just tried it, can't get `fee 0.00100000 vs 0.00100000 flags.1 keylen.4 valuesize.5 height.4459 (74 65 73)` this print to print from mempool

[06-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
do you have that printing from mempool already? Did you do anything in particular to get that working?

[06-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16

[06-Oct-18 07:30 PM] jspook16#3059
yes i just did it again .....i uncommented all of komodo_kv.h except for //search rawmempool, and did a make clean before i rebuilt

[06-Oct-18 07:30 PM] jspook16#3059
not sure i did anything in particular though

[06-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
so if we can't get it printing from mempool, I thought of a dirty hack that would work

[06-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
we can create an on-demand blocks chain and force it to have a static easy diff then dpow it with staked

[06-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
that way, as soon as a message hits mempool, it will be mined and the diff won't raise after many messages

[06-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
and with dpow it can't be reorged, so I don't see easy diff as a problem

[06-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Alright#0419
seems like a really round-about way to accomplish what we need though

[06-Oct-18 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
actually might be a good test for what @blackjok3r has been working on

[06-Oct-18 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
he's been fixing the StakedNotary repo so that we can have chains with different consensus rules

[06-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c what do you think about the above idea? Static easy diff on-demand blocks chain, so txs always mined immediately

[06-Oct-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
sure

[06-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
seems easy enough to do, but like I said very round-about way to accomplish what we need

[06-Oct-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
more experimentation more experience more better

[06-Oct-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing wrong with getting what you need done with least effort, regardless of where the effort is

[06-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 do you want to try to go this route?

[06-Oct-18 07:45 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah you may have to guide me since im not up to speed on what @blackjok3r is doing

[06-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
need to find the checks that reject blocks with lower diff than target and remove them

[06-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
then set target in getblocktemplate to a a static value

[06-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
pow.cpp

[06-Oct-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
easy peasy

[06-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
isn't as simple as that, setting target in blocktemplate to static value has seemingly no effect on the built in miner

[06-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
need to find where that grabs the target from

@SHossain can you reproduce this?

Sure. Will check as soon as I'm back to my computer. Currently afk.

@veerava - jacky  do you mean Agama 0.2.42c?

[07-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
how exactly did you get it working?

[07-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jspook16#3059
I go out to the mempool....the txids....comapre them against any that i already processed...make a new list and process that list. I pull the op_return from each txid .....look for the key length ...print the key (username), look for the value length and print the value (message). converting where i need to

[07-Oct-18 06:26 PM] jspook16#3059
Im going to work on it a bit more ....then make a github account hopefully

[07-Oct-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
cool!

[07-Oct-18 06:27 PM] jspook16#3059
its almost instant....of course its just me messaging right now

[07-Oct-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
should be just a few seconds until the network gets 1000+ nodes

[07-Oct-18 06:28 PM] jspook16#3059
well i did it on the ac chain ive been messing with so its not on stake....but honestly it can be used with any asset chain...just have to change a few things

[07-Oct-18 06:29 PM] jspook16#3059
ac_name = LIZ üòÉ

[07-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
we can certainly use a lot more apps that take advantage of the rpc calls, especially CC rpc calls

[07-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
once you an realtime message someone else and this is proven to work across nodes, I will send you a tip

[07-Oct-18 06:30 PM] jspook16#3059
so i plan on adding a lottery CC.....so each message sends 1 Lizzie (or whatever coin) to a lottery CC that pays out to recent users

[07-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I wrote how to make a lotto CC properly in lotto.cpp

[07-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not so easy

[07-Oct-18 06:32 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll be looking to that once i get the user interface a bit cleaned up.....yeah thats where i got the idea, from reading your documentation

[07-Oct-18 06:32 PM] jspook16#3059
although i havent delved in to it deeply (CC that is)

[07-Oct-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the tuning of the difficulty was the hardest issue, if you just made that a lotto parameter when it is created it sidesteps it

[07-Oct-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the PoS code shows how to do very hard to cheat entropy (1 bit from miner)

looks like i need to implement some threading.....message input is holding up new messages from other users

[07-Oct-18 11:58 PM] jspook16#3059
if anyone cares.... I got the kv chat working from mempool but im having issues with the refresh ......might have to use curses or blessings for terminal. Will work somemore on this. I hope to have it up on github soon

Referring to the recent announcement by VerusCoin. What is to stop a malicious actor from gaining large enough control and "finding" their own attempt to cheat the stake reward? This system essentially gives them a legitimate way to create coins by discovering their own attempt to cheat. Additionally, what does this do the the total block reward over time?

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[08-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt change the blockreward at all

[08-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
well if someone cheats and then discovers their own cheat, what did they gain?

[08-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
they gained a mining reward, and then lost it and then gained it

[08-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so net gain of 1 reward instead of 1 reward

[08-Oct-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this maliciousness seems quite misguided with a ROI of 0%, even if it works

[08-Oct-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and they are competing against the entire rest of the network to mine the cheat claim, so odds are very good they wont recover the stake they put up
