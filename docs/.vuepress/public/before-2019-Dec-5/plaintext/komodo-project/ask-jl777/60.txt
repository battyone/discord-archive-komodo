Is there an easy way to find the largest ( by coin amount ) transaction sent to an address before a certain blockheight.   The only thing I can come up with is to listunspent , pull the json to a sheet and use a function to sort.  I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm missing something obvious to get this done more simply

[19-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
not listunspent as it could be spent already

[19-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you would want getaddresstxids

[19-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
filter out all after a blockheight

[19-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
find the biggest

[19-Apr-19 06:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will getaddresstxids work with watch-only addresses? they will be burn addresses so not worried about them being spent

[19-Apr-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as addressindex is on, it will work with all addresses, it is what the explorers use

How difficult to make: DPow bounty security testchain that is running CC with locked funds to  be released for  first who succesfully will reorg chain?

[20-Apr-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
on the same chain?

[20-Apr-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite difficult

[20-Apr-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that it wont have consensus

[20-Apr-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so you would need to prove all the blocks in the reorged chain

[20-Apr-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it could be possible if all the nodes were making commitments every block

[20-Apr-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that the code is not very complex. it has specific code that says that if a block has been notarized, return error if it is trying to be reorged

[20-Apr-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so it literally cant happen. I guess some sort of memory wiping where it makes it forget about existing notarization would be needed.

[20-Apr-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
not impossible, but to find a remote buffer overflow that will work on all nodes and precisely take out the notarization data without affecting anything else... like i say, not impossible, but until I see it, i wont believe it

[20-Apr-19 07:47 AM] Mark81#4505
Wouldn't point be exactly that bounty for that who can get new consensus over notarization data?

[20-Apr-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if there is code that says if ( block reorgs notarized ) reject it
is there, then what you are asking for is what? something that can overwrite code inside all daemons across the network at the same time?

[20-Apr-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
once its notarized, its notarized

[20-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and the node will simply refuse to reorg it

[20-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
now maybe you can disrupt notarizations, but in that case the dpowconfs stays at 1, so everybody knows notarization is not happening

[20-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so even if you can disrupt notarizations, it doesnt help double spending

[20-Apr-19 07:51 AM] Mark81#4505
Would it be attracting PR?

[20-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
there has been an ongoing bounty with the KMD chain for anybody that can reorg

[20-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the hashrate for KMD is very low compared to its marketcap

[20-Apr-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
very low

[20-Apr-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
many attempts have been made

[20-Apr-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and we have seen chains in the midst of constant attacks deploy dPoW and the attacks stop, or rather the negative effects of deep reorgs from the attacks stopped

Hi James, This was an amazing read! Also started reading your blog posts on medium.
 I'm wondering how is Komodo planning on protecting every solution the you or the team finds/designs/develops. Stuff like oracle solutions... Do you just plan on being way ahead of others in terms of dev that they won't have time to catch up ?
At the moment there is a ton of innovation being produced in Komodo but it is completely unheard of. How do you plan on finding clients since the majority ignores how smart contract work and the inherent fundamental problems they carry with them ?
So if the platform does not get any traction in terms of projects onboarding, what will prevent other platforms to shamelessly copy and adapt komodo developed solutions since the project is open source ?

i think you are confusing komodo with some sort of for-profit company

also any project that doesnt do the due diligence to find out that they are making a project that has to pay GAS costs everytime their contract is run... i think you will be surprised at how much people dont like paying $1 per tx

@Marcau my new HUSH whitepaper is pretty good advertising for why a project would want to migrate/upgrade to a KMD asset chain. To "prevent other platforms to shamelessly copy and adapt komodo developed solutions" is very easy. KMD has exponentially more dev resources than most projects, there is drastically more to gain by building upon KMD than trying to compete with it: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-v3-whitepaper/blob/master/hush-v3.pdf

A question regarding how the Komodo 'correct chain' is determined:    
Generally in most blockchains, the chain with the most cumulative work is considered the correct one.  (Many people think of this as 'longest chain', but this is wrong, a chain that was longer but at lower difficulty could have less cumulative work).  
In Komodo, notary nodes are allowed the chance to periodically produce one block at a low difficulty, to gain their rewards.  This results in notary nodes collectively getting a large portion of the total blocks.   
My question is:  does the best chain in komodo consider these notary node produces blocks as counting as low difficulty for purposes of determining the correct chain?  Or do they count at the same weight as normally mined (high difficulty) blocks?
This is important because if they count at the same weight, then Notary Nodes have a much greater impact on determining the correct chain than they 'should', which one could say was more centralized because notary nodes would have far more ability to determine the best chain than their proof of work would indicate.

[25-Apr-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it counts as the difficulty mined, easy diff, so it is not any advantage

[25-Apr-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
this issue is only for KMD itself, other chains have no advantages at all for notaries

Tech Tuesday Update #13: A Summary Of Last Week's Development - Komodo

https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg

[25-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ok, so because notary node blocks are low difficulty, they dont give a group of notaries the ability to 51% attack, or determine which chain or fork to follow.  Thats good.

[25-Apr-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries are designed to be as passive as possible

[25-Apr-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they wait for the chain to come to a normal consensus

[25-Apr-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
then when the notaries agree on a recent height+hash, they submit this proposed notarization to the network

[25-Apr-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
EVERY node then checks to see if that height+hash matches what they ALREADY had locally, then and only then do they change state in any way at all due to the proposed notarization. It adds a dynamic checkpoint to the already existing checkpoint code and also if it detects an attempted reorg of a notarized height, it rejects it

[25-Apr-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a very small surgical change designed to only protect notarized heights that were already on the local node

[25-Apr-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the power of evil notaries would be to NOT notarize, thus smoothly degrading to a non-notarized chain

[25-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Komodo always seems very well designed against attacks, whenever I try to come up with some way its vulnerable, its like you already thought about it. üòâ

[25-Apr-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
I foresaw the many chains world and the lack of hashpower to secure them all, so I needed a very efficient way to secure the dozen ecosystem chains. I guess when making something you will depend on yourself, you go the extra mile, but really I just made the fewest changes to an already working system. That seems the best way, especially with consensus systems, where seemingly easy things to do like DAA is full of pitfalls. So if it aint broke, I dont fix it. Which mean just adding to the already existing checkpointing and later when we found some 90%+ hashrate attack needed to specifically prevent reorging notarized chain, we added that. The final aspect that made it as close to 100% protection as I can imagine was the dpowconfs. That simply sets the "confirmations" field to 1, until it is notarized. With that trivial change, exchanges that rely on "confirmations" > N automatically wait for notarizations. We found that exchanges just wont make any changes to their payment processing code, so this was the way to get them to support notarizations without doing anything. And since the main risk of evil notaries is that notarizations can be stopped, the dpowconfs is an automatic detector for that condition

[25-Apr-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
we also find that when there are blockchain events, ie. chain split, larger forks, the notaries dont reach consensus themselves and this also triggers dpowconfs to stay at 1. This is a good thing as the last thing you want to do when there is an active chain split is processing any large amounts!
