Also no problems when I run it on virtual machines on my MacBook air (Virtual machines using 1 core and 2-3 gigs ram) - even can build daemon for ~40 minutes

[16-Jan-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
@Acura feel free to post it, it does seem like a very good answer

This sharding stuff - seems they are build the roads with gasoil cars - now have traffic jams and need more roads. While assetchains it's a traffic of flying cars where cars fly on the different levels

[16-Jan-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they want to build a single road to handle all traffic

[16-Jan-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Our cars can fly in parallel - can take all the  air square because no need roads

[16-Jan-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if a city did that, there would be a single highway that is a glorified parking lot

[16-Jan-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in komodo, we just build more normal roads

[16-Jan-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes to combine traffic from multiple roads requires a bit of extra work, but that is much better than trying to shard the main highway

[16-Jan-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
There is some basic traffic safety rules as dPOW

[16-Jan-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is possible to make a vacuum sealed maglev train that can go very fast

[16-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but you cant use rockets, the gases mess up the vacuum, so it needs to be electric

[16-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and likely such a high tech "road" would have a higher througput than a normal road

[16-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but at 1000x the cost

[16-Jan-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
better to have 1000 normal roads than a single maglev highway, which will be expensive to use

[16-Jan-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
in fees and time, and please ignore the TB of data

[16-Jan-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
On some point tech should evaluate organically to such super roads. Like a when 1Mb memory in PC was a super high tech - it was possible to make a 1 Gig cluster but needed 1000 of 1Mb instances

[16-Jan-19 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's not very cost-effective and real usage oriented to build such PC

[16-Jan-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Better to have many ones which can fit a everyday tasks of current technologies state

[16-Jan-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i like practical solutions, they are much more useful

[16-Jan-19 07:57 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c thx that was very informative :)

[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just because everybody else is working on the wrong problem to solve, doesnt mean that komodo solution isnt valid

[16-Jan-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i just cant see a non-centralizing way a single chain can scale up in usage. you end up with TB chains needed GB/sec bandwidth, so really other than massive data centers you need to use lite wallets, ie. centralized

[16-Jan-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the komodo solution is the most decentralized possible solution to this problem. the fact that it isnt some theoretically pure solution isnt relevant when all the alternatives require unscrambling an omelet into the original eggs or TB +GB/sec centralized monsters that force lite wallets

[16-Jan-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
dont compare to some fantasy ideal case when there are ZERO other scalable solutions

[16-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Mylo#8306
Sorry to change subject.

I have a scenario I'd like some direction on plz:
1.  There are two addresses: Rxyz1 & Rxyz2
2.  The blockchain is currently at block 10,000
3.  I would like to create a rule where Rxyz1 can only send to Rxyz2 when the height is at 10,9XX.
4.  In fact I am happy for Rxyz1 to send to Rxyz2 anytime in the blockchain life it is 100 blocks before the next thousand.  e.g. 11,9XX, 12,9XX, ... ... 505,9XX 

What is the best way?

5.  Instead of 505,9XX can we use a method similar to "time based sapling activation" that says 100 blocks after 9am UTC the transaction will be valid.
6.  Can we make transactions valid between set hours, e.g. 9am-5pm

?

[16-Jan-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the heir CC is similar to this

[16-Jan-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you have a designated pubkey as heir

[16-Jan-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you then have a special address that you can spend freely at any time

[16-Jan-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the heir can only spend if you dont do any spends for a specified amount of blocks

[16-Jan-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so you could setup a similar CC where there are constraints on when a specific pubkey is allowed to spend, how much, etc.

[16-Jan-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this CC does not exist, but CC are turing complete -> anything you can write a program for can be implemented

[16-Jan-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so the answer to the question of whether a CC can do X? is the same as the answer to the question "is it possible to write code that does X"

[16-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes thanks, using CC makes it easier to achieve said goal than have to do some other "cryptic stuff" üòÉ   thanks!

[16-Jan-19 06:49 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
hi guys! what do you think about Grin (MimbleWimble) and will it be traded on barterDex?

[16-Jan-19 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i think MW is very interesting new tech. mm2 i think will be able to atomic swap it

[16-Jan-19 07:04 PM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
what about particular implementation -  Grin ? have you researched it, any comments  and critics..

[16-Jan-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i have looked into BEAM

[17-Jan-19 10:18 AM] ph03nix#3115
crypto-bridge is 2014 multi gateway technology

[17-Jan-19 10:25 AM] ph03nix#3115
#cc-assets

[17-Jan-19 10:37 AM] ph03nix#3115
jl777's 2014 multi gateway tech never charged a listing fee

[17-Jan-19 10:38 AM] ph03nix#3115
nor does barterdex

[17-Jan-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
they use automated multisig gateways?

[17-Jan-19 10:39 AM] ph03nix#3115
no

[17-Jan-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
then it isnt as advanced as multigateway was

[17-Jan-19 10:41 AM] ph03nix#3115
yet they charge to list

[17-Jan-19 10:46 AM] ph03nix#3115
long question short

[17-Jan-19 10:46 AM] ph03nix#3115
can cc-assets replicate crypto bridge

[17-Jan-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
combined with cc-gateways

[17-Jan-19 10:48 AM] ph03nix#3115
or improve

[17-Jan-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and a nice GUI

[17-Jan-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Crypto-bridge is a GUI for Bitshares protocol as I know

[17-Jan-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
GUI and gateways

[17-Jan-19 10:50 AM] ph03nix#3115
yeah

[17-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Fab√ò#8941
@jl777c there is a moment when I could pick your brain 5-10min

[17-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Fab√ò#8941
?

[17-Jan-19 12:47 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Here is the thing in my world every thing is about bargaining or trade of units (assets)
We are born and die with one Wealth In French we call that ‚Äúla th√©orie de l‚Äôindivisibilit√© et immutability du patrimoine‚Äù this wealth is constitute of debt and active combined on one ledger from birth to dead.

We could make the Platform Komodo a gateway where converge it all (barterdex Atomic swap). For each human or machine one asset chain, this one can record and display everything every transactions, every possession, every potential defaults. the asset chain can be use for KYC is the person agree to display push the info  (CC, like a token private key), for credit worthiness, identification etc‚Ä¶

[17-Jan-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a matter of making such a chain

[17-Jan-19 12:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
yes and lot of GUI and interconnection to make it easy to create such chain

[17-Jan-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a way of making a chain owned by a privatekey

[17-Jan-19 12:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
this is great

[17-Jan-19 12:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
if we do things properly

[17-Jan-19 12:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we need that for the credit union

[17-Jan-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure.. I will be getting back to that, my plan was to separate the streamer options from this permissioned chain, so you can use which ever parts you like.

[17-Jan-19 12:51 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we need a fair system that can track and prove while respecting privacy

[17-Jan-19 12:52 PM] Fab√ò#8941
can that be automatized

[17-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This may work, although it means the person needs a node always running to mine any transactions that happen on it.

[17-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its on demand blocks

[17-Jan-19 12:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With a sinhle miner

[17-Jan-19 12:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
can we use the notary nodes as a third parties

[17-Jan-19 12:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
?

[17-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible to make the chain mineable by notary nodes I think yes

[17-Jan-19 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That's a hell of a lot of chains though

[17-Jan-19 12:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
yep

[17-Jan-19 12:54 PM] Fab√ò#8941
but after it is like a network

[17-Jan-19 12:54 PM] Fab√ò#8941
let's say you have 1000 assetchains representing 1000 users

[17-Jan-19 12:54 PM] Fab√ò#8941
those user gonna interact with each others

[17-Jan-19 12:55 PM] Fab√ò#8941
or maybe an asset chain per person is not the solution

[17-Jan-19 12:55 PM] Fab√ò#8941
but i think you got what results I try to get

[17-Jan-19 12:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that is the next job on my list to get to. I will keep your application in mind while doing it. If it suits great if not its just another assetchain option :+1:

[17-Jan-19 12:56 PM] Fab√ò#8941
thanks mate

[17-Jan-19 12:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
happy to talk about it anytime

[17-Jan-19 12:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
there is definitely a business application of the tech here

[17-Jan-19 12:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
that helps all parties customers and businesses

[17-Jan-19 12:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
i think

[17-Jan-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For sure

Hi there! 
Which programming language skills would be more useful for Komodo blockchain projects? Or which language/s would be best to start with?

[17-Jan-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
C

[17-Jan-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or python

[17-Jan-19 04:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what you want to do

[17-Jan-19 04:26 PM] jorian#4555
most useful would be Javascript

[17-Jan-19 04:26 PM] jorian#4555
we need GUI's

[17-Jan-19 04:26 PM] jorian#4555
for a number of dApps

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
javascript may be the fastest to learn, but not really the "most useful"

[17-Jan-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
javascript, just say no and learn a real language

[17-Jan-19 04:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Java script is non sensical

[17-Jan-19 04:40 PM] jorian#4555
still number 1

[17-Jan-19 04:40 PM] jorian#4555
and he asked 'most useful for Komodo projects'

[17-Jan-19 04:40 PM] jorian#4555
i'd say JS is it

[17-Jan-19 04:41 PM] jorian#4555
but this is #ask-jl777 so the only correct answer is C
