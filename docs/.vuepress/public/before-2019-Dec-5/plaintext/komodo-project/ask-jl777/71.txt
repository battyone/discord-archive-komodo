move that risk to something better or less risky

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Coin2stable#1872
not objective

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
saying from investor point of view.

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] phm87#7395
Where can I buy some shares of mm2 DEX ? I didn't know such things exist

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Coin2stable#1872
no you sound loyal and emotional

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont promote it at all

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a pretty well kept secret, not that it is intentionally secret

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody does any promoting of it

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
however that sounds, I'm telling you my experience.

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
ask the nearly 1000 people that got refunds from the hack

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Coin2stable#1872
my point are valid and JL has been on point with his reply not getting  feelings but addressing my indignation

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@phm87  you can place an order on Barterlly

[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that was $20 mil that i had in my control, i think $19 million is returned now

[21-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the other $1 mil, is coming from my pocket

[21-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how you can be indignant

[21-Jun-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt sell you the DEX, did i?

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you I prefer to not use barterlly, i'll search for alternatives.

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
how can you feel i treat your unfairly?

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt make you any promises that i didnt keep

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i only have a track record of responsibility and integrity

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@phm87 Only OTC  then for now , hard finding sellers

[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you

[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
spanning over 6 years

[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and here you come in insulting me

[21-Jun-19 08:10 PM] allbits#5898
Six years? Not good enough. I demand six and a half!

[21-Jun-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
now allbits, he did invest in me, and i am happy to answer any of his concerns

[21-Jun-19 08:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was OK reading til there was no insult

[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but regardless of how you obtained DEX, i will do my best to get the best revshares out

[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
likely only the BTC and KMD dexfees will be significant enough at first

[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sure chmex will setup the automated reporting

[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] allbits#5898
I have no concerns

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, been hanging out in discord and slack before that a lot

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Coin2stable#1872
"i am sure chmex will setup the automated reporting" .

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Know most of the history of kmd/jl/supernet

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX is unlike any company in that it has no expenses, no overhead, doesnt exist other than as the coin and its revshare rights

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Coin2stable#1872
that will help in transparency and trust

[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And everything has been pretty solid

[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Coin2stable#1872

[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810

@Coin2stable I'm trying to understand what your concerns are. Still unclear.

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
also, as far as I can read between the lines... The potential money that jl can scam from dex fees or whatever, is peanuts in the grand sceme of superNET things

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810

not with trust me I am a man or honor , any psychopath can do that

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And would harm himself the most

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`people should always prove them selves ,`
He has proven himself enough. Much more than enough.

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Coin2stable#1872
you know like the hacker

[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] Coin2stable#1872
play nice then strike

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should jl scam the general public, his personal holdings would suffer the most

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ðŸ˜‚

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So would be shooting himself in the foot

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes but if people like using DEX who cares

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Coin2stable#1872
he can have all the cash

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and nothing will happen

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i already have a lot of cash

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont need anymore

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
havent for many years

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
gave away a lot of it along the way too

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Everyman always want more

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Coin2stable#1872

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] dan.#2473

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] dan.#2473
lol

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Coin2stable#1872
not you but she does

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i tell her no

[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and a yacht

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
again, no, but we could rent it for a day

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Coin2stable#1872
what is you have 9 wifes and they all want jets

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
you are assuming i am like the normal person

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
however it seems i am a bit unusual

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
9 wives sounds like too much headache tbh

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] dan.#2473
to reiterate, yes cryptoon i agree, that is what they are trying to say. but it is what it is.

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Coin2stable please come to the point.

[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think he is a troll

[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Coin2stable#1872
an island in south asia

[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
just trying to get me all upset

[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Coin2stable#1872
No I am not that an easy thing to say

[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Coin2stable#1872
But ok I digress

[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Let see

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Coin2stable#1872
I own businesses and I test everyone I employ

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Jl is probably one of the biggest holder of DEX anyway, more revshare increases the underlying dex price.

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Coin2stable#1872
People are what make the company ,

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i do indeed have a decent number of DEX

[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
where you are going with that statement? 
jl777 is not your employee

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Keeping dexshare would reduce dexprice to zero

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Jl777 makes KMD

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX is not a company

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Coin2stable#1872
I know it not

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not a company

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is part of an open source project

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes

[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Coin2stable#1872
I know

[21-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Coin2stable#1872
