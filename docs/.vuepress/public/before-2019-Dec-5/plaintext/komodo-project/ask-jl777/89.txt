thanks!

[27-Sep-19 11:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
I would sympathize with vi myself- I hate emacs :troll:

[27-Sep-19 11:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
but you don't use a makefile?

[27-Sep-19 11:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
I remember form once compiling an x server and having to do stuff in the makefile.. fells like in a Stephen King novel

[27-Sep-19 11:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
Also, these low level tools need constant practice- I was sort of semi-proficient in vi, but that had totally decayed after like- a year or two..

[27-Sep-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is usually a makefile that already exists. add the new source files to the makefile and run make

[27-Sep-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
usually i make a simple script file to issue all the commands to test a new iteration

[27-Sep-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so edit, save, run script, test, repeat

[27-Sep-19 11:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
sounds good- 
I guess those really evil makefiles are the ones that are made for multi-platform distributions
back in the day when Solaris BSD and all kind of competing unixoids were still a thing

[29-Sep-19 05:51 PM] Slyris#2880
@LocoMB The current architecture of the Komodod make CLion really hard to use with it.

I myself am a big fan of writing its makefiles is even I did it a lot, only sometimes it is also necessary to adapt with his time, there are certain platforms that are in C++ much more easily targetable with CMake.

From my experience, I think that today when we think of a project from the beginning it is not a bad thing to think about those who use IDE's, you will not prevent those who want to use VI to do it.

On the other hand make a small local Makefile and supported only Linux, and think that everyone will use VI or create a script to compile, you lose the possible support of IDE's, one of my goals is to create a CMake for the Komodod project without breaking the backward compatibility with ZCash.

I can not for my part conceive of making a C++ project today without CLion, others it will be QTCreator, others it will be Visual Studio, other XCode, other emacs or VI. But the interest of CMake is that all its developers will enjoy their favorite editors/ide's.

[29-Sep-19 05:58 PM] Slyris#2880
I can understand seeing some CMake dating from several years ago that we may be afraid to do, however as a modern CMake expert I think to provide a clean, easy to maintain and that will please to everyone.

777 (number)
777 (seven hundred [and] seventy-seven) is the natural number following 776 and preceding 778. The number 777 is significant in numerous religious and political contexts.

[05-Oct-19 09:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
one thing though: jl777 is without a doubt _not_ chinese, because then it would be jl888, being most lucky number in China... no Chinese would settle for 777, ever! 8⃣8⃣8⃣

Hello
We discussed with bitcoiners during meetups. Some were interested by komodo tech and dpow. Whitepaper was read but they are searching for the set of rules introduced by dpow. I linked few articles but they would like a list of rules such as https://hastebin.com/uladolizup.sql do we have such list ?

[15-Oct-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you

[15-Oct-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there are just 2 rules.

[15-Oct-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
1. accept only notarizations that matches what your local node already has as its mainchain

[15-Oct-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
2. if a new block arrives that tries to change a notarized block, reject it

[15-Oct-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you. I sent the info to the person

@jl777c Any news on bringing atomic swap tech to other fields than crypto soon? For instance: swapping tickets for events or a 1-on-1 marketplace for placing sportsbets and sorts (1 taking action, 1 buying action at a certain price which are held by the atomic escrow tech and settled after the event took place). The last one is a multi billion (maybe trillion) business. I think in general adoption of the DEX will be much faster if you start bringing out usecase outside of crypto.

if someone made a coin that represented these external things, then it would already work. it is up to others to launch such chains

[21-Oct-19 12:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the hard part is to enforce linkage between tokens & real world assets I think , and that is up to the laws/guidance/rules of companies/entities/countries

[21-Oct-19 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if I wanted to make memo-based message app with public content - which kind of blockchain is best for such? shall I start my own or I can use one existing ? fast blockspeed would be good

[21-Oct-19 04:08 PM] Oszy#5734
as in z-tx memo ?

[21-Oct-19 04:08 PM] Oszy#5734
or mixed

[21-Oct-19 04:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
more like t-tx memo

[21-Oct-19 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
afaik zcash t-tx not allos memo

[21-Oct-19 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but btc deos

[21-Oct-19 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
btc, bch, ltc ...

[21-Oct-19 04:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im just thinking for more or less messanger app quick block speed is required like even maybe 5 seconds

[21-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Oszy#5734
i am sure it's possible on an assetchain with custom options

[21-Oct-19 04:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
1 sec would be perfect 😛

[21-Oct-19 04:11 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
another insane idea I was thinking if it is possible to have default preloaded addresses with small amounts for testing - to more easy allow users for "trying/testing" apps / crypto

[21-Oct-19 04:12 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so for example  I would make some dust like 0.001 coin per address, at least in some early stage to increas adoption of the app

[21-Oct-19 04:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
tha would also be usefull for test like beer pizza in the past - no need to ask anyone for change or search - you just create a wallet and in some misterious way same time "mine" some initial reaload available during first

[21-Oct-19 04:13 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
N blocks

[21-Oct-19 04:15 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Oszy so basically I should create my own chain to have required specs ? where can I learn how to do so and what is required for me to support it later on the go? I think those new invetions of nSPV and aPOW doulb be nice to, so that lite app is usable through nSPV and aPOW makes me not ti think about mining problems and overall blockchain problems

[21-Oct-19 04:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe for regular transparent chain nSPV is not so crucial

[21-Oct-19 04:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"get KMD holders' addresses for airdrop" is not exactly what I asked, I was thinking more "someone download the app and opens wallet (create address) and get small amount of the coin - kind of reward supporting usage/adoption

[21-Oct-19 04:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

@gcharang that looks simmilar to what Im thinking - twitter replacement - decentralized

[21-Oct-19 05:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and yes faucet sounds like it allows preloading addresses on demand

/on creation

[21-Oct-19 05:14 PM] Oszy#5734
for that i believe you'd have to have a button in a gui, (if there's a gui)  and a script that generates new address and pulls from faucet to the new address

[21-Oct-19 05:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes basically wallet would be messanger app

[21-Oct-19 05:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
while block explorers could work as web display of content, wallet (app with credits) would display personalized content

[21-Oct-19 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
i am thinking of a drawback of a public decentralized "twitter" style app, so what if there is like illegal content posted the kind that you should not even look at let alone having it associated with you ip ever?

[21-Oct-19 05:19 PM] Oszy#5734
could this be the reason they don't exist?
