as far as I'm aware from reading in the scaling sections, Komodo scaling is not through the asset chains that are set up on it, it's about scaling the Komodo current chain with asset chains that are fungible with it. it's not saying there are 100 asset chains, each their own project and coins, therefore KMD tx/s is X(#of asset chains). it's saying Komodo can launch multiple of its own chains that are all KMD (not other projects) and all fungible with it, therefore providing n chains of Komodo. I don't think I've read anywhere that these asset chains don't need their own resources to scale either.

[28-Jun-18 11:43 AM] ProficieNt#3097
so it is relatively formal opinion held by Komodo

[28-Jun-18 11:44 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@Regnar okay, then why do I get told that asset chains bring their own PoW

``I've always looked at the starting of an asset chain, not as splitting and pulling hash power away from Komodo, but adding hash power to the asset chain that didn't exist in the Komodo ecosystem yet.``

[28-Jun-18 11:45 AM] Regnar#6164
Isn't that what I said?

[28-Jun-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think there seems to be a conflation of things here.
the chains that spin up for scale are not the same as the chains that get spun as asset chains
If KMD needs more headspace, the assets like MNZ and others aren't going to get flooded with transactions; these are separate from that

[28-Jun-18 11:47 AM] Meyse#0952
@ProficieNt did you read up on MoMoM?

[28-Jun-18 11:49 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie what is the correct terminology for Komodo's own chains?

[28-Jun-18 11:50 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@Meyse I read a high level overview. Is it basically notarizing the markle tree into KMD main chain and then back into the asset chain. this would then allow cross merklized chain communication

[28-Jun-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, I just came back last week after a hiatus and I'm not completely up to speed, so I'm not sure what the actual term for what I'd call a "sub chain" or "side chain"is

[28-Jun-18 11:53 AM] ProficieNt#3097
kk

[28-Jun-18 11:54 AM] ProficieNt#3097
the way these chains would be structured is different because they need their own PoW incentive? is there any research into this?

[28-Jun-18 11:55 AM] Meyse#0952
Okay so as far as my technical skills go its like this: everyone can create an "assetchain", you can secure this assetchain with the notaries through dPoW. If you need lets say 1m tx/s, you create a whole bunch of assetchains and link them together, with the whole MoMoM thing, so they act as "one". These are also secured with dPoW then. EVERY assetchain needs their own PoW/PoS/whatever

[28-Jun-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you mean the scaling chains, they have no need for "incentive", the point of existence is "overflow"

[28-Jun-18 11:56 AM] Meyse#0952
so now you have scaling and security

[28-Jun-18 11:56 AM] ProficieNt#3097
so they run on PoW consensus with no block rewards? or what's the story

[28-Jun-18 11:57 AM] Meyse#0952
you run them however you want to run them i suppose

[28-Jun-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
given what I know of the protocol, I assume one *could* mine the scaling chain on it's own and get a 0.0001 block reward of 96c57ca8db8162fd3b501ee9edc16d69766dcda8308cca2f8854ab1772cef229 coin

[28-Jun-18 11:59 AM] ProficieNt#3097
so there is no incentive beyond transaction fees to run scaling chains?

[28-Jun-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not sure there needs to be "incentive" for an "unseen" chain

[28-Jun-18 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
unless I'm missing something

[28-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Meyse#0952
all assetchains, which are the same as "scalingchains", are all customizable however the creator wants it

[28-Jun-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Meyse they are different creatures

[28-Jun-18 12:03 PM] Meyse#0952
are they?

[28-Jun-18 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
born out of the same code, but serving a different function

[28-Jun-18 12:03 PM] Meyse#0952
i thought its just assetchain+assethain+assetchain etc linked together

[28-Jun-18 12:05 PM] Regnar#6164
We definitely need different terms for asset chains like OOT, BNTN, etc and scaling chains that are KMD fungible.

"so many different parts"
That's why I took exception to the "pick one" earlier; I don't think there is a "pick one" that Komodo is in and if it is, then it likely will not stay "just one" for long

@SHossain Why haven't you written a glossary yet? :troll:

[28-Jun-18 12:16 PM] jorian#4555
i think @gcharang is doing documentation now, but we're still in a limbo between atlassian and readthedocs

[28-Jun-18 12:17 PM] Meyse#0952
i like readthedocs most

[28-Jun-18 12:18 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie , @gcharang is taking care of the documentation now. I'm sure he can get one written. Please help him if you can üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 12:20 PM] gcharang#6833
I have access to both the docs at readthedocs and atlassian. The problem is, scaling solution is still in testing and it uses the exact same technology of asset chain creation(but enhanced with MoMoM stuff). For the assetchain/parallel chain part, they both mean the exact same thing and there were plans to phase out both the terms and make it just `blockchain` we will need to finalise all these either as a team or as a community which is a problem because of all the `decentralization`. There is no CEO here to say this is the final truth and make it so.

blockchain is good, cause thats what it is. the only way KMD is attached through it is dPoW anyway

[28-Jun-18 12:36 PM] jorian#4555
agree, it's a blockchain

[28-Jun-18 01:02 PM] gcharang#6833
They are the same technology being used for different things after enhancement. is wrong?

[28-Jun-18 01:04 PM] gcharang#6833
That is because historically only Komodo assets lived on these chains.

[28-Jun-18 01:06 PM] gcharang#6833
I understand all of this. I am new here and need the go ahead to edit stuff. I can't go around changing documentation just because I thought something could have been named better

[28-Jun-18 01:08 PM] jorian#4555
true that

[28-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Meyse#0952
so you start with an assetchain, if you need to scale, you add scaling chain?

[28-Jun-18 01:10 PM] SHossain#0007
TXSCL assetchains/parallel chains were only created for scaling. end users are not going to use it.

[28-Jun-18 01:11 PM] SHossain#0007
these are test chains

[28-Jun-18 01:11 PM] SHossain#0007
like we have BEER & PIZZA

[28-Jun-18 01:11 PM] gcharang#6833
I have read all the scaling -test chat and libscott's explanations of cryto-condition explanations and all. I do understand at a high level what is being done. I am just saying that scaling is still in testing and it uses the same commands as creating asset chains to spawn scaling chains but with one extra parameter (`ac_cc`) and no one thought to name them

[28-Jun-18 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
yes, that burn protocol is what makes it different, essentially, it serves a complete different purpose than 'just an assetchain'

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] Meyse#0952
yes ok, but if you spawn a blockchain (asset chain), and later i have the need to scale, what do i do?

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] SHossain#0007
TXSCL chains are Komodo assetchains like any other AC we have. the difference is they are clustered using `-ac_cc=3`. If any other real projects wants to use `-ac_cc=x` they can. those will not be classed as scaling chains

[28-Jun-18 01:13 PM] SHossain#0007
just assetchains/parallel chains with advanced features

[28-Jun-18 01:14 PM] SHossain#0007
that is for cross-chain transfer and sharing

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
blockchain contracts / smart contracts

[28-Jun-18 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
chains using same clusterid can share data between themselves

[28-Jun-18 01:16 PM] gcharang#6833
Yes

[28-Jun-18 01:17 PM] Meyse#0952
blockchains you can cluster (or do whatever the fuck you want with it)

[28-Jun-18 01:18 PM] gcharang#6833
Yup, but the thing is the tech crowd will understand this statement, but for the normal people we need a memorable-name and flash it before their eyes a lot of times for them to associate it's properties to what it really is.

[28-Jun-18 01:19 PM] jorian#4555

[28-Jun-18 01:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
just to add in from above my opinion (from my understanding).  since the scaling chains are essentially assetchains with  -ac_cc=3  or whatever it is, I'm not sure 2 names is really necessary. In the future wouldn't we want to promote anyone who's spawning an assetchain to include  -ac_cc=3  no matter what the purpose of their chain is?  that way in the future if they ever need to take advantage of the CC features, they don't need to create a new chain just to add this paramater

[28-Jun-18 01:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and that begs the question as to if there will need to be a snapshot of  SUPERNET/DEX/etc  assetchains  and then spawn new chains with the  -ac_cc=3  param

[28-Jun-18 01:49 PM] jorian#4555
do those chains need scaling?

[28-Jun-18 01:49 PM] jorian#4555
or simple contracts

[28-Jun-18 01:49 PM] jorian#4555
or any of the new tech?

[28-Jun-18 01:49 PM] jorian#4555
i don't think they need that, because DEX and SUPERNET are 'just' assets
