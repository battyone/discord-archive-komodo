Quick update from me: I'm listened to this podcast in response, and I have a few hours today that I will spend writing up a new article. No promises that I will finish it today, and if I don't then I won't have time until Wednesday. I'll share the article here before publishing. https://soundcloud.com/blockchainists/siddhartha-the-author-of-komodos-whitepaper-explains-delayed-proof-of-work

Hello JL777 - i got 2 Questions from a user: How does the transaction size differ from the block size? A pirate block is 4MB in size and the actual transactions are only 200kB in size? What about the rest of the 3.8MB? Is the block size of 4MB then fixed for each asset chain?

[17-Dec-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
there are 1 or more transactions in a block

think of tx as cans that you put into the box,these can be up to 200kb, but they can be much smaller, typical tx is 2kb

[19-Dec-18 06:47 PM] sgp#7572
@jl777c does Komodo search for the chains with the greatest work, or the greatest number of blocks? I'm trying to figure out how the notary nodes' mining of blocks with low difficulty factors into this

[19-Dec-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses the standard consensus rules for the non-notarized chain

[19-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and the NN easy mining is only for KMD, no other chain

[19-Dec-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so this seems to mean a shorter chain with more work could do small reorgs of the notary mined blocks, not giving notary mined blocks any special protections

[19-Dec-18 07:05 PM] sgp#7572
all right, so the chain with the most work put onto it. thanks

[19-Dec-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that is notarized

[19-Dec-18 07:08 PM] sgp#7572
we already discussed this but just to be especially clear: suppose a node is on chain A with total work 100. It sees chain B with a more recent notarization, but the total work is only 50. It does not switch over. No issues with this, right?

[19-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
chain A is notarized? if so and B is in conflict, that node will stay on A

[19-Dec-18 07:10 PM] sgp#7572
chain A has 100 work and chain B has 50 work. both are notarized at point A shared between both chains. Chain B is also notarized at point B exclusive to chain B

[19-Dec-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization is not messing with chain weight calcs, it is just filtering out new blocks that try to reorg a notarization, and all notarized blocks were achieved by global consensus as to the chain as of a recent height. Given those changes to the normal consensus rules, is the answer to what each node will do. 

In your example, you say both are notarized at point A, so all nodes have that notarized block. How could chain B then be the consensus block if it only hash chain work of 50? It seems chain B would not be a legal one as chain A has more weight, but if chain A is part of chain B, how can the weight of be end up at 50?

[19-Dec-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
A chain needs to be legal for there to be a consensus that it is notarized at any given height. If it is illegal, then no node would accept the notarization

[19-Dec-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
Only very small changes to the consensus rules were made. it is not like any random chain can be notarized and pushed onto all the nodes

[19-Dec-18 07:15 PM] sgp#7572
I'm not talking about the notarization process, I'm discussing a situation where one chain without a notarization has more work than the notarized chain

[19-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
i must have gotten confused as that is not what I read...

[19-Dec-18 07:15 PM] sgp#7572
there are many circumstances where this could be possible

[19-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain that is not notarized cannot reorg a notarized chain

[19-Dec-18 07:16 PM] sgp#7572
notice how I never mentioned reorgs at all, let's put that aside for now

[19-Dec-18 07:16 PM] sgp#7572
suppose a node is currently on the longer chain A

[19-Dec-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
There are 2 places in the main.cpp that implement the dPoW. Where it currently looks at checkpoints and where it tries to disconnect the tip

[19-Dec-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the checkpoint code rejects any block that is earlier than a checkpoint

[19-Dec-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the disconnecttip change returns an error if it is the notarized block

[19-Dec-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if a node is on the longer chain A with a notarization, the above two rules would make it so it wont see blocks from chain B

assuming you mean me, the grin is very interesting, but it is unproven new tech, I would imagine from a privacy standpoint they would be approx the same but not sure how grin explorer would show the tx and if values are hidden also

Speaking of, the whole dPoW concept would work just as well on a PoS chain wouldn't it?

[20-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
would you be interested in writing some in depth article on dPoW?

[20-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes dPoW works regardless of the underlying consensus mechanism

[20-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the implementation assumes 256 bit blockhash and that there are blocks

[20-Dec-18 07:15 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
Maybe sometime next year if I can find some extra time, as well as understanding it all of course

[20-Dec-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be great. will have a bounty for it of course

[20-Dec-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it waits for the chain to obtain consensus and then makes what is basically a 13of 64 multisig tx as what is basically a proposed notarization

[20-Dec-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
then the nodes check to see if it is in their mainchain and updates their notarization state if it is

[20-Dec-18 07:18 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
I'm looking at the gamecredits PR that added Komodo, and curious how the proof system. How does the GC chain actually get the notary proofs? Are they submitted to the GC blockchain as some special tx, or do nodes monitor some external network?

[20-Dec-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
PoS chains tend to have much less issues with 51% but having an external reference solves most (all?) the objections against PoS consensus

[20-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
normal nodes just look for a the 13 vin 1 output notarization tx in the blocks as they come in

[20-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant assume that all nodes are connected to any other chain

[20-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization tx puts the notarization height and blockhash in the opreturn

[20-Dec-18 07:21 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
@üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ are you a journalist?

[20-Dec-18 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the notary nodes run full nodes for all the chains and provide the anchoring to the other chain

[20-Dec-18 07:21 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
Hmm. interesting. How does the notarization tx prove that the notarization has been put into BTC or KMD though?

[20-Dec-18 07:22 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
to the GC chain*

[20-Dec-18 07:22 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
reading some of the answers to the questions that were posted. Interesting discussion.

[20-Dec-18 07:22 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
@GlorymanRTS  Just like interesting new crypto tech that I come across üòÉ I'm a co-founder/lead dev on Qtum, though this isn't related to that. Just a personal interest

[20-Dec-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization p2p network runs a decentralized protocol and it doesnt submit the local notarization tx until the tx to the other chain is succeeded. Since the txid of the notarization is needed to be put in the local chain data, this is a prerequisite

[20-Dec-18 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible for all nodes to cross check the other chain for the notarization txid, but currently we are not doing that as we cant assume a node will be running both KMD and BTC

[20-Dec-18 07:25 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
@üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ I was looking for some accessible and interesting articles on the comparison of KMD, raven coin, ethereum,  ripple, monero ect.

[20-Dec-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
@GlorymanRTS can you wait with your questions till later?

[20-Dec-18 07:26 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
If a user node ran a local electrum/light wallet instance of btc (and kmd if you have that), they could use that to simply check that the notarization txid exists on btc/kmd though?

[20-Dec-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it would indeed be possible to do that

[20-Dec-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
thats a good idea! I can add an SPV crossvalidate option

[20-Dec-18 07:28 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
ok

[20-Dec-18 07:28 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
As it is right now though, if you had some group of colluding nodes, they could in theory communicate in private and submit a different notarization proof to GC than they do to the notary p2p network and/or kmd/btc?

[20-Dec-18 07:30 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
That was where my idea got stuck heh... that and mine didn't involve a notary system at all, it was rather just some "here's proof that this chain existed at this point in time" which is useful for preventing long (>500 block) stake attacks... but then if it's consensus, it needs some way to communicate with BTC

[20-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but it would need to be validated by all nodes as exisiting on the GC mainchain, by each node

[20-Dec-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, 13 evil notaries could create notarizations that dont follow the notarization p2p protocol

[20-Dec-18 07:31 PM] üÑ¥üÑ∞üÖÅüÑªüÖâ#5039
but only when they all win the lottery... I'm curious though of what effect that would have

[20-Dec-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but the only advantage I have seen is they can boost their mining ROI by orphaning competing chains

[20-Dec-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
a notarization that a node sees that is not in its mainchain is just ignored, so has no effect

[20-Dec-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
this problem does seem to require a set of trusted nodes to be the oracle for blockhash data

[20-Dec-18 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
private chains are invalidated with a notarization

[20-Dec-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but in an evil notary cabal scenario, what we want is notarizations to have no effect

[20-Dec-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
which they can certainly do
