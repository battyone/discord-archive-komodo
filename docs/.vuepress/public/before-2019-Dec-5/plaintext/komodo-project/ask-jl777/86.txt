maybe you can try ssl and if that doesnt work try tcp?

[15-Aug-19 10:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i can confirm mm2 support both

[15-Aug-19 10:24 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah i would do that probably

[15-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a process that parses all the files, determines ssl or tcp and puts it all into a single json array in a file with "coin" and "type" fields added

[15-Aug-19 10:26 AM] Slyris#2880
i would like

[15-Aug-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
then this can be run whenever there are important updates to the main coins file/electrums

[15-Aug-19 10:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Thank's, for the moment i will do a simple try and if i find this process i will use it !

[15-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the coins and electrums are not changing very often, just a weekly update by running the electrums file creator should be enough

[15-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
also it can start with parsing the old electrums file to remember the ssl vs tcp type and only do it for new electrum entries

[15-Aug-19 11:31 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Slyris Hi! TCP is default protocol used, if specific electrum address requires SSL it will be shown in coins repo: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums since commit: https://github.com/jl777/coins/commit/21597cef15d95d1835fb9ee47255f3ef930bfab8 As I can see there're no servers that use SSL as of now.

@jl777c Are there any plans to put the Komodo project into a company structure? Right now we have the KMD token which doenst give hodlers any equity, just a token to use on the platform. With all the new techniques you guys are coding (which are also interesting for other projects) do you guys considering changing the structure so hodlers could choose to invest in a company instead of a usage token?

[17-Aug-19 09:18 AM] CoinKing88#1540
If yes, it would be cool to give hodlers a change to get in prior to other ppl üôÇ

[17-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo the open source project wont become any company

[17-Aug-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
however there can be companies that can be using the open source tech

[17-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so KMD structure wont change, and others are working on company structure that builds with komodo tech. i am not directly involved in those efforts

[17-Aug-19 09:23 AM] CoinKing88#1540
You mean like redlabs etc.?

[17-Aug-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is one example. not sure what i am allowed to say about others

I noticed today that on the low volume CCL chain a tx can take long before being dpow secured as we have on demand mining turned on. Is there a way to address this?

[21-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it should actually go pretty fast. how long is "take long"

[21-Aug-19 02:50 PM] barv#0867
It went fast to 5 confirmations. Then 1 hour for number 6. Now I sent antother tx and it proceeds to 8

[21-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but how long did it take to get notarized?

[21-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
5 confirmations, if "confirmations" field means it was notarized. how many confirmations are you waiting for

[21-Aug-19 02:52 PM] barv#0867
Ah, I didn't think it was at 5. I figured 10 which it reaches now, after 4 to 5 hours

[21-Aug-19 02:53 PM] barv#0867
thx @Deleted User that is a solution indeed

[21-Aug-19 02:53 PM] SHossain#0007
CCL doesn't have many regular txs. There was 1 notarization a min ago. Follow what Emmanuel said and use cronjob to send tx to self every few mins

[21-Aug-19 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
You can send 0.0001 to self which would be very low cost

[21-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but why do you want to get more confirmations?

[21-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
once its notarized, its notarized

[21-Aug-19 02:54 PM] barv#0867
@jl777c I don't. I just don't want it to 'stop' before it is dpowed

[21-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
did it stop before it was notarized?

[21-Aug-19 02:55 PM] barv#0867
>> once its notarized, its notarized

[21-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Aug-19 02:55 PM] barv#0867
exactly. after that I don't care

[21-Aug-19 02:56 PM] barv#0867
Okay. That is good. So on demand mining makes sure a single tx gets notirised, and then it sleeps again?

[21-Aug-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
on demand mining doesnt guarantee it will get noarized right away, but most of the time it should

[21-Aug-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized

[21-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can see if it was notarized or not

[21-Aug-19 03:02 PM] barv#0867
Okay. I suspect we will have days with just 1 transaction. And I want to prevent them to be not dpowed within say 15 minutes. Should we then make this cronjob or is that unnecessary?

[21-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized

[21-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
is it reporting it as notarized or not? how often is it stuck at 1?

[21-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you think there is a problem?

[21-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized

[21-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
5 is more than 1

[21-Aug-19 03:05 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Just call a script on blocknotify that sends dust to yourself until the original transaction is notarized.

[21-Aug-19 03:05 PM] barv#0867
I am just trying to find out how this on demand mining works. I now know there wasn't a problem (but I just thought there was)

[21-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if there are no transactions in the mempool, no blocks are mined

[21-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that is ondemand blocks

[21-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can find cases where a transaction is not notarized, then let us know

[21-Aug-19 03:07 PM] barv#0867
Yes. So with only 1 tx a day you have a problem?

[21-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[21-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
does it get notarized?

[21-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if it gets notarized, 1 tx per year is still notarized

[21-Aug-19 03:08 PM] barv#0867
Because it will be out of the mempool once processed and then you have to wait for the next right?

[21-Aug-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
are you just making up problems based on guessing?

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a transaction that isnt notarized, then it should most of the time trigger a notarization

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
which puts another tx in the mempool

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
which gets mined

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] barv#0867
I try to understand the 'most of the time'

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
notarizations are not 100% guaranteed

[21-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it might not happen

[21-Aug-19 03:10 PM] barv#0867
and the only way to avoid that is more tx?

that shows CCL was notarized 4 blocks ago

[21-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
just send a tx once per hour

JL777, by when do you think the whole ecosystem you are trying to create will be complete? I've been a long time follower and I see we are closer now then ever. But, we might still be a good year away.

[31-Aug-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if by complete you mean the point where it wont be growing anymore, it certainly seems a lot farther out that a year. maybe in a year, all things will be in place to allow things to really start
