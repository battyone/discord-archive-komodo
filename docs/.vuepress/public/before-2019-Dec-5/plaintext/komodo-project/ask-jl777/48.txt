What could be reason for
`electrumx_rpc -p 10702 getinfo` throwing `error making request: CancelledError()`
but komod-cli is giving me some info
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=XXX getinfo`

[04-Feb-19 10:09 AM] niksmac#0421
On an assetchain set up

What keeps you motivated to keep moving Komodo forward even though it gets less recognition from the masses than other sub par projects?

[06-Feb-19 12:52 AM] Meyse#0952
I'm no jl777 but recognition from the masses is not important. I'm still here because I believe in the possibilities that Komodo offers which no other project offers. Recognition is achieved by other projects building on the Komodo tech

[06-Feb-19 01:43 AM] jspook16#3059
I guess I'm asking more about the day to day grind. I also believe in Komodo. I'm just curious as to what drives James.

[06-Feb-19 02:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll also wait for James' answer. üôÇ

[06-Feb-19 02:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But, from a similar mindset on working on this tech in this industry, I can share my views on this question.

[06-Feb-19 02:12 AM] jspook16#3059
Please do

[06-Feb-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Motivation:
- Even if you have everything, like enough money to survive where you don't even need to do anything to have good living and resources for your own lifetime and even for your next generation, a person who loves doing just does that for the sake of doing something meaningful. Self-fulfillment.

Constant improvement and Learning:
- The person who does 1 thing perfect, like is excellent in doing something which they have been doing for years, and loves doing it all day without feeling burdened will even do it for free. I know people from my circle who have the same mindset. Example, I go to same barber ever since I arrived in NZ. He has enough of fortune to not work ever, but he still does just because he loves doing it. This is not something which applies to some, but to many others who have achieved big success or things in life.
- What drives a person to keep learning, making, doing things, excelling is the self motivation of going 1 more extra mile, till the last breath one have before they die.
- The life is not all about struggles. It is amount the experiences you have going through it, good or bad, it makes a person what that person is because of all those past experiences. If you stop doing what you love to do, life will feel meaningless and empty.

[06-Feb-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Cryptocurrency industry is an infant:
- I'm not really sure how many people realize this, but even after the existence of Bitcoin for 10 Years which is 1 Decade, it is not even grown to the maturity level where it can be called something decent. This is experiment. Probably one of the most expensive one in entire history of humankind and the most widely social run experiment.
- There are not set standardization yet in cryptocurrency, and this whole industry is driving innovation and standardization in all directions.
- It will probably take a lot more years for things to get settled down before we can call it regular thing of everyday, may be another decade or two if I just have to guess.
- I see James' work not doing work and comparing itself to just today's industry project. It is paving the path to some very well thought out architecture which is in my opinion an outcome of years of experience one has from lifetime of work working in computer science in various areas. See it from this view point, it is really a long term project than short term. To my opinion it'd be very silly to compare KMD project to compare with today's project. Compare it to some future projects, as KMD is advance in innovations than others in years like 2-5 years!

[06-Feb-19 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, there is no finish line for this project. It will always be improving further, even if jl777 is no more with the project. I hope that by that time this project is widely spread and known as one of the excellent piece of tech another anonymous dev gave to the world like Satoshi gave us decentralized internet money.

[06-Feb-19 02:38 AM] jspook16#3059
Thanks for the view @grewalsatinder

My oppinion is that hes not... because to understand how BTC worked he wrote it again in C (iguana) ... if he was satoshi then he woudnt have needd to do that.

[06-Feb-19 08:06 AM] Mylo#8306
anonymous satoshi nakamoto backwards or hal finney.   if in the interest of national security, maybe the signals for making an alternative currency were there.   computers started off as a research of the air force or navy and economists iirc.  after ww2 and other wars, there'd be enough data to signal things going in the wrong direction.  banking failures is probably the biggest signal.   so start a bankerless money system.  might take 20-50 years, but it won't end in nuclear war.   crypto so far has not bombed the sh*t out of any country.

a musician will play music, a chef will cook.  why not a coder code?

i need a good advice from a C programmer, cause i‚Äòm pretty new to C. what do you use instead of the strncpy function? strncpy doesn‚Äòt produce null-terminated strings so it causes unwanted behavior. is there a secure alternative? üòÉ @jl777c

[10-Feb-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
strcpy

[10-Feb-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
strncpy should create a null term string if there is enough space. you can check if the last char is non-0

[10-Feb-19 04:12 PM] jmpout#7289
oh ok, thank you jl777c üí™ because a lot suggested to not use these functions because they aren‚Äòt reliable ^^

[10-Feb-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
they are very simple functions. depending on what type of inputs you need to handle, then you can always add error checking and then call strncpy

Hi, sorry in advance if is a silly question, but, if Komodo can achieve 1M txs, and can emulate a Ethereum VM, can Komodo do more Ethereum txs than the Ethereum blockchain itself?

[10-Feb-19 10:51 PM] beor#1569
In other words, can Komodo have a Ethereum compatible sidechain with more tx than the original?

[11-Feb-19 01:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
short answer is yes, but someone would ahve to build it

[11-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Mylo#8306
There is a bounty for an EVM implementation.  Details here for porting solidity to komodo crypto conditions https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-3/

EOS did have a project to achieve the same, but I think they stopped it.

If another project ports solidity to their environment, then depending on their devs, the license, the language, our devs - it would be a possibility.

Great, thanks!

[11-Feb-19 06:59 PM] hastrup#8742
I have just talk somone at the resdex telegram group and I ask about what relationships they had whit komodo and this what his answer
Daniel:

We aren't using Barterdex code, we have written our code from scratch : ) When we mentioned BarterDEX it was because we have similar features such as BDEX uses atomic swaps and we do so as well. Likewise they use snarks for Privacy.

My question is. 
I have read that you have mentioned that bdex could use resdex lp but how is that possible when they use a different code. Kind regards

[11-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
my understanding was they forked barterDEX. if it is different then of course it cant work together so easily

[11-Feb-19 07:04 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c maybe that is the case but there admin just don't know it. But if it is a fork would Dex coin also work in the fork?

[11-Feb-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you are asking me to speculate about your speculations on what something someone else did?

[11-Feb-19 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I see you seeing me seeing you seeing me seeing you

[11-Feb-19 07:07 PM] hastrup#8742
It sound like it lol. I just wonder about if a fork where to happen would Dex coin work on the new fork.

[11-Feb-19 07:08 PM] hastrup#8742
But maybe ComputerGenie can answer it I don't want to bother you any more

[11-Feb-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_has no clue what internals someone else is using_

[11-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont even know if it is a fork and if it is what changes they made

[11-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are asking me to speculate on something nobody here has any actual information about

[11-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
might as well ask your dog

[11-Feb-19 07:11 PM] hastrup#8742
No I'm not. If I fork bdex and I have done nothing to the code would the original Dex coin still apply to the new fork

[11-Feb-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if there are no changes, then you are asking if original Dex coin would work with an unmodified bdex?

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
@hastrup if they want to share liquidity with bdex, they need to keep the DEX address the same

[11-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
but it's trivial for them to change it

[11-Feb-19 07:14 PM] Alright#0419
@hastrup do you have a link to their github or where ever their code is?

[11-Feb-19 07:15 PM] hastrup#8742
They just posted this to me

Daniel:
By the way Ole, re-read what I said again. I confirmed with devs we aren't using front-end code but we do use back-end code from Komodo : )
We wish to work closely with KMD ecosystem actually and related projects (planning to list most of them) 

By adding KMD & asset-chains to ResDEX we plan to improve liquidity for KMD projects and get us support of Komodo's traders : )

[11-Feb-19 07:15 PM] Alright#0419
if you find me the code, I'll tell you whether or not they changed it

[11-Feb-19 07:16 PM] hastrup#8742
Cool I ask

[11-Feb-19 07:17 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c yes

@hastrup @Alright @ph03nix @Cryptoon  If you're interested: Res DEX is scheduled to have live demo for their technical community on 13th Feb, 5:00 p.m. CET. It will probably be for a close circle only. I've got an invitation from Wolf of RES via direct message. Demo will be running on a separate channel, locked for a live video/AMA parcipitants only. But I don't have a technical skills so basically I am useless for your discussion. If you would like to know more, ask for an invitation.

[11-Feb-19 10:25 PM] Alright#0419
Do you have any idea when they'll make the code public?

[11-Feb-19 10:26 PM] Alright#0419
Think they might have to at that point according the license, but I could be wrong

[11-Feb-19 10:26 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
No. But you can probably ask them.

[11-Feb-19 10:27 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
I can show a print screen of a communication with Wolf of RES, but i'm almost sure you need persionalized invitation.

[12-Feb-19 03:14 AM] hastrup#8742
@Alright Daniel:
To answer your questions, Github will be launched later on not at this time (expect sometime in Q2 2019, will give you a set date when we announce it). But you can join Discord through https://discord.gg/7weECSh
Check out #dev-mining and #proof-of-research channels there, quite a lot of discussion goes there!

[12-Feb-19 11:42 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Hiya @Alright  @Cryptoon @jl777c  : ) 
We are happy to have a Private demo / call for ResDEX exchange demo with Komodo developers. You can ask any other questions you guys have for Resistance core devs & team.

Our current one as scheduled for Wednesday has slots booked/ full now from our own community.  I can setup another invitation form for those who are interested.

Regarding code; yes it isn't public yet and by our current plans we aim to make it public in Q2 2019!

[12-Feb-19 01:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is the discord. You need to migrate your coins if you have not

[12-Feb-19 03:59 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c incase BTC fails, how fast can KMD latch onto another strong PoW coin for security?

[12-Feb-19 04:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@Tek Komodo has already notarized to LTC in the past when BTC fees skyrocketed and BCH is probably a simple hotfix of switching the daemon around and where the oracle's check for their notarization.

[12-Feb-19 04:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Ethereum is highly unlikely for backups. If Komodo were to switch it will be to one of the two mentioned above.

[12-Feb-19 04:47 PM] Tek#5253
@BlackJesus but its a plug and play system, so they can switch and do it relatively fast? Dash is coming out with ChainLocks soon making 51% attacks not viable, is Dash on the menu?

[12-Feb-19 04:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Doubt it.

[12-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
sad.

[12-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Tek#5253
but all I needed to know if they could switch fast

[12-Feb-19 04:49 PM] Tek#5253
I don't have faith in BTC or LTC, maybe BCH.

[12-Feb-19 04:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I don't have much faith in Dash

[12-Feb-19 04:49 PM] Tek#5253
They are innovating, like KMD üòõ

[12-Feb-19 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
BTC is used simply because it has the highest hashrate

[12-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253
I know this

[12-Feb-19 04:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The masternode model isn't the best idea. It promotes hoarding, and with their seedy premine from the early days leading into a holders market idk man.

[12-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Tek#5253

[12-Feb-19 04:50 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Weren't something like 30% of all dash in existence instamined during inception.

[12-Feb-19 04:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Hell they adhoc the max supply to make sure the instamined coins would always be substantial.

[12-Feb-19 04:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It honestly isn't. It's true facts are not fud.

[12-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Tek#5253
