@jl777c  what do you think of that? "If someone wants to have a PoW blockchain I can see why he should use komodo (security), but if he wants PoS, I don't don't see a reason to use komodo nor the original multimillion mature PoS blockchain project when someone develops a tweakable zero cost blockchain generators of them." - 
a developer, when choosing a chain to use, would have to weight the modularity of consensus level changes when spawning a komodo assets chain with another PoS chain generator with less tweakable parameters and a mature multi devloper ecosystem that he could use after the chain has spawn

[30-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Mylo#8306
tweakable parameters, once launched to change require a hardfork.    so tweak whilst testing, testing testing....then launch.  the tweakable part is then less of a distraction.

[30-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Mylo#8306
have you lauched an assetchain and tweaked parameters OR forked a PoS from experience?

[30-Apr-19 01:12 PM] artik123#2884

there are 18 parameters ranging from privacy to non private, PoS & PoW & in a hybrd config, founders fee, block rewards, eras of emission for rewards + many more....all from command line.   this is a 5 second tweak compared to C++ code changes and testing.

yes,   build-a-coin was cool 5 years ago perhaps, but the market moves along.   build-a-coin is natively part of komodo with a lot of extra features.

@jl777c would you say it some sort of wix/wordpress for blockchains?

If you could put 4000 more tools in a "Swiss army knife" without sacrificing utility or size, then that's what Komodo would be for blockchains

[30-Apr-19 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@@artik123 Interesting to see you struggling understanding why to use Komodo.

[30-Apr-19 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought u had a grasp of it

[30-Apr-19 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
May be you need to catchup a lot

[30-Apr-19 02:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[30-Apr-19 02:07 PM] artik123#2884
It's all about trade-offs, I'm trying to have a crystal clear understanding about the trade-offs that a guy that has a future killer app idea would have to make

[30-Apr-19 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That guy will really learn good lessons in life for sure. It is good in many cases, but such lessons cost time, and a lot of money.

[30-Apr-19 02:10 PM] artik123#2884
I didn't say he would choose komodo or other blockchain. just trying to understand the trade-offs

[30-Apr-19 02:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anyway, u can try assetchains params to create a PoS blockchain. 
Then check existing crypto-conditions documentation and many reference code,
Then make a CC for your own PoS assetchain. 

All with a cost of 0 KMD.
If desired can go with dPoW with your choice or not.

[30-Apr-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If ur blockchain project goes big, can scale it too, with MoMoM tech. Already tested last year.

[30-Apr-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd also suggest you to learn about VerusCoin

[30-Apr-19 02:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
They are one of the most smart project in KMD ecosystem.

[30-Apr-19 02:16 PM] artik123#2884
the future will come anyway... 
I just want that guy to have a clear cut decision to pick komodo and not otherwise... thats why understanding the trade-offs is so important

[30-Apr-19 02:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
When learned and tried assetchains params, and in case having questions about CC, just ask here

[30-Apr-19 02:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm having the feeling you are rushing to take decision. If so, do not do so. Give your own self time to read, analyze different possible solutions for a problem.

[30-Apr-19 02:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If don't like komodo, don't go with it. Go with the solution u liked. Maybe possible you get success out of it.

[30-Apr-19 02:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just read all you possibly can about komodo.

[30-Apr-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also share what you didn't like about komodo. We'd love to hear where it didn't meet dev's needs.

[30-Apr-19 02:22 PM] artik123#2884
Let me ask it this way. do you think that any guy with a killer app would certainly use the komodo route? and also what could define the guy that does choose the komodo route?
low development costs, scarce of resources like time and money?
for example for someone to create his own chain from scratch would be the longest route and the most time, money consuming...
but at-least 100 projects went this route... so how would you define the guy that chooses komodo?

[30-Apr-19 02:24 PM] artik123#2884
in other words.. who are your customers?

[30-Apr-19 02:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess you need to first define that "Guy". I just assume that, that guy is a developer, a developer who can code in languages which are complied to  native code, instead of bytecode, for now. If so, the finest route is the same I expressed in steps earlier in my comments. 

If a Javascript dev, better wait for @Deleted User to finish his work, then that too will be possible soon enough.

[30-Apr-19 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also read. Without reading the written material you are missing a lot of knowledge and wisdom about komodo.

[30-Apr-19 02:28 PM] artik123#2884
I want you to define that guy.... is he a developer? entrepreneur?

[30-Apr-19 02:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo is NOT a smart contracts platform. 
It is in my opinion Smart Custom Consensus Platform

[30-Apr-19 02:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Where developers create Custom consensus.

[30-Apr-19 02:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or just use existing custom consensus RPC API calls to make applications on top of it.

[30-Apr-19 02:30 PM] artik123#2884
this is a definition of the tech... not the customer...

[30-Apr-19 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can not answer that guy question. Just pick the examples from existing world and history for such guys.

[30-Apr-19 02:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Devs who became entrepreneurs

[30-Apr-19 02:32 PM] artik123#2884

Killer app. The app word says the person has to be a developer to make an app.

[30-Apr-19 02:33 PM] artik123#2884
it doesn't. he could be just a guy that has a killer app idea and some money

we are talking from a completely different points of view. to my understanding it is unknown yet 
who is the customer so it's more like shooting in the dark and hoping for a fish to get caught in the net.

[30-Apr-19 03:07 PM] artik123#2884
for example, to my understanding, it's not that good for someone who care less about consensus level changes and more about governance.

[30-Apr-19 03:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think the WP comparison works really well for the fork vs. assetchain discussion. A developer with a great website idea can code the php from scratch but won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of the tons of plugins already built for the WP framework, similar situation with Komodo and its CC,  you *could* custom code functionality into your chain, or take advantage of the dozens of already coded and tested modules.  Since time= money ,  just like with WordPress you save a lot of both.  This is especially important for people don‚Äôt have lots of money or dev experience  to be able to work on a project.

@artik123   Governance can be done with consensus level changes,  cc payments is a good example of governance functionality  through consensus.

[30-Apr-19 03:09 PM] artik123#2884
this is a start

[30-Apr-19 03:09 PM] artik123#2884
same for voting?

[30-Apr-19 03:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes I am sure that could be done as well,  though currently we don‚Äôt have a voting CC.   CC is very powerful in that you can pretty much make anything abide by consensus

[30-Apr-19 03:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Governance is something that people I assume want enforced so  there needs to be a mechanism to enforce it

Komodo (4) 

[30-Apr-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
look at miketout, he was CTO of parallels and also did .net at MSFT. He could have spent time making a blockchain from scratch, but realized building on top of komodo would save a lot of time. within one year, he delivered on the whitepaper and now has extended komodo tech to some pretty amazing level

[30-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
projects are switching to komodo if they dont have a large dev team also, as they can get a lot of  dev automatically done, like HUSH, hempcoin and likely more to follow

[30-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a wide spectrum
