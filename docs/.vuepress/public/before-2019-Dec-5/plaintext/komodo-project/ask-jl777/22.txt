Hi James I am curious what interests you about the Hush project? As I understand it is a zcash fork like many others. What about it makes it stand out to you?

[11-Sep-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
BTCH

[11-Sep-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
I see them as a couple HUSH+BTCH

[11-Sep-18 12:06 PM] Hegelian#0018
Is it currently possible to use Komodo for private messaging?

[11-Sep-18 12:07 PM] Hegelian#0018
And will every kmd asset chain have or will have this functionality?

[11-Sep-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you can encrypt data in OP_RETURN

[11-Sep-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also hushlist that i think works with the 512 bytes inside each z-transaction

[11-Sep-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so, yes, itis possible

[11-Sep-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
with oracles CC you can setup an encrypted point to point messaging

Hello, are there fiat gateways and securty tokens at komodo in the ecosystem or is it planned?

[12-Sep-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
peer2cloud  is a fiat gateway, along with bitpanda, there are atms, some services in australia, also austria

[12-Sep-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what exactly you mean by security token

[12-Sep-18 09:03 AM] Paul#0981
Nex will also offer a direct fiat connection, but KMD doesn't cover that with BarterDex or Hyperdex? to the other one was meant whether secuurity token vs utility token, which one is it...

[12-Sep-18 09:11 AM] ollsanek#8340
HI! how far we from zk-snark micropayment channels like z-channel or bolt proposals ?

[12-Sep-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
until fiat implements hashlocks and timelocks, you cant atomic swap with it, so how could there be barterdex support?

[12-Sep-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not clear on the exact definition differences between security token, utility token, cryptocoin. KMD is a crypto coin, it allows to create both security tokens and other cryptocoins and utility tokens

[12-Sep-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
we are not working on zksnark micropayments, but we have in development a channels CC

[12-Sep-18 09:23 AM] ollsanek#8340
as I understand CC channels is not private, correct?

[12-Sep-18 09:26 AM] Paul#0981
ok thank you

[12-Sep-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
CC channels are transparent, yes

[12-Sep-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
until there a homomorphic contracts, it cannot be private

[12-Sep-18 09:38 AM] ollsanek#8340
ok thank you

[12-Sep-18 03:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Paul We support fiat backed tokens such as USDT and GUSD in HyperDEX

[12-Sep-18 03:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
not direct support but about as good as we can get away with while remaining decentralised and not requiring KYC

[12-Sep-18 03:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
Oh and Dai too

[12-Sep-18 04:44 PM] Paul#0981

Any support planned for different algos on asset chain creation?

[13-Sep-18 05:54 AM] Mylo#8306
@bishop yes.  VerusHash will be supported.  Just waiting for some code and testing.
After implementation the work on what to do to make other algorithms available can be highlighted/documented

Hi, I saw on the SuperNET holdings page that it also holds 1,312,500 MNZ tokens, is this from the private presale or something else?

[13-Sep-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is just being held for others

[13-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362

dose Komodo platform offer something similar to Lightening network?  I know CHIP allows micropayments, maybe using similar approach.  just couldn't find any good information online

[13-Sep-18 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
Komodo doesn't use LN

Has the channels cc made chips obsolete?

[14-Sep-18 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so really, as the pangea protocol is in chips.

[14-Sep-18 03:42 AM] rainbro7#4735
With crypto conditions and the Gemini dollar peg coin, can barterdex become a decentralized bitmex? That would be crazy!

[14-Sep-18 03:44 AM] rainbro7#4735
Oh okay

[14-Sep-18 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Chips does use CC already its in the CHIPS code.

[14-Sep-18 05:52 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Channels have nothing to do with replacing CHIPS but I think they could be used in place of LN for the same purpose, that is creating temporary gaming tables for CHIPS

[14-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
channels isnt LN, it is dPoW secured mempool transactions. So it is backward compatible with existing infrastructure, but it is all onchain tx, not offchain. So it is different solution and wont help with scaling

[14-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it does however allow instantly validated payments, good for paying at Starbucks and not having to wait for confirms

[14-Sep-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810

Is there a solution to have a dICO of tokenized securities with KYC and AML integrated?

So if interested might be good to contact them, cheers

[14-Sep-18 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
we aren't holding a dico. it's a normal ICO with kyc. One of our partners is interested in barterdex tech and we are discussing ways of adding a KYC layer to BarterDEX. We still need a proof of concept.

[14-Sep-18 04:40 PM] PTYX#6840
the concept is simple though. You whitelist an address and make sure that your BOB doesn't trade with any addresses that aren't whitelisted.

[14-Sep-18 04:41 PM] PTYX#6840
the whitelisting process would involve various apis depending on your KYC provider.

oracles CC solve the performance issue of having thousands of datasources being updated

[16-Sep-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it also builds in a monetization for data at market prices

[16-Sep-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
by launching a new chain just for some specific data usage, the cost for lifetime of data samples can just be premined, but as the coin gains in value the data providers becomes a bit like miners

[16-Sep-18 07:36 PM] jspook16#3059
is the fee pre-defined, variable, etc?

[16-Sep-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
each data provider can set it and change it with a tx

I have a question about the burn protocol for cross-chain tx, I read that Notary Nodes are the ones checking and providing the proofs for this to work. The inner details are of beyond my understanding but do you see it possible in future to use CryptoConditions to blockchain-enforce such cross-chain tx? Without NN having to play a part

[17-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
NN post the merkle roots to the chains during the notarization process. they are not involved in creating the proofs

[17-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
NN notarized

[17-Sep-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
using that notarization, the node doing the cross chain can create the proofs

[17-Sep-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont see how we can keep notarizing without NN

[17-Sep-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so I think your assumption is incorrect

[17-Sep-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
however, gateways CC uses the oracles CC to get merkle roots onchain and that doesnt involve notary nodes, just the multisig signer nodes
