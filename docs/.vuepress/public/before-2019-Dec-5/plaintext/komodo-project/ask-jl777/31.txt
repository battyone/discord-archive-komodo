exactly, research is it all comes to.
When I asked many questions in the beginning to James I always made sure I did my home work to find the answers, and when I could not I just asked James.

[21-Nov-18 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because I value his time, and I value the learning experience.

adding checkpoints is usually a centralized process, however dPoW adds checkpoints automatically using a randomized process between the 64 elected notary nodes. to call that centralized is being ignorant of what it is. basically hearing "checkpoint" -> "must be centralized"

[21-Nov-18 01:22 PM] kriptek#7720
@jl777c I heard in an interview about the “expense” of the dPoW process of notarizing KMD transactions to the btc blockchain...what is this expense and does it make the Komodo platform unsuitable for low cap, low value coins (thinking ETN)?

[21-Nov-18 01:24 PM] kriptek#7720
I like KMD platform and have an idea for an app or Dapp but this app would require an ETN like coin.

[21-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD already pays the same BTC txfees, whether it notarizes 1 coin or 1000

[21-Nov-18 01:37 PM] kriptek#7720
@jl777c looks like the website got an update: more platform on boarding focused. I’d like to create an app using a native coin on the kmd platform but I’d imagine there are significant upfront costs, but I have to ask...any possibility to share revenue or ownership with the Kmd community rather than upfront cash outlay?

[21-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the cost is a few thousand dollars per year for dPoW. if your idea is good enough, you should be able to find someone in the community who can help or provide capital. there are -ac_founders option now to be able to recoup via coins mined

[21-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
also -ac_perc that pays based on coin usage

[22-Nov-18 11:27 AM] Cassius#9158
How advanced is the launch-your-own-chain functionality? I'm intrigued by this. It sounds like a great way to sandbox new crypto projects so people can define and tweak parameters, see how they work in the wild, then update them as they learn more

there are probably dozens of -ac params now and you can customize the chain parameters with a lot of control

[22-Nov-18 11:30 AM] Cassius#9158

Thank you, I'll take a look

[22-Nov-18 11:40 AM] Cassius#9158
That looks pretty impressive

[22-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
seems right around 2 dozen, but these combine and basically can create millions of different types of chain params

[22-Nov-18 10:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Cassius yes you can make custom rules around protocol/consensus using crypto-conditions 
These are different level od smart contracts which can work from consensus level to app backend level

[22-Nov-18 10:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Like C language can be used to make a code which can affect deep hardware level stuff to an end user level apps, depending on how it's used and coded, in an analogy.

[23-Nov-18 06:47 AM] Cassius#9158
Oh cool. You have more details?

[23-Nov-18 07:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cryptoconditions.info should be more helpful

It's a textbook from James

[23-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Mylo#8306
@Cassius 
Re:  change consensus of your chain, yes - this is what crypto conditions allows a developer to do.   For instance, say you wanted to send all block rewards to a contract, then once per day you trigger a payout from that contract to “people that play your game in the last 24 hours” - then you need to make this player-data available to the blockchain - you can do this through an oracle and you make your “protocol”/data-structure of the different players from the day.
The daily payout from the smart contract can be triggered by some specific node(s) to enquiry to the oracle data, and pay out proportionately to your players.

That is a hypothetical scenario atm, but do-able as a change of payout method, using off-chain data.

https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-7/ bit of info in the last section.

[23-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Cassius#9158
Thanks, interesting indeed. I was vaguely kicking around an idea, not sure how smart/possible it would be in practice

[23-Nov-18 04:34 PM] Cassius#9158
Basically to rewrite old blockchain entries to 'compress' them, e.g. A->B->C ---> A->C

[23-Nov-18 04:34 PM] Cassius#9158
That's a far more complicated case though

I'm learning Python currently. I was studying C++ but have switched focus to Python. My question is whether or not you think Python is valuable in the cryptocurrency/blockchain space?

[26-Nov-18 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly useful things can be made with python

[26-Nov-18 06:15 PM] kriptek#7720
My thought is that by learning Python I will be able to develop on the client side, while applying to the crypto space, without neccessarily using C++ or Java for actual crypto/blockchain development...

[26-Nov-18 06:15 PM] kriptek#7720
Smartphone apps that use implement crypto being the end goal applications..

[26-Nov-18 06:21 PM] kriptek#7720
Thanks. You are awesome

[26-Nov-18 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kriptek there are massive amounts of automated tests for BTC + ZEC, which KMD inherited and now has it's own additions to. They are all written in Python, so if you are interested in testing, Python is very valuable. These are the tests for cryptoconditions: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py

@kriptek I would suggest you to don't leave practice on C++ if you focus on python. There can possibly be python interpreters for crypto-conditions in future, but right now you can only code these smart contracts in C/C++

[26-Nov-18 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810

Hi,
```CC is not smart contracts - jl777 ```
 I've made the mistake of referring to CC as Smart Contracts.
Could someone please show me where I can find what the difference is, bearing in mind that I have little background knowledge?

[27-Nov-18 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
When people refer to smart contracts, like in ETH, all the nodes+miners know a specific programming language(Ex: solidity). The contracts are written on the blockchain using the programming language and as all nodes know the language, they will evaluate them.

In Komodo's architecture, there is no such thing as solidity. The code for the contracts is already in the daemon. The only data that gets written on the blockchain is a reference to the contract and any other inputs it requires. So theoretically, the code in the daemon can be written in any language. This also gives us the possibility for a modular architecture, where you specify the contracts you want to run on your blockchain when compiling your daemon and only those contracts are usable on the chain created using it. Currently all the contracts get added to the daemon by default when you use it for assetchains but this modular functionality is planned for the future when there are more contracts

[27-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a custom consensus module

[27-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
not a contract

[27-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at the initial CC that are being made and you will see it is not anything like solidity contracts

[27-Nov-18 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
@gcharang @jl777c Thanks, for the info! Much clearer now!

Perhaps a long shot...well probably...but are you interested in doing an interview and being apart of a live AMA? Would love for you to discuss the updates happening in the next few weeks as well as the entire KMD ecosystem. Maybe even drop some hints or “exclusives” on some branding?

[28-Nov-18 08:06 AM] BitDaddy#1453
Hows about a rebrand. The project is amazing been in from the start but the pirate name  just sounds like a dodgy chain that is going to rob you at first chance. Sorry if this seems rude but got to get my opinion out there. I have one suggestion RaydARR  given the fact that it is untraceable off the radar so to speak. This could also keep the ARRR ticker. I believe this could help the project gain more momentum and gain more public support. Any thoughts on this. 👍

isnt KMD going to get this merged mining feature in the near future?

[28-Nov-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
will you do a deal with bitmain?

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
convincing miners to merge mine isnt exactly easy (or free)

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
they have merged mining with btc

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
and half of bitmain hashrate is still significantly less than BTC hashrate

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
starting in December

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i would do a deal with bitmain as they are very powerful

[28-Nov-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that each miner needs to specifically merge mine a specific coin for that coin to be merge mined?

[28-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
especially if i was a coin outside the top 100

[28-Nov-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
