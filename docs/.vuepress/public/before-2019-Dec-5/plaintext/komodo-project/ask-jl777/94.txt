grid coin has done this, it seems possible but not sure the demand for it

[29-Nov-19 03:33 PM] beor#1569
Oh, i mean gridcoin, not grincoin, my mistake. But, with the climatic change and concerns with the Bitcoin electric consum, can be a good idea.

I have looked into this idea a lot ,  BOINC computations seem a match made in heaven.  The main hurdle of a BOINC crypto is the economic structure , Gridcoin and similar coins have gone the route of rewarding users with a coin,  the issue comes with a lack of utility of the coin.  Other than trading it for BTC / ETH there is nothing you can do with it.  The problem is made harder in that pretty much all BOINC projects are volunteer based .    A coin based on BOINC  needs to have a utility , some reason a person will keep on to and use the coin.  I have found a project out of the university of Brno in CZ that is a BOiNC based hashcat distribution ,  this could be an example of a public utility BOINC project.  People use the coin for work prioritization .  Other BOiNC projects can be rewarded as well but one has to be cognizant of the issues ( some people try and game the system to get more credits and in doing so sabotage the research being done )

bitcoin electricity use these days is getting greener every year, renewables without a way to transmit or store is the cheapest source of power

It is a myth that eventually bitcoin mining will have a big impact on climate change, cruise lines do more damage right now

I will argue for BOINC from a different perspective ,  that of user acquisition,  BOINC has a big community and many people are willing to contribute to research additionally with the crunch on worthwhile gpu and cpu minable coins this gives them a way to earn and contribute without competition found in mining

Have a lot of people taken you up on the supernet floor proposal?

[30-Nov-19 12:14 AM] allbits#5898
You can find that information yourself on the blockchain

hey there

[30-Nov-19 04:22 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
you mentioned i should have 3 addresses correct ?
can you explain that ?
i have my youtube channel
an exchange receive address
and my secret address for myself ...correct ?
all 3 address within the same wallet
the backup wallet.DAT should carry all those private keys if i ever want to import into a hardware wallet

[30-Nov-19 04:23 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
@jl777c

[30-Nov-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, those 3 addresses. however i wouldnt expect hardware wallet anytime soon

[30-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
oh why

[30-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
is it difficult for hardware wallets using Z ?

[30-Nov-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
can you name a single one that does?

right

[30-Nov-19 05:01 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
none

[30-Nov-19 05:01 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860
is it possible  ?

[30-Nov-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be possible, but doing zksnarks in a hardware wallet likely wont be easy at all

[30-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Offshore Crypto#6860

So zksnarks may not be replaced by Stark’s

[01-Dec-19 01:22 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860
Because starks may not improve the functionality

[01-Dec-19 01:22 AM] Offshore Crypto#6860

ARRR is an even bigger risk than Zcash. It relies on Zcash for all the tech that just 1 or 2 of their devs understand

@jl777c how are the arrr coins audited for supply?

based on the zcash sapling code

the sprout supply was audited through a turnstile

thx

[04-Dec-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
note that the loans are at 0% and there is no counterparty, it is purely with the blockchain.

[04-Dec-19 04:31 PM] Mylo#8306
it is based on the USD price of the collateral?  (i would guess, yes for USDK)

when paying back the stablecoin, there is no fee? (hence the 0%)

in the case that KMD is used as collateral, the rewards would still be accruing?

if so, will the rewards go to the depositer upon release, or would they go to some "fund", or do they just not exist?  or is there automated blockclaim re-deposit to claim the reward monthly?

in the current design, the rewards are for the maintainance costs of the multisig signers' servers

> it is based on the USD price of the collateral?  (i would guess, yes for USDK)
yes
if the stable coin is pegged to BTC and collateral is KMD, KMD/BTC price is used

> when paying back the stablecoin, there is no fee? (hence the 0%)

if the price did not go below a certain amount and the debt ratio was always below 80%, afaik, there is no fee

[04-Dec-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you issued X stablecoins, you can pay back X stablecoins to release all collateral
