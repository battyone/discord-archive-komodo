Is this RK9ogyZ1W5CJS837ui7QDLcTaxqBVUtVxq the adress that the agamahack hacker used?

[06-Nov-19 04:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I was thinking if the faucet could be conditioned? like it seems goo idea to give away some coins per address but to me it only mae sense if one will use it for "testing purpose" to check if some functionality in an app will work or how easy it is to get some service and so ...

[06-Nov-19 04:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
however if these are money per addr then abusers might create an addr every second and comulate it

[06-Nov-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
that is how it works now

[06-Nov-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
small amount per address

[06-Nov-19 04:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so for example it can be conditioned to only be spendable to 1 addr ?

[06-Nov-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it can be spent anywhere once you get it, but it takes a minute of CPU to get 0.1 coins

[06-Nov-19 04:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ah ok so it's kind of mining

[06-Nov-19 04:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
good there is protection in place

[06-Nov-19 04:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I was thinking if spending address conditioning would be possible that would probably kill abusing or limit it also greatly

[06-Nov-19 04:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if a service got dedicated addr and you could only spend fauce cash there  abusing makes little sense

[06-Nov-19 04:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is there also a time limit for faucet? for example to allow only 1 year or block num equivalent ?

[06-Nov-19 04:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually having kind of "cupon service" where can get money but spend it only to 1 addr would be what many shops are doing with prepaid cards to promote themselves

[06-Nov-19 04:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for apps ans services that are starting would be good in initial period

[06-Nov-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
only fresh address that "mine" get the 0.1 coins. the protection is that the 0.1 coins is not worth spending a minute mining

There is a post about BIP39 seed phrase entropy that was once shared with me.   The explanation in it was showing how leaking the position of word reduces the entropy greatly.

Are you able to reshare the link if you are familiar with my request, jl or community?
Cheers

[13-Nov-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
just leaking the word, discloses the exact bits that must be in the privkey

[13-Nov-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
our method hashes the entire seed, so even if a word is leaked, it wont give much advantage in decoding privkey

[13-Nov-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if the word and position is known, that is even worse with bip39 as that directly reduces the entropy bits

[13-Nov-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810

kmd is not the country code for Indonesia ,  the closest claimant to the gTLD is a small town.  We have a strong claim because of our ticker, name and community size .    If someone wants to try and do a non-ICANN domain name feel free to,  just be aware of the benefits and drawbacks

[15-Nov-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
fast syncing is definitely possible, even without the highly encoded ramchain data structures

[15-Nov-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but a much more efficient way would be to automatically validate a bootstrap using nspv

[15-Nov-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and having incremental bootstraps

[15-Nov-19 09:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes that does seem better as all it has to do is validate notarizations ,  didn’t think of nSPV being applied to bootstraps before

[15-Nov-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
just need to nSPV validate a tx in the latest bootstrap height at notarization. then the entire bootstrap is validated

Honest question that perhaps might make some people angry. How is it possible to justify the current value of the top 100 coins. Coins with 10-50k in transactions per a day are valued at over 100 mill. Seem like an illusion. Take komodo for example, what can justify the price? Technology? It's all open, can't someone take it? The team? You guys are amazing but 20 mill can prob make a great team. Utilization? There is not much use that would require coins to be purchased. Speculation? Of what exactly? There are 1000 coins competing to do nearly the same things. Anyone have an answer? I feel crypto will go to 80% under current prices in 1 year.

[17-Nov-19 03:13 PM] joe2x4#5987

[17-Nov-19 03:16 PM] jspook16#3059
As for price? Well currently I think it's speculation that kmd ecosystem will be able to efficiently support use cases in the future. What those are is really up to everyone that wants to implement something using their infrastructure

[17-Nov-19 03:17 PM] jspook16#3059
Then there's the dex and chips/pangea

[17-Nov-19 03:18 PM] jspook16#3059
The dex may provide fee relief or faster trading via kmd and chips I think will pass through kmd at some stage

[17-Nov-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> How is it possible to justify the current value of the top 100 coins.
it's mostly not

[17-Nov-19 03:19 PM] jspook16#3059
Concur. Current value I think has mostly been established by the amount of fiat that has been invested into

[17-Nov-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sunk mining cost factors in that too (somewhere), but that's more of an "excuse" than a "real" value

[17-Nov-19 03:24 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah there's that too. As far as coins competing for the same thing, true. Basically, do your research. If you believe crypto has a future, pick a few horses and see who hits the finish line first. If you don't believe crypto has a future, there's nothing wrong with that either.

[17-Nov-19 03:39 PM] jspook16#3059
I think your on to something though regarding price drop. I think alot of the coins whose development has fallen behind will essentially tank. And that value will start moving into the more established coins. We're past the phase where any coin with a roadmap can establish funding. They'll need something tangible. Just my thoughts
