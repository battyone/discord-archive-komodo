I didn't set that rpc port in conf

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Had someone done contract calls before the fork?

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Alright#0419

[13-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
you sure those are correct?

[13-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah i just entered those and i got the right ports

[13-Oct-18 08:08 PM] jspook16#3059

[13-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
what ports?

[13-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
O.o

[13-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
consistently getting LIZ: p2p.40053 rpc.52928 on my node

[13-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jspook16#3059
then i get this   sage: /MagicBean:1.0.15/: version 170003, blocks=30645, us=70.119.217.80:52927, peer=1

[13-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jspook16#3059
which shows the correct blocks

[13-Oct-18 08:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im out of my house and have had no ibternet today from home

[13-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jspook16#3059
but later ill get another version message with blocks=24 and then it syncs to the 24 blocks

[13-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
-ac_supp=100000000

[13-Oct-18 08:10 PM] Alright#0419
that's what you just pasted, you sure you're not doing that?

[13-Oct-18 08:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I recommend you delete everything and start over with the old chain pulling from hollows node

[13-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jspook16#3059
damn

[13-Oct-18 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
I can't connect to hollow's node. I don't think he has the port open or node running

[13-Oct-18 08:12 PM] jspook16#3059
is it -ac_supply?

[13-Oct-18 08:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ahh, he night not have public facing ip

[13-Oct-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ask him to share his chain on a zip file then

[13-Oct-18 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, its ac_supply

[13-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll get with hollow and try -ac_supply.... i have to get going but thank youguys

[13-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll be back later and let you know what happened

[13-Oct-18 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok

[13-Oct-18 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The ac_supp might be the issue

[13-Oct-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ac_cc=100 is the same as ac_cc=2, except much fewer other chains in that non-fungible group

[13-Oct-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want a fungible cluster at least 101 or more

I asked about reward claiming in here before, but would I be able to get a channel created for discussing Ledger reward claiming progress and Qs? Ideally with me, James and a few other devs that know their way around the komodo codebase?

[19-Oct-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
here is fine

[19-Oct-18 11:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
would be good to get a channel anyway to keep everything in one place, I'll probs come back with regular questions regarding the reward claiming

[19-Oct-18 11:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
we hit a little road block with the app, it turns out the current official KMD app implements BTC consensus rule checks on the TX before signing

[19-Oct-18 11:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
and having an output amount larger than the input amount violates this and causes the Ledger to throw an error

[19-Oct-18 11:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can see the function here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

For more context it's called from here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/main.c#L1987

Allow Ledger to sign Komodo reward claim transactions ¬∑ lukechild...
https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2123375?s=200&v=4

[19-Oct-18 11:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
it works, and bypasses the check for KMD

[19-Oct-18 11:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
However the txfee amounts shown to the user now overflow for reward claim transactions

[19-Oct-18 11:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
I wanted to implement the reward amount calculations on the device but:
1) It is completely incompatible with the current BTC protocol coin codebase
2) I'm almost certain Ledger won't accept a PR with all that code

The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them. So we'd need to completely fork the BTC app, add support for passing block height info to the Ledger, implement all the KMD interest consensus rules on the device, and then fork their API client and add the block height support to that too. :/

[19-Oct-18 11:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
so the current solution is preferable to that

[19-Oct-18 11:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
just force allowing any output amount

[19-Oct-18 11:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
Just wanted your opinion on if this change is ok, I don't think it should have any negative effects

[19-Oct-18 11:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
The only down side I can see is, if the outputs are larger than the inputs the txfee value overflows so it displays the txfee as like a bazillion KMD

[19-Oct-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
but that would only ever happen if the output amount is larger than the input amount

[19-Oct-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g with an reward claim TX

[19-Oct-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
normal TXs will show up fine

[19-Oct-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
so no normal software is likely to encounter this

[19-Oct-18 11:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
worst case scenario possible, someone accidentally crafts a TX that has way more outputs than inputs and sends it to the ledger to sign, the Ledger signs it without error, then they broadcast it to the network and it gets rejected instantly

[19-Oct-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
no loss of funds

[19-Oct-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will just sign TXs that break the consensus rules in the single scenario that the outputs are too large

[19-Oct-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
_I think_

[19-Oct-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, I'm a little out of my depth, I'm not very familiar with C at all

[19-Oct-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
so would be great to get your opinion on that

[19-Oct-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
and also if you or anyone else can see an obvious way to not make the txfee overflow so we can show negative fees like on explorers rather that ridiculously high numbers that would be great too

[19-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
I made a rewards channel

At one time is was stated that "KMD will be the fuel for our upcoming Komodo Smart Contract API enhancements" Does this still hold true?

[20-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
in order to do MoMoM cross chain CC, you will need KMD

[20-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course komodod is needed for all

[20-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is maybe more an indirect thing, like being on exchanges giving value to a coin

[20-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD being the core coin of the ecosystem gains value with each new ecosystem project, CC, etc.

[20-Oct-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a zerosum game

[20-Oct-18 03:22 PM] yorklab#7270
I see . I asked because of this statement:

"Finally, UTXO-based smart contracts do not require ‚Äúgas‚Äù or any sort of fee for every process executed. Recall that the smart contracts and dApps built on Ethereum must pay for gas for every single process. This makes complex apps impossible."

Thanks for the reply.

[20-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I wont be adding in monetization in the code just for the sake of monetization. The key to mass market scalability is maximum value at minimum cost and if the cost is close to zero, even better. With millions of users in the ecosystem and all coins referenced against it, KMD is the main currency of the ecosystem. this alone is a big benefit as we see how BTC gains value as all is traded against it

@SHossain @jl777c @grewalsatinder solution suggestion - not sure if anyone already suggested this OR if it is already in dev, but otherwise would be a neat addition to Komodo services portfolio. It's just a shower thought, perhaps suitble for a community discussion, cheers ----- 

Asking the real questions here...
‚óè How can an OTC trade of arbitrary size take place, in a
decentralized manner, w/o any escrows?
‚óè How can bids/asks be placed/taken with a *chosen*
party, w/o an intermediate, and risk-free?
‚óè How can this be realised with Komodo‚Äôs existing tech
i.e. within Komodo ecosystem?

Komodo‚Äôs OTC Dex

 OTX: an OTC Dex solution by Komodo

for: miners, shallow and deep pockets, and anybody seeking to do quick
business w/o going via exchanges with imposed (low) limits

 It would work in a similar way the BarteDEX does with
atomic swaps, but
‚óè Instead of waiting for orders to get filled in the usual way through order matching, an immediate trade on agreed upon price can take place, with tx-fees e.g. shared equally between the parties, or optional buyer/seller bears all fees
‚óè Each party has permanent account (name) linked to, perhaps, reputation or scoring mechanism with stated coins willing to do business in (KMD,ARRR,BTC,etc)
‚óè TX fees are perhaps only in KMD or BTC
‚óè Some simple chat function per transaction/trade, with downloadable/archiving function, available only to involved parties per tx, and/or sort of trade summary as with atomic swaps
‚óè Log in, check out currents offers on the board, sort by coin, contact the buyer/seller and do business
‚óè Coin not found? Place an offer or a request...
‚óè If trade agreed upon > initiate automated trustless exchange of funds

[22-Oct-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
barterdex already has this pretty much possible. select a non-default netid get a bob node running as and FR node. then have alice connect to it and do the atomic swap

[22-Oct-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
likely a GUI can automate most of this process

[22-Oct-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but nobody I know of is working on this

[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] NedBGQ#8462
thanks for the swift reply and the hint, did not know this- lately there are a lot of OTC activities related to ARRR, so, that why the suggestion

[22-Oct-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
jawarrr is implementing a trusted node to do the escrow, but yest for non-PIRATE an atomic swap escrow that is easy to use would be the ultimate

[22-Oct-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
likely would be a good bounty for anybody that delivers this

[22-Oct-18 06:04 PM] NedBGQ#8462
but, instead doing a real atomic swap, a trustless exchange of funds as it is usually via OTC, woudl be a cool feature and perhaps a neat source of fees and exposure for komodo (marketing wise)...

[22-Oct-18 06:05 PM] NedBGQ#8462
anyways, thanks for looking into this, I appreicate it

[22-Oct-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
its one of those things where all the difficult part are already done. just need somebody to put it all together

[31-Oct-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810

Hi @jl777c if a cryptocurrency like Equaliser wanted to implement crypto conditions what would they have to do? From reading it looks like crypto conditions were built and added to the Komodo blockchain recently. Does that mean that all cryptocurrencies on the Komodo blockchain would have access to the crypto-conditions functionality?

[01-Nov-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
for existing chain an -ac_ccactive=height needs to be added to all nodes, CC will activate at the specified height so make sure to do it enough in the future to allow all critical nodes to update
