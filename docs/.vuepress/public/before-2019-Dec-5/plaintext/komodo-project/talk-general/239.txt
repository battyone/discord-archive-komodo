wut?

[27-Mar-19 02:14 AM] PTYX#6840
the backdoor would likely come from the project itself. not the other way around.

[27-Mar-19 02:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
like Trump?

[27-Mar-19 02:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
I've got a server, what's this election you speak of?

[27-Mar-19 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I brought a 10year old quad CPU last year and run in a team with someone who klnew how to win an election.... I gave him half of my KMD this year, but now I will run for myself as I think the community will vote me in  because of everything I've contributed this year.

Feel free to run your node and participate. There's a testnet running in #notarynode

[27-Mar-19 02:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
so let me get this right

[27-Mar-19 02:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
``The Komodo Notary Node Elections are stake weighted, meaning that those who hold more KMD have more voting power in the election. ``

[27-Mar-19 02:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
so you're telling me the biggest KMD bag holders determine who's a notary

[27-Mar-19 02:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol

[27-Mar-19 02:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
ugh

[27-Mar-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes but that doesnt matter really... I got a spot last year. If you can actually run a notary  in th testnet that will prove a lot.

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] PTYX#6840
In theory if you're a whale and hold a good percentage of the supply you could vote a node in.

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] crunchycat#0726
wtf does that mean "that doesn't really matter?"

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt 3even know how to use linux... had to learn how to build everything for the node from scratch, I think it took me 3 goes to get the testnet notary node up ... Spent a few weeks on it

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] PTYX#6840
if that node performed poorly, everyone would see it and you can prevent that node from running or take other measures.

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] crunchycat#0726
that matters completely, whoever has the biggest KMD sack votes who's the notary

[27-Mar-19 02:19 AM] PTYX#6840
however, the community has more voting power than most whales, so it's not likely but still a possibility

[27-Mar-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Pretty sure it was a whale who voted my team in, but that doesnt matter... I had liek 1000 KMD and got a spot lol is what im saying

[27-Mar-19 02:20 AM] crunchycat#0726
is there a whale list?

[27-Mar-19 02:20 AM] PTYX#6840
as with any voting mechanism that bases votes on the amount of tokens you hold

[27-Mar-19 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Mar-19 02:20 AM] crunchycat#0726
exactly @blackjok3r , that's prob how every single notary gets in

so what you're saying is I have no chance unless I buy enough KMD to become a whale and overwhelm all the other whales

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure how you contact the peopel who own thos address though.

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] PTYX#6840
you dont need any kmd to be a notary node

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] PTYX#6840
the community votes for you

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] PTYX#6840
just convince them to vote for you

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] PTYX#6840
why should you be a notary?

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
dood, the community doesn't vote you in.  Whoever has enough KMD votes you in

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No lol... be aprt of the comminuty make a propoisal of what your going to get done and hope you made enough noise to win.

[27-Mar-19 02:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay I'll agree to disagree on that point

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] crunchycat#0726
so tell me this

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] crunchycat#0726
what happens when one notary decides to ddos the other notaries?

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] PTYX#6840
it's all on the blockchain. you can see how many addresses actually voted for each notary

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] bishop#9773
If you are a competent dev and add to the community, there are whales that will vote for you

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] PTYX#6840
so you can deduce yourself who are and aren't the whale chosen ones

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] bishop#9773
it's a matter of showing that

[27-Mar-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`what happens when one notary decides to ddos the other notaries?` you could actualyl do this, but nobody has... because you would get blocked by everyone pretty fast.

[27-Mar-19 02:23 AM] PTYX#6840
exactly, 99% of the notaries are doing things for the community and working on other things for Komodo

[27-Mar-19 02:23 AM] PTYX#6840
so it's not like just some random guys are getting picked that aren't doing anything

[27-Mar-19 02:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
If some random guy is/knows a whale then yes, he is getting picked

[27-Mar-19 02:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary was my foot in the door to the whole space, ive learnt sooo much in the last year. Notary is agreat way to lean basics of blockchain just jump in the deep end. Write all your own scripts try to imporve how they work.

[27-Mar-19 02:24 AM] PTYX#6840
ok, but that wont make him a good notary. and you can see their performance live

[27-Mar-19 02:24 AM] PTYX#6840
if the whale voted someone in but they performed well, what's the issue?

[27-Mar-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... its about notarizing first and formost... but I made that so easy this year with all the big fixes ... that isnt really all of the job anymore IMO

[27-Mar-19 02:25 AM] PTYX#6840
the purpose of the notary is to perform well and notarize. nothing else.

[27-Mar-19 02:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay so what happens if I, just a random person, ddos all the notary nodes?

[27-Mar-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant

[27-Mar-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they ignore the packets

[27-Mar-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to sign each packet with the privkey and you dont have one

[27-Mar-19 02:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
really?  So no amount of traffic would disable them from functioning?

[27-Mar-19 02:27 AM] PTYX#6840
are you talking about an elected node spamming all other nodes?

[27-Mar-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so, not all of them anyway... unles maybe your the NSA

[27-Mar-19 02:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
nah, I'm talking about a random person ddosing the notaries

[27-Mar-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure what you mean by dDOS ... what exactly do you mean.. .we tried various attacks already all that realy works is an elected notary acting badly... and they can be identified and blocked very easily

[27-Mar-19 02:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
^^^^

[27-Mar-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary ips are mostly public

[27-Mar-19 02:29 AM] crunchycat#0726
^^^^

[27-Mar-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess someone has already dont this and it didnt do much... 64 nodes in world class DC's isnt something easy to ddoss down all at once I would imagine

[27-Mar-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how big is your botnet?

[27-Mar-19 02:30 AM] PTYX#6840
@BlackJesus all you need is 11 nodes to form consensus right?

[27-Mar-19 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
13

goo bye

[27-Mar-19 02:31 AM] crunchycat#0726
?

[27-Mar-19 02:31 AM] PTYX#6840
what's the query exactly?

[27-Mar-19 02:31 AM] crunchycat#0726
did you attack another coin?

[27-Mar-19 02:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Did Komodo attack another cryptocurrency project?

[27-Mar-19 02:31 AM] PTYX#6840
No

[27-Mar-19 02:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
hmmm, really?  because it kinda sounds like it did

[27-Mar-19 02:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
I mean I'm not familiar with Safe Coin or whatever that is, but kinda sounds like it

[27-Mar-19 02:32 AM] PTYX#6840
Is that correct?

[27-Mar-19 02:32 AM] PTYX#6840
do you have any evidence to proof that komodo team members attacked another project?

[27-Mar-19 02:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
I just posted a story about it

[27-Mar-19 02:33 AM] PTYX#6840
a story

[27-Mar-19 02:33 AM] PTYX#6840
yes, but not evidence

[27-Mar-19 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
You mean because the safecoin devs were incompetent to remove the keys of the notaries and the existing KMD notaries easy-mined it (within their right)?

[27-Mar-19 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
hardly attacking it

[27-Mar-19 02:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
lmao well I'm not Dick Tracy over here so no, I don't have verifiable evidence that would hold up in a court of law

[27-Mar-19 02:34 AM] bishop#9773
it's code they put out in their repo

[27-Mar-19 02:35 AM] bishop#9773
Sometime around their launch... but they rolled back their blockchain numerous times iirc

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
So you saw a flaw, then instead of alerting the devs you took advantage

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
nice

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] PTYX#6840
Komodo in fact pointed out the issue, and some community members offered safecoin their help

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] bishop#9773
are you rehashing nearly a year old story to lame troll?

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] PTYX#6840
if it wasn't for komodo team members, safecoin would still be vulnerable

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol how many coins did you mine before you alerted them?

[27-Mar-19 02:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
and yes, looks like it was a year ago

[27-Mar-19 02:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
doesn't negate what looks like happened

[27-Mar-19 02:37 AM] PTYX#6840
and let's not confuse komodo team members with community members

[27-Mar-19 02:37 AM] PTYX#6840
they aren't the same thing

[27-Mar-19 02:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay

[27-Mar-19 02:38 AM] bishop#9773
I think if you are going to fork a coin, you should be knowledgeable about the code and what it entails... if you leave a feature that KMD uses, well, what were you hoping to accomplish?

[27-Mar-19 02:38 AM] PTYX#6840
@crunchycat who are you directing the question about mining to?
