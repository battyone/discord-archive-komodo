Is this v0.5.7 Verus agama safe to use?

Can we keep exchange wallets offline for a few months pls, this is going great üòÑ

[08-Jun-19 03:13 PM] barv#0867
@kpprabhu Yes. All version Verus Agama were unaffected

[08-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Fischershans#2984
hey guys! how long is the lock time for funds held in verus agama? (KMD)

[08-Jun-19 03:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@Fischershans there is no locktime for them, just use them by activating the KMD coin in lite mode in Verus Agama

[08-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Fischershans#2984
but no more claim rewards?

[08-Jun-19 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
you can claim rewards too

[08-Jun-19 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
just like previous agama that is same

[08-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Fischershans#2984
ok, thx. my KMD funds are on the verus agama wallet since two days now, but it says locktime is still unset. So no rewards to claim for me.....

[08-Jun-19 03:26 PM] NNoperator#3835
send them to yourself to set the locktime then

[08-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Fischershans#2984
ok, will try this

[08-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Fischershans#2984
thx

@Fischershans  With this explorer: komodod.com    You can look at your UTXOs and see the rewards accumulate.   They should show a rewards icon that you can click to get the actual amount waiting for you.  It will take an hour to start accumulating. https://komodod.com/b/03c12e1054b7aeb52e76150e1f8849be4de9c893efe1e914ce6ae3b54272a6ff

[08-Jun-19 08:29 PM] suhthern-girl#8418
So, was the wallet seed compromised or the WIFs of the keys?  I have seen some instructions that say to create a whole new wallet and others leave that out, saying to just send funds to a new address in the VERUS wallet.

[08-Jun-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
both are basically the same

[08-Jun-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
a "new wallet" is basically a new seed/privkey

[08-Jun-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
use the verus wallet

[08-Jun-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
make a new address

[08-Jun-19 08:32 PM] suhthern-girl#8418
Wow.   Blow me away!   lol

[08-Jun-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Jun-19 02:22 AM] AkiraX#8269
how about etomic

[09-Jun-19 02:22 AM] AkiraX#8269
i found i have some etomic, pizza and beer

[09-Jun-19 02:22 AM] AkiraX#8269
and coqui

[09-Jun-19 02:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Coqui has some value, the rest do not

[09-Jun-19 02:25 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pizza and beer are just test tokens, etomic was the mechanism to mimic utxos for eth/erc20 swaps

[09-Jun-19 02:48 AM] richardt#2807
Just read that AtomicDEX will replace Agama.  Will that be released July 15th with everything else or will it be sooner?

[09-Jun-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the exact timing. we also have a path for agama, dont worry

@jl777c verus wallet is like agama ? does he have more coins wallet ? like agama

[09-Jun-19 05:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes it's like agama it's an agama fork

[09-Jun-19 05:42 AM] CHMEX#0686

@polycryptoblog You got stolen too?

[09-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Dan122#4857
cool thanks. Hey Funny Komodo gets hacked, price goes up. Must have some loyal supporters out there

[09-Jun-19 07:41 AM] farl#9964
Komodo isn't hacked, only a library used in the Agama wallet. And only users who fill in their privkey for interest claiming,.

[09-Jun-19 07:41 AM] farl#9964
But yes, strange thing KMD (and JUMBLR) also rise in price still.

[09-Jun-19 07:42 AM] farl#9964
üí™

[09-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Lennart#9331
it just shows that price still has nothing to do with any fundamentals... KMD had such great developments, achievements... price did go down... I don't get it

[09-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Lennart#9331
or is it because people can't deposit on exchanges?

[09-Jun-19 07:43 AM] farl#9964

@Dan122  yes it is a hack, however what was hacked is important,  the wallet software is not the chain.

@Kurbeks dm screenshot as proof

[09-Jun-19 07:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont understand the logic behind crypto prices movements much, but I like to think the recent rise is due to the media exposure of how the team responded to the attack. Crypto hacks are not uncommon, and happy endings are even less common.

[09-Jun-19 07:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Major exchanges being closed too has its effect on the rise, many moved to an exchange before they shut off service

[09-Jun-19 08:03 AM] peddycb#5889
@jl777c when will the kmd be sent to the new accounts? And what happens to claims under 1 kmd

[09-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be sent starting today for the small amounts

[09-Jun-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
under 1 kmd is rounded to 0

[09-Jun-19 08:06 AM] peddycb#5889
ah ok then I can understand everything ... thanks

afaik, exchanges wait also for planned notary updates take place on june 15th  @farl

[09-Jun-19 08:30 AM] crumb#2550
by then hopefully people whose KMD got swiped and held small amounts, should have received their KMD. not all, but hopefully some of them at least

[09-Jun-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i got the refund processor coded and it will be sending out the first 90 refunds over the next hour or so. about half the claims for less than 777 KMD have properly sent the special tx 2) to the secure refund address. this is approx 10% of the affected users, so not a bad start. assuming there are no issues, the rest can be processed as soon as the proper claims are made with a matching send from the old address to the new secure address.

by the way, the refund processor is 500 lines of C code

[09-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
plz post if you received your refund properly

[09-Jun-19 09:37 AM] farl#9964
Thanks James. I will monitor my account

[09-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it is only for < 777KMD accounts for now

it is looking like the refunds are working fine. more importantly it updates state via the blockchain so i can stop it at anytime and run it again and it will resume where it left off, and also process any new refunds that have the claim validation tx (dust from old address to new address)
