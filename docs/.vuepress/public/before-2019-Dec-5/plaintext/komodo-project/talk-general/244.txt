i guess you need to have `libsodium-dev` pkg as well

[31-Mar-19 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007
`sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev`

[31-Mar-19 12:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I already had that package installed though 😂

[31-Mar-19 12:27 PM] SHossain#0007
which distro and version you are using?

[31-Mar-19 12:35 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm on Ubuntu 16.04

[31-Mar-19 12:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
native compiling works fine though

[31-Mar-19 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i used Ubuntu 18.04

[31-Mar-19 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
should work on Ubuntu 16.04 too

either the paste is bad or you r not on the good guide

[31-Mar-19 12:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, getting it, pretty experimental :p, never left the base build.sh ^^

[31-Mar-19 12:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'll just stick with komodo on Linux then .

[31-Mar-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
Linux the most recommended OS to be in if you are into all sort of blockchain staff

[31-Mar-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
Windows has so many issues

[31-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
you ll just make sure you get the latest working directly

[31-Mar-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
not that i don't use Windows 😂

[31-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
my box is a windows setup with putty tab manager, get a good one and you ll be ok ^^

[31-Mar-19 12:53 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have 2 nodes on Linux already that's why I want to try cross compiling for Windows for the 3rd nodes 😂

"Insider" likely responsible for Bithumb hack
<https://www.ccn.com/20-million-bithumb-hack-exposes-alarming-threat-to-bitcoin-exchanges>

[31-Mar-19 04:38 PM] PTYX#6840
@Regnar makes sense. It wouldn't surprise me that a smart hacker could infiltrate an exchange as a collaborator and walk away with the funds as soon as he has access to infrastructure.

[31-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't think there is a good way to prevent that sort of thing with the current model, keeps coming back to who owns the keys, owns the coins

>I can't believe this random person that I don't know and didn't vet well isn't 100% trustworthy

[31-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Regnar#6164
I assume exchanges break up the keys, like two keys to launch a nuke kinda thing

[31-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Regnar#6164
or two keys to open the bank vault is probably a better example

[31-Mar-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd bet that we'd be surprised at how many *don't* do that "because it's inconvenient"

[31-Mar-19 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

being reported as an "accident involving insiders"

[31-Mar-19 04:49 PM] Regnar#6164
whatever that means

[31-Mar-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that made me giggle when I read it

[31-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
"accident" likely is a google translate error

{Reactions}
🤔 

[31-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe "incident"

[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Regnar#6164
yea probably right

[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the privkey was accidentally input and then accidentally sent to the other exchanges to be sold

[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
by insiders

[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Regnar#6164
3 million EOS

[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] Regnar#6164
and 20 million XRP

[31-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or there was a car accident with the insiders in it, along with usb that had the privkey. small child on bicyle picks it up when the usb flies out of the car and sells it for $1 to local usb recycler, who noticed the wallets on it

That sounds like a 90s straight to VHS

[31-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
seems likelier that someone that got fired and got angry, took the usb from some insider with the privkeys and used it directly, to frame whoever he took the usb from. so it is possible (likely) they dont even know who did it

[31-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
by "usb" I mean whatever contained the privkey

[31-Mar-19 04:53 PM] Regnar#6164
reality is often stranger, so I guess we'll see

[31-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ramen was involved

[31-Mar-19 04:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Shapeshift funds were stolen by an insider too,  ~3 years ago, he stole the keys from other team members that left their devices unnantended

[31-Mar-19 05:02 PM] Regnar#6164
That sounds pretty common

Can i know what does the voting do? And what are we voting for? Is there any incentives for voting?

[01-Apr-19 05:47 AM] PTYX#6840
@chin Komodo holders vote for their favorite candidate to secure the network by running a notary node. The incentive is electing capable operators to secure the kmd blockchain.

No one has said that, all that is being said if these events did occur it is not irrational to think that he would consider himself the target of a scammer.  Anyways PayPal has a reimbursement and a cancellation policy .
