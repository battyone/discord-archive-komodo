@ptyx yes that s my thoughs. Thing is in this world it seems that if I just claim publicly that you invented a new mechanism that will revolutionarize the sector and pay the huge fee to spread on main news sites you win. Noneed fact as marketers will spread the news and people will assume the news is on times : it can be trusted.

[19-Jun-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763

The good point for kmd community is to just witness that "brand new" ideas are just outdated and just not ideas. But are here for real

[slack] <jorian> DSEC probably has some private investors. i remember them saying something about it

[19-Jun-18 08:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They do talk about komodo around 18min as an example of dPoW. They just plug their penalty mechanism as the solution, but would consider using a mixture of dPoW and PoS. Quoted 'An additional safeguard'.

@cyrotiv, because of the way nodes work, the best "total" you could ever get is an "educated guess"

I would estimate 500 or so

That's still only based on nodes that setup has seen.
It's possible to design a crawler (iirc, someone did one for Bitcoin once upon a time); however, there's several reasons that many nodes may never be seen by such things

We have done cross chain test successfully with MoMoM. Moving coins from one chain to another without any atomic swap. The chains should be running same cc cluster. i.e.: `-ac_cc=3`. This requires MoMoM data and notarization and not instant. The duration would be around 15 minutes max depending on notarization speed for those chains. There are about 3 waits, first for export tx to be confirmed, then for notarisation of export and backnotarisation, then for 2 notarisations on target chain.
We also have 3 new komodo API call to make this work.
```
migrate_converttoexport rawTx dest_symbol export_amount
migrate_createimporttransaction burnTx payouts
migrate_completeimporttransaction importTx
