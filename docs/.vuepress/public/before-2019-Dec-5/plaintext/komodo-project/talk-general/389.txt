still most think KMD is just a zcash clone, a privacy coin

[08-Jul-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
its recent price performance shows a lot of relative strength (not counting last day)

[08-Jul-19 03:10 PM] rainbro7#4735
KMD is the only crypto that makes sense. Why would anyone use something else?

[08-Jul-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
hype coins live not on usage, but hype

yea KMD has had great support and performing pretty well....but i feel like im taking crazy pills when I read the capabilities of the  Antara.....

`Why would anyone use something else?`
FOMO, why else do you think BTC is "King"?

[08-Jul-19 03:12 PM] rainbro7#4735
If BTC is king, KMD should be the Prince since we piggyback off of it 😂

[08-Jul-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC going up is fine. KMD at this price with dominance at 63% bodes very well

[08-Jul-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`network effect`
... driven by FOMO 🤷🏽

[08-Jul-19 03:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
so many talking heads and crypto luminaries are so heavily staked in btc that they have to declare it's supremacy at every opportunity.

[08-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is being recognized as not controllable by any country

[08-Jul-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and wealthy peoples start wanting to collect it

[08-Jul-19 03:13 PM] palfrun#5361
Hey Guys. I send 2 Transaction to my Agama Wallet today but on only 1 is the locktime set.. any ideas? :/

[08-Jul-19 03:14 PM] rainbro7#4735
I look at KMD as an AIO blockchain solution. Not some gimmick hype coin. I can't wait to see the full power of KMD.

[08-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Fukblm#3067
it will always be the gold even though its technically way outdated

[08-Jul-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
gold is also outdated, yet it is still gold

[08-Jul-19 03:14 PM] Fukblm#3067
lol yea I still gold mine for the crap haha

[08-Jul-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so many talking heads and crypto luminaries are so heavily staked in btc that they have to declare it's supremacy at every opportunity.`
It almost makes my ears bleed every time someone posts some new lecture AA has given about how "Only Bitcoin can...." and stakes a claim that 10 other coins already do and likely do better than BTC ever will 😦

[08-Jul-19 03:17 PM] dan.#2473
if btc is as bad as the alt communities say it is, then it will be then be dethroned someday

[08-Jul-19 03:18 PM] Fukblm#3067
Will the KMD ticker be changed to Antara ?

[08-Jul-19 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Many people thought that feudal times were good too

[08-Jul-19 03:18 PM] Malti#3948
afaik not

[08-Jul-19 03:18 PM] Malti#3948
logo of KMD will change, but not the name

[08-Jul-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
also, @dan., it's not that BTC is "bad" (although in some other contexts it is) but that it's not "the best" despite the claims of maximalists

[08-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Malti#3948
what are the general thoughts on decred btw (except for the fact that they claim to have done the first atomic swap)

[08-Jul-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
decred is still a thing? 😮

[08-Jul-19 03:23 PM] palfrun#5361
Hey Guys! I'm new here but a long time KMD holder, I'm planing to stack up kmd since I adore project but besides that.. what are other great Projects worth looking into long term?

[08-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Malti#3948
Komodo ecosystem projects such as K64/PIRATE (ARRR)/VerusCoin (VRSC) are the ones that jump into my mind

[08-Jul-19 03:23 PM] Malti#3948
Hush

[08-Jul-19 03:24 PM] Malti#3948
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 aren't they?

[08-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Malti#3948
dev wise I mean

[08-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Malti#3948
they are still doing pretty okay price wise iirc (talking about Decred here)

[08-Jul-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depending on what some folks do and how long of an investment plan one looks at, there's quite a few good options within the ecosystem

[08-Jul-19 03:27 PM] palfrun#5361
Honestly I'm looking at it as an investment option for let's say the next 5years

[08-Jul-19 03:27 PM] palfrun#5361
Can be outside of the ecosystem

[08-Jul-19 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`they are still doing pretty okay price wise iirc (talking about Decred here)`
It was a 1/2 joke, I honestly haven't looked at decred at all since I got into equihash mining

[08-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Malti#3948
1/2 joke 😆

[08-Jul-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Honestly I'm looking at it as an investment option for let's say the next 5years`
My "not financial advice" would be to look at PIRATE

realpirate 

[08-Jul-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, 5 years from now it has great gain potential as well as utility

[08-Jul-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it'll likely be rough for a while until folks learn that it's not "the same old thing" and that some self-responsibility is required

[08-Jul-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
after that point, I believe that utility demand will grow exponentially

[08-Jul-19 03:32 PM] palfrun#5361

Im worried about liquidity on atomicdex :( It seems like DEXs suffer from a lack of liquidity.

[08-Jul-19 08:29 PM] owerache#0341
The otc have a greater potential for liquidity, the figures are 2 to 3 times the volumes of the main market.

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And due to various regulatory and other concerns coins that cannot be on CEX or are not for whatever reason can have a way of p2p exchange

[08-Jul-19 08:33 PM] owerache#0341
Decentralization is good for networks but for exchanges nothing beats p2p

[08-Jul-19 08:56 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
it's great that Digital Price have ARRR and I like them, but to withdraw even a small amount of BTC it's around a $6 fee.
Is that just them or the same everywhere?

[08-Jul-19 09:00 PM] bogybogy#3962
Hy to everyone,today I sold my cardano to stack more kmd,I learn something watching at antara and the things going today around kmd and when I see the price drop i understand the price isnt the value ,the value is determined by the numbers of the users on the network,the amount of capital  coming in and the team behind the platform and a project can progress only if he got vision ,well done to everyone in Komodo and for the users supporting the project

TonyL: Made simple python wallet on top of nSPV for testing: https://github.com/tonymorony/nspv_pywallet

At the moment possible to use on Ubuntu. Very few deps are needed and can be found in README.

Start procedure is simple - put wallet file to the same folder with nSPV komodod (or nSPV komodod to the same folder with wallet files) and execute: python3 main.py KMD or python3 main.py ILN
