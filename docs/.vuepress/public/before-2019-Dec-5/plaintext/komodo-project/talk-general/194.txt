yes, i have blank screen too on Ubuntu 18.04. followed the steps exactly 😃

[02-Feb-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
the error is using file:///

[02-Feb-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
CORS blocks it

[02-Feb-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
let me retest again from scratch

[02-Feb-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
or rather, same origin policy. you need CORS headers or to load it not from file:/// , depends on browser and day of week and what the spec says this month

[02-Feb-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
```
node --version
v10.15.1

[02-Feb-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007

we re actually orientating towards SOP @dukeleto

[02-Feb-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```computergenie@NewBeast:~/agama$ node --version

computergenie@NewBeast:~/agama$ npm --version

[02-Feb-19 12:51 PM] ca333#0118
i ll look into the specific code and why index is loaded via file stream

[02-Feb-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
when developing locally, on localhost, file:/// probably works. When you make a binary and it's not using localhost anymore, you can't use file:///, it's not the same origin

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] ca333#0118
@SHossain are you on debian? please make sure you are.

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
Ubuntu 18.04

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
browsers may handle this edge case differently, not sure

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] ca333#0118
yes i know @dukeleto - thats why i am saying we shouldnt have filestream in there anymore. we removed it all a  looong time ago.

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
so check in Chrome + Firefox, too

[02-Feb-19 12:53 PM] ca333#0118
to make sure not violating same origin policy

[02-Feb-19 12:54 PM] ca333#0118
it was in fact the reason we created Agama

[02-Feb-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`browsers may handle this edge case differently, not sure`
it's using its own (chromish)

[02-Feb-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 agreed, this kind of thing happens often, where code works in dev but that fails in the big scary real world

👍 💯 

[02-Feb-19 12:54 PM] ca333#0118
with a modified netstack and recompiled kernel i could get my modded webserver to empty your agama (in old cases)

[02-Feb-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
security, it was not the first thing on their mind I guess

[02-Feb-19 12:55 PM] ca333#0118
maybe we missed something - pinged @pbca26 and looking into it

[02-Feb-19 12:55 PM] ca333#0118
yes - security wasnt really taken care of. nowhere... 😃

[02-Feb-19 12:55 PM] ca333#0118
not here - but in the rest of the cryptoworld

[02-Feb-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be, that in development, the file path of something was stored, and it's using file:///, perhaps a dependency (of a dependency ...)

[02-Feb-19 01:07 PM] ca333#0118
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 plz ensure you ran "npm run build" inside agama/gui/EasyDEX-GUI/react/

[02-Feb-19 01:07 PM] ca333#0118
if it fails let me know what it spits

[02-Feb-19 01:09 PM] ca333#0118
also what does your frontend terminal show? can you plz post/DM that infos

[02-Feb-19 01:09 PM] ca333#0118
it allows me to ensure you have the frontend built and running properly

[02-Feb-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@ca333 seems that the missing 'run' makes the difference

[02-Feb-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Feb-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's well worth it and the help was appreciated 👍🏽 
I use cli or Ocean for preference reasons, but it's nice to finally have local agama as an option and be able to maybe even help with some of the issues I've seen

[02-Feb-19 01:32 PM] ca333#0118
i am very sure that you will be very helpful - feedback from the techy users in here is always highly appreciated.

[02-Feb-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
Ocean is fast performer and easy. The main reason I use Agama is Lite mode and lot of other features packed inside. i.e.: offline signing

[02-Feb-19 01:37 PM] SHossain#0007
Lite mode is the quickest to send funds without downloading the chain for about 250 coins (i dont' use them all thought)

[02-Feb-19 02:00 PM] ca333#0118
@bogybogy China even has an official Crypto Rating Index - https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-chinas-crypto-ranking-2019/ - where **KMD is in the Top 10** - the chinese are being very active. So if you see this sort of stuff going on then be sure - its just the tip of the iceberg. History should have taught us - China often keeps operating in the underground until whatever "project" has matured to be released. I guess this applies to lot of things..

Maybe than we have a chance

[02-Feb-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
is there  a way to differentiate real user vote or by bot?

[02-Feb-19 03:12 PM] coingirl87#6489
Dont know but bots has many numbers in name

[02-Feb-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
How come it's "paid bots" when other coins do it, but when Komodo spams a few thousand people to vote, then the votes are "real"?

We dont pay community...only ask to help komodo...its not the same

[02-Feb-19 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
by paid bot i meant to say, probably fake users. there are lot of sites where you can pay few cents to perform micro works

[02-Feb-19 03:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why assume that instead of assuming that they too spammed all of their users and just had a better turn out?

[02-Feb-19 03:15 PM] SHossain#0007
that could be.
but, our users are real. like ComputerGenie is not fake 😛

Thats normal for you?

[02-Feb-19 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
at *x* level of "voting" 100 people make up 40%
so, there's that

[02-Feb-19 03:18 PM] coingirl87#6489
No...at this moment (neblio was 15%) there was more than 3500 votes...

[02-Feb-19 03:19 PM] coingirl87#6489
So 100 people cant make the difference

[02-Feb-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
875 can

[02-Feb-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, math

[02-Feb-19 03:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
I think with fair methods komodo will not win this poll but its okey for me.

[02-Feb-19 03:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes and you think 875 people vote in few seconds?

[02-Feb-19 03:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
Before that 3500 people vote in hours

[02-Feb-19 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yes and you think 875 people vote in few seconds?`
What I think happened and what's realistically plausible are not always mutually inclusive.
My point remains that if you think that it's implausible that 875 people in the entirety of the internet can do something "within seconds", then you underestimate the functionality of the internet (probability of happening in such a narrow space is another topic).

Richard Heart has 50k followers that he routinely tells are "idiots", "morons", and "too stupid to understand a fuking thing I say" and yet if he told them something was good to vote for, it wouldn't even take 1.76% of his followers to make 875.

`If there is any doubt ZIL is botting this vote, look at the comments. The ratio of Cashtags should speak volumes.`
So, my vote doesn't count because I didn't comment?

[02-Feb-19 05:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No, but social media and the herd mentality have certain "features".

[02-Feb-19 05:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And there should definitely be a larger vocal presence for projects with real followers, as is evidenced by the KMD voices.
