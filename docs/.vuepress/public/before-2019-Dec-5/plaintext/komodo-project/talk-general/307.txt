Komodo on the list need to be registered at qtrade to vote

how to dig a mosquito with msi gtx 1050 4g. give me some video or link where to remove miner.

its Komodo PoS ?

[19-May-19 04:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no its proof of work, plus also DPoW which essentially provides strong 51% attack prevention/detection.

[19-May-19 04:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
however, you do get 5% annual interest by being active and making a transaction at least once a month., but this has nothing to do with the concensus algorithm

[19-May-19 04:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes, KMD is a platform like ETH, so there are other cryptos built on it

[19-May-19 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`KMD is a platform like ETH,`
That's wrong on so many levels üòõ

[19-May-19 07:31 AM] richardt#2807
KMD is 10x better than ETH.  As soon as more devs start to build on top of it, it's game over for ETH

[19-May-19 07:34 AM] designer#4893
How do you make a good developer choose a komodo?

[19-May-19 07:35 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
an erc20 -> assetchain migration tool as easy as the AWS blockchain generator will start the flippening

[19-May-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
bull market -> ETH txfees $2, this will help. also recent SEC guidelines might help too as centralized dapps can be considered money transmitters

[19-May-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
at first only the smart projects that do their research will choose KMD, but as they deliver superior solutions, then more and more will. This will take time, but it is inevitable as komodo is a tax free zone and it only needs to provide equivalent tech to win. Since it provides superior tech and is a tax free zone... well you do the projections

[19-May-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not saying ETH is going away, it wont. but there is so much growth left in crypto, there is room for a large number of projects. ETH does not have to go away for komodo to succeed.

[19-May-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we are now seeing komodo based projects getting funding. the people that know things in the industry know about komodo. It is the consumers that are always last to know

[19-May-19 07:41 AM] designer#4893
that's right, consumers are always the last.

[19-May-19 07:44 AM] designer#4893
what about Komodo's response to many big companies trying to build good dapps on each other's platforms while supporting money?

[19-May-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be like MSFT apps vs linux apps, each having their own domains

[19-May-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for entities that dont care about spending $100,000 per year to spin up and maintain a network, being the free supplier doesnt matter to them

[19-May-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but generally speaking the innovation is not from dinosaurs, it is from smaller companies, that in turn become big companies. then there are existing big companies that have many small divisions, each acting like a small company, so even a large existing company can innovate

[19-May-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
until CC, making a new consensus algorithm was a large project taking years and millions of dollars

[19-May-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
in the last year, I personally created more new blockchain consensus algorithms than anybody else, possible more than everybody else combined

[19-May-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this level of productivity increase can only be ignored at your peril

[19-May-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and marketing this, promotion that,... sure it is a good tiebreaker for projects that are all about the same. but my guess is that the model T car didnt need a lot of paid promotion when it came out against the horse and buggy. so new tech does win, in spite of existing competition having all the marketing. how did the horse buggy end up? did it matter who on youtube was promoting them? of what sort of hype was created?

[19-May-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if we have to rely on hype to survive, then might as well sell all KMD and buy whatever coin you feel has the best hype machine

[19-May-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
please think about the definition of hype: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hype

Promotion or propaganda; especially exaggerated claims.

for those of you that are pushing for us to hype, you are pushing us to make exaggerated claims, but that just goes against our nature. We will make claims that we can support

when your operating timeframe is decades, a few month boost from hype is just a needless expense

[19-May-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
either the tech will survive and thrive over decades and KMD will be worth magnitudes more than it is now, or we will always be pegged to $1 and/or ranked #50 on CMC

At the moment we have a huge demand for the best project or the next Eth and then the only supply project I see is Komodo,once Komodo will be full functional we will have a huge market

[19-May-19 09:16 AM] bogybogy#3962
Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much (quantity) of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain good producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The correlation between price and how much of a good or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.

The relationship between demand and supply underlie the forces behind the allocation of resources. In market economy theories, demand and supply  will allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.

[19-May-19 09:16 AM] bogybogy#3962
Good morning to everyone

[19-May-19 09:22 AM] bogybogy#3962
If we remember in early 2017 we hear about next Eth I will not promote them names but did we see any now after 2 years?no we know projects collecting hunderts or billions of dollars to become next Eth,did they prove something No,behind this scamm projects bwe see venture capitalits with billions in them pokects and they want more(free money)they laugh behind behind doors and they call them selves successful business man or a analyst, Blockchain is in early early stages but learning about Komodo will make you to understand the basics why is important only you to have acces to your own funds and why is important to have a secure smart contract

[19-May-19 09:36 AM] mobipoi#5774
I Don't care about hype, I just want a DEX to trade with

[19-May-19 09:38 AM] bogybogy#3962

[19-May-19 02:53 PM] Llama#1330
Is k64 a token?

[19-May-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
assetchain

[19-May-19 11:24 PM] Alright#0419
Last reminder I'm going to give about this. LABS is running a provably fair lottery to add two additional NNs. You have about 3 more hours to sign up. Come by #kmdlabs channel, if you're interested.

[19-May-19 11:24 PM] Alright#0419
Great way to learn the underlying tech behind dpow and komodo in general, getting a spot as an NN basically forces you to learn

[19-May-19 11:26 PM] Alright#0419
Launch of the chain is slated for ~Wednesday, it's been about 10 months in the making, a long time coming üòÉ

[19-May-19 11:27 PM] crumb#2550
what are the prerequisites (if there are any)?

[19-May-19 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
understand how to use a terminal and be willing to learn

[19-May-19 11:28 PM] crumb#2550
what hardware, VPS etc

[19-May-19 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
can get by with 4gb 4core with swapspace

[19-May-19 11:28 PM] Alright#0419
recommended is 8gb 4 core

[19-May-19 11:28 PM] crumb#2550
so reasonably old laptop will do

[19-May-19 11:29 PM] crumb#2550
or beefier hw is preferred?

[19-May-19 11:29 PM] Alright#0419
20% of emissions overall goes to NNs, they'll eventually be making more on top of that once we have fungible chains up and running. The person(or entity) creating the fungible chain essentially puts a "bid" in for what they agree to pay notaries. Notaries then have the freedom to decide whether or not they will notarize it at the rate offered

[19-May-19 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
something hosted in a DC is highly recommended

[19-May-19 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
your node is not likely to perform well otherwise. Better connection( and hardware to some extent) = more money as it's pay per notarization

[19-May-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
aaah yes of course. makes sense

[19-May-19 11:43 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright if we loose at the lottery, what is the next timeslot for the next lottery to get a kmdlabs NN seat ?

[19-May-19 11:44 PM] phm87#7395
Next year ? Next month ?

[19-May-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
2 months

[19-May-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
every 2 months we will add 2 additional spots if we have people that want them

[19-May-19 11:45 PM] Alright#0419
until we hit 64 total

[19-May-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
the only way to lose a spot is to be <25% average notarization count for the 2 month period

[19-May-19 11:46 PM] Alright#0419
might have to revisit that, but for now it's set up to where if you even try you won't lose the spot

[19-May-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
someone not notarizing doesn't have much of a negative effect other than them making less money overall

[19-May-19 11:48 PM] Alright#0419
so anyone *trying* is welcome to keep trying

[19-May-19 11:49 PM] phm87#7395
So the only NN network accessible to everybody without votes or lottery is the NN testnet 2019

[19-May-19 11:49 PM] Alright#0419
At the moment, yes. We'll be reworking the CFEK network to be more of a testnet after launch

[19-May-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
Right now, the CFEK network uses the same keys as the LABS network. We'll be separating them, so CFEK can add/remove people on a whim

[19-May-19 11:50 PM] phm87#7395

I was asking for reward percentage

[20-May-19 07:41 AM] Instel7#1416
the reward percentage is 5.1% annual

[20-May-19 07:50 AM] Blackbeard#9921
@ankit 5%

[20-May-19 07:50 AM] ankit#7481
Thanks

[20-May-19 07:51 AM] Blackbeard#9921
but you need to claim it yourself, your wallet doesn't need to be open 24/7

[20-May-19 07:52 AM] ankit#7481
Ok

[20-May-19 07:52 AM] ankit#7481
I can claim it after amonth that would not be a problem

thanks @gcharang for posting it

[20-May-19 07:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ankit it would not be a problem, it just stops accrueing after a month, so claim at least once a month and you are golden
