looks like it

[06-Jun-19 11:06 AM] costa2439#3771
How do I get the seed for the assets, from my Ledger? Is it the same one that is written on a piece of paper?

[06-Jun-19 11:07 AM] Helly88#3715
When will a Trezor connection finally come? You can see what happens if you don't have a hardware wallet. On the Trezor page it says that there is no wallet from KMD yet. When can one count on it

[06-Jun-19 11:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@wolfgang there is no reported issue with the Komodo paper wallet, but there could be problems based on its source
https://www.coindesk.com/researcher-discovers-serious-vulnerability-in-paper-crypto-wallet-website
Our recommendation is to use one of these:
```
- Verus Agama (https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview)
- KomodoOcean QT (https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/folders/29000055193)
- Ledger Hardware wallet (Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the unsahe versions of Agama) 
```

If you have cryptocurrency in a paper wallet from WalletGenerator.net you'd best pull it off.

your paperwallet should be safe ‚Ñ¢

[06-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Archimedes#7830
that incident had to do with the source not beeing identical with the actual code on the website

[06-Jun-19 11:18 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@gcharang I reported that story a few weeks ago. It seems the problem (only in recent months) was for users who loaded the webpage and then disconnected from internet, that is not the recommended way to use. Downloading from github was safe. So Komodo paperwallet was forked long before the vulnerability happened and was downloaded from github, should be safe ‚úå

I only have this right now, waiting for confirmation from @Decker

[06-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Archimedes#7830
trust... ok i agree. maybe not trust a source that has shown potentialy malicious intentions in the past

[06-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Archimedes#7830
but as to vulnerabilities, there are none known at this point to my knowledge

[06-Jun-19 11:22 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, there are no known vulns that's for sure

[06-Jun-19 11:43 AM] debaas#3337
switched from paper wallet to verus agama just to be sure

[06-Jun-19 11:45 AM] debaas#3337
ah i did that

[06-Jun-19 11:45 AM] debaas#3337

[06-Jun-19 11:46 AM] debaas#3337
not affecting price at the moment it seems. but that could be because exchange wallets are offline

I didn't see the reclaim form (in fact I did, but I just don't remember), do we have a selectbox with the choice to claim being an user, or a company (with proof of that being available publicly).
Some business can be affected by this and can run into issues :

not stating someone is more important than other, at all

[06-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think there was a checkbox, I think in their case it might be helpful to contact sHossain so he can add the info

[06-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
adding this will offload support

[06-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
and DMing SHossain or JL will slowdown it also

[06-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
of course dispute resolution will require additional time

[06-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, fill out the form. that is a CRITICAL part of the process

[06-Jun-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
more details when we will start the reclaim process next week.

[06-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do not fill out the form, your reclaim process cannot be expedited

[06-Jun-19 01:06 PM] klein#5233
Yes

[06-Jun-19 01:06 PM] debaas#3337
@jl777c any idea when exchanges will open up wallets again?

[06-Jun-19 01:08 PM] klein#5233
@kastmada  follow the transaction to its next hop and it goes to the address controlled by admins

[06-Jun-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we are very close to having the new NN hardupdate, so we will make that and the exchanges can open. target date of June 15th

My funds were still available yesterday and moved from Agama to Ocean. The Ocean wallet is literally downloading 2-1/2 years of block data. Anyone know now long this takes? Been going strong for like 13 hours on my pc and like 5% of the way.

[06-Jun-19 01:26 PM] cipi#4502
use bootstrap from here instead: https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
it takes only minutes to have KMD native running

Jl777c have you tried to use the exploit to steal Arrr????? is it possible ?

[06-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you exported and imported wif keys into agama the chances are they are vulnerable

[06-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And you are better off transferring funds to a fresh non-agama address

[06-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Kaed#8040
Any news about possible risks for the computers who had this rogue version of Agama installed ? Are our other wallets (non related to agama but running on the same computer) at risk ?

[06-Jun-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the npm module with the exploit was specifically looking for an agama internal variable, the one for the seed

[06-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Kaed#8040
@jl777c  Thanks. So we can assume that only agama was targeted ? Not the whole OS ? No screencap/keylogger/trojan were found ?
