oh wait i didn't read it completely

[22-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Tek#5253
seems like hybrids arent affected

[23-Jan-19 12:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on the hybrid, the attack, and the implimentation

[23-Jan-19 11:04 AM] $tefano.#3560
any plans to add other big exchanges for KMD ? ( okex, digifinex, huobi, etc )
Volume market is low

[23-Jan-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I must be old, I've never even heard of any of those 😕

[23-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what is digifinex?

[23-Jan-19 12:53 PM] PTYX#6840
Kmd is on the best exchanges. Bittrex, Binance, Upbit, HitBTC, and Barterdex

[23-Jan-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bitfinex is one of the larger ones we are not on yet, but hasnt got the best reputation

[23-Jan-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
okex is mostly fake volume, same for huobi iirc

[23-Jan-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
poloniex is oldschool name, but doesnt really have the volume it used to anymore

[23-Jan-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
binance/bitpanda/bittrex are the best sources/fiat gateways for kmd tbh

[23-Jan-19 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`poloniex is oldschool name, but doesnt really have the volume it used to anymore`
I'd love to be at a Circle board meeting and watch them explain why they think buying Polo is still a "good idea" :trollface:

[23-Jan-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other than being "grandfathered" into certain things, I never understood why they would want it in the 1st place

[23-Jan-19 01:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
droppping the Trollbox sounded their death knell 🔔 :trollface:  🔔 🔔 ⚰ ✝

[23-Jan-19 01:27 PM] $tefano.#3560
upbit €10.220 
bittrex €37.686

[23-Jan-19 01:28 PM] $tefano.#3560
🤔

[23-Jan-19 01:28 PM] $tefano.#3560
bitpanda OMG .. fee very high

[23-Jan-19 01:30 PM] $tefano.#3560
to move volumes okex and huobi are necessary

[23-Jan-19 01:31 PM] PTYX#6840
So to increase kmda volume we need okex and huobi?

[23-Jan-19 01:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
to increase wash trading yes :trollface:

[23-Jan-19 01:31 PM] PTYX#6840
Basically

[23-Jan-19 01:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Other coins with hi turnover are they really been purchased and taken off the exchange to use? or just for price speculatin g?

[23-Jan-19 01:32 PM] $tefano.#3560
do have hear trading ? 😄

[23-Jan-19 01:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
someone could increase the kmd volume by using a trading bot to market make that is what keeps up most coin volumes not people robots 😃

[23-Jan-19 01:34 PM] $tefano.#3560
200K on trading volume daily and BNB has more than 66%

[23-Jan-19 01:34 PM] $tefano.#3560
🤔

[23-Jan-19 01:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
BNB has a real purpose for use on binance exchange so its expected

[23-Jan-19 01:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
take XRP for example. What you see is mainly wash trading between bots. XRP has no use for people to buy and use.

[23-Jan-19 01:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What we need imo is is more eco systems projects to onboard all these bring attention naturally to komodo

[23-Jan-19 01:40 PM] $tefano.#3560
attention is given by the trading in first step .. 
big projects ( kmd, pirate, verus etc etc) and a big community but not volume

[23-Jan-19 01:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
what im trying to say is. if you removed all the nonsense bot trading on the exchanges you would find that not many of bigger volume coins would actually have any volume

[23-Jan-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what? you mean that 100% of a coins marketcap trading every week isnt organic trading?

[23-Jan-19 01:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yes i was shocked too

[23-Jan-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
what is considered normal in crypto is just pretending that the massive manipulations are normal

[23-Jan-19 01:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Heres me thinking the unbanked are buying millions of $ worth of XRP a day 🤣

[23-Jan-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
a 1% per day volume is perfectly fine

[23-Jan-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if not on the high side

[23-Jan-19 01:50 PM] $tefano.#3560
@CryptoNinjaa so do you think that 50 million of waves volumes is made by bot? 
i hope to have 50 milion of bot on kmd!!

[23-Jan-19 01:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yes you do not need 50 mill to do it

[23-Jan-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
1 BTC at a time, back and forth

[23-Jan-19 01:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
could be many bots also

[23-Jan-19 01:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
The bots are not discovering prices they are there to turnover thats it

[23-Jan-19 01:52 PM] $tefano.#3560
i do my own bot, I know how it works

[23-Jan-19 01:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then you understand how wash trading works

[23-Jan-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be the 5% rewards acts to minimize exchange trading

[23-Jan-19 01:53 PM] cipi#4502
btw, do you guys know some popular trading software that uses bots, so we can analyze the source code and see how the algorithm works? maybe we can trick the bots out 😃

[23-Jan-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Nov '17, 100% of the volume that drove up the price of UNIT by 3500x was a broken bot on topia

[23-Jan-19 01:54 PM] $tefano.#3560
of course .. but having 50 mil against 200K it's better

[23-Jan-19 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
becuase bigger number ?

[23-Jan-19 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
200k of real buys would be better

[23-Jan-19 01:55 PM] $tefano.#3560
investors want see numbers not whitepapers

[23-Jan-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@$tefano. can we borrow $50 mil from you to make such markets?

[23-Jan-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you think we have millions to burn?

[23-Jan-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`investors want see numbers not whitepapers`
Yes, and that's why the BTC bubble popped 😉

[23-Jan-19 01:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
hmm the last 4 years or crypto revolved alot around how a white paper looked

[23-Jan-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🎵 pop goes the bubble because the bubble goes pop 🎵

[23-Jan-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
for investors I think by the time this bear market is over, they will appreciate all projects that are still alive and active

[23-Jan-19 01:57 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
appreciate your feedback and thoughts @$tefano.. It is a good point to raise. but maybe towards the higher vol coins. like where are these coins going?

[23-Jan-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
XVG used to have a lot of volumes and probably still does now;

[23-Jan-19 01:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You could buy waves today. tons of volume . tomorrow bots switched off low liquidity then what?

[23-Jan-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
any news on waves today?

[23-Jan-19 01:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
we expecting some lol ?

[23-Jan-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I, personally, would rather have 0 "big money" investors and have it grow organically than have a gajillion dollars dumped into dogshit because investors looked at the ponzi scheme numbers and the bottom drops out because they have no long-term chance of return

[23-Jan-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
20%+ gain on big volumes for waves today

[23-Jan-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but couldnt find anything other than they were making some presentation in the recent days

[23-Jan-19 02:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not sure have not heard anything. Rouge bot ? 🤣

[23-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
waves is the future

[23-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
can ben close this discord? it became obsolete

[23-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
or was it ca333

[23-Jan-19 02:10 PM] sφldat#8733
wts kmd -> waves

[23-Jan-19 02:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
they had some interesting new features recently, but no special news today except a new wallet release

[23-Jan-19 02:18 PM] sφldat#8733
this waves volume is weird..

[23-Jan-19 02:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
lol

[23-Jan-19 02:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Is being 57th out of 2116  with like hardly any wash trading a bad thing?

[23-Jan-19 03:07 PM] LocoMB#8593

[23-Jan-19 03:10 PM] Privopunk#0447
Waves mostly is fake volume though. Sometimes I wonder if Russians have blessed Waves & Link as projects.

[23-Jan-19 03:17 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
could the reason have been the launch of this game on waves? https://twitter.com/wavesplatform/status/1088092343939547137

Hang on 1 minute lol . what you make of this game

[23-Jan-19 03:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
The last player to buy a ticket before the countdown hits zero will receive the entire amount held by the smart contract.

[23-Jan-19 03:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Ponzi game much? maybe looking into too much lol

there's not much that can be done to have Komodo on exchanges, its their decision. Certainly not worth to spend 100k for listing

@KomodoWorld you are Italian like me, in some Italian crypto groups people talk about Komodo and they have the same questions

[23-Jan-19 04:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
unfortunately Komodo doesn't have VC backing or a Joseph Lubin billionaire. The aren't millions of funds available to list on more exchanges...

[23-Jan-19 04:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
It must find its place by sheer tech superiority in a space that is 95% made of paid promotion or vaporware. In another year exchanges will beg to list Komodo

`In another year exchanges will beg to list Komodo`
I wonder if that's true, mostly because I wonder if they will still be open in another year 😛

[23-Jan-19 04:44 PM] D3b0#9761
do you have any idea how to attract people to invest in komodo?

[23-Jan-19 04:48 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think most people stumble on komodo after hitting losses on other vapour ware. Security is a main selling point. Komodo is one of if not the most secure blockchain going. Freedom to build and not be tied to komodo is another plus.

[23-Jan-19 04:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Komodo is like a net it catches up all the useful tech and makes an eco system with it. majority of other projects create a box and close themselves off imo

[23-Jan-19 04:50 PM] SHossain#0007
James once said, Komodo is a movie studio where anyone can produce a movie of their own. A lot of possibilities.

[23-Jan-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do you have any idea how to attract people to invest in komodo?`
imo, we need to attract more users and vendors, not necessarily more investors
