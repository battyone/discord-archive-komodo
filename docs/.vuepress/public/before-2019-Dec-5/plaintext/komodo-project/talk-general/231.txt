crypto needs to stop setting its own v low standards if it wants to compete in the real world

[11-Mar-19 08:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
here 
Hey everyone, I wanted to make a small announcement.
@radix42 is currently hard at work to create a dedicated full node software port for the www.nodl.it 

This is a plug and play hardware unit for running full nodes!!

BTC is the only one who has this currently.

Now, thanks to Radix, we also have XMR, PIVX and ZEC.  
She is furiously working to add KMD and its 40+ asset chains to be run on this unit, including z address support for Pirate.

The power that this can have to show KMD's firm placement in the Crypto Ecosystem and the desire for the project to be an infinite powerhouse, is intangibale, yet valuable.  

Any Komodoshis you can find to support her in this Venture would be great.  
To date she's not received much support from the other communities, and I think it is time to show the Crypto world not only the strength of Komodo but the power of it's Community support.  

I sent 500 KMD and while I don't expect you to send the same, I want you all to know she deserves way more than than for what she is doing. 

https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/c83a92d71bec1bcb8786412a0394160b185b8bc61f35fa3f3576ebdef38709c9

`Radix 42 KMD and Asset chain donation address`
```RFHfS9z19AnzDYYvKEdmc7ijmydfQnzZdi``` 

Thank you in advance for your support.

[11-Mar-19 08:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You can donate and not say anything, you can donate with the tipbot, or you can make your donation known.  Any way, it helps her.  Decentralization doesn't happen with Corporations or VC or Bank loans or payroll.  

It happens with Community support.  100%

$KMD paid an ex zcash developer for code that would have let you put a node on a raspberry pi......

$ZEC might have a better team but $KMD knows how to do business

[12-Mar-19 04:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The rear looks cool and futuristic. Not sure what to think of the shield, kinda feels like a "elite" club coin. But I can see you have put a lot of work into it, so don't mind my weird preference

[12-Mar-19 06:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
