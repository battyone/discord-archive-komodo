Only few submissions are appearing on reddit, i think because of spam filter deleting posts automatically..

@DesignBlock please drop your questions regards infographics contest addressed to @benohanlon  in #komodo-team

Most Infographic designs are awesome, but i think they don't effectively communicate Komodo's Architecture, so i made my entry.. here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/9klq3e/second_entry_komodo_platform_architecture/?utm_source=reddit-android

hello

[02-Oct-18 03:17 PM] NicoSama#0960
I would like to know more or less the price when it will be listed, for any mining or investment!

[02-Oct-18 03:18 PM] xRobeSx#5136
what listed @NicoSama ?

Is komodo plan to be asic resistant ?

talking about ASIC subject, it is messing up the Siacoin comminity 😂

[02-Oct-18 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` asic resistant` and ` asic proof` are not synonyms

[02-Oct-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and the only ` asic resistance` in the equihash wp is based on nothing more than RAM price

[02-Oct-18 06:01 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@srgess what they mean is that KMD has no threat from 51% attack so ASIC's are no issue for the network. They strengthen it even.

SIA is messed up as the coin devs went off and created a mining ASIC company and now cant make a pure decision for the coin

[02-Oct-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
coindesk article:
Sia's decision is unique, however, in that the goal is not to keep ASICs off the network entirely – Vorick has written that this is a losing battle and diminishes a coin's security – but to block ASICs made by particular companies.

If Innosilicon and Bitmain move as fast as possible to produce new hardware, Vorick told CoinDesk, they may be able to replace the bricked ASICs in three or four months. In the interim, then, miners sold by Sia's sister venture Obelisk will have the run of the network.

so if kmd wants to get rid of asics  why does it support asics ?

[02-Oct-18 06:29 PM] srgess#8462
@xRobeSx Yeah i understand that point but currently they can be mined faster for a limited people that have currently have a big access to buy those asic. It lead to have big whale manipulate the komodo market

@exploitURcoins No one ever said Komodo wants, or cares, to "get rid of ASICs"

[02-Oct-18 06:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
everyone has the option to buy an ASIC

[02-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
also nicehash is a much bigger threat than any asic and everybody has access to it

[02-Oct-18 06:31 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I don't have a farm or an intense mining operation, and I was still able to purchase an ASIC for around the same price it would cost to build a GPU rig, and mine more efficiently

[02-Oct-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but KMD is immune even to nicehash

[02-Oct-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@srgess Given that an ASIC is ~ the same price as the leading GPU and 40x more efficient, where do you get this notion?

[02-Oct-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you can buy a GPU, then you can buy an ASIC

[02-Oct-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because $1 = $1

[02-Oct-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S. - if you don't have $750 to enter mining, then mining is not for you

[02-Oct-18 06:33 PM] srgess#8462
Sure but the thing is only one manufacturer of the asic and cant deliver enought for everyone so here i cant buy one, out of stock and very overpriced

[02-Oct-18 06:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only one manufacturer of the asic`
fallacy

[02-Oct-18 06:33 PM] srgess#8462
I can go to store buy video card and start mining

[02-Oct-18 06:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
then do so, you can still mine with ASICs

[02-Oct-18 06:34 PM] srgess#8462
I already do it

[02-Oct-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the only valid point I have heard is that a gamer who already has a GPU can mine without any extra money paid. but that is unfair to anybody that isnt a gamer and wouldnt it be fair if all gamers helped the nongamers out and let nongamers use their GPU?

[02-Oct-18 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I can go to store buy video card and start mining`
Or you can go to BM, buy an ASIC, and have it shipped tomorrow

[02-Oct-18 06:34 PM] srgess#8462
But comparing gpu and asic performance mining the same algo...

[02-Oct-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
in a race without any constraints, if somebody invents the motorcycle and obsoletes all bicycles, should:
a) everybody get a motorcycle
b) outlaw motorcycle

Take a stroll over to Core and ask them if they'll make Bitcoin so that it's only GPUs 😉

keep in mind there is no way to enforce any rule that says you can use a motorcycle

it is about the math

[02-Oct-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
next thing you will want is a CoC

[02-Oct-18 06:36 PM] srgess#8462
I was asking a question at first if komodo would be asic resistant. Not going to argue with how asic are better

[02-Oct-18 06:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has a big CoC_

[02-Oct-18 06:36 PM] srgess#8462

no

[02-Oct-18 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"ASIC resistance" is about 2 things
Securing from attack (which KMD does, extremely well)
pacifying existing GPU owners

1 thing I likwe about a GPU is more recycleble afaik -> if mining stops being profitable you can either sell it or play games; with AISIC what can you do ? noise and heat your room ? 😃

[02-Oct-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810

@srgess Guess what that means? Mining '200,9' equihash isn't for you...
Other than the lemming coins, no one is going to alter the protocol every few months to some new magic number that mitigates cheap RAM costs

[02-Oct-18 06:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
