It was above 10k but I don't remember the exact amount.  Heard a couple people getting in the thousands.

[20-Sep-18 10:43 AM] rrrj288#7865
@jl777c  wondering if you've noticed the issue happened to EOS? Is there any chance it would happen to us, too ?

[20-Sep-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
which issue? the smart contract hacks or the central exchange being confused?

[20-Sep-18 10:51 AM] rrrj288#7865
These two problems can be seen as one , isn't it ?  Hacker created a fake token based on EOS, and funny it's also named EOS.  Would this happen to us too ?

[20-Sep-18 10:52 AM] rrrj288#7865
And they could use fake EOS to buy other tokens.

[20-Sep-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be due to the exchange not being well coded

[20-Sep-18 10:55 AM] rrrj288#7865
One more question. Is it possible for those who want to create token our ecosystem, using the same name as KMD? JUST like what happened to EOS

[20-Sep-18 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
tokens using the assets CC use a txid, they arent even a coin

[20-Sep-18 10:55 AM] rrrj288#7865
Yeah. Newdex was very stupid . They didn't even use smart contract

[20-Sep-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a totally different thing

[20-Sep-18 10:56 AM] rrrj288#7865
Oh I see. Thanks it's clear now

do i have to uninstall the previous one, was asked during the process

pls anybody, my coins are stuck in my lite wallet and unable to send them to exchange because of the wallet issue

[21-Sep-18 01:12 AM] yorklab#7270
I always uninstall old wallet.

[21-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Hermes#6934
@crypto9999  the solution I proposed to you should help you understand better how the wallet works

[21-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Hermes#6934
as long as you have the seed you can enter Agama , Hyperdex or Barterdex

[21-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Hermes#6934
The seed functions as your private key , after you update the wallet you just need to enter it. If you still feel that you need to confirm you are having access to your funds after updating the wallet try installing the wallet in a second computer and access it ...or also try some other of our applications as Hyperdex or Barterdex and you will see that with the same seed you will have access to the same address in both 3 applications

Hey guys, I started to wrote a wiki page about Komodo (in French for the moment https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_(cryptomonnaie)). There is no English version yet however it will be nice for the visibility of the project.
