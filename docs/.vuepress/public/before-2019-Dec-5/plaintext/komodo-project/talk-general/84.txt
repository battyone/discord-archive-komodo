you cant 51% attack KMD ... because 75% of the blocks are mined by notary nodes.

[30-Sep-18 07:18 AM] shiggidy#4554
when you say 51% attack KMD, you're referring to the main chain correct?

[30-Sep-18 07:18 AM] shiggidy#4554
or the assetchain?

[30-Sep-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
main chain yes.

[30-Sep-18 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... you could 51% attack it, ike with selfish mining but you cant go back past a notarization.

[30-Sep-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the assetchains are easily attacked, but also you cant reorg a chain past a notarization, Alright has tested this extensivly. it works very well.

[30-Sep-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It doesn't take too long to 51% attack an assetchain and then start pissing away hash on your own pointless fork that has no value 😛

[30-Sep-18 07:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
notaries rock

[30-Sep-18 07:36 AM] shiggidy#4554
so technically speaking it would be possible to simultaneously attack an altchain and it's assetchain that employs dpow as long as the attack happened within 10 minutes

[30-Sep-18 07:38 AM] shiggidy#4554
its not an issue so long as the exchanges that are listing the altchain require confirmations greater than 10 minutes

[30-Sep-18 07:40 AM] shiggidy#4554
got it...

[30-Sep-18 07:43 AM] CHMEX#0686
it's not counted in minutes but in blocks assuming 1 block a minute yes than it's 10 minutes, but I believe if you rent a lot of hash attack the network the blocks fly faster for a moment.

[30-Sep-18 07:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can attack an assetchain, but once you fork from the notary block to try to ds, all you're doing is burning hash on a chain that no one but you will ever follow

[30-Sep-18 07:47 AM] shiggidy#4554
yeah just saying that there is the possibility of a double spend there

[30-Sep-18 07:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@shiggidy think of a notary  block as being the same as a hardcoded checkpoint

[30-Sep-18 07:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they serve the same function, essentially

[30-Sep-18 07:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
except that notary blocks keep getting added to the chain, live

[30-Sep-18 07:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
since attacking an assetchain is relatively easy

[30-Sep-18 07:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
theoretically

[30-Sep-18 07:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
hmm theres a 9 block delay

[30-Sep-18 07:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
between notary blocks

[30-Sep-18 07:50 AM] shiggidy#4554
if my understanding is correct

[30-Sep-18 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes there is the "potential" if proper confirmations are not required (which is why I usually suggest a bit more confirms on an asset than on KMD)

[30-Sep-18 07:51 AM] shiggidy#4554
gotcha

[30-Sep-18 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but the flip side to that is burning yourself on a single ds that gets noticed quickly, so the value is minimal and the risk is higher

[30-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The "gap" is 10 KMD blocks for ACs .

[30-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they will atempt a notarization 10 KMD blocks after the last one happened.

[30-Sep-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as 2 AC blocks have happened

[30-Sep-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats not to say that 100% of the time, this occures. The process has a lof of randomness built in and they only happen 80%-90% of the time they are attmepted. This number very recently improved from 50% of the time, due to a bug fix I implemented.

[30-Sep-18 07:55 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@snowdamn Amazing - how are u sure no1 will vote for me ? Also I need about 1 mil votes - the rest I can get myself

[30-Sep-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
getting elected wasnt so hard last year, but I predict it to be much more competetive next year... Also with more coins being added, running and setting up a notary is getting quite diffucult.

[30-Sep-18 07:56 AM] snowdamn#2414
because there are people here dropping endless code that 🐳 vote for 😉

[30-Sep-18 07:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hungry_BullBear don't feed the :trollface:s; @snowdamn is more of a contrarian than I am 😛

Tbh, the people that follow the discord know which notaries added value to the kmd ecosystem and these will be rewarded

[30-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Like for example @blackjok3r

[30-Sep-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really hope mainnet notaries can implement somehting like we are usig for #private-staked  where coins are added automatically.

[30-Sep-18 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So should he not get automatically get a new spot I’m pretty sure the community will vote for him again

[30-Sep-18 07:58 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Hm .. Are the already existing Nodes being voted to stay on each year as well ?

[30-Sep-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no chance a-team is going to auto elect unfortunatly... I will not be moving my node just to get the auto elec either, having all the nodes in teh same DC in sydney for SH is a bad idea.

[30-Sep-18 07:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_will  vote against @blackjok3r just for giggles_

[30-Sep-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will have to get voted in again... But I dont think that will be an issue with all the work I have put in.

You sell all yor KMD to cover costs, i doubt you vote will make much diffrence.

many of the tech-savvy notary candidates got a pleasant surprise towards the end of the election 😉

Newbie here, do hyperDEX has a separate blockchain?

[30-Sep-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@DesignBlock HyperDEX is an app, not a chain

[30-Sep-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There is a DEX chain, but it's unrelated

[30-Sep-18 08:39 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So a blockchain is only mandatory for tokens/coins? You can have a DApp without having a separate blockchain?

[30-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[30-Sep-18 09:20 AM] snowdamn#2414
"Chainalysis revealed 36% of BTC in circulation is lost, likely lost, or unmined."
what does unmined mean considering the context?
also, do you agree it's 36%?
not a boring day in crypto

[30-Sep-18 09:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`in circulation is .... unmined.`
errrr......ummmm.....

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
"unmined" means not mine 😉

{Reactions}
🤣 

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] snowdamn#2414
yeah, reading rest of article now

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] snowdamn#2414
they must mean something else

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
thats an odd phrase

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
but yeah i think theres about 3m lost

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
out of the 15m out there

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
so its close

[30-Sep-18 09:23 AM] shiggidy#4554
a conservative estimate says 3m

[30-Sep-18 09:24 AM] shiggidy#4554
which is 20%

[30-Sep-18 09:24 AM] shiggidy#4554
36% maybe a little on the high side

[30-Sep-18 09:24 AM] shiggidy#4554
but its still within the realm of possibility

[30-Sep-18 09:25 AM] snowdamn#2414
"Un-liquid coins, ones not mined or simply lost or held," - wat?

[30-Sep-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"unmined"/"not mined"...
"un-liquid", yes; "in circulation", no

[30-Sep-18 09:27 AM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[30-Sep-18 09:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks that article may have been written by some old banker that doesn't yet understand that there is no "the blockchain"_

[30-Sep-18 09:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
i view such level of misunderstanding/ignorance as very bullish for crypto

[30-Sep-18 09:35 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, i think i deciphered, by "in circulation" the author probably meant Total Supply

[30-Sep-18 09:36 AM] snowdamn#2414
so, ~17.6% out of the 36% is unmined

[30-Sep-18 09:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks what they "meant" was to write `tl;dr I dunno wtf I'm talking about go on the the next article`_

@shiggidy if i deciphered correctly, you were spot on! 🤓

Is Cross chain support only for Komodo Assetchains or for other blockchains too like bitcoin/ ethereum?

[30-Sep-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC allows crosschain to bitcoin protocol coins,but requires an oracle CC posting merkle roots

[30-Sep-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the tech KMD CC has allows for very largescale new functionality, regardless that GUI are nowhere in sight

[30-Sep-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the fundamental problems of crypto are being solved

[30-Sep-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like make a FTL engine that actually goes faster than light, but people saying it has no value since the chairs are uncomfortable

{Reactions}
😆 (3) abusedsmily 

[30-Sep-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
my focus is achieving the never done before "FTL" type of functions, and NOT on having the right cupholder in the right place with the best upholstery

[30-Sep-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I leave such design things to others that are much better at it than me

[30-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and it might take longer to design the perfect cupholder than to invent the "FTL" drive

[30-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but I am confident that it is just a matter of effort and time to have decent cupholders

[30-Sep-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but not for those crazy big many liter cups

[30-Sep-18 10:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
especially since as soon as "the perfect cupholder" exists, someone will invent "the perfect cup" that doesn't fit in it

[30-Sep-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and then start fud that the FTL drive is worthless due to the cup that doesnt fit into the cupholder

[30-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
now, since we have the ability to create the "FTL" tech, we are. but it is still a work in progress for several aspects

[30-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI will come in time

[30-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
then the marketing

[30-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont have $75 mil to spend to get placement on a prominent website

[30-Sep-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
pay for placement in my mind is mostly a waste of money and I dont like to waste money, even if trolls claim that paid placements is marketing, it is not. it is advertising.. which is done after the marketing has already taken effect

[30-Sep-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
think of marketing as planting the seeds and advertising as harvesting the crop

[30-Sep-18 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we dont have $75 mil to spend to get placement on a prominent website`
that's why you, personally, need to get to crowdfunding 
We need funds, not tech :trollface:

[30-Sep-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
if I had $75 mil to spend, I would hire an army of CC devs

[30-Sep-18 10:20 AM] snowdamn#2414
let the projects that end up using the Komodo Platform do the paid placements :mindblown:

[30-Sep-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
well, there is that too

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD's job is to create the tech and provide the infrastructure that other projects can use to jumpstart themselves

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
like VRSC, PIRATE

[30-Sep-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and the other ecosystem projects
