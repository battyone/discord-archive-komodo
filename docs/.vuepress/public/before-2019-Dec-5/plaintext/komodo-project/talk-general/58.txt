I can make it like the dice CC, where the dealer node automatically pays out winners.

[06-Sep-18 05:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is someone could create a chain with auto rev also would be nice (attracting potential icos)... I was thinking if for exampel I make a trading bot with shares/ token make ICO to have supply for the bot, but then use tokens to auto generate rev based on that bot....

[06-Sep-18 05:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually using CC maybe that bot could be an atomic swap app implemented into KMD idk

[06-Sep-18 05:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
then all could be automatic

[06-Sep-18 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, once the tokenized assets are onchain, automated trading is possible

[06-Sep-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We got ZEC/AUD pair today... but they still know who you are to take out fiat, but they no longer can trace where it came from. Not sure if maybe its a honey pot though 🤔

FYI: claim interest before sending to Z 😉

[06-Sep-18 02:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
also, no interest while in Z

more like a PSA than a FYI lol

Any Z Transaction from an z Adress will nullify the interest

[06-Sep-18 03:06 PM] riseandfall#3726
I wonder what is the difference between that and scriptless script (a feature which will be implemented on bitcoin once they switch to Scnhor signature) ?

[06-Sep-18 03:07 PM] riseandfall#3726
I know scriptless script requires linearity in signature aggregation (Shnorr offers it). KMD is based on ECDSA and doesn't propose it.

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD CC can implement arbitrary things, including schnorr signatures with one CC, solidity contracts with another CC, etc.

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is at a totally different level

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
yes right (didn't think about that)

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it creates a new type of output, that follows whatever new rules for that new type of output

[06-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
each CC does

[06-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so to compare this with some single thing...

[06-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you cant really compare them. you could compare one specific CC to it though

[06-Sep-18 03:10 PM] riseandfall#3726
I follow you.

[06-Sep-18 03:11 PM] riseandfall#3726
Guy you are amazing.

[06-Sep-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
each such CC would need to be coded, but it is possible

[06-Sep-18 04:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I wonder if bitboost / old FreeMarket will come back from ETH to KMD . More or less it's known that Eth is more a dream then a platform for real e-commerce...

@benohanlon hey guys? tell me why choose KMD when we could have Xlm, eth etc. Just for some survey.

[06-Sep-18 07:09 PM] benohanlon#1119
@zainshoukat590 I don't give investment advice. However, I like that @jl777c forsaw issues like congestion and security from the start. I believe in what we're doing. Lowering barriers for blockchain. Creating toolsets for devs and dAPPs. Access to a dex, wallet, indepdence etc... so if I asked myself that it would be because I believe Komodo has heart.

[06-Sep-18 07:10 PM] zainshoukat590#6584
@benohanlon Thats awesome explanation and convincible as well for serious investors. Looking for some more suggestions.

[06-Sep-18 07:13 PM] benohanlon#1119
@zainshoukat590 let's look at what most people say when they talk about Bitcoin... "it uses up too much energy, it's wasteful, it harms the planet. What Komodo has done is recycled the enormous energy that's being poured into Bitcoin (think of the hashrate as a river of electricity running through all the miners) to protect and secure other chains. That's amazing. Now Bitcoin's energy can be used to protect the small guy. To create independence. Recycling Bitcoin's energy is an excellent talking point.

[06-Sep-18 07:14 PM] benohanlon#1119
@zainshoukat590 you could share this live chart https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-eth-bch-ltc.html to demonstrate how much larger bitcoin's hashrate is. Komodo offers small projects the security of Bitcoin. It's huge.

everyone  we are less than 1000 blocks (~15h) away from the Komodo 0.2.1 update activation - please update your komodod (current: 0.2.0/0.2.1) or Agama (current: 0.2.41d) if you havent done so yet. Not doing so will result in being on a fork which can/will cause irreversible financial damage.
