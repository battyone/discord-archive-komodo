maybe my recont post that was supported by community did some impression

someone can make it to top 1 ??

[18-Sep-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
small volume needed

[18-Sep-18 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
Sad to see BTM is on the list. I used BTM github repo to get help setting up the insight explorer for BTCD

[18-Sep-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
people will remember

[18-Sep-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes BTM seemd to have nice goal

[18-Sep-18 04:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
real life usage but seems not enough dev power

[18-Sep-18 04:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe BTM could co-op with Verus on profile

[18-Sep-18 04:05 PM] SHossain#0007
never owned BTM though :p

is it possible to have a cryptowat.ch integration to barterdex?

[18-Sep-18 04:08 PM] shnu#0359
similar to what kraken does

[18-Sep-18 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
possible, yes

[18-Sep-18 05:09 PM] SRV#9449
Sup. Learning about Komodo. Just found out our about the 64 dpow nodes. Doesn’t this make Komodo centralised and stoppable. Any thoughts?

[18-Sep-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SRV dPoW nodes (notaries) are elected by those that hold KMD and can be anyone (literally) and as such does not "centralized" make

[18-Sep-18 05:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if anything, the fact that any "Joe off the street" can become a notary is the opposite of centralized

[18-Sep-18 05:16 PM] SRV#9449
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 but the 64 notaries can be taken out, blackmailed, killed, threatened etc?

[18-Sep-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's different from making the same argument about a handful of pools controlling any chain (BTC being an example)?

[18-Sep-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you can corrupt 64 unconnected individuals, then surely your time and money would be better spent corrupting the 6 people that "control" BTC pools

[18-Sep-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks will continue even without notaries

[18-Sep-18 05:19 PM] SRV#9449
You can’t turn btc off. If all the miners stopped today, the mining difficulty would drop and pc mining would start again,

[18-Sep-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries dont have any monopoly power to create blocks

[18-Sep-18 05:20 PM] SRV#9449
Oh wow hello sir.

[18-Sep-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
hello

[18-Sep-18 05:33 PM] SRV#9449
What power do the 64 notaries have above a non notary? What authority/power do they have over and above someone like me with a small holding

[18-Sep-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
they can notarize

[18-Sep-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
they can also each mine approx 1% of blocks

[18-Sep-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but anybody is able to become a notary as the elections are an open process

[18-Sep-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and the technically capable ones tend to win the open spots

[18-Sep-18 05:57 PM] jorian#4555
as a notary myself, i don't have a lot of power. i dedicate time to make sure my node is up and in good shape to help secure the KMD network by dPoW. apart from that i don't have any more power than any other KMD holder

[18-Sep-18 05:58 PM] jorian#4555
i can try to sabotage the network, but we have plenty of smart people who would notice. and then it's 63 against 1 and i'm out. don't want to take that risk

[18-Sep-18 06:04 PM] SRV#9449
Appreciate your answers. Thank you.

[18-Sep-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_almost wishes that notaries would go corrupt, the chain would fork, and he would pick up an extra percentage of valid blocks 😝_

[18-Sep-18 06:53 PM] Resistor#1215
does anyone have a windows exe file to double click to solo mine?

[18-Sep-18 06:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
no, you would need to setup a stratum first then mine to it

[18-Sep-18 06:55 PM] Resistor#1215
but linux does that , how come windows can't do that?

[18-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Resistor#1215
i tried that earlier

[18-Sep-18 06:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I don't know of a linux stratum for KMD that's just started with a single executable file either

[18-Sep-18 08:31 PM] ABP blocklord#2715

[18-Sep-18 08:34 PM] ABP blocklord#2715
yes

[18-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Hermes#6934
@ABP blocklord  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/get-listed-barterDEX.html Here is a guide on how to get listed in Barterdex just in case.

[18-Sep-18 08:34 PM] ABP blocklord#2715
great, thks

[18-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Hermes#6934
maybe your dev will like to see it , your coin has to able to take rpc calls

[18-Sep-18 08:35 PM] ABP blocklord#2715
if I need more info, may i write you @Hermes

[18-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Hermes#6934
yes also you can send a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will document your request and hand it to the dev in charge of integrations, although you can already submit the request via github directly but just in case let us know in the ticket.

[18-Sep-18 08:36 PM] ABP blocklord#2715

Looking at dexstats, it seems that we've had 200KMD (so roughly 200USD) of trade volume over the past 24hrs

[19-Sep-18 02:35 PM] moneyisold#7406
I know we have to get that higher dex is the way

[19-Sep-18 02:36 PM] nii236#2759
Yeah

[19-Sep-18 02:37 PM] nii236#2759
there's no clear increase

[19-Sep-18 02:37 PM] nii236#2759
In fact its pretty poor overall https://dexstats.info/tradevolume.php

[19-Sep-18 02:37 PM] nii236#2759
This is a good way to see uptake

it's from 2015, knowing Todd I think he would say the same about kmd or everything else

[19-Sep-18 03:11 PM] moneyisold#7406
Possible Solution:
Use a platform like KMD — Komodo Platform to anchor hashes periodically.

[19-Sep-18 03:13 PM] moneyisold#7406
It is bytheway really stupid to not collaborate with other coins in these times

[19-Sep-18 03:13 PM] moneyisold#7406

`“Confirmation time is security parameter; lowering it makes the system fundamentally less secure for a lot of reasons`

[19-Sep-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10 minute confirmation time is security parameter in that it allows a 10 year old PC to lag down modern equipment to standards of 10 years ago, maybe 😖

I was also emailling them the other day to list KMD

[19-Sep-18 03:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@benohanlon  ok I ment that good to plan such actions to make better impact (use our human/users/subs resources), not necessarily to use this one 😃

[19-Sep-18 03:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
now when there is official KMD response - good to send email to example 5 bullet friday subs to support the twitter post

[19-Sep-18 03:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
anyway by far it seems KMD is rather small community or not very active compared to example DOGE or others; if we exceed 5k likes on that twitter post I will change my mind

[19-Sep-18 03:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Komodo titter followers almost 100k, if only 5% supports such post would be enough... question if ...

[19-Sep-18 04:16 PM] moneyisold#7406
That is because you guys don't hire a promoter

[19-Sep-18 04:17 PM] moneyisold#7406
KMD has a lot of moon possibility

[19-Sep-18 04:17 PM] moneyisold#7406
it is just not sold in the right way
