Verus agame won't connect with komodo light. veruscoin connects fine.

[07-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Easteregg69#4081
Next. Bittrex check.

Notice price on rise as network is "disrupted".

[07-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
price had literally broken out and was going up hours before the hack, this has stalled it out at this price, it probably wouldve risen more otherwise

[07-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Easteregg69#4081
Not a big fan of disruption.

11 KMD worth of trouble.

[07-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
FYI guys, if you don't want to use verus agama you can use zelcore or like...a bunch of other wallets to make your new address. Google around, there are a lot of wallets that work with Komodo.

a smart person never stores more than a spending amount on a mobile wallet

[07-Jun-19 11:31 PM] PTYX#6840
once we add cold storage support that's a different story

[07-Jun-19 11:42 PM] Roadrunner#3038
This has to be a stupid question, but how does one get the KMD balance shown in the Asset Viewer to a new wallet. I have Windows 7, so no Verus or Ocean. I have Verus  on Galaxy Pad and Guarda on PC. Now I just need to transfer or import from safe storage. Gotta be easy?

[07-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Easteregg69#4081
@Potato Guy 9000 
Have a running version now. Back to filling form.

[07-Jun-19 11:47 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
@PTYX so is it wise I get my kmd out of chameleon because I sent it all there on a quick reaction to the vulnerability news

[07-Jun-19 11:48 PM] PTYX#6840
If it's a significant amount of funds, don't keep it in a mobile walelt.

[07-Jun-19 11:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Roadrunner guarda may not support all the assets.
why no Verus on windows? weren't you able to install it?

[07-Jun-19 11:50 PM] Roadrunner#3038
It only works on 8 or higher. It would make it easier.

[07-Jun-19 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
@gcharang do you know when KMD work on Bittrex (i mean a wallet )

[07-Jun-19 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
not possible to deposit/withdraw

[07-Jun-19 11:52 PM] gcharang#6833

[07-Jun-19 11:53 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
@PTYX what would you consider significant? It‚Äôs not like a life‚Äôs savings amount.

[07-Jun-19 11:54 PM] PTYX#6840
I keep what i spend on mobile. So usually a few hundred dollars. Anything above what I will be spending I keep in cold storage. You can use various wallets to see your cold storage balance so you can still see your portfolio without needed to have your keys on the device.

[07-Jun-19 11:54 PM] PTYX#6840
Once we add bip support we will add the ability to create watch-only addresses for that purpose.

[07-Jun-19 11:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User most likely after june 15

[08-Jun-19 12:00 AM] DingDongSoLong#0148
@PTYX ah ok i think I should move to a cold storage then. Out of curiosity which would you consider the safer option to hold stuff on, Chameleon or an exchange?

[08-Jun-19 12:05 AM] PTYX#6840
Chameleon

[08-Jun-19 12:06 AM] PTYX#6840
I've heard of exchanges using cold storage but you're still at their mercy.

[08-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks @gcharang

[08-Jun-19 12:12 AM] Easteregg69#4081
No valid utxo is available.

[08-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Easteregg69#4081
I have filled a new refund form with new address  a moment ago.  Username Easteregg69.

[08-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Easteregg69#4081
New address is working. Old wallet wont give me an "UTXO".

[08-Jun-19 12:25 AM] nocturnal#2177
anyone have any opinions about ledger vs trezor? or they basically the same?

[08-Jun-19 12:32 AM] crumb#2550
both have their pros and cons. mostly it's about personal preference tho. read some reviews and watch some youtube vids to make your choice easier. or get both üòÑ

[08-Jun-19 12:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Bimbles  Agama is/was going to be deprecated in the near future .  In the background KMD team has been working on a new wallet with integrated atomic swaps currently it is finishing alpha testing and moving into beta with it progress can be viewed in the #atomicdex-beta  channel

[08-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Bimbles#2263

[08-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Dan122#4857
Hi so I send from my old komodo agama to the new komodo versus wallet? New wallet address is the one specified in the form as my new address?

[08-Jun-19 12:53 AM] gcharang#6833
@Dan122 yes

[08-Jun-19 12:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have been fortunate enough to test it briefly and it is easy to install ( will be available mobile first google play/AppStore when full release is out )  and  the ui is pretty intuitive even for the atomic swaps I think people will be pleased and best part no npm dependency lol

[08-Jun-19 12:54 AM] Dan122#4857
why does my old agama wallet seed also log me into the versus wallet?

[08-Jun-19 12:54 AM] Easteregg69#4081
@Gordon Komodo compromised one Agama_windows_portable_0.3.6b from komodo site

@Gordon Komodo Cannot get a valid utxo for sending that small amount as required.

[08-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Old address to new address.

[08-Jun-19 12:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seeds just generate keys.  So same seed same key.  Verus and Komodo Use same format for generating high entropy keys

[08-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Bimbles#2263
Last question from me @polycryptoblog :
If we had other coins on Agama mobile wallet, should we add them to Verus wallet or what is the process to recover those?

[08-Jun-19 12:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , all coins should be moved immediately .  Recovery process is the same if they haven‚Äôt been swept otherwise fill the claim form

[08-Jun-19 12:59 AM] crumb#2550
@Color888 you do understand that this wallet issue had NOTHING to do with Komodo core code?

[08-Jun-19 01:00 AM] Bimbles#2263

[08-Jun-19 01:00 AM] Bimbles#2263

[08-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Bimbles#2263
Still difficult to understand @crumb 
How is the Verus wallet any safer from that than the Agama mobile wallet (which has been compromised). Looks like the Verus wallet has the same problem?

[08-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Easteregg69#4081
How come i don't have valid utxo for sending 0.0001 komodo?

[08-Jun-19 01:08 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Pretty core stuff.

[08-Jun-19 01:08 AM] crumb#2550

@polycryptoblog 
Sending to the Verus KMD public address from the Agama mobile wallet doesn't work for ERC20 tokens. Send to an ethereum wallet instead?

[08-Jun-19 01:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, send to an address you control that was not generated by Komodo Agama
