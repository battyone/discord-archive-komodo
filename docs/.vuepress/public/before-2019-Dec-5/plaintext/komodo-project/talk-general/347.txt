Removed @Cryptoon  I had like 9KMD. LOL

[07-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I saw that üòâ

[07-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Ludom#5832
You need to mix it with Pirate now

[07-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Keppie#5156
In a month, we laugh with this event. To a succesful ending of all of this! :Komodo:

[07-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Keppie#5156
Just feel bad for jl having to put 500k kmd in this

[07-Jun-19 03:10 PM] skerberus#7584
If I used agama 0.35 I should move funds, is that correct?

[07-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Is there an online wallet that I can use to log in to my old adress?

[07-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
So I can check the small TX and send it

[07-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Keppie#5156
you can use the verus enhanced agama wallet & use your old seed

[07-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Okey

[07-Jun-19 03:17 PM] eduard#6056
I sent 0.0001 and 0.0001 to my new Adress

[07-Jun-19 03:17 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@skerberus  Agama 0.3.5 or later are compromised

[07-Jun-19 03:19 PM] eduard#6056
what should we do after we have sent KMD to the new address?

[07-Jun-19 03:20 PM] skerberus#7584
Ok, thanks

[07-Jun-19 03:22 PM] skerberus#7584
I have a ledger nano s can I use that for the new address? I remember that claiming was not possible on the ledger some time ago

[07-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
@skerberus there are two 3rd party apps that you can claim rewards with a ledger with now 
https://app.magnumwallet.co/
https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

Please be sure to actually verify what you're confirming on the device is correct if you use these

https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/
Ledger KMD Reward Claim
Claim your KMD rewards on your Ledger device.

[07-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
would recommend the atomiclabs option as it's open source

[07-Jun-19 03:25 PM] LeshAft9#0083
magnumwallet does not offer the ability to confirm your address on the device

[07-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Alright#0419
you sure about that? ü§î

[07-Jun-19 03:26 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Go there and look for any link or button that causes it to show the address on the device, I can't find it.

[07-Jun-19 03:27 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I'm just talking about a basic Receive action

[07-Jun-19 03:27 PM] skerberus#7584
my other komodo assets can be sent too to the ledger nano s address right?

[07-Jun-19 03:27 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I don't think so skerberus

[07-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
If you plan to hold them long term, yes, but it's pretty annoying to then spend them again, fair warning

[07-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I have sent my small TX to my new adress but it said the amount is lower than fee

[07-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
would not recommend it unless you're pretty technical

[07-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
how am I 00% it worked

[07-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
nvm they showed up in new adress

[07-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
what should I do now?

[07-Jun-19 03:31 PM] skerberus#7584
looks like I am too late

[07-Jun-19 03:34 PM] skerberus#7584
and unfortunately no safe wallet it seems

[07-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Verus agama is safe'

[07-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ledger as well

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] skerberus#7584
well my coins already left

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Might have been swept by the team

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
check the adress which they were sent to

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] skerberus#7584
yeah it is not a safe wallet

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
same happend to many others

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] skerberus#7584
RWxxx

[07-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Oh dayum

[07-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Think they have 2 safe adresses

[07-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
double check

[07-Jun-19 03:36 PM] skerberus#7584
they have RS as safe wallet

[07-Jun-19 03:36 PM] gcharang#6833
