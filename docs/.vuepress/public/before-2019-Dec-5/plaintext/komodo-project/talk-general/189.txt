Seems only one important hint needed ) Length of passphrase. 
I guess it can be:

81 - if we use all numbers in solution.
59 - if we omit given numbers.
52 - if it's just a WIF calculated as in Sudoku CC algo from solution.

[01-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
Decker, did you have ca's hint in mind while trying to crack it?

right @DvorNick - i stand to my word - here is the hint: "Solving the sudoku alone wont help. You need to combine the solution with the heart/brain of Komodo"`

[01-Feb-19 12:35 AM] Decker#3767
I'm read it as "combine the solution of sudoku with brain" )) Yes, i'm using brain during the process )) But seems read incorrectly )

[01-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Decker#3767
` However, it is not involving the sudoku client at all. Only the above sudoku puzzle, Agama and a little bit of analytical thinking is needed.`
Seems i miss somehing in this puzzle ... )

@grewalsatinder yeah ... but ... puzzle should be solved just looking on Sudoku picture. `However, it is not involving the sudoku client at all. Only the above sudoku puzzle, Agama and a little bit of analytical thinking is needed.`

[01-Feb-19 02:41 AM] ca333#0118
yes - it can be solved just by looking on picture + first hint (brain/heart).

[01-Feb-19 02:44 AM] ca333#0118
if i disclose such info, bruteforcing this puzzle is a no-brainer. i know x cryptosolver and bruteforce that we can use for this. and anyone could solve it this way. the next puzzle will require you to know about binary arithemic, fibonacci and golden ratio... that one you can come with your bruteforcer. this one requires some thinking/trial and error..

[01-Feb-19 02:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

now now:troll_lol:

[01-Feb-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason was unrestrained spending across the industry... "However, they admit that spending reached as high as 9 million XEM per month. That would have been worth close to $0.75 million in December, and $1.5 million per month back in July."

[01-Feb-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
considering KMD raised a bit less than $2 mil, it is simply not possible for us to spend like the other projects do. No sponsoring of olympic teams, basketball, etc. and the paid placements have to be very carefully selected. It is so easy for people to spend other peoples money, but they forget komodo is not selling any products, it is not a company, so the normal rules of business dont quite apply.

anyway, curious to hear from all the "marketing is all that matters" crowd about how marketing can matter at all when all the money spent on it didnt lead to any usage of the tech that wasnt completed yet (like happened with many of the high profile projects), and likely that most of the people who even remember the marketing are not even in crypto anymore.

[01-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Lennart#9331
it's also a timing issue. when there is "enough" working tech for developers to jump on and the rebranding is in full effect, a small marketing campaign would be very well placed. Could come just in time for market sentiment change as well

[01-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Lennart#9331

@ca333 "i wanted to make snakepath first and add the head of a dragon on top of it.

So you mean the hearth/brain clue should tell us how to enter those sudoku numbers in the "Enter Passphrase" text box to get access to the wallet? So I guess we need to focus on 777 right???? But I can't figure it out! 😩

[01-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Strob#3417
From the white paper: "Iguana Core is the heart of the underlying technology
that enables the vast Komodo ecosystem to work together."

[01-Feb-19 02:09 PM] Decker#3767
@Strob we defenitily need other hint from @ca333 ... bcz some people here, including me, seems tried everything. I'm also tried to follow "jl777" letters circuit as a path for entering digits from solutions: Too many guesses about "combine the solution with the heart/brain" )

@Decker Yes combining the 64 numbers with "Iguana Core" or any other word of the list leaves almost infinite possibilities. I tried focusing on Iguanan Core (IC=93) that should tell us to follow a path starting from "9,3"  https://imgur.com/OPThjA6

Can this help a bit more?: A Note About Komodo’s Iguana Core Technology
All the following processes are supported by a deeper Komodo technology called
Iguana Core. Readers of our entire white paper will note that Iguana Core is featured
in each section. This is because Iguana Core is the heart of the underlying technology
that enables the vast Komodo ecosystem to work together. The Iguana Core code
itself is complex and to fully explain would require a separate white paper.
In short, Iguana Core is a collection of code that serves many purposes. One function of Iguana Core is to empower the blockchain technologies Komodo either builds
or adopts to act in coordination with each other. Often, Iguana Core can advance their
initial capabilities beyond original expectations. In the case of dPoW, the code that
underlies notary-node functionality spawned from Iguana Core technology.
Iguana Core is coded in the C programming language—the language of choice
of our lead developer, JL777. The C language is designed to enable computers to
process high volumes of information in a secure manner at high speed. This aligns
with Komodo’s directives to provide security and scalability to our users

[01-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Decker#3767
@Strob btw, why "combining the 64 numbers" ? length of sudoku solution is 81 or 59 symbols (depends on count given number or not).

[01-Feb-19 02:30 PM] Strob#3417
Ok yes sorry I meant 81

[01-Feb-19 02:37 PM] Strob#3417
And we must not forget about the pirate chain comment "with only a OR missing"... So that would give something like: Probably in order as they appear left to right OR top to bottom.

[01-Feb-19 02:38 PM] Strob#3417
We are still at an almost infinite number of possibilities and life is not infinite so I will wait for more clue!
