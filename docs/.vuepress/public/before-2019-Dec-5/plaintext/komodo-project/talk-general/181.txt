with coming dev documentation and portal, the great job of organizing hackatons, courses and attracting developers can start.... Have multiple projects building things (I want a MakerDAO and Aragon replicated on Komodo blockchains... ), convince the best Erc20 to move to assetchains...  showcase scaling Bitcoin with sidechains...

I wonder if "Smart chains" is a better term for asset chains?

[23-Jan-19 04:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
or is smart over used these days

[23-Jan-19 04:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've seen them called Dappchains

`I wonder if "Smart chains" is a better term for asset chains?`
maybe, but there's still regulars *in here* calling "rewards" "interest" so, changing name doesn't always change much üòõ

[23-Jan-19 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are just chains ü§∑

[23-Jan-19 04:59 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Are smart contracts just contracts? lol

[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well... I dont think our"contracts"  are really that  either..They are just code like any other.

@jorian ledger is working well on Magnum but you need to delete the kmd app using Ledger Live and reinstall. Once you do, it will make and receive transactions on Magnum wallet.

No I haven‚Äôt @polycryptoblog but we aren‚Äôt there yet. We will do so when we get closer to making strides towards figuring out our governance model. That‚Äôs the next step after ethoFS beta comes out late this month.

Komodo!

[24-Jan-19 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@$tefano. I know about this, looking forward to see how it works myself. It assumes that masternodes are good nodes, and then makes exchanges only connect to masternodes. Not sure of specifiecs tho.

[24-Jan-19 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r what coin?

[24-Jan-19 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Xsg

[24-Jan-19 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It only prevents 51% attack against exchanges

[24-Jan-19 01:14 AM] Alright#0419
they have some docs on how it works?

[24-Jan-19 01:19 AM] Alright#0419
wondering how they validate that a node is truly a MN

[24-Jan-19 01:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He's still working on it, I didn't ask too many questions. I guess he would answer them if you asked.

[24-Jan-19 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
can you remind me when they put it into production

[24-Jan-19 08:27 AM] $tefano.#3560
@blackjok3r indeed but seems interested same concept of NN but extended to MN

[24-Jan-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its quite diffrent

[24-Jan-19 08:43 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I wouldn't call more limited solution an extending solution

[24-Jan-19 01:47 PM] Magnum Wallet#0608

i don't know, you tell me

[25-Jan-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
I moved into Zec KMD and Nano hoping to not get fucked with vulns

[25-Jan-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c does this affect ZEC and zec forks ? ( kmd ? ) ?

[25-Jan-19 01:51 AM] Tek#5253
thought so

[25-Jan-19 01:51 AM] Tek#5253
im going to puth my faith on the heavily audited ZEC forks

[25-Jan-19 01:51 AM] Tek#5253
im so done with the cryptonote xmr fuck ups

[25-Jan-19 01:52 AM] Tek#5253
Edward Snowden was right, XMR is a hobby project

[25-Jan-19 01:53 AM] Tek#5253
I know but I need something reliable

[25-Jan-19 01:53 AM] Tek#5253
its been a lot of time they have bugs

[25-Jan-19 01:53 AM] Tek#5253
serious bugs

[25-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
I need to have some holds where I can just , leave it for a year where i don't need to worry.

[25-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
about these kind of things emerging

[25-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
so no more xmr

[25-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Tek#5253
i gave it a lot of chances and I lost a lot of money holding it having faith im fucking done lol

[25-Jan-19 01:55 AM] Tek#5253
I know right but with ZEC codebases atleast it gets audited heavily by a party that wants the best for the chain(s), with xmr, who knows what gets into the codebase, they aren't self funding.

[25-Jan-19 01:56 AM] Tek#5253
its a risk and I'm not willing to hold it at the moment ... I have more faith in the ZEC basese then..

@Tek what if I told you a similar thing can be done on ZEC?

[25-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Tek#5253
then i'd be sad

[25-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Tek#5253
i guess i'll have to store my value in nano then

[25-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
it's insignificant

[25-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
it would get noticed almost immediately and be mitigated

[25-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Tek#5253
zec doesn't have a block size limit?

[25-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
Slap a scary sounding name on some nuisance attack and scare investors :abusedsmily:

[25-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
seems to have worked

[25-Jan-19 03:39 AM] Tek#5253
doesn't matter, xmr is a bad investment anyway

[25-Jan-19 03:39 AM] Tek#5253
i mean not a bad

[25-Jan-19 03:39 AM] Tek#5253
just worse than others

[25-Jan-19 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
ZEC does have a block size limit, but I'm fairly sure it doesn't have a size limit on sapling transactions

[25-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
so single spam transaction can fill their 4mb blocks

[25-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
5.5GB/day for very little money

[25-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
Ah wait, their block times are slower

[25-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
so smaller than that

[25-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Tek#5253
well that sucks

[25-Jan-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
~2GB/day? ishhh

[25-Jan-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
not nearly as bad as XMR thing

[25-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Tek#5253
it can't be done on the zec chain that bad so to cripple and destroy the whole network

[25-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Tek#5253
is what im getting from this

[25-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
Would you believe me if I told you ZEC has a killswitch?

[25-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Tek#5253
you're part of the team so i suppose you are , suppposed to know whats in the code

[25-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Tek#5253
killswitch for what exactly? though
