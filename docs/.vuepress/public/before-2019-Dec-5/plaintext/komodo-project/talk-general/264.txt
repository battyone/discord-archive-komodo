Question, notary nodes @ mobile wallet, asking me for seed or private key , why is that ?

[12-Apr-19 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
notary nodes don't ask you for anything
mobile wallet needs your seed because it doesn't sore locally and you have to prove you own it

So I asked few question in which "How we measure growth for Komodo platform adoption? What are the current adoption number? (Adoption -Projects/businesses/individuals using komodo‚Äôs tech)"

I didn't this questions answer properly ..So I created a Excel, in which let's add the project we know also Pin this somewhere ..so we can get as much data as we can ..

This will help internally and also we can give it to media, so they look into komodo ecosystem and write about us. 

For now it's open and anyone can edit ..I will create daily copy, so we can protect this data

[12-Apr-19 06:44 PM] Caglio#3337
For security reasons lol

[12-Apr-19 06:44 PM] Caglio#3337
I thought I will just get snapshot and receive vote tokens

[12-Apr-19 06:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Your seed for KMD will be the same seed for the vote tokens

[12-Apr-19 06:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you want to access them, you'll need to either use agama desktop or mobile

[12-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Caglio#3337
I understand that, but for entering my agama, Ineed to write my password, afterwards

[12-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Caglio#3337
It asks me for my seed, and once again for my passphrase

[12-Apr-19 06:47 PM] SHossain#0007
that is ok

[12-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Caglio#3337
It just seems a little bit sketchy to me

You will receive the vote tokens as long as you have your KMD in your address. They will be airdropped on the 14th, all you have to do is use your seed/passphrase/privkey on the vote2019 coin and the 1:1 airdrop will be there

I think the main metric is the number of blockchains on Komodo platform, especially those that use dPoW ‚Äì¬†as else it's more like a test net (very vulnerable)

[13-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Audo#5667
I want us to have a website that showcases the size of our ecosystem. We might have something on the rebranded website but there could be a community run / third party website also.

Would it be an idea to have a "stackoverflow" like webapp, that instead of reputation bounties, does kmd bounties? I love discord, but it is time to move forward as a community, accelerate development, bug tracking, etc. This might also be good for ecosystems (like our Gaming SDK, Agama Wallet, CC's, etc.). It's fairly simple to use Discord OAuth for it. I am not talking about another discussion forum, but for example, there is an issue found that isn't like severe in GH, but could be bountified.

[13-Apr-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`I love discord, but it is time to move forward as a community`
fek, we just left slack not too long ago, you want miracles? :troll:

[13-Apr-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
but on a serious note, the only problem I see with that suggestion is navigation. how do I find this, that, or the other?

[13-Apr-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
we'd pretty much need a bounty system to fund building the bounty system

[13-Apr-19 03:07 PM] CHMEX#0686
It's one of the ideas I have which hopefully I can execute soon.
I wish to build some page where funds can be collected and shown ( like kickstarter if that's still a thing )

[13-Apr-19 03:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I dont like soon. Soon is in the batcave. From a community perspective it is important. But no worries. I'll hack something into existing, somewhere tomorrow. My idea: post bounty, throw it in escrowment. People respond, fix and PR, and the bounty owner accepts answer and BAM, done. Thats like  Meteor tutorial.

[13-Apr-19 03:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Or maybe better is to create a Discord Bot.

[13-Apr-19 03:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
one that list, CRUD and show stats.

[13-Apr-19 03:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yes, probably better and cheap as fuck.

[13-Apr-19 03:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
My motto is to start simple and refactor.
