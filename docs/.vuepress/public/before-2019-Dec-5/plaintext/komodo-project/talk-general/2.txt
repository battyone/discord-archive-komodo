But they are the only one in South America that does transfers locally

[28-May-18 03:15 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Oh

[28-May-18 03:15 PM] ptytrader#0000
No

[28-May-18 03:16 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Hes eu right

[28-May-18 03:16 PM] ptytrader#0000
I think so

[28-May-18 03:16 PM] ptytrader#0000
I haven't hears if him in forever

[28-May-18 03:16 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Do they also support carribean

[28-May-18 03:16 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I will get st kitts soon

[28-May-18 03:17 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
If things go as planned

[28-May-18 03:18 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yea I've been doing some digging on the best jurisdiction. User friendly wise EUR accounts are the best

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] ptytrader#0000
You could just do what cryptocapital did and open an account in Portugal so you can sell directly from Bitpanda or another big exchange

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] ptytrader#0000
That is a longterm solution

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Portugal support foreign account?

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Singapore only supports PB

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] ptytrader#0000
I believe so

[28-May-18 03:19 PM] ptytrader#0000
Oh really?

[28-May-18 03:20 PM] ptytrader#0000
Good to know

[28-May-18 03:20 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Yeah you need long term visa for local

[28-May-18 03:20 PM] ptytrader#0000
Portugal and Spain are the easiest to get a company and account

[28-May-18 03:20 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
And for long term visa you need to set up a company there and hire like 3 people

[28-May-18 03:20 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I set up a company there using otonomos

[28-May-18 03:21 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
And they had some management issues and their company go bust

[28-May-18 03:21 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
So now i dont have a nominee

[28-May-18 03:21 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
So i had to close it lol

[28-May-18 03:21 PM] ptytrader#0000
üòï

[28-May-18 03:21 PM] ptytrader#0000
At least you didn't lose funds

[28-May-18 03:22 PM] ptytrader#0000
Sometimes those fiduciary services can go very wrong

[28-May-18 03:22 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Well i paid them 5000 for 1 year support

[28-May-18 03:22 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
And they go bust after 5 months

[28-May-18 03:22 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yeah, that sucks

[28-May-18 03:23 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Well for now let me try cryptocapital if they scam lol

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] ptytrader#0000
Let me know how it goes

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Ok. Let me know about panda though

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I will need some various gateways anyway

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yup already sent him and email

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] ptytrader#0000
Have you tried LB?

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Lb?

[28-May-18 03:24 PM] ptytrader#0000
Localbitcoins

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I thought about it

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] ptytrader#0000
I have found some really good traders and contacts via LB

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] ptytrader#0000
And their escrow is very well thought out

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I was a broker of lb in korea when i started coins

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] ptytrader#0000
Broker?

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Dealer

[28-May-18 03:25 PM] ptytrader#0000
Gotcha

[28-May-18 03:26 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
And then a phishing chinese group sent me fiat via my bank account

[28-May-18 03:26 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
And police froze my account for 5 months until trial is done

[28-May-18 03:27 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Lol

[28-May-18 03:27 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
I couldnt do a bank transfer for 5 months

[28-May-18 03:27 PM] ptytrader#0000
OMG

[28-May-18 03:28 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yes I see your point

[28-May-18 03:28 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Their broker fee is about 7~10%

[28-May-18 03:29 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yea I honestly hate.... Hate receiving transfers to my bank account

[28-May-18 03:29 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
So i dont think its much reliable

[28-May-18 03:29 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Btw, do i need to visit portugal for setting up bank account?

[28-May-18 03:40 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yes but it's super easy. If you get a good lawyer.... There are ways of not visiting

[28-May-18 03:40 PM] ptytrader#0000
Basically they either bypass the NIE or process the nie on your behalf

[28-May-18 03:40 PM] ptytrader#0000
Then you can open it online if it's a personal account

[28-May-18 03:40 PM] ptytrader#0000
S√°badelle bank doesn't require a NIE if you go in person with a passport and proof of income

[28-May-18 03:41 PM] ptytrader#0000
S√°badelle is known to be crypto friendly

[28-May-18 03:42 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Do you know a lawyer there?

[28-May-18 03:43 PM] cryptoon#0000
Where?

[28-May-18 03:43 PM] bitcoinuserx#0000
Portugal

[28-May-18 03:51 PM] ptytrader#0000

The real slim shady?

[29-May-18 03:11 PM] joebitcoinorg#0000
Is Komodo a good platform for doing proof of existence?

[29-May-18 03:13 PM] n41r0j#0000
You mean storing a hash of a digital file in the OP_RETURN of a dPoWed assetchain?

[29-May-18 03:18 PM] joebitcoinorg#0000
Yes, I think that's right Jorian.

[29-May-18 03:19 PM] n41r0j#0000
That's possible

[29-May-18 03:20 PM] joebitcoinorg#0000
Thanks Jorian .  I appreciate the answer.  I'm usually working on my RemedyCoin project, but a friend wants me to help with putting up a proof of existence site .
