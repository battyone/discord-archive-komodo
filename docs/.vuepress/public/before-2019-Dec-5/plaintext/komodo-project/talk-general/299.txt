I am biased, but it's only one month and it's not that annoying. Only thing I found annoying is the ultra long user handles

A dedicated channel purely for some Q&A type stuff where voters can ask questions related to proposals etc would be nice

[13-May-19 08:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not only during election time, but during the entire year, so if NN promised x or y, people can ask about the progress etc

[13-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And not just dormant notaries becoming more publicly active the past month because 'they have to'

[13-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Interaction with non-dev public is what gets people interested as well in what the NN's/devs do

#notarynode

[13-May-19 08:19 AM] hastrup#8742
@Cryptoon that is a good idea.  you could run the voting promote bot for the duration of the voting period. And after that voter could check up on the nn promised ti would also be helpful for new votes so see back

[13-May-19 08:19 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c I will continue there

[13-May-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean that is the channel that can be used

[13-May-19 08:24 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c OK I see :)

[13-May-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I always thought the #notarynode channel was for the notaries themselves discussing notary stuff

[13-May-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
how to solve xx problem related to notarizing etc

[13-May-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
notary questions and answers seems to fall into "notary stuff" category

[13-May-19 10:01 AM] jeezy#3408
notary election is a very important thing for komodo. it affects everyone in some way, and should be taken seriously. thus I think its okay to deal with 3-4 weeks of promotions from candidates.

[13-May-19 11:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338
nah i was just confused and thought maybe my comment had been printed as  -ing  to others, since genie said that

[13-May-19 11:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338

If u recieve vote tokens, are u able to send those vote tokens to someone else?

[13-May-19 01:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only one transfer allowed I think

[13-May-19 01:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Send them to the notary candidate of your choosing

[13-May-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
Im just trying to learn how it work and what flaws i can find in it

[13-May-19 01:33 PM] Markus#5464
cause if u can send them more then once then if u got 2 nodes u want elected u can basically send tokens from a winning one to a non winning one to get both winning

[13-May-19 01:35 PM] Instel7#1416
@Markus There's one screenshot that will be taken at 00:00 utc, whoever wins, wins... there's no chance for sending votes to anyone else after the screenshot

[13-May-19 01:35 PM] Markus#5464
why would u do it after screenshot

[13-May-19 01:35 PM] Markus#5464
ofc u would be doing that before

[13-May-19 01:36 PM] Instel7#1416
then it doesn't make sense what you're proposing, it would be double spending (?)

[13-May-19 01:36 PM] Alexfrog#1338
only the first send of votes counts, you cant send them again

[13-May-19 01:36 PM] Markus#5464
Okay

[13-May-19 01:39 PM] Markus#5464
how?

[13-May-19 01:40 PM] Markus#5464
thought vote was suppose to be non centralized

[13-May-19 01:41 PM] Markus#5464
Well maybe its in rules i didnt read them if there is any 😄

[13-May-19 01:42 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[13-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last year someone got disqualified for doing the thing you are proposing if I remember correctly

[13-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ran for 2 nodes, neither was going to get elected, sent votes from one candidacy to the other

[13-May-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As all is on blockchain it was clearly visible

Can't remember who, should go look in slack logs, but I'm sure someone here 'members

[13-May-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
interesting xD

[13-May-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That's why if you are not sure, better to run for only one node, make sure your node does well, get auto reelected and run for another node with your node already safe

[13-May-19 01:46 PM] VoskCoin#1869

@Markus the code that tallies votes knows about the trick you mentioned, and only funds which have been sent exactly once are counted

[13-May-19 03:26 PM] Edward#3177
Damn, KMD can't catch a break. Had one good month in March and back to 2018 shit. I know they're all about open source and free services, but I think ETH has something to say about it being used for gas and demand with ICO funding. KMD needs some actual demand. 5k KMD a year for dPoW isn't going to get us there, especially if most are done pro bono.

`not sure if you can claim rewards storing during 1 month on paper wallet, changing wallet every month... did someone do that?`
As long as the tx is correct, there's no reason you can't

[13-May-19 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only actual difference between paper and not-paper is that paper key hasn't been imported
everything else is still what it is
