sweet, I just didn't want to end up having it do an overwrite and screwing me up since I never use ZEC anymore

[07-Oct-18 05:06 AM] actionslacks#4072

what is the difference betweenm txns and payments in those stats?

[07-Oct-18 05:11 AM] IP#9768
thanks for the link by the way

[07-Oct-18 05:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm not sure tbh

[07-Oct-18 06:09 AM] IP#9768
@webworker01 yeah i know how utxo works but how come it is batched so good? 7.5k txns 64k payments means batching is rather good

[07-Oct-18 06:10 AM] IP#9768
not complaining for sure just curious, maybe exchange or pools batch txns so good

[07-Oct-18 10:14 AM] ch6ris#5240

Is there anybody who participated in the blocknation ico, I'm really confused was there a refund?

[07-Oct-18 11:33 AM] ch6ris#5240
airdrop refund? I can't even remember what wallet I used.

[07-Oct-18 11:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes they airdropped back the KMD and you get to keep the coins

[07-Oct-18 11:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
hmmm, I can't find the transaction, I've used 6+ wallets since then. thanks for that, good thing I have a recycle bin. I think satoshi said never delete a wallet because you never know when you might need it again.

[07-Oct-18 11:43 AM] ch6ris#5240
was a terrible idea to give them money in the first place IMO.

[07-Oct-18 11:45 AM] CHMEX#0686

[07-Oct-18 09:46 PM] riseandfall#3726
on one side, i'm realy wondering if what he describes as the GHOST-DAG has not some common points with KMD dPOW technology.

[07-Oct-18 09:49 PM] riseandfall#3726
i think he quoted komodo....

[07-Oct-18 09:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/ghostdag/ is this the right transcript? I can't find the quote

[07-Oct-18 09:53 PM] riseandfall#3726
Am i getting crazy or one of the best Doctor in decentralized world is working to define a protocol that KMD makes running already for few years ??

I wish he would do an Aviv coin to experiment for his CS department

[07-Oct-18 09:55 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and create stuff on it

[08-Oct-18 12:42 AM] riseandfall#3726
it's not Komodo he says. I said bullshit i think.

[08-Oct-18 12:43 AM] riseandfall#3726
I think i well understood his protocol and doesn't matter...you know why ? Because Komodo is better principle 😃

Somebody will be live-streaming a 51% attack on the cryptocurrency "Einsteinium" on October 13. This should be interesting to watch. https://t.co/u1Pi7TQ2dl

Most people don't understand what a 51% attack is, much less the difference between a double spend attack and a 51% attack (which is as simple as renting on NiceHash). I hope Jackson actually reads some of this document and teaches people: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1049146245376180225

@PTYX @grewalsatinder  woudl this be good idea to make 51% attack as presentation test over coins that already added dpow? to show it works ->  a live stream maybe ?

[08-Oct-18 06:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In my views it should be a good idea... 🤔

[08-Oct-18 06:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but lets wait for EMC2 guys

[08-Oct-18 06:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that must be interesting results

[08-Oct-18 08:18 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually if you make a series of "51% how to" you gain 2 things: 1. you share how to protect using dpow 2. you educate people how to make 51% - so that they use it more often and more often other projects come to KMD to get protection :trollface:

[08-Oct-18 08:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also making a list of 5!1% enabled coins is good idead - to make people (or actually CEXes?) buying those coins aware these are risky

[08-Oct-18 08:26 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
CEXes aware of the issue can either extend confirmation times or ask coin devs to make changed like dpow or delist the actual shitcoin

everyone https://medium.com/@EthAdvisor/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e - tweet and share this news. A Komodoplatform ecosystem project lead by Veruscoin lead-dev Mike Toutonghi solved one of the biggest problems in crypto. Interesting read on how " Mike solved in a month (using CC) what others and the rest of crypto world couldnt in all these years" - like jl777 expressed his view on this big step.
