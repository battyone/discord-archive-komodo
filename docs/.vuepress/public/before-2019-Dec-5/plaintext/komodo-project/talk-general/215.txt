@benohanlon does that mean, that the Amazon Komodo partnership news is officially out now? it has been known for a while, but kept mostly under wraps.

@taco Bezos is not going to talk about it. that would be too much to ask

what determines how often notary nodes do commits on btc chain? do they decide together?

[23-Feb-19 12:15 AM] SHossain#0007
iguana decides that

[23-Feb-19 12:16 AM] SHossain#0007
every ~10 minutes

[23-Feb-19 12:18 AM] Gawain#7858
if fees get too expensive, and komodo reward isn't enough to compensate, couldn't they slow down if they wanted to?

[23-Feb-19 12:25 AM] Markus#5464
dpow use btc from the kmd ico to fuel dpow costs if im not mistaken

[23-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Gawain#7858
I was just curious of how the system will balance it. I'm worried about KMD accumulating to notaries who then can use the KMD to vote themselves in forever. Since there's a fixed number of them, at high profit they have no reaosn to sell

[23-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Gawain#7858
like if mining profitability goes up, other miners can enter, and then profitability goes down, so it naturally corrects so profitability/accumulation is minimal, as miners have to sell most coins over time to cover costs which helps distribution

[23-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Markus#5464
enough if ur rich enough to buy a few mil kmd and u can possibly vote urself in election into multiple regions

[23-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Gawain#7858
i'm just curious about dpow itself, not specifically this specific network

[23-Feb-19 12:33 AM] Markus#5464
i think best person to answer this would be JL

[23-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Gawain#7858
personally I love the idea of such commits for doubel spend protection, just trying to get the rest of it down

[23-Feb-19 12:49 AM] Gawain#7858
I been thinking about this for so long on how to have kmd level certainty on checkpoints without the whole PoS type deal. and maybe the answer is simulated pow

[23-Feb-19 12:52 AM] Gawain#7858
what if instead of determining irreversible commits via a majority consensus of fixed set of "miners", it was determined by anyone in every bitcoin block with the weight measured by amount of bitcoin they burned, and consensus for childchain looks for chain with the largest burn per bitcoin block

[23-Feb-19 12:54 AM] Gawain#7858
burn miners can still batch tx to burn together and save on space, they could leave if got too expensive, could join if profitable, they get rewarded on child chain via rewards of that chain so incentives somewhat aligned still. a burn consensus attack would require someone to burn coins for long time until they run out of finite money, just like in pow

[23-Feb-19 12:55 AM] Gawain#7858
they can't double spend because the result of each block is set in bitcoin-quality-stone, it's not most accumulated burn, it's most burn per block

[23-Feb-19 12:56 AM] Gawain#7858
if bitcoin gets reorg, it would ofc unfinalize those child chain blocks as well and be based on whatever commits end up on new bitcoin chain

[23-Feb-19 12:59 AM] Gawain#7858
burn can include both miner fees and burn addresses for total cost which is what matters

[23-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Gawain#7858
since checkpoints would then be safe, the in between checkpoint blocks could be produced with even basic proof of stake. if PoS emission <<  PoB emission, and PoB people have real costs so can't just hold onto stake easily, PoS shouldn't influence the real consensus (PoB) and can handle chain propagation between commits.

[23-Feb-19 01:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
DPoW doesn‚Äôt burn,  and if people want to accumulate millions of coins to assure a position nothing can stop them ,  also someone without any coins can win too

[23-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Gawain#7858
well, what I liked about it is it kinda does, by paying bitcoin fees

[23-Feb-19 01:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not to a burn address

[23-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Gawain#7858
yeah, it's not an ideal flexible burn. main problem for me is stake determines who is notary, notaries get paid in stake, notaries have (almost) no reason to sell stake so over time influence grows, and notaries are pretty important since they can invalidate PoW miners on childchain by only notarizing blocks they mine very cheaply.

[23-Feb-19 01:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notaries can‚Äôt invalidate PoW miners

[23-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Gawain#7858
notaries can be pow miners so they can validate shorter chain

[23-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Gawain#7858
where they are sole miners

[23-Feb-19 01:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[23-Feb-19 01:59 AM] Gawain#7858
pretty sure I read in interview even jl confirmed they can control block production (could be wrong)

[23-Feb-19 02:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The are just nodes on the network,  don‚Äôt think a couple cpu cores will do anything to preferentially mine blocks on 3rd party chains.  I‚Äôm a notary node. Regenerating fees > burning fees.   Because Math. To fully lock down open notary spots every year an entity or consortium would need 60 million or so KMD,  and notaries have costs and spend much time on doing work for the system they deserve to be rewarded and with a maximum reward of 25-30k  Komodo a year per notary before server costs ,  notaries account for only for 30% ish of the coin generation a year most is done through the reward mechanism.   Notaries have no part in 3rd party block production, only in KMD block production.

[23-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Gawain#7858
I agree with that, but it's not about deserve but about decentralization of control. if notaries can pick which fork between commits is real one, they can pick where their rasberry pi can mine all the blocks eventually, so they would get all the rewards, as opposed to much of the rewards, and thus be very hard to fire over time even faster. they can't double spend, but they could for example censor their chain and child chain, front run, and so on, all for little to no cost other than bitcoin fees. if those fees were higher, then they would eventually run out of money and someone else would easily take over, stake excludes people without stake, but PoW and PoB are permissionless so anyone can compete and money runs out.

[23-Feb-19 02:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notaries don‚Äôt pick

[23-Feb-19 02:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You are making a bunch of assumptions on false premises

[23-Feb-19 02:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They literally don't choose anything.

[23-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gawain#7858
either notaries pick and thus use bitcoin security or they don't pick and kmd isn't using bitcoin security. why can't notaries pick?

[23-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Don King#8901
Some notaries also pay % to their Voters in NN elections, KMD whales electing themselves is less likely, more likely they spread their whale votes over lots of good candidates who bring skills into the community

[23-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Gawain#7858
if there are two equally long forks, who gets to decide which one gets commited to btc?

[23-Feb-19 02:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The 3rd party network

[23-Feb-19 02:11 AM] Gawain#7858
?

[23-Feb-19 02:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notaries on non-KMD chains are just regular nodes,  they just do a recording so deep reorganization can‚Äôt happen

[23-Feb-19 02:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
TL;DR - They get easier mining % for certain durations of time.  They follow the same consensus rules.  When they find a block they write and  include the notarization transaction, when a miner finds a block it doesn't.

[23-Feb-19 02:13 AM] Gawain#7858
i'm only concerned about kmd + btc, not child chains (not saying kmd has this issue but this is design)

[23-Feb-19 02:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They just include the "data hash" in their transactions to be notarized.

[23-Feb-19 02:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kinda funny one sec, there was an attack today on emc2 again,  let me pull up the info and show how it works

[23-Feb-19 02:14 AM] Gawain#7858
they can mine blocks only on their own blocks (i.e. finding block) and then include notarizations only for the chain with only their blocks

[23-Feb-19 02:14 AM] Gawain#7858
in other words, miners choose what block they mine on

[23-Feb-19 02:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Youre assuming they have any control over the notary node other than following protocol.

[23-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Gawain#7858
i'm assuming nobody else will have any idea if they are following protocol, maybe they just didn't see the longest chain yet

[23-Feb-19 02:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
https://chainz.cryptoid.info/emc2/orphans.dws

[23-Feb-19 02:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They won't be able to mine a separate chain secretly or intentionally with their node consensus rules.  It doesn't work like you're inferring.  Someone like Duke or JL will have to explain WHY.  I am not tech versed enough to do so.

[23-Feb-19 02:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Glad you're asking tho Gawain.  The more people that ask questions like this... the more people that can understand what's really going on at a deeper level.

[23-Feb-19 02:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because the secret mines chain can‚Äôt be notarized because notaries can‚Äôt see it to notarize it

[23-Feb-19 02:17 AM] Gawain#7858
I'm assuming they have their own miners too, separate from just notarizing

[23-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gawain#7858
but secret mine chain is done by the notaries, just maybe from another computer for example so they can see it and reveal

Enough notaries colluding , so 90% + because you are randomly selected as one of 13 to do a notarization

[23-Feb-19 02:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[23-Feb-19 02:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes that‚Äôs understandable,  but there is a big difference between practical attack and theory though.  If a practical vulnerability is found we would be working on fixing it right away

[23-Feb-19 02:39 AM] Gawain#7858
i just think it's a little backwards. for decentralization you need permissionlessness at base layer and avoiding mechanisms centralizing control over time. bitcoin has that through permissionless PoW and high sunk costs. then you have notaries who are permissioned. and then you have on chain PoW which depends on notaries giving them permission. if you flip last two, you have permissionless bitcoin, permissionless notaries (PoB), and then the less important blocks which can be chosen by permissionless notaries. it's really not a big difference from current system to implement, but security & sustaining decentralization much better.

[23-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Gawain#7858
like a central party or a self-appointed federation might also not want to attack necessarily, but issue is you want unlimited independent parties in control so issue is with a fixed number and how stake funds being elected which funds more stake over time.  I think checkpointing to btc has HUGE potential for sidechains, better than merge mining imo

[23-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Gawain#7858
if something like kmd implemented eos/evm type flexibility, used bitcoin security, and didn't depend on fixed reinforcing set, I'd be in heaven

[23-Feb-19 02:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Normally mined  blocks are not permissioned. Veriblock is trying something like you are suggesting they spent 12x what we spent  having notarization be a free for all.  Blockstack is trying The burning method ,  but that just eats you notarization funds away and drives up the cost of your service

[23-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Gawain#7858
you don't need notarization funds though

[23-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Gawain#7858
block reward is those funds

[23-Feb-19 02:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And how would it get into btc then

[23-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Gawain#7858
if only 10 satoshi are burned in a block, rules still work

[23-Feb-19 02:49 AM] Gawain#7858
you can trade for btc

[23-Feb-19 02:50 AM] Gawain#7858
barterdex is good example. for kmd even easier since it watches btc - lock kmd in bitcoin-seeing-contract for specific price, when bitcoin funds get to seller, network sends kmd to address specified in btc payment
