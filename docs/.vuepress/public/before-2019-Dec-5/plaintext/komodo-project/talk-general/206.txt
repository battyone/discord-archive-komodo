@PTYX I’m talking to CryptoBridge about considering doing what you guys did with CoinBene.  

I’m going to pass it to Steve Lee if they are interested in pursuing it.  👍🏴☠️

[08-Feb-19 11:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@PTYX on GitHub there was a repo for “Chainpoint” I think, which was a way to link document hashes to BTC.   Tierion project does this currently.   Perhaps Komodo can find a solution as well.

[08-Feb-19 11:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just one more thing that Komodo could do as a feature that is other coins reasons for existence. 😜

all opreturn data on komodo chain is notarized automatically to BTC since the beginning

What about  a document proofing CC.   Could that be done?

[09-Feb-19 04:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Like notarizations.

[09-Feb-19 07:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Wait a few mins.  It may resolve then try again.

@Alecandro the best proof jl777 is not Satoshi is that Satoshi loved C++

to link document hashes to BTC there is also https://opentimestamps.org/ (a Peter Todd project I think)

OpenTimestamps: a timestamping proof standard
OpenTimestamps aims to be a standard format for blockchain timestamping. The format is flexible enough to be vendor and blockchain independent.

[09-Feb-19 10:00 AM] skitout#8659
currently used with BTC, but can be used with Komodo blockchain (with an anchoring every minute;  )

The idea for Chain Lizard sounds good, its like the shopify of blockchains. Is people from the AWS team working with you to create this or is it their own project, and will this affect Chainzilla?

[09-Feb-19 07:15 PM] PTYX#6840
Chainzilla uses those tools which makes our job easier

[09-Feb-19 08:06 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ah okay

[09-Feb-19 09:46 PM] PTYX#6840
I hope the Chain Lizard tool also generates value for Komodo

[09-Feb-19 09:47 PM] PTYX#6840

we just got in touch with the guy who made the game to let him know about KMDs 51% attack countermeasure. would be damn cool if we could "integrate dpow" into that card game. Our marketing team will try to arrange that for the next deck.

mm2 is in testing now, we are moving away from mm1

[11-Feb-19 06:26 AM] coingirl87#6489
That sounds good...any idea when mm2 will be ready? Not an exatly date but maybe month/ quarter?

[11-Feb-19 06:29 AM] coingirl87#6489
And what is different to mm1? Is there a comparison chart or graphic? That would be fine

[11-Feb-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is in testing now, so far it is doing well. it is restructured and able to run on mobile, improved networking and uses a more basic atomic swap now that all the coins support CLTV

[11-Feb-19 06:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok nice to hear.  I am excited about performance of mm2. In my opinion the biggest problem was the one with liquidity. Are there any plans how to solve that?

[11-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
with mm2, there is not much difference between alice and bob, so all nodes should automatically provide liquidity. basically all the trouble spots of mm1 are fixed with mm2

[11-Feb-19 09:10 AM] hastrup#8742
@wolfgang yes hodl :) if you have your funds in a t adresse you are fine. If they are in a z adresse you need to move them into a t address befor Feb 15 i believe

[11-Feb-19 09:24 AM] coingirl87#6489
Will there be also a new gui for mm2? The pld barter dex is cool but i think not very userfriedly 

The new mm2 combined with easy userfriendly gui will be like the first man on moon....a giant leap for mankind

[11-Feb-19 10:06 AM] wolfgang#3508
@hastrup   been hodling for 18months now. Im in kmd for the long hall. Just checking re: wallet updates t/z adresses

[11-Feb-19 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@coingirl87 I think for MM2 the komodo team will just design the engine and leave it up to third parties like hyperdex to create the bodywork for the DEX

[11-Feb-19 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@wolfgang just make sure you hold your KMD in a transparent address and you will be fine

[11-Feb-19 11:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok...maybe someone from hyper DEX team can give some update?

[11-Feb-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't say for hyper, but the original GUI will get a full update shortly after mm2 is user-ready

[11-Feb-19 11:49 AM] coingirl87#6489
You are in team of barter dex ui?

[11-Feb-19 11:49 AM] coingirl87#6489
Will it be also more user friendly like hyper dex?

[11-Feb-19 11:50 AM] coingirl87#6489
I like the gui from hyper dex...so easy to understand

[11-Feb-19 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
technically, there's never been an "official" "team" for "BarterDEX GUI"
That being said, yes I have been involved in it in the past and plan on resuming where I left off in the near future
As for "user friendly", no matter what the project, devs can't make "user friendly" changes if users refuse to give feedback about what is/isn't "friendly" (if you see something that needs changed, say something)

[11-Feb-19 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
\*"you" being general, not *you* specifically

[11-Feb-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
much of the non-"user friendly" bits of BarterDEX GUI are a direct result of
>this thing sux
>What exactly is wrong? What can we fix?
>It just sux
Nothing ever gets changed with feedback like that

[11-Feb-19 11:58 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok yes thats correct...i unterstand...maybe the inofficial team of barter dex should make a survey? Like i said...the hyper dex gui is very good...simple, not many buttons and a good layout

[11-Feb-19 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, what's "bad" about the layout of BarterDEX GUI?

[11-Feb-19 12:38 PM] wolfgang#3508

[11-Feb-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there *might* be, but as far as I know it's hard-coded to default
you should probably ask in #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel
