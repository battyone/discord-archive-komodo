steps to make new address etc there ‚òù

[07-Jun-19 07:52 AM] psalm#0481
And it won‚Äôt be compromised In the slightest?

[07-Jun-19 07:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Use Verus version of Agama, it doesn't use the compromised npm module.

Why doesn‚Äôt binance kmd wallet work?

[07-Jun-19 07:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
binance disabled because of the hack, they dont want to let hacker sell

[07-Jun-19 07:54 AM] psalm#0481
Sweet

[07-Jun-19 07:59 AM] psalm#0481
its this file right for a quick address or is there a better option? Agama-MacOS-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview.dmg

I made the transfer from old Agama to new version(v0.6.0), while I was in old version I noticed I had accrued a small amount of rewards but they did not make the transfer, any way to retrieve? I suppose they are gone now and only a very small amount but curious anyway

[07-Jun-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
just transfer it out

[07-Jun-19 08:16 AM] zeehenk#4990
Glad I keep everything on ledger... you guys are doing great work helping out the people who lost funds. Hope this will not dent the komodo spirit or reputation!

[07-Jun-19 08:20 AM] Stephen#5661
Thanks jl777c,  it showed zero balance before but went back and it was there, cool!

@zeehenk I think it will make Komodo Stronger.

Who may I refer to regarding a question to claiming reward on ledger?

[07-Jun-19 08:24 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Google search should give you a thread for it.

`Claiming KMD rewards on ledger`

[07-Jun-19 08:27 AM] zeehenk#4990
I know how to do it, but found a bug or something which I'd like to discuss... nothing mayor, but still....

[07-Jun-19 08:27 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I was wondering how you prevent bad actor/contributor in anonymous decentralized env, seems to be more secure is working in centralized not anon env - you know/see people and if they act to hurt you have some ways (from direct force to legal) to change/fix that

[07-Jun-19 08:29 AM] wl#4107
I just noticed that the fee paid on the last transaction ( hack ) in my agama wallet was the amount of KMD I had... What does that mean?

[07-Jun-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
not without 24/7 surveillance on all devs

[07-Jun-19 08:30 AM] zeehenk#4990
@FishyGuts I sent you a message about it. Hope you can help

[07-Jun-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to make a refund claim, you will need to make a transaction from the old address. for this you will need to login with the compromised privkey one last time. it wont matter which version you use as the privkey is already compromised

[07-Jun-19 08:34 AM] zeehenk#4990
When trying to claim rewards (latest chrome) I go through the motions, but if I wait to check the address/funds it gives me a timeout. Even after just a few seconds. If I just keep clicking without checking it works, but it doesn't feel right for me....

[07-Jun-19 08:34 AM] Malti#3948
was the hack actually aimed at KMD? or did we just happen to be the unlucky project that used the NPM module

@jl777 I noticed that the fee paid on the last transaction ( hack ) in my agama wallet was the amount of KMD I had... What does that mean?

[07-Jun-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it was most likely swept to the safu address

[07-Jun-19 08:37 AM] wl#4107
ok

[07-Jun-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
1191 addresses with 11746 utxos were swept

[07-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Monitor the seed collection point to see if the attacker accidentally uses compromised agama and steal back stolen funds

[07-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Camilo Lopez#8651
@jl777c so we have to make a transaction in the compromise wallet to where?

[07-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Zerkon21#3586
to make a refund claim, transaction from the old address? I mean how, it has 0 balance

[07-Jun-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
many are dust addresses, i will round down to the nearest KMD, so people will lose a fraction of a KMD, but this simplifies things a lot

[07-Jun-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i will send a special transaction to your compromised address. just enough to pay for txfee

[07-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Zerkon21#3586
ah ok, thx for clarifying

[07-Jun-19 08:41 AM] nocturnal#2177
hmmm balance showing as 0

[07-Jun-19 08:41 AM] nocturnal#2177
but wallet keeps crashing

[07-Jun-19 08:41 AM] nocturnal#2177
maybe it just needs to load

[07-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Camilo Lopez#8651
I installed the mobile version with the compromise keys and it open

[07-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Lumbi#8378

@jl777c  good morning, first of all many thanks for all you have done, in my wallet now i have zero kmd, and eventually i m not able to make a transaction. Which is the best way in order to claim the funds ?

[07-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg#3393
Bitpanda too!

[07-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
@istante fill out the claim form

[07-Jun-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
hacker probably used that photo

[07-Jun-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
can't be that stupid

[07-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Never underestimate poor OPSEC

[07-Jun-19 09:14 AM] istante#3749
@jl777c  already compiled the form. Is this enough at the moment?

[07-Jun-19 09:15 AM] nocturnal#2177
how can i fill out 'balance' on form? wallet wont load so cant see transactions. block explorer showing nothing

[07-Jun-19 09:15 AM] klein#5233
was stupid enough to not secure the seeds i suppose

[07-Jun-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. there are 891 addresses with less than 7777 swept. those will be processed first. if you have less than 7777, make sure you have submitted a claim ASAP. if you dont have a claim address, you will not be able to get a refund for obvious reasons

[07-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
May have needed to remain unsecured to freely collect passphrases

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don‚Äôt know

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] nocturnal#2177
@jl777c how long do we have? I have to work till sunday

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] nocturnal#2177
to make claim

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] nocturnal#2177
(i have less than 7777)

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I doubt they‚Äôll put an expiration on it

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] nocturnal#2177
says ASAP above

[07-Jun-19 09:16 AM] nocturnal#2177
that means time limit?

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Means they don‚Äôt want the hassle I‚Äôm sure

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] betterzen#2372
@jl777c Thank you for your hard work and great support in this case ! Great community !

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] istante#3749
More than 7777 swept, so i waiting for it?

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Otherwise the team is no better than the hacker @nocturnal

[07-Jun-19 09:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
they won't go through the trouble of saving your KMDs to then try to not pay them back to you because you could not go through reclaim process fast enough

[07-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs ‚Äúplease come get your coins because I really don‚Äôt want to be dealing with this for years on end‚Äù

[07-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Even though they will be :abusedsmily:

if you dont have your data submitted, it cant be processed

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it will need to be processed in the next batch

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
i cant submit it now the process is long and I cant access my wallet

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
but will do it sunday

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
thanks for the advice

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you just need a new secure address to submit the claim

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
the form requires balance etc

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
which i cant access

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs his last attack vector, claim process since hacker has keys too, good luck with that mess

[07-Jun-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can leave it 0, if you cant figure it out

[07-Jun-19 09:23 AM] nocturnal#2177
ok thanks

[07-Jun-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why we only do the undisputed addresses first

[07-Jun-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
gives more time for everyone to submit a claim

[07-Jun-19 09:23 AM] LocoMB#8593
umm.. how can I see a potential dispute?

[07-Jun-19 09:23 AM] LocoMB#8593
sry..

[07-Jun-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if your address is not in the first batch and it is < 7777, it is being disputed

[07-Jun-19 09:24 AM] LocoMB#8593
I often chatter before thinking

[07-Jun-19 09:24 AM] LocoMB#8593
sometimes that makes me look really smart and a quick thinker..
sometimes.. not..
