You wouldnt want to run into any 51% attacks, scaling problems, high tx fees or anything like that in the future right? :Komodo:

GLX is an ICO on a Komodo chain. Why wasn‚Äôt the ICO promoted? What is the reason that there is no GLX-channel here?

I think they are still testing, not sure if their ico is already officially underway

Hi all - does somebody have a link to the Agama wallet for OSX? The link on the KMD website doesn't seem to work

Hi @gzezo All existing utxos will still operate under the old rules. Changes in rewards claiming will only affect new utxo created after the activation height of 1 million.

Hi, my name is Alvin (Managing Director of T.C.P.A. Consultancy), and I‚Äôm currently in the process of founding a new tech-marketing startup that will make use of blockchain to facilitate transactions on the platform (that still needs to be developed) and use a dICO for the (initial) funding. Can someone on here tell me what are the (initial + yearly) expected costs for creating and running a sidechain on Komodo?

[29-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Hermes#6934
If you need a full service to launch a DICO you can contact our ecosystem developers Chainmakers and Chainzilla  at support@chainmakers.co or hello@chainzilla.io / www.chainmakers.co , www.chainzilla.io

[29-Aug-18 10:06 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
Thanks for the info, will do then!

[29-Aug-18 10:08 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
@Hermes do you by any chance know how I can buy KMD using a iPad? Because to download for example BarterDEX you need a Mac

[29-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Hermes#6934
Haven't tried Hyperdex in an IPad but its Barterdex with a customized GUI and it is optimized for quicker trades. At least on Mac you need 2 cores to able to handle Bdex not sure about Hyperdex

[29-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Hermes#6934
since they use the same marketmaker program my guess it wouldn't work

[30-Aug-18 12:05 AM] jspook16#3059
Are you trying to buy kmd with crypto? (BTC etc)

[30-Aug-18 12:07 AM] jspook16#3059
You could probably get to shapeshift from an ipad and get it that way

How can Komodo take advantage of the Venezuela inflation debacle and jump in front of Dash?

[30-Aug-18 12:22 AM] Tommyboy50#3199
hey quick question, would be much appreciated if anyone could help as Im about as tech savvy as a potato. I want to update the wallet as requested, but it's not working for me.I've tried to redownload the wallet but it takes forever, then says download failed. As I already have agama wallet, do I need to redownload the whole thing again or is it possible to just change a file in the original directory?

[30-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@BoBot-BUY KMD  like the coin shows undefined?

anyone know how frequent the rewards are paid out to DEX coin holders along with Supernet coin holders? I think I have held those for 9 months now and never got any payouts

[30-Aug-18 05:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
once it accumulates approx 1 mio USD in Revenue

[30-Aug-18 05:23 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
is there a place to check past payouts?

[30-Aug-18 05:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
What this means is that there will be three different December 25th revshares:
9850 KMD to REVS, approx 0.00853268 KMD per REVS
62351.99718 KMD to SUPERNET, approx 0.12893765 per SUPERNET
124648.00282 KMD to CRYPTO, approx 0.19439150 per CRYPTO

[30-Aug-18 05:28 AM] CHMEX#0686
Currently the asset that has constant high revenue is CRYPTO ( Notarizations)

[30-Aug-18 05:29 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
so around once a year

[30-Aug-18 05:30 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
ok cool , also had a question about the rebranding, are you guys changing the name Komodo as well

[30-Aug-18 05:31 AM] CHMEX#0686

[30-Aug-18 05:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@BoBot-BUY KMD Did you restart Barterdex after adding?

[30-Aug-18 05:49 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea

[30-Aug-18 05:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to close app, delete `Cache` folder in `%appdata%/barterdex` and start it again

TEL is an ERC20. On a Komodo chain, the project would be more useful.
