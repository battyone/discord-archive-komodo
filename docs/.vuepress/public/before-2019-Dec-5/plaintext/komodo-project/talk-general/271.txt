[19-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Timo#5756
I would like to talk about the Komodo Oracle. Is there someone from the dev team open for a discussion?

[19-Apr-19 11:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@jl777c

[19-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[19-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
@Timo what questions do you have

[19-Apr-19 11:41 AM] Timo#5756
On the article about komodo oracles vs. other oracle projects, it says there is a flaw on how they are build. I find it hard comparing the komodo oracle to something like Chainlink. Do they both serve they same use cases? Based on the article from komodo, it seems like it's for price-feed only

[19-Apr-19 11:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've used one to track a dog.

[19-Apr-19 11:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and have a few for tracking vote stats, notaristaion, coin migrations etc - http://oracle.earth/sh_vote_graph/

[19-Apr-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
chainlink uses data aggregation, which is the level that our oracles CC is for

[19-Apr-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
to get a trustless oracle, you need to do something like what we do and it would apply for anything that has an online data source

[19-Apr-19 11:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
stuff i've done was befre KMD oracles were upgraded to trustless

[19-Apr-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as use cases go, there is room for both trusted, aggregated and trustless oracles

[19-Apr-19 11:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but working on upgrades

[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Timo#5756
Yeah I would get into the trustelss/decentralization part when comparing it to Chainlink. Aggregation is only one component for securing the network. The other two big parts are stake and reputation

[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and something wont be so easy to make a trustless oracle for due to lack of freely available online data source

[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Timo#5756
Why do you think Chainlink is not secure enough/not trustless (enough)?

[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
stake and reputation add detection and disincentives, but doesnt prevent an attacker

[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
as i said chainlink and oracles CC are sufficient in many cases

[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the betsize dwarves the value of the stake, then it is not a deterrent, is it?

[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if the attacker is patient and builds up reputation over months or years, it doesnt prevent that, does it?

[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
things are on a spectrum

[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
there are no absolutes

[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Timo#5756
How does it not prevent an attacker? Reputation raises the weight of the people acting honest and want to earn money. On the long term, raising your reputaiton brings you more 'jobs' and thus more income through the node. An attacker would have to 'farm' reputation for a long while to even consider attacking and maybe losing his stake

[19-Apr-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
what if he is betting 10x or 100x the value of the stake/reputation?

[19-Apr-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
this model caps the entire at risk amount to the value of the stake, but there is no way to measure off chain bets

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Timo#5756
"Betsize higher then stake", how would that happen? If I as a dApp developer could set the stake the nodes have to have, for providing my dApp with their data, I can have it always higher than the value behind it

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so the stake/reputation systems work quite well, until it doesnt

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
offchain betting

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say I make a bet with you about next years world cup, we happen to be both billionaries, so we bet a billion dollars sidebet,

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Timo#5756
It's about onchain for now. Offchain is not a thing yet. Chainlink didn't build into that direction yet. Main use case is onchain

[19-Apr-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but you cant stop offchain

[19-Apr-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is offchain

[19-Apr-19 11:49 AM] Timo#5756
So when it's about onchain, you would say reputation and staking is more secure/ secure enough?

[19-Apr-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and offchain bets can and will influence onchain, you certainly cant guarantee that nobody would ever make sidebets offchain
