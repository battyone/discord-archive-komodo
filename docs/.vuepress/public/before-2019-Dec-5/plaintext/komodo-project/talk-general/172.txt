in bitcoin you have to wait 6 confirms (1 hr) for a tx to be valid

[11-Jan-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
Komodo and all assetchains has dPoW Conf which is available throguh Agama and CLI. Just wait for conf to be more that 1. That means the tx is immune to 51% attack and can't be double spent

[11-Jan-19 03:06 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Who is confirming?

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
each block confirms the previous block
in komodo, these are 'rawconfirmations' and 'confirmations' never exceed '1' until notarized

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Ah, so around 10 minutes.

[11-Jan-19 03:10 PM] garbonzo607#4659
So why are elections needed? Is being a notary that subjective? It's the subjectivity I don't like. Easier to target.

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So why are elections needed? `
In a word:
decentralization

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get better operators :trollface:

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
elections = not all notaries are friends that some centralized entity picked for you

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Because "better" is subjective?

[11-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
better as in does more for the ecosystem

[11-Jan-19 03:14 PM] garbonzo607#4659
This can all be gamed though. Psychological warfare, etc. Nothing is as it seems. This is why I prefer verifiable facts.

[11-Jan-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This is why I prefer verifiable facts.`
And yet your last hr + has been spent in fantasyland

[11-Jan-19 03:15 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Haha 😊

[11-Jan-19 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang `in bitcoin you have to wait 6 confirms (1 hr) for a tx to be valid` that is just a rule-of-thumb, not a "real" rule, not codified in BTC internals code. Just makes certain things very very unlikely

[11-Jan-19 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh we've all seen 1 BTC block take over 2 hrs

[11-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Arboreal#3777
yea especially in January

[11-Jan-19 04:02 PM] Arboreal#3777
TONS of unconfirmed tx

[11-Jan-19 04:10 PM] jorian#4555
how is chickenpool going, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[11-Jan-19 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a whole lot of meh

[11-Jan-19 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with the updates, I decided to take it down to update/upgrade and now I'm not happy with any of the code 😛

[11-Jan-19 04:13 PM] jorian#4555
haha. you're a true developer

[11-Jan-19 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or a true basket-case of OCD :trollface:

[11-Jan-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$4k a year for servers no one is using while I do all these edits/mods locally 😕

[11-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Arboreal#3777
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what are you hosting on these servers lol

[11-Jan-19 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 is literally an empty Ubuntu server and the other 2 are  just running 3 daemons

[11-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Arboreal#3777
ahh okay I see

[11-Jan-19 04:18 PM] Arboreal#3777
try hosting nodes or staking something on them haha, not sure it will cover all 4k though

[11-Jan-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the pool was on the one that is now empty

[11-Jan-19 04:18 PM] D3b0#9761
hi, i sent 120kmd on exchange
how long i must wait for 20 confirmations  cca?

[11-Jan-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
recovering the cost isn't the issue as much as I was just pointing out that the servers were ready for me, but I'm not ready for them 😛

[11-Jan-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how long i must wait for 20 confirmations `
19 blocks after 1 notarization

gonna have a payday soon, any projects other than Komodo I need to get?

[11-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Arboreal#3777
(already have the fattest bag of Komodo)

[11-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Arboreal#3777
@Deleted User nice, is it trading on big exchanges?

[11-Jan-19 04:32 PM] cw#1047
@Arboreal I like ChiliZ, as far as meme coins go it looks like it could have legs

[11-Jan-19 04:33 PM] cw#1047
And ResDEX as a competitor to BarterDEX

[11-Jan-19 04:33 PM] cw#1047
Haha don't we all

[11-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Arboreal#3777
I have never even heard about Barterdex

[11-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Arboreal#3777
only DEX I heard of is IDEX

I get that. Was just countering a point about 10 min notarization lag for KMD confirmations

crypto dead?

[11-Jan-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
Countermeasures. All of the attacks we discuss in this paper can be prevented by using deterministic ECDSA nonce generation [29], which is already
implemented in the default Bitcoin and Ethereum libraries.

[11-Jan-19 06:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok relief 😃

[11-Jan-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
seems only signatures that were vulnerable were mostly from years ago using some multisig app, a few that were likely manual tests. but yes, if you botch any part of the signing, it is bad news indeed

"only marketing matters" if you want to make quick money and escape with that 😃

[11-Jan-19 07:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and this might be the reason 99% of us are here

[11-Jan-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i would put the percentage much lower

[11-Jan-19 07:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
regarding apps -  you think is doable to build decentralized email ?

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, is this needed?

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well I was thinking it is nice idea to have an email that cannot be just shut down or closed by anyone

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there is already a decentralized chat made in #kmdlabs, email is very similar

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I know hush started chat

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
just add encryption layer on top

[11-Jan-19 07:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
hush ng

[11-Jan-19 07:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think this is also a background for decentralized social media, chat -> email -> forums -> social media

[11-Jan-19 07:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not sure how about file storage ?

[11-Jan-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is possible, but the blockchain capacity at scale would require a lot of chains in a cluster

[11-Jan-19 07:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and information is stored on blockchain or ?

[11-Jan-19 07:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
can information be stored temporarly "elsewhere" and user just receive a "key" on the blockchain ?

[11-Jan-19 07:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idk how storj or other projects work exactly

[11-Jan-19 07:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to avoid permanent storage of files that no need permanence ?

[11-Jan-19 07:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe having CC storage could be "paid per period" - memory released after time paid with say 1 GB/year / 0.01BTC expired

[11-Jan-19 07:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I no nothing how this tech works, so sorry if sounds stupid 😃

[11-Jan-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
how would you handle attachments?

[11-Jan-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
large attachments

[11-Jan-19 07:37 PM] SHossain#0007
limit size?

[11-Jan-19 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idk I imagine a system of information validation as separate to actual information container. So even email txt could be stored outside of blockchiain,

[11-Jan-19 07:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
So blockchain I see sth that validates information access, and some other "system" that stores data, not permanent

[11-Jan-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
sure, just send a decryption key to an encrypted ipfs hash

[11-Jan-19 07:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the big question you ask is "is it needed"

[11-Jan-19 07:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as in the article linked - question how many users globally would use that, and who are they

[11-Jan-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 @blackjok3r created a proof of concept for something he calls a "streamer chain". It's a permissioned blockchain that allows the creator to upload files to it. Combine that with dpow, and you have a powerful tool

[11-Jan-19 07:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not many people can appreciate new tools

[11-Jan-19 07:44 PM] jorian#4555
it doesn't solve a problem (yet)

[11-Jan-19 07:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
month ago I read how CIA failed with encrypted messanger and exposed thousands of agents to death

[11-Jan-19 07:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so I guess secret agents are target group here 😛

[11-Jan-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian it has limited practical use cases IMO

[11-Jan-19 07:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
plus any group that requires trusted communication (politicians, presidents, CEO's)

[11-Jan-19 07:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it will start as sth "elite"

[11-Jan-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
BTC wasn't designed for file storage. There are better methods such as IPFS

[11-Jan-19 07:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
which is good - Apple product are "elite" = expensive

[11-Jan-19 07:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok so BTC + SPV + IPFS + encryption = android mobile decentralized email with attachments ? 😃

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for politicians, agents, journalists

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
no needto use BTC for this

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
too expensive

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
just use a low value chain

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
BTC = replaced with anything else

[11-Jan-19 07:49 PM] Alright#0419
An example of a good use for a streamer chain is something we hope to make for LABS. If all goes well, we'll have a "meta" chain that has every single chain that ever existed in the cluster for history purposes

[11-Jan-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
the way LABS works, it's possible to lose portions of it's history if all copies of a given fungible chain cease to exist

[11-Jan-19 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
some fungible chains will be one time use, so it's important to us that these chains don't just become a block box of "some coins went in, some coins came out"

[11-Jan-19 07:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think 2 apps like chat and email if made nicely for mobile with default privacy would get attraction from human rights and privacy groups

[11-Jan-19 07:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idk how IPFS actually works? is it period-based paid temporary storage?

[11-Jan-19 08:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it looks like actually IPFS allows "decentralized internet" which cannot be banned

[11-Jan-19 08:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if it was only joined by network of decentrazlied CPUs and maybe RAM memory ?

[11-Jan-19 08:12 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
there would exist decentralzied services that could not be banned by anyone
