sweet I copied the tx. One final question @Deleted User,  I did move one of the asset chains to my new wallet (that was not moved by the sweep). Will this disrupt anything? Can I move any other asset chains that still reside within my compromised wallet?

[07-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Crypt0Fin#6366
thx for the info

The https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview wallet is good and safe to generate a new address and use to send?

First of all thanks for securing the funds Komodo Team! I would like to suggest some changes regarding the claiming, which is currently necessary monthly and is as we can see a risk for the funds.
1. Switch back to yearly (or lesser) claiming in order to avoid that in a security breach many users are in danger. I am an example of a person that only had to be secured because I had to claim.
Of course I unterstand the incentive to have active users, but this also opposes risk as we have seen.
2. Another option is to make ot possible to claim from another address. Some kind of delegating, so if Address A with coins delegates the claim right to B, B can claim but A always gets the funds. In that case we would not have to log into the account withs funds monthly.
3. Create a minimal wallet with as less dependencies as posssible that get's security reviewed and that does not need to get online. That wallet could create an offline transaction to claim and does not need to get updated as often.
Maybe these suggestions can help @komodoteam @jl777c

verus wallet created an unusable address for me. after install. i sync'd the verus chain overnight. rebooted. wallet had a diff address that worked. sync'd kmd chain and blocks were loaded for that as well. now everything is working in native. I refuse to use lite mode again.

@Jimm B. wow, imagine being a unlucky person whos been told to delete eveything regarding agama from their system. imagine if someones binned the seed too

[07-Jun-19 05:25 PM] skerberus#7584
I personally would add a 4th step for refunding: Sending the 0.0001 KMD to the Komodo Team address to make sure that people have the private key for the new address saved for sure

[07-Jun-19 05:29 PM] madjester#0881
@skerberus a little late for that maybe... since it would take another 0.0001 KMD to pay the TX fee

[07-Jun-19 05:29 PM] skerberus#7584
yup, you are right

it is being recommended that you mave your funds to the Verus coin Agama version.

@load you have the funds in your own address
1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview 
2) It is safe
3) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
4) Note down the address
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
6) If you face "electrum error", "connection error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
7) Uninstall the old version of agama and don't run it again. But please keep a backup of your old(compromised) seed, wif, privkey or anyother way you used to Access your old wallet. See the following article to backup your old access method: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024424-how-to-secure-your-wallet-seed-private-keys-wallet-dat-file

@actionslacks if it was for CHIPS, yes the Verus Agama didn't recognise the address
but it should work fine for other coins
thats why we made this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029965-moving-chips-to-a-new-address

[07-Jun-19 05:58 PM] load#7208
@gcharang  Was this just for KMD or even for other crypto? perchedentro agama I also have DGB.

[07-Jun-19 05:59 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang Do I still need to do this? ATTN the users who had assetchains swept to safe address and used refund address of exchange on the claim form since day 1, please DM me with the following details only.
```
- The Discord ID / email you provided on the claim form
- The exchange address you used for assetchains
- The new address that you want to receive assetchains back (you must own the seed / private key (WIF) for that address)
```
Any users with ONLY KMD claim and provided exchange address, doesn't have to do anything.

[07-Jun-19 05:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@load you have to search the address on DGB explorer to see if the funds are still there
don't open the old agama
then use the verus agama or other wallets to transfer funds to a new wallet(seed)

[07-Jun-19 06:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@shu-aib did  the KMD team move the coins from assetchains from your addresses? did you submit an exchange address for tham as the claim address?

[07-Jun-19 06:01 PM] load#7208
yes .. in my wallet I have all the funds .. ok thanks a lot for the info

[07-Jun-19 06:03 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang My coins was already moved from my Agama. I submitted a Coinomi address. Which is where I sent the small amount to from the special transaction received. Also the receive address submitted on the form

[07-Jun-19 06:04 PM] gcharang#6833
this is about other assetchain coins
like BOTS, BET etc.,

[07-Jun-19 06:05 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang the tiny amount sent is now in the Coinomi wallet 0.0001

[07-Jun-19 06:07 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang is all still good with what I‚Äôve done so far? So now I just wait?

[07-Jun-19 06:09 PM] gcharang#6833
@shu-aib you only own KMD on agama and no other coin correct?

[07-Jun-19 06:12 PM] ecbuddy#8524

[07-Jun-19 06:24 PM] angrygnat#7242
asked in support too, to send the amount from the old address to the new one, can i enter in the old address with new version of agama? Is it safe?

[07-Jun-19 06:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@angrygnat yes you can enter the old seed in Verus Agama
it is safe
but don't use that old address as receiving address in the future

[07-Jun-19 06:26 PM] angrygnat#7242
no, sure. but for the claim process i need it, or not?

@gcharang the other coins were probably all air drops but the KMD is most important for me to recover. I‚Äôm not sure how to handle those

[07-Jun-19 06:32 PM] JimD#9272
How many coins did hackers get ahold of before KMD team cut them off ?

[07-Jun-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
we are still trying to assess this

[07-Jun-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
current estimate is 1 million, but with a big +/- factor

[07-Jun-19 06:34 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, in other discords people are posting stuff that says 1 million but sounds like its not settled yet

[07-Jun-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
until all the claims are in and we analyze each one, we wont have a clear idea

[07-Jun-19 06:34 PM] JimD#9272
Its somewhat annoying cause they make it sound like KMD is trying to cover up when we just don't know yet

[07-Jun-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimated 1 million based on the initial data and the fact that 90% of the people whose funds moved ended up in the sweep address

[07-Jun-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
some trolls make it sound like we shouldnt have rescued the funds

[07-Jun-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but i know for sure when people think the hacker got their funds they are very sad, but when they find out we rescued it, they are much happier. In 100% of the cases, so i dont care at all what the trolls are saying

[07-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it would help if everyone posted the sane point of view on this to social media

[07-Jun-19 06:40 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Btw, HyperDEX is showing as an empty wallet.  But When we use the  Verus Agama 0_5_6, the  balance is there.
