I'm just confused by the ambiguity of the question/statement. Which coin? is the 's' meant to indicate plural or possessive? Why no question mark?
Most likely it was simply a meta-koan, to be contemplated, and to contemplate the contemplation.

What is most common way you accept crypto?
do you copy paste address all the time? and does that makes you uncomfortable?

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.

I just read James's article on decentralized trustless oracles, I think the correct port of the price feed site is 8050, not 8080 (http://159.69.45.70:8050/ and not http://159.69.45.70:8080/ - as stated in article)

@NutellaLicka I am told its 5% APR not 5%/month

[22-Apr-19 10:55 PM] crumb#2550

[22-Apr-19 10:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Apologies, my explanation was written poorly. Yes, 5% APR but it has to be claimed every month. It will stop acruing after 1 month of inactivity.

[22-Apr-19 10:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah lol thats how it was explained to me too so i thought it was 5%/month. but its not. Better to margin trade it

The example link from James article still needs fixing. It currently leads to 159.69.49.70:8080 instead of the correct address 159.69.45.70:8050. Note that beside the port error, '49' should be '45'. Note also that the text of the link and where the link actually points are different and both incorrect (as far as I can tell).

what steps did you take and what happened?

Clicked the vote button on desktop, entered my seed, it opened the map and was just spinning, never stopped spinning and nothing happened. Tried 3 times. Was able to send transaction of KMd to myself so I know I had a connection
