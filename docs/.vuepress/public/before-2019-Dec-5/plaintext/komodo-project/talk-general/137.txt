kmd notaries have 75% network hashrate so an attacker has to be able to control 26% of notaries and 25% of hashrate . Notary operators are elected publicly , so Notaries operator likely won't risk the chance üòÑ

[27-Nov-18 04:54 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if btc hashrate goes to shit , then KMD can notarize to Verus chain or any other more secure chains

Here is a little explanation from our devs on how DPOW works https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024853-dpow-security-explained-/en

[27-Nov-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD can change to notarize on whatever chain has the highest hashrate. if BTC dies, then BTC2 will be used. doesnt affect KMD in any permanent way if BTC hashrate goes down

[27-Nov-18 11:40 AM] wookie#7663
Just wondering: are there any thoughts or plans for kmd in the upcoming STOs / securities tokens arena?

@wookie i just had a chat with @Steve Lee yesterday and I explained to him the need to create non-fungible security tokens.

[27-Nov-18 01:21 PM] PTYX#6840
I believe that jl777 said these could be created via CC or some other mechanism. So it's most likely coming.

Hi great news. So question: asics equijash miners will to be allowed to mine veruscoin also?ty

[27-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hey @Deleted User

[27-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to ask in their discord channel to be safe: https://discord.gg/YTc4dk

[27-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or alternatively try #talk-mining or #verus

[27-Nov-18 03:54 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
Is the update for Agama wallet and kmd only or does it affect every coin in Agama wallet?

[27-Nov-18 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Nov-18 04:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
So is it true in saying the main exchanges with KMD wallets are going to be down for nearly about 3 weeks total(including the days they've already been down)?

[27-Nov-18 04:18 PM] justpip#5610
The upcoming hard fork. Do KMD holders get a forked coin?

[27-Nov-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there will just be one KMD post-fork

[27-Nov-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
ledger will presumably update in time

[27-Nov-18 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@zeehenk We will contact Ledger to update once the source is ready. They updated within time frame when we requested last time. Hopefully, it will be same this time.

[27-Nov-18 05:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe @jl777c can take a look when there is time

[27-Nov-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
holdings havent changed much, NAV is dropped a lot due to bear, barterDEX is showing about 17 KMD price

[27-Nov-18 05:59 PM] chagidel#6952
any information statistics on the cpu mining performance  ?

[27-Nov-18 06:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"cpu mining performance" of?

[27-Nov-18 06:16 PM] chagidel#6952
saw them mention better performance with cpu after the u√•date

[27-Nov-18 06:16 PM] chagidel#6952
update

[27-Nov-18 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
That performance is mostly for sending private transaction

[27-Nov-18 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
sapling private transactions are faster than sprout.

[27-Nov-18 06:53 PM] DRC#7445
how does the upgrade and fork effect agama wallets, will we need to update again? thanks

[27-Nov-18 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
New Agama version will be released (maybe by next week). All you have to do is use the new one.

Coins in paper wallet and on exchange safe?

[27-Nov-18 07:41 PM] Hermes#6934
that's correct ...in the case of exchanges they have already been notified about the update.

[27-Nov-18 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`and on exchange safe?`
Yes, exchanges keep their coins safely away from you after you give them away :trollface:

Will the timelocking feature also allow for ‚Äòmasternode‚Äô-like features? Or is the timelocking purely for locking up team funds for example?

[27-Nov-18 09:48 PM] Hermes#6934
you are referring to Locktime?

KMD. KMD

[28-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just a technical update with new consensus rules

[28-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not all hardforks have to be politicized and contentious

[28-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes, you can just update the tech and have new tech

[28-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Zbouby#6066
Ok thx! I though that a fork was an attack. And who vote for this fork? People who control notary nodes?

[28-Nov-18 12:14 PM] modereck#4269
Hi, I saw a tweet that says rewards can be claimed  on ledger by a web app, do someone have the link?

[28-Nov-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@Zbouby we dont do technical development by voting. it is coding, not voting and this is the new codebase that is developed so why wouldnt we update?

[28-Nov-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
technology that is politicized leads to taking 4 years to not increase blocksize

[28-Nov-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but any assetchain is free to not update to the latest, we have provision for that

[28-Nov-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
technical decisions should be based on technology, not politics

[28-Nov-18 12:35 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I'm confused - is the KMD fork already in progress and we should not move our coins till 15 Dec or the fork will yet be announced before 15 Dec and finish after 15 ? The initial ann was like "till 15 Dec exchanged halted due to fork" so it sounds like no tx should be done and upgrade will take 2 weeks ?

[28-Nov-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on the final tests for the update. we hope to get it live around the 1st of Dec. that gives everyone 2 weeks to update

[28-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Zbouby#6066
Thank you jl777c for the explanation

[28-Nov-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you update before Dec 15th once the update is ready, you will be fine

[28-Nov-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if you use lite mode, then you dont have to worry, whoever runs the SPV servers need to update

[28-Nov-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but entire infrastructure needs to be updated, including all full nodes, mining pools, explorers, exchanges, etc. and unlike the normal update, special sapling suppport is needed as it creates a new tx version, even for taddr

[28-Nov-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
due to this, we couldnt make it the normal, "just update komodod" process which would be much faster.

[28-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is I am still concerned there isnt enough time for all things to be updated. I know it is a painful process, but we have to do this at some point and anytime would be painful.

[28-Nov-18 12:54 PM] PTYX#6840
Can you explain how this would play out with 500-1000 chains: "but any assetchain is free to not update to the latest, we have provision for that"

[28-Nov-18 12:56 PM] PTYX#6840
What provisions?

[28-Nov-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
add -ac_sapling=farfutureheight

[28-Nov-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
or

[28-Nov-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
just make a repo with all the current code being used and not update it
