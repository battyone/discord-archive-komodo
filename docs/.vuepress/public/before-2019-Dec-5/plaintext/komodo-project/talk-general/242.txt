@crunchycat  from a business perspective, why would I pay 3x more to do the same job

[27-Mar-19 12:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@crunchycat Also with the percentage mining model,  it’s not cost effective even for the customer chains.   You say even large chains will want VBK,  imagine there is a coin similar in price and marketcap and mining parameters as Komodo. About 2.6 million coins are mined per year. 26000 coins at 1% mining fee roughly 26k usd ,  this is 4-5x the cost of Komodo DPoW.  And only gets worse with more capitalized chains.  Lower end chains face the problems a) no way to recuperate shitcoin for btc spent b) low value coins being split up = tragedy of the commons

[27-Mar-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
1576800 coins mined per year, still the cost is quite a bit higher

[27-Mar-19 12:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah yes My mistake, yes it still is like 3x higher.

[27-Mar-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but KMD has pretty low mining emission due to the 5% APR, most other mining coins are issuing all new coins via mining, so it could be 3x more than 3x

[27-Mar-19 09:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
from what happened with IEO on binance,  I don't think bittrex would dump their allocation of vbk  right away if they want to keep this IEO trend going so they can earn more from future IEO.

what can go wrong doing 100x the BTC tx than dPoW. but maybe this is something the btcfee market peoples are wanting

[28-Mar-19 04:27 PM] Markus#5464
sounds like a cheap way to use miners to do it so that the team dont have to fund the tx fees to btc

[28-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
Can BTC pool owners just get free veriblock?

[28-Mar-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
they totally can.... 🤔

[28-Mar-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
spending 100x the funds doesnt sound cheap to me, ultimately somebody has to pay for this

[28-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
I guess it's not free if you're replacing a tx that would have paid more

[28-Mar-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
and if it starts a fee market, maybe everyone will have to pay $30 per BTC tx

[28-Mar-19 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
are they connected to blockstream?

The new quantum resistance is all about making keypairs so big it just crashes your computer when you try to use it.

[29-Mar-19 06:53 PM] Spaid#3606
quantum secure is saying technology will never advance to break it... doesn't matter how big the key is, someday it will be broken

[29-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Regnar#6164
It's more just saying we changed the problem being asked to one that is more difficult for a quantum computer to solve, assuming we understand HOW the computers will try and solve them.

[29-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Regnar#6164
There very well may be a new algorithm that QC will use that may break lattice based encryption, by that I mean just give it an advantage to some degree in solving it, but then we have to change the problem being asked again. repeat forever

[29-Mar-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
just because you cant be sure the new algo will remain quantum resistant, it is sure better than continuing to use obsolete algo that we know are totally cracked.

[29-Mar-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
when QC arrive, we need to transition

[29-Mar-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
will it be dilithium? who knows?

[29-Mar-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but we can practice ahead of time what the anti-QC migration would be like and solve whatever issues we encounter in the early ones

[29-Mar-19 07:05 PM] Regnar#6164
It's definitely good to have a grasp of both sides of the situation. Seeing how computers and tech are evolving, what they are doing better, where their limitations are etc. and then finding hard problems that can only be solved (that we know of) in ways that those computers are not good at.

[29-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Regnar#6164
will the new Dilithium addresses work with SPV?

[29-Mar-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
SPV has no idea about dilithium, but it would be possible to calculate the special address where the registration opret is

[29-Mar-19 07:12 PM] Regnar#6164
so lite/mobile wallets would be possible but take some additional work?

[29-Mar-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a fair amount of work, but less than for zSPV
