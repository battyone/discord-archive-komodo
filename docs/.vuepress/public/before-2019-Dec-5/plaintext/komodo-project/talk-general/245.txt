The article says PayPal won't return it because the mother used "friends and family" as a payment method

[01-Apr-19 06:05 PM] crunchycat#0726
So, did he return it or keep it?

[01-Apr-19 06:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
There was a local news story about it

[01-Apr-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
Not saying that is the situation

[01-Apr-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
but if it happened to me I would assume that was what was happening

[01-Apr-19 06:07 PM] crunchycat#0726
Okay, fair enough.  So he returned it once he realized it was legit?

[01-Apr-19 06:07 PM] crunchycat#0726
@dukeleto

[01-Apr-19 06:09 PM] crunchycat#0726
She tagged his Twitter

[01-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lol guys

[01-Apr-19 06:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So an unknown twitter account accuses @dukeleto of whatever

[01-Apr-19 06:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And you assume its true?

Why would it be true? Because some rando tags him?

[01-Apr-19 06:11 PM] crunchycat#0726
I typically stay away from Twitter, but this caught my eye

[01-Apr-19 06:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
well that escalated quickly... dukeleto asks some questions about vbk on twitter and now he is a miscreant who steals from children

[01-Apr-19 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
even if it is true, he should not have sent back the money. They should have dealt with paypal directly

Yeah I pointed it they don't return it, friends and family payment

[01-Apr-19 06:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also no mention of what the ‚ÄúJ‚Äù in J. Leto stands for in the broadcast or in the article .  So is there even a connection between the two other than a common name

[01-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*Ralston‚Äôs payment did go through to a J. Leto, just not Jennifer Leto as she intended.*

[01-Apr-19 06:12 PM] crunchycat#0726
Either it was him, or the Twitter account tagged the wrong person

[01-Apr-19 06:12 PM] crunchycat#0726
So which is it

[01-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How do you go from j. Leto to duke leto?

There is no mention anywhere in the article or story of the website or who J Leto is.  Baseless accusations

[01-Apr-19 06:18 PM] Alright#0419
if a stranger sends you money out of no where and demands you send it back, you're almost certainly a target of a scam. If you can't understand this. You're obviously trolling.

it seems that you should let the developers communicate with each other. not relay muddled messages back and forth
