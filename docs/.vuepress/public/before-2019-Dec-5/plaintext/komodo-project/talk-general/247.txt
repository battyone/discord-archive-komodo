[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
We need code

[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
I do at least

[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We have a production system that does what VBK claims to do that’s been in use by 50 chains and has been around for going on 3 years.  You guys have shit

[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Bill P#0322
centralized lol

[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
to truly understand it. They make bold claims, it's hard to know what is real or not without seeing the code

[01-Apr-19 08:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Explain how it’s centralized

[01-Apr-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
suddenly @two2too's english got better and using nice grammer? 🤔

[01-Apr-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you aree insulting yourself by talking rubbish

[01-Apr-19 08:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Bill P  I’m waiting How is it centralized ?

[01-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Bill P#0322
your notary nodes and voting.

[01-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Bill P#0322
and is its notary node runners who do the voting

[01-Apr-19 08:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You need 1M+ votes to get elected. There may be 5 whales big enough to get someone elected

[01-Apr-19 08:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There are 64 nodes

[01-Apr-19 08:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Please tell me how a notary can buy the election

@Bill P Notary nodes make like 20k KMD a year, no where near enough to vote themselves in.

[01-Apr-19 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Please tell me how a notary can buy the election`
he can buy 1 spot for $1.6M USD

[01-Apr-19 08:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
To make 20k

[01-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah sick returns

[01-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Totally worth buying a spot

[01-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
!!!1!1!1!!!1

[01-Apr-19 08:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And let’s not forget that we have historically and currently notary operators that cannot buy themselves in .

[01-Apr-19 08:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
shhh with all those facts things, today is say random made-up shit and it's real day

[01-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, should a whale vote in a crappy notary, he would devaluate his own kmd holdings.

[01-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So he is incentivezed voting for the best notary

[01-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Butttt, as I said, should vbk yield interesting insights in the field, i am sure other projects, kmd included, would adapt.

[01-Apr-19 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Should vbk not yield something usefull then we’ll see what happens in the long run

[01-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362

`(once read wp, otherwise no point)`
unlike your clan, we read stuff before commenting on it

[01-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Post#7345
the kmd guys are developers, they have to see some actual code to see if it works and the whitepaper is not really informative on that part

[01-Apr-19 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone can type some words and say that it's true just because they said so

[01-Apr-19 08:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yo.    Love that BS on Duke. 


"Hey anyone here, you know if Crunchycat is around?   He took 1500 that was supposed to go to the kids cancer hospital."

[01-Apr-19 08:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I sent it to his KMD address and he hasnt sent it back!

[01-Apr-19 08:49 PM] Post#7345
there is no real reason to make i closed source to begin with

[01-Apr-19 08:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
When VBK has chains actually protected, with demonstrated thwarting of 51% attack because of their notarization mechanism , then we can have a conversation .  Right now you have *nothing*

[01-Apr-19 08:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Closed source code on an IEO where your "users" are literally paying through the nose to Prove your Proof... is a bad idea.

[01-Apr-19 08:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It will end poorly most likely.

[01-Apr-19 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts she's said a dozen times that there's "documentation" and every time some person that asks her for it, she stops responding to them
so, that should tell you something

[01-Apr-19 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
👆

[01-Apr-19 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Innocent until proven guilty.

[01-Apr-19 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But if the other way around then Crunchycat DEFINTIELY took that money from the kids cancer hospital.

[01-Apr-19 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes. This is why I do not particpate.

[01-Apr-19 08:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
😃

[01-Apr-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Irony

[01-Apr-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`waiting to open source is protection imo`
yes, "protection" against no one buying it when peer-review shows it don't work :troll:

[01-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
why do they need IEO if they already raised $18 mil?

[01-Apr-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
private investors, is what I heard

[01-Apr-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
and the veriblock team will have 50 to 70% after the IEO

[01-Apr-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it is almost at ripple levels, which some may feel is a good thing

{Reactions}
😂 

[01-Apr-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so they are totally centralized with 70% control, but the first thing they do is make up the fiction that NN are centralized

[01-Apr-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, good, you can stop talking about it and then complaining that there is talk of vbk here

[01-Apr-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is feken glad it's finished too_

[01-Apr-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
time to talk about something useful, like 👯

[01-Apr-19 09:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's like XVG taking pot shots and XMR.  

XVG is shit comparatively and they know it but if they put themselves in the same narrativce and discussions, those that are uninfomred and sheeple will lean towards the more vocal idiots and shills with cute buzzwords instead of facts. 

VBK is XVG as KMD is to XMR
No contest and those who continue to put their heads in the sand will wake up one day and realize it.  

LOL 10 BTC a day in notary fees.  

😂

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No point in discussion the probnlems in VBK.   Noone will listen anyway

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
?

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I just got here.

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I do

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
and as much as I hate BTC, I have better things to do with my BTC than to support VBK.

[01-Apr-19 09:01 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also... if you want VBK its cheaper to buy than to PoP mine anyway.

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Its dumb

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
but to each his /her own

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bro I know.

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's an awful idea.    I will not talk about it any more.

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Have a nice day I have work to do. 😃

[01-Apr-19 09:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Unfortunatleyt, lots of people will get hurt and lose money and THAT is fucked up.

Your equating market cycles to scams.

[01-Apr-19 09:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
well not a scam, but a project that reeks of a scam.

[01-Apr-19 09:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If it's so solid, why do pop miners pay BTC?

[01-Apr-19 09:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Why are users supporting their idea?

[01-Apr-19 09:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No, its not.

[01-Apr-19 09:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Paying BTC TX fees is NOT a form of mining no matter how you slice it.

[01-Apr-19 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why do pow miner pay electricity?`
Because they like to watch 📺

[01-Apr-19 09:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To falsely call something, something that it isn't... is one of the definitions of a scam.

[01-Apr-19 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`notary = MN: just a vps running`
That's literally not even close to true

[01-Apr-19 09:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most obvious difference is I mine KMD and I don't pay a percentage to the NNs

[01-Apr-19 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
NNs, don't cost you anything but hosting costs (or your own server if you have net)

[01-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@two2too please stay with facts, equating two things as the same since it runs on a VPS is quite silly. using that logic, anything that runs on a VPS is the same?

[01-Apr-19 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`same with MN`
find me a single coin worth $1+ that I can get a MN for $20......

[01-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
seems you are not here to learn, you are close to being banned. we are tired of the vbk trolling

[01-Apr-19 09:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
MN = rich get rich and poor stay poor

[01-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
is running a client wallet on a VPS the same as a MN?

[01-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
they are both on a VPS and cost money

[01-Apr-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this is nonsense logic, i guess it might pass for technical expertise in vbk land, but here we have higher standards

[01-Apr-19 09:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@two2too Ive been here over 12 months at least and I have NEVER seen james say that,  He may have but I haven't seen it.  He's not wrong.  You're not debating, you're ignoring facts and statements to troll
