[06-Jun-19 12:02 AM] crunchycat#0726
WTS 1 million KMD. No escrow needed, just take it from my Agama wallet.  Leave BTC in the "trust box"

[06-Jun-19 12:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
I was thinking that maybe we can put together a fund to contribute to in an effort make everyone whole. I'd be willing to throw in a few. would be a nice gesture at least.

[06-Jun-19 12:17 AM] strugglebus#2266
thank god for JL and such an active and brilliant dev team and ecosystem. this would have nuked a shit coin. once again shows the difference and competency levels between devs of a real coin like KMD and your run of the mill shitcoin

[06-Jun-19 12:29 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
Checked my wallet and it’s drained

[06-Jun-19 12:30 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
here

[06-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the dev team raced the hacker and secured most of the KMD

[06-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
Oh thank the fucking lord! So nothing was stolen and all will be returned?

[06-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if your coins ended up in  RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF   then everything is fine

[06-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
some were stolen, but most were protected

[06-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
How do I check that?

[06-Jun-19 12:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Check your address in the explorer and see if they were sent to the address above

[06-Jun-19 12:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[06-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Anyone know the number that were stolen?

[06-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes, but it couldve been much worse, the dev team handled it well at least

[06-Jun-19 12:34 AM] Jenny8675309#5331

[06-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
what a nightmare

[06-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[06-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes its a nightmare

[06-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Llama#1330
you have >$100,000 and it's not on cold storage

[06-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Llama#1330
?

[06-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
well i fucking thought it would be safe on a wallet on my very secured pc

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
same, took mine off exchanges to be safer lol 😄

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
me too... this has never happened to me with any other crypto? Was it just KMD that was affected?

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
didnt imagine a hacker couldve gotten an exploit into agama

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] wolfgang#3508
its not kmd per se. its the agama wallet itself

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was a library that agama depends on

[06-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Llama#1330
it was just the agama wallet

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
any coin using that library is at risk

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
was it only KMD though? or other agama wallets too?

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
were any other coins using that library?

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] wolfgang#3508
agama supports multiple currencies so other coins would be affected too

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
all coins in your agama wallet

[06-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Caglio#3337
jenny stop trolling poor ppl

[06-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Jenny8675309#5331

[06-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
I came here to figure out what the fuck happened to my shit

[06-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Caglio#3337

[06-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064
she could have that much

[06-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i talked to a guy that had 220k of them before back in slack

[06-Jun-19 12:42 AM] bishop#9773
@Jenny8675309 Did you actually lose it or was it swept by the team?

[06-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Jenny8675309#5331
I need to figure it out, but it doesn't look like it's in the team's wallet, so I might be fucked

[06-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wherever it went, look to see if it moved further from there into the dev wallet

[06-Jun-19 12:43 AM] bishop#9773
Exactly

[06-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Sdunbar#5064
whats the transaction ID jenny?

[06-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Caglio#3337

[06-Jun-19 12:44 AM] Jenny8675309#5331

KMD is like an abusive girlfriend/boyfriend to me now lol.   Why you gotta hurt me KMD, I love you.

[06-Jun-19 12:50 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
If it helps, the dev team went for the big wallets first knowing the hacker would try to get those before moving on.
