as crumb said, you can probably find all the necessary  info in #dev-scalability  , all I know is Komodo did some scalability test on AWS

[28-Nov-18 09:50 PM] Paul#0981
Ok Thank you

[28-Nov-18 09:50 PM] crumb#2550
the big 1M tx/s will also be done with the help of AWS

If Komodo is integrating Sapling and all of this other tech from Verus, isn't Komodo just Zcash, but better? What else differentiates Zcash at this point

Not at home, but when I did it last year it was pretty dicey.

[30-Nov-18 12:59 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah, I doubt many are trying. You should probably give it a shot. I certainty have no need to.

[30-Nov-18 01:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess he‚Äôs just gonna check the explorer or something. No need to transfer i would hope

[30-Nov-18 01:00 AM] ch6ris#5240
Maybe, that would make a lot of sense.

[30-Nov-18 01:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's not that it's doing well, it's that he was supposed to swap 3 years ago ,  probably just doing it to cover his ass on something

[30-Nov-18 04:40 AM] house#8741
Guessing the community pressure to get Sasha to honour his word is finally getting some traction. Looking at the waves price and his latest venture with Vostok, I am assuming he needs to listen to the community that put him in such wealth. Took feken long enough tho

[30-Nov-18 04:42 AM] house#8741
Still holding heavy bags of his shit that he abandoned ... 2 years ... he lost a lot of respect doing that

[30-Nov-18 04:43 AM] house#8741
Not to mention loyal followers

[30-Nov-18 05:41 AM] Don King#8901
Coinomat asset holders should be compensated, I msg Sasha on next forum and asked him if any benefits in not swapping in round 1 in May 2016, his answer was hodl would mean a larger share of dividends as coinomat and investment funds would still operate (he basically said waiting was better) .... I don't think any dividends were ever paid after round 1, in retrospect it should have been all swapped in 2016

[30-Nov-18 06:10 AM] house#8741
Agree 100%. I still have a link somewhere to the thread on btt where he said coinomat would be fully integrated to waves platform, I purposefully not only waited for that, but bought more in anticipation of a new and improved version

[30-Nov-18 06:15 AM] house#8741
Weird thing is ... James helped him to created the Waves idea, knowing full well that a proxy token would be no match for the real thing that KMD was to provide
Hyper-jump two years later ... waves is worth more than KMD ... dafuq ?!

[30-Nov-18 06:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
@ryman112  I was perusing chainlink‚Äôs github. they could be doing everything in secret. and I dont know a whole lot about coding. But their shit is sparse and rarely updated for the most part. They do have an office in sf though.

[30-Nov-18 06:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
Chainlink is more hype than substance imo

[30-Nov-18 07:20 AM] jorian#4555
waves is worth more than KMD because ivanov did the marketing well

[30-Nov-18 07:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
they raised 30 million vs 2 million, that helps

[30-Nov-18 07:52 AM] jorian#4555
that's a result of marketing, not the cause

[30-Nov-18 07:54 AM] jorian#4555
"A total of 21042 tokens have been released on Waves." hope to see that on KMD platform one day

[30-Nov-18 08:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They also had first mover advantage from the NXT exodus

[30-Nov-18 10:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Waves - Raised 30,000 BTC = 120M at $4k (MC 115M)
KMD - Raised <3000 BTC i think = 12M at $4k (MC 73M)

[30-Nov-18 10:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure some of the BTC would be spent, so for waves they are at NAV basically.

[30-Nov-18 10:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD is 6x

[30-Nov-18 10:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Relatively speaking, KMD is doing 6 times better than Waves.
