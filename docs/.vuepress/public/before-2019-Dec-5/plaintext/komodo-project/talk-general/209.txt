[14-Feb-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the fork happened on Dec 15th

[14-Feb-19 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah activation block?

[14-Feb-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the feb15th was in the dec15th hardfork

[14-Feb-19 01:06 PM] Vertigo#0439
Sorry just exited about kmd.

[14-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thanks for the clarification @jl777c

[14-Feb-19 02:04 PM] Alecandro#1179
Did anyone suggest that Komodo should officially reach out to Activision employees who are getting laid off to suggest they look into development for KMD games??

[14-Feb-19 02:05 PM] Alecandro#1179
It was activision where everyone got laid off recently right??

Doesn't discord make some type of contests for video game developers?

[14-Feb-19 03:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Hermes actually thinking of it I guess it is possible

[14-Feb-19 03:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like the bot we use to tip users

[14-Feb-19 03:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it can be used for this ROGUE game too

[14-Feb-19 03:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just tested it a bit

[14-Feb-19 03:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ca333 @jl777c am I correct?

[14-Feb-19 03:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with tip bot customised for ROGUE, each user can get the txid and seed etc linked to the pubkey of their tip address

[14-Feb-19 03:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be I'm thinking ahead of my work, I should just focus on my current task üòÑ

[14-Feb-19 03:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will get back to this later....

[14-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Hermes#6934
I am pretty sure Discord has some type of contest for new developers at least yearly

[14-Feb-19 03:34 PM] Hermes#6934
competitions are always good for marketing :treasure:

[14-Feb-19 04:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We can get Sclear on the intercommunication ability between discord and outside APIs.  So technically you could manage your avatars via discord.

Hi there, if my Komodo is on an exchange, I donmt need to move it for the upcoming upgrade, right?

[14-Feb-19 05:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
correct no need to move

[14-Feb-19 05:37 PM] coingirl87#6489
Which upgrade?

[14-Feb-19 05:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
of you have funds on a zaddress move it to t address ( R address) now

[14-Feb-19 05:38 PM] coingirl87#6489
Ah this one...ok than i know

[14-Feb-19 05:39 PM] coingirl87#6489
I have take a look in richlist and i dond find any adresses with a z

[14-Feb-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes z addresses are shielded and not transparent

[14-Feb-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
so they are not public

[14-Feb-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
only the owner of the priv key or the viewing key knows the balance

[14-Feb-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
only sprout is being deactivated on the assetchains

[14-Feb-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
only KMD and ZEX are going to ac_public

[14-Feb-19 05:42 PM] jorian#4555
still 85000 KMD in sprout

[14-Feb-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
seems will be forever

[14-Feb-19 05:44 PM] coingirl87#6489
@CHMEX thanx

[14-Feb-19 06:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why you guys are getting rid of z addresses? How do I send my KMDs privately now?

[14-Feb-19 06:26 PM] jorian#4555
you can't

[14-Feb-19 06:26 PM] jorian#4555

I chatted with them a bit - they are real game geeks, but it seems they are really scared of anything that reeks of real currency

[15-Feb-19 07:57 AM] LocoMB#8593
I told them that they'd prly be better off to start a new blockchain for their in-game currencies, but markm said that using some worthless and trashed blockchain would be better dbecause they feared the canadian taxman

[15-Feb-19 11:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got more plans than time at the moment lol. But I'll be experimenting with oracles most of this year when I get a chance, in combination with some other ccs

@Deleted User imagine spending 3 hours on COD and getting some COD coins which you use to buy a skin. Now, you don't want it anymore so you go to skindex and sell it for more COD tokens or possibly even JPM coin.

[15-Feb-19 04:42 PM] PTYX#6840
video games rely on virtual tokens as part of the in-game economy. This just makes it more tangible.

[15-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree vg with token utilization but seriously there‚Äôs no need for cryptography. It‚Äôs just a video game. And most companies have stores setup to buy extra skins or whatever

[15-Feb-19 04:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Having crypto currency for tokens is overkill

[15-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
For example, when I want to play pinball at my local arcade...I go and exchange for tokens....I don‚Äôt need to hide it from anyone because I use them right away

[15-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Targeting existing skin markets and in game currency does not make sense yet. We would need to find a better economic model for those game publishers and developers to try and displace that existing model.

[15-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Steve Lee#1967
one reason roguelike is interesting is that it is typically a single player. by adding a provably fair and blockchain enforced solution we can now offer a way to have a multiplayer "tournament" mode functionality.

[15-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Daiyox#2701
Game company A does not trust game company B, but both see the value in being able to exchange assets between their platforms..I don't think it's so much about hiding transactions as creating a neutral database that doesn't require the trust of humans

[15-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Steve Lee#1967
right, i think targeting indie gaming and a way for them to create an interoperable ecosystem would be a good move

[15-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Steve Lee#1967
game betting and anti cheat would be another area to explore

[15-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Avg gamer is an 11 year old. I don‚Äôt think they give a shit about cryptography.

[15-Feb-19 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
It‚Äôs just making gaming more complex

[15-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Daiyox#2701
They shouldn't need to care about cryptography, blockchain would just be the backend for the gaming companies to utilize as a resource imo

[15-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Steve Lee#1967
that is a ux/ui and integration issue, the user shouldn't have to know what the backend is doing

[15-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Daiyox#2701
It's just like the user doesn't care about servers and all the database infrastructure that games run on

[15-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Daiyox#2701
Should be the same if adding in crypto, it's just another storage system

[15-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Good luck with giving parents refunds when their kids buy a shitton and adjusting the blockchain

[15-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Steve Lee#1967
finding what the value you could be should be something we find out from devs, not users

[15-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Steve Lee#1967
how would that be any different from those demanding refund in an existing model?

[15-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well it‚Äôs proposed here to use the blockchain for token usage

[15-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we're not trying to replace in game currency or marketplaces with crypto, that doesn't make sense to me
