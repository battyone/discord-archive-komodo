KMD is almost at 0.1% of total cryptomarket cap. as unreliable as that is, it seems more stable than any other way to see the KMD market value as it factors out both the BTC price and the BTC market dominance factors (which are very large)
to put this in perspective, during the bull market peak KMD was at 0.15% for a bit but it has usually ranged between 0.05% and 0.1%. Since not so many follow this metric, I doubt there is any "TA breakout" mania at 0.1%, just a key metric from my point of view. It means that $1 out of every $1000 value in crypto is held in KMD.

The fact that this is happening at 30k sats is also very important as when KMD goes back above 100K sats, it would mean 0.3%+ of overall crypto marketcap (barring any big breakdown of BTC dominance). I think this means for this bear -> bull market phase, KMD is one of the leading alts. So for all of those that claim that KMD is not doing well outside of tech, this is a bit of perspective.

I hope Komodo can really set itself apart in this regard. I know we‚Äôve got some good things going so far with blockchain games and whatnot. I hope we can bring real world gaming companies into the mix to work with KMD and really try to be a market leader

[14-Mar-19 05:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ripple doesn‚Äôt know what they want to be.  Them trying to make a game division after trying to get banks to use them is an indication to me that they have no direction.

[14-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yep I agree there

[14-Mar-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo has had no direction from the start. being decentralized it should grow into all areas

[14-Mar-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo makes the core tech that allows others to blockchain whatever they can think to blockchain, just make sure you are using it when it makes sense to. blockchain allows to have strangers on the internet be able to transact monetary value without trusting anybody else. so it does apply in a lot of areas.

[14-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Blackbeard#9921
interesting theory @FishyGuts

[14-Mar-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
since KMD isnt forcing people to pay fees, it becomes much more attractive to just use KMD than make your own. even just the small dPoW cost will have many many chains, some from large companies.

 I see many thinking that it is better to charge high fees and that ETH gas model is perfect. But from last years BTC fee market and cryptokitties, we all saw what happens when the fees get too high. you just stop using it. Making a CC design without any gas required, this is a big reduction in barrier to entry. During the adoption phase is NOT the time to increase the costs for adoption, even if it might boost the marketcap in the short term. komodo aims for maximizing long term adoption and for open source how can you even enforce fees anyway?
