I wonder if we will hire Daniel Schiener to manage the claim process  :troll:

@jl777c  thank you, will do... üòÑ what a morning :p

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
we saw the attackers plan, but he seems to be dormant, so we decided to sweep the funds to where there is a chance for users to claim as opposed to just disappearing some random moment

@jeezy better not, still missing some IOTA üò¶

I just tried  Komodo Ocean QT and it says komodo already running

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] majors#9223
bc of agama

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jeezy#3408
nice handling and good transparent communication on this incident so far, keep it up

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jeezy#3408
just hope the  claim process will be as smooth

[05-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be much smoother than trying to convince the attacker to return your coins

[05-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@majors you can only run one instance of komodod at a time

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So Ocean and Agama can't run simulataneously

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] coyote#8010
Tell people what info they need to save in order to claim with as soon as possible to make sure the claim goes smooth

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you can find all the info here

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] majors#9223
ok but if I use Ocean to generate a new address and then close and send to that from agama it should work?

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Steelrat#2421
yes, apprediate your effort guys... I think and hope, I did it... now I have to get to know my new Magnum Wallet, and hope, there is a better solution for mac...

[05-Jun-19 08:51 AM] majors#9223
Ocean will NOT use the same wallet.dat file?

[05-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
I m not 100% sure about this, but as long as you re in **native** mode, the GUI relies on the daemon, and the wallet.dat should be the same

[05-Jun-19 08:54 AM] majors#9223
yes in agama I am in native

[05-Jun-19 08:55 AM] majors#9223
what about the Verus version of Agama...that I just rename something else to not overwrite my original Agama and run in lite mode correct?

[05-Jun-19 09:07 AM] majors#9223
I cant connect to Komodo SPV servers from Verus Agama in lite mode

[05-Jun-19 09:07 AM] majors#9223
any ideas?

[05-Jun-19 09:11 AM] tipmebits#4427
can i simply send the kmd from agama to exchange for example?

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362

do not use the seed of new address in web wallet or old agama

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@tipmebits yes if you trust the exchange to hold the coins for you

[05-Jun-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@tipmebits we usually cant recommend exchanges, but in this case an exchange is better than a known vulnerable agama

[05-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
IF you use an exchange, at least make sure you have 2FA etc enabled

[05-Jun-19 09:23 AM] majors#9223
but if I cant access electrum servers on the new address how will I later access the new address/agama? or is the electrum connectivity issue just temporary?

[05-Jun-19 09:23 AM] majors#9223
can't I just send out from old agama to new address?

[05-Jun-19 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
you can

[05-Jun-19 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have old Agama running fine

[05-Jun-19 09:24 AM] majors#9223
yes it appears to be

[05-Jun-19 09:25 AM] tipmebits#4427
can't seem to send from agama?

[05-Jun-19 09:25 AM] majors#9223
but the Verus version in SPV can't cnnect to the servers

[05-Jun-19 09:25 AM] tipmebits#4427
doesn't sync

[05-Jun-19 09:26 AM] tipmebits#4427
kmd is visible on block explorer

[05-Jun-19 09:26 AM] majors#9223
so I could transfer to this new address but then the question is  how do I later transfer out if this Verus agama won't connect to electrum servers?

[05-Jun-19 09:29 AM] majors#9223
or at a later time I can use my new seed with an updated agama or web wallet?

[05-Jun-19 09:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@majors within the next few days a patched version of kmd agama will be out, use your verus seed in kmd agama and you will see your coins and adress

[05-Jun-19 09:31 AM] majors#9223
ok great thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:31 AM] gcharang#6833
@majors if not a patched agama, verus agama will be able to access KMD electrums
please be sure that access will be brought to you one way or another

[05-Jun-19 09:32 AM] verymuchso#9902
Can the Komodo devs indicate which upstream library was affected to make sure other wallets do not expose the same vulnerability. Thank you.

[05-Jun-19 09:32 AM] molite#8723
If the computer that the wallet is on is offline is this bug an issue?

[05-Jun-19 09:32 AM] TimC#3334
So did you get both address the hacker sent funds to? I see a big TX to this address RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF and the change that was left (interest) was sent to this 2nd address RWXmNq2EgDgknZs2uaJ3ETs2nnhwqczAtQ

[05-Jun-19 09:33 AM] gcharang#6833
@verymuchso we can't disclose it until the vuln reporters themselves do it
they are warning other projects and teams
expect that within 24-48 hours everything will be made clear

[05-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Cruz X (10)#7512
Thank you for getting this out as soon as possible..
Is there anything we should do, to help out, aside from move our funds out of Agama?

[05-Jun-19 09:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@TimC RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF is by the KMD security team submit a claim for funds swept by that address

[05-Jun-19 09:35 AM] klein#5233
Who found the vulnerability

[05-Jun-19 09:36 AM] verymuchso#9902
Can the Komodo devs indicate if simply using the wallet was enough to have funds stolen. Or that only new private keys generated in that wallet are vulnerable.
@gcharang Thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:36 AM] gcharang#6833
even entering the seed/privkey in agama in the last 5 months was unsecure

[05-Jun-19 09:38 AM] molite#8723
@gcharang if the computer is and has been offline is this bug still an issue?

[05-Jun-19 09:38 AM] gcharang#6833
no

[05-Jun-19 09:38 AM] verymuchso#9902
Even? So private data was transmitted out as well? 
And also the key generation algo, random number generator was affected.

[05-Jun-19 09:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
I just compiled OCEANQT so that will take care of KMD - but can it also be used for assetchains?

[05-Jun-19 09:46 AM] gcharang#6833
any secure address starting with R can be used 
it just might take some time to access them

[05-Jun-19 09:47 AM] tipmebits#4427
People have sent from Agama?

[05-Jun-19 09:48 AM] gcharang#6833
yes you can use agama to send the funds out

[05-Jun-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@LocoMB yes, ocean works for ACs too

[05-Jun-19 09:52 AM] tipmebits#4427
My Agama can't get transaction data. can't send funds..?

it should be a secure option, not sure the webwallet is secure

my supernet has also been  swept to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF
not just KMD

[05-Jun-19 10:13 AM] crumb#2550
with dozen of so addresses with multiple assets. what a clusterfek

[05-Jun-19 10:13 AM] gcharang#6833
thats fine @crumb RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF is controlled by KMD team so any funds swept by that address can be claimed back

[05-Jun-19 10:26 AM] tipmebits#4427
any idea how many funds were stolen?

[05-Jun-19 10:26 AM] tipmebits#4427
and how did you sweep addresses? Using the same vulnerability?

[05-Jun-19 10:26 AM] TS#7923
none to our best knowledge

yes

I have several accounts with kmd and the assets like dex bet bot etc .... Now I want to send se to another account ....note the partially deducted from dev...I really can not look through anymore ....

I understand it's a controversial move but this was by far the best option out of many bad ones. It should all make sense after the vulnerability can be disclosed.
