like an very large exchange hot wallet?

[08-May-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
could be. hard to predict

[08-May-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
would need to happen between the moment reorged and before the mempool tx are confirmed again

[08-May-19 09:48 AM] jansako#3330
funny if it would be Binance themselves...  just speculating!

[08-May-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the hot wallet node is checking mempool for spent tx (it should), it would be a very small chance

[08-May-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but these are non-consensus dynamic states, so very hard to predict

[08-May-19 09:49 AM] jansako#3330
Understood, and probably a moot point in this case. thank you sir!

On weekends, I met with representatives of several startups to discuss scalability, sharding. But stormy discussion was caused by the KMD system multiple clusters of chains (assets). Future is mass adoption and simplification. That what we do at IBM. And that what doing Ko...

Who is this @airratchet and how did we get such a staunch kmd advocate from inside the IBM borg?

[08-May-19 02:18 PM] ca333#0118
@actionslacks - She's a IBM researcher. To me it seems the industry and R&D is starting to focus on solid technology rather then hypeish p&d stuff - imho thats a forerunner of the 'mainstream adoption'.

I am very happy that we are now having CC independently developed, doing things I am not even sure what is. that is the power of CC, it lets you make an application specific consensus rule, blockchain enforced

[08-May-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
likely there are many other secret projects being developed that we just dont get tweets for. CC is very powerful and people have noticed

Well hopefully they'll all want to use dPoW. But if it's a really large corporation using it they may not need dPoW.

It's pretty nice having IBM on your R & D team in any case.

[08-May-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
most large corporations dont have a lot of hashrate. but they are experimenting with the n,k parameters, which lends to CPU mining and i guess IBM probably has quite a few CPU resources they can tap into

Solutions: 420 bytes (reduced more than 3 times)

with -ac_nk and -ac_blocktime, I think KMD can re-create just about every equihash coin that exists, via CLI parameters. That opens up which coins would be open to migrating to an AC, since we could support their N,K and blocktime. Before, we could only do 200,9, and it would be a non-starter for chains that changed those values

hm.. 'low energy mining', now that sounds spiffy!

[08-May-19 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I figured whe I was making the ac_nk, that only using the n/k % 8 limitaion was pretty usless, lucky the BEAM project had c++ code that allows that limitation to be removed, so I just ported that to KMD allowing any number to be used.  Ive been suing 77/3 on LABS test chains for months, as its "asic" and "gpu" resitant and used very little resources to mine.

Hi, I'm wondering where you guys got the number 64 from for the amount of nodes in dPoW

[08-May-19 03:35 PM] ŁATOSHI#7990
When mobiDex 🤨

[08-May-19 03:35 PM] haha#6652
From what I remember, Bitshares had 101 Bps but noticed that there were only around 20 actual participants who owned multiple nodes so they cut down the number to 21

[08-May-19 03:35 PM] haha#6652
Is there any reason for 64 nodes?

@haha 64 is a lot more distribution than most all coins. even BTC has the top 16 mining pools getting vast majority of blocks. also 64 fits into a 64 bit integer for efficient code. 128bit integers are not universally available yet

Hi guys, if you want to earn at least 5$ just for downloading the wallet and to be one of the first to use the only decentralized private trustless and crypto-agnostic Particl Marketplace on mainnet in the coming days follow my referral and create yours: 

https://friends.particl.community?kid=Z7C05

The wallet will be updated automatically with the marketplace in it next week, just after the Particl presentation at MCC and Consensus.

If this message was not allowed in this channel, I apologize and feel free to remove it.

Ps: we will be more than happy to be integrated in your DEX and to integrate your DEX in our marketplace.
