Agree .. but to setup and manage own servers it is maybe better to know all the tits.

[27-Jun-18 02:10 PM] alexander#4618
Try reading something like this (didn't read exactly this but I think such step by step approach is the best for learning programming)

[27-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to manage servers you want to learn linux cli... BASH

[27-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or docker stuff.

[27-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or both

[27-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
asnd python

[27-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all very easy

[27-Jun-18 02:12 PM] alexander#4618
Anyway, you need some goal you want to reach yourself (like implementing some exact application), and after spending some time reading these dummies manuals you'll get understanding what exactly you need and will be able to just search for some specific questions.. Though I don't understand why you need c+++ - it's not needed for server management

[27-Jun-18 02:13 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Had a steep learning curve by using ubuntu for first time ever at 41yo üòÇ never knew more than casual using windows.
Installing and running full node eth on it... fieww..

[27-Jun-18 02:14 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Executing files through terminal.. 
Installing progs... sudo commands etc..

[27-Jun-18 02:14 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thought c++ was needed.

atomicexplorer.com is not showing kmd rewards and utxo-s

[27-Jun-18 04:47 PM] crumb#2550
also it's still called interest in the content, not rewards

for me the Komodo website doesn't work since 3 days, I can reach it because the favicon loads but for the rest there's a loading wheel spinning forever

friendly suggestion:  When there is announcement like the agama wallet update, just post it once with the tag in the announcement channel.  I think there is no need to tag everyone in 5 different channels about it üòÉ

@ranfoltu is there a need for 5 people to post about being tagged 5 times? :troll:

[27-Jun-18 06:58 PM] Jazzy#0001
I think so, it makes it very clear that is was a problem

[27-Jun-18 06:59 PM] Jazzy#0001
Generally when people move to discord this kind of thing happens once, people speak up, and (hopefully) a lesson is learned and implemented

yes, because anyone that joins the team 6 months from now will surely read every word of 30 channels for 6 months back and see said complaints üëçüèø

Hey guys, looking for some feedback around a crypto ratings system I've been developing: https://ironwood.io/ratings/new

Basic gist is once I've got enough data for coins then I can take that and display the ratings and comments to everyone, so people can simply visit the site and get an idea of the crypto community's take on various well known projects. Thanks!

[27-Jun-18 08:41 PM] jorian#4555
something like Utrum is doing too?

[27-Jun-18 08:41 PM] jorian#4555
#utrum

[27-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Great White#9005
It's a standard app, not blockchain based (for now), but just looked up utrum, and looks similar for sure

[27-Jun-18 09:05 PM] Great White#9005
@jorian do you think there's much value in aggregating that data?

[27-Jun-18 09:05 PM] Great White#9005
I obviously do, but I'm curious about others' take  on the concept

[slack] <smk762> Spook - funds must move monthly now instead of yearly to claim interest.

[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I claim every two weeks..

[28-Jun-18 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
isn't that supposed to be activated at block 1M?

[28-Jun-18 08:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes from block 1m which is in 4 months or so

[28-Jun-18 09:48 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
What is supposed to be activated at block 1M?

[28-Jun-18 09:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
Transactions with locktime after 1m will need to claim rewards each 30 days. It will stop accruing rewards after 30 days.
It's a good idea to get some practice and do it monthly already.
FreeForAll mining will also be disabled at height 1m this does only concern miners and not the average user.

[28-Jun-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is

[28-Jun-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
since majority of coin emission is from 5% rewards and 75% of mining from notaries

[28-Jun-18 05:46 PM] 1TheGhostProject#3962

what about all the 1060 GPU miners, how is it fair there is a 1080?
