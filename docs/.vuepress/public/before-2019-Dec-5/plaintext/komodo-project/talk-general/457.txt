@jl777c thx for the vtc explanation

[03-Dec-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we offer dPoW services to the general crypto community at what is basically cost, but it seems this is not appreciated very much. if projects want to stay vulnerable to 51%, even after they are attacked (again and again), that is their choice to make

[03-Dec-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
within the komodo ecosystem, i consider a chain without dPoW as a testchain, but that is just me

[03-Dec-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe others too. without dPoW, it is just so easy to mess with a blockchain

[03-Dec-19 07:55 PM] richardt#2807
Seems quite ironic that a coin whose main mission is to prevent centralized mining and 51% attacks keeps getting 51% attacked

[03-Dec-19 07:56 PM] richardt#2807
It's as bad as if DOGE stops being a meme

[03-Dec-19 08:00 PM] richardt#2807
I think the main reason VTC doesn't want to use dpow is because they don't want to admit their methods do not work

Komodo $KMD dPoW is Pointless and Expensive

It provides 51% Attack Protection NO BETTER than the 10-Block Checkpointing system used by Bitcoin Cash (which is FREE)

Treasury holders should BUY BACK $KMD with whatever remains from the 2639 BTC ($18 Million)

given that he went around saying that we had a dev fee because of some test code, no

who is he ? & what scam did he pull ?

[03-Dec-19 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he took the dev fee out of zcash long ago, made a fork of it and never went back to it

What is the process to list a coin  on AtomicDEX?

[03-Dec-19 10:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Contact partners@atomicdex.io and we will see if the coin is compatible .  There is initial integration fee ( depending on coin type ) and a 1k a year fee.

how much did he walk away with?

[04-Dec-19 12:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
>>> What's the damage?

> You need to have 1,000 DASH, currently valued at US$50,000, to own a Dash masternode, and Moo offered two kinds of masternode service.

> One was full hosting where people with 1,000 DASH paid Moo $35 a month (in DASH) to host the node on their behalf. In this case, people would retain access to their own funds, but they probably aren't going to get their $35 a month refunded.

> The other service, which is where all the affected users come from, is shared masternode hosting. Here, users pool their funds to add up to 1,000 DASH and share the masternode earnings proportionally to their contribution. People directly send Moocowmoo their money, and Moo keeps track of who owns and is owed how much.

> There are 4,843 Dash masternodes in operation, which currently lock up about $245 million of DASH. If only 20 masternodes (0.4% of the total) are shared masternodes under Moo's control, the total amount of money allegedly lost here is more than DCG can reimburse.

it's not KMD's first dICO, it's a dICO on the KMD platform, that just doesn't sound right

BlocNation returned all funds to users that they generated on that dICO

Users/participants didn't have to return those BNTN amounts they had

Thanks sounds good. Not at all trying to stir the pot, I'm genuinely curious.  I couldn't find any updates, it was delisted from coinmrktcap and the founder's linkedin's were all deleted. Their website says they were the first Dico.
