[04-Feb-19 02:03 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
is separated with φ from the other

[04-Feb-19 02:04 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
?

[04-Feb-19 02:06 PM] Decker#3767
@linuxcaptain i don't think that the blocks is separated by UTF character φ ...

[04-Feb-19 02:07 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
then phi

[04-Feb-19 02:07 PM] Decker#3767
bcz many variants in this case ...

[04-Feb-19 02:07 PM] Decker#3767
of phi representation ...

[04-Feb-19 02:07 PM] Decker#3767
it's wrong way i think.

[04-Feb-19 02:08 PM] Decker#3767
i think each link should be replaced just by a number ...

[04-Feb-19 02:08 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
The links connecting the numbers in the seed must be replaced by the number symbol of the first hint.

[04-Feb-19 02:08 PM] Decker#3767
6 numbers or 6 groups of numbers ...

[04-Feb-19 02:08 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
"number symbol"

[04-Feb-19 02:09 PM] Decker#3767
hm ... let me try to check with φ as separator ...

[04-Feb-19 02:11 PM] Decker#3767
seems nothing ...

wrong ...

[04-Feb-19 02:14 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
@Decker  the blocks are 14 i think...

[04-Feb-19 02:15 PM] Decker#3767
"The image is more a way to understand how the seed is written with this number."
second chain is mirrored ... so this is how the seed is written related i think ...

[04-Feb-19 02:16 PM] Decker#3767
but no problem to check with 6 or 12 blocks per 14 digits each ...

[04-Feb-19 02:19 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b7 b6 b5 b4 b3 b2 b1  separated with phi or φ  is the right form i think and each block has 6 or  7digits..  but .. lets wait for the next hint

[04-Feb-19 02:24 PM] Decker#3767
i guess we miss something ...

[04-Feb-19 02:24 PM] Decker#3767
third hint needed )

💯 

[04-Feb-19 02:28 PM] Decker#3767
but don't say me that first chain is a [1] line of passphrase and second chain is a [2] line )

[04-Feb-19 02:36 PM] Decker#3767
also may be we misunderstood "mirroring" ... for example:
`618033`
mirrored can be `330816` ... but may be also something like 10-n ... `770294` ...

[04-Feb-19 02:36 PM] Decker#3767
need to look on screen once again ... how chains mirrored ...

i think the blocks represented by a fibonacci sequence

[04-Feb-19 03:23 PM] cryptocat#9465
I think Only "[1] line of passphrase" means the seed is just the second passphrase. Ignore the top array.

[04-Feb-19 03:23 PM] cryptocat#9465
[0] = first array
[1] = second array

yassinheart 

[04-Feb-19 03:24 PM] cryptocat#9465
So take the mirrored array and use it, with a φ at the end

`φb1b2b3b4b5b6b7b7b6b5b4b3b2b1φ`

[04-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Decker#3767
main thing is to correct determine what is b[n] ...

[04-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Decker#3767
each b[n] is just one digit or group of digits?

[04-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Decker#3767
it can be n-th digit of φ or n digits of φ ...

[04-Feb-19 03:29 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
probably a group..

[04-Feb-19 03:32 PM] cryptocat#9465
I still think the answer is going to be arr2φ

[04-Feb-19 03:34 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
the biggest problem to solve is the representation of each block....

1  option) they re part of the phi... 2 option) fibonacci series

[04-Feb-19 03:36 PM] Decker#3767
chain means - sequence ... i think it means no any digit after `.` can be omitted ...

[04-Feb-19 03:36 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
1 )70%  2 )30%

[04-Feb-19 03:36 PM] Decker#3767

Golden spiral
In geometry, a golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ, the golden ratio. That is, a golden spiral gets wider (or further from its origin) by a factor of φ for every quarter turn it makes.

i try to combine it in a way of a golden spiral but i cant think a way now...

[04-Feb-19 03:44 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
yes.. thats a part of the theory of the fib  series.. the ratio oscillates around the golden ratio..

[04-Feb-19 03:46 PM] Decker#3767
Most important question - each block is a one digit or group of digits ...

[04-Feb-19 03:46 PM] ca333#0118
@Decker i will be "free" (gonna make a little break) in ~1.5 - 2h - if you want lets team up (if anyone else wants to team up ping me).

[04-Feb-19 03:46 PM] ca333#0118
have you tried using PHI as the connector?

{Reactions}
👈 

[04-Feb-19 03:47 PM] ca333#0118
which connects both sequences/block"rows"

[04-Feb-19 03:47 PM] Decker#3767
i think template is `φb1b2b3b4b5b6b7b7b6b5b4b3b2b1φ` ...

[04-Feb-19 03:47 PM] ca333#0118
also replacing PHI with its numerical constant?

[04-Feb-19 03:47 PM] ca333#0118
just thinking out loud.

Fourth Hint🧩: The title of one of Max Linder's films gives the number of digits included in each block.

The passphrase does not contain any letters except φ

[04-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Novo#3073
is interest claimable on ledger with this new update?

[04-Feb-19 05:57 PM] cryptocat#9465
Max Linder's films with numbers in the title:
- 1: One Can't Believe One's Eyes
- 2: Two Great Griefs
- 3: The Three Must-Get-Theres 
- 7: Seven Years Bad Luck 
- 10: Ten Wives for One Husband

[04-Feb-19 05:57 PM] cryptocat#9465
So it's likely to be 7, right?

[04-Feb-19 05:57 PM] linuxcaptain#2335

there are 14 blocks and 1914 has 14 in it...

if blocks have 7 digits in each block ... how one block should be separated from others ...

with φ too or no separator ...

[04-Feb-19 08:24 PM] Decker#3767
good hint will be how the chain starts ... from `φ16180` ... or something else ... but this can make the puzzle too easy ...
