@crizzzuu @CrimsCrypto @teddycleps If you're interested in migrating to @KomodoPlatform we would be happy to discuss it with you. It's by far the most robust native tokenization mechanism around.

But what I really want to say with it. So many users voted for an ERC20 against a dICO platform. 🧐

If we really want to win this one, maybe a post on reddit would help ? (still 24hours remaining).

internet2 ---> router2 ---> PC2

Anyone know where I can find a laymen's guide for idiots to get PC1 and PC2 to connect and see each other.

you have 2 internets?

Why are there so many chains coming out

[31-Aug-18 09:38 AM] Smith#5802
There is pirate again

[31-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Smith#5802
More dilution for limited users and money

[31-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Smith#5802
And development resources

[31-Aug-18 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
There is a lot of possibilities and features in KMD so chains mostly creating to test different stuff and options. Money can't dilute on test non-tradable chain.

[31-Aug-18 09:43 AM] TonyL#3577
End goal of such initiatives is to deliver tested, secure, usable and predictable technology

[31-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Smith#5802
my attention is definitely diluted

[31-Aug-18 09:46 AM] Smith#5802
The KMD is fading away and it's getting more confusing among the so many *test chians the ecosystem. Not to mention, so of them are listed

[31-Aug-18 09:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
explorer.dexstats.info
I think it's just like ETH did that dilute your attention when all the tokens came out?

[31-Aug-18 09:48 AM] Smith#5802
New chains on ETH get new users,

[31-Aug-18 09:49 AM] Smith#5802
Those *test chains are mostly getting KMD users

[31-Aug-18 09:49 AM] Smith#5802
Fundamental difference

[31-Aug-18 09:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
ZILLA got a lot of new users VRSC aswell

💯 

[31-Aug-18 09:51 AM] Smith#5802
Those I agree

[31-Aug-18 09:51 AM] Smith#5802
But for pirate?

[31-Aug-18 09:51 AM] Smith#5802
What's that for

[31-Aug-18 09:52 AM] Smith#5802
And staked?

[31-Aug-18 09:52 AM] TonyL#3577
It's already hard to count all big hacks on Ethereum

[31-Aug-18 09:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
It's a private chain so all transactions are private on PIRATE
the privacy is forced by the chain

[31-Aug-18 09:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
there is no other assetchain that does that at the moment I believe.

[31-Aug-18 09:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
and I also believe it's important to test things on a chain with no actual value

[31-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Smith#5802
Agree on the testing and development of tech, but need to think about branding perspective.

[31-Aug-18 09:56 AM] Smith#5802
Don't get users confused, build on the core brand, not to dilute it. There are so many competing projects out there. The worst thing is to create competition within the system itself

[31-Aug-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think the point is to *show* we can use KMD tech to make whatever we like.

[31-Aug-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A lot of it is just fun, ad without KMD none of it would work.

[31-Aug-18 09:56 AM] Smith#5802
Name it like a project or something

[31-Aug-18 09:58 AM] Smith#5802
Something like a Pirate Protocol or something, just not a new chain/coin

I think I will want to launch a PirateStakedKMDSmith chain

[31-Aug-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  I wonder if the name could be that long

[31-Aug-18 10:03 AM] Smith#5802
I get the intention, just felt a bit wow and wtf when I saw so many chains under the ecosystem channel

[31-Aug-18 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how many ERC20's are there?

[31-Aug-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make that coin btw.. it doesnt work... the name must have some limit of length

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Smith#5802
I can launch a Chain but the problem is that probably I will only get my mum to buy it

[31-Aug-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well, tbh... its kind of if not impossible to buy PIRATE. Thats why i have not bothered to mine any.

And as far as that goes too, its more of a collectors item maybe, I mean I have a fair bit of staked, but I'm not looking to sell any of it any time soon. Its not really for that.

[31-Aug-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will give it away to people willing/able to help us with it.

[31-Aug-18 10:10 AM] jorian#4555
exactly. for PIRATE as it is now, it doesn't have a lot of use cases, other than to transfer it to someone else without anyone but you and the other party seeing it. if you can find a use case that really needs this functionality, then a chain like PIRATE can be made with one line of code and you're good to go.

[31-Aug-18 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
it would be awesome if we could have a zk-snarks only chain that is accepted as payment at coinpayments or sth

[31-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Smith#5802
If there are endless new users and money coming in

[31-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Smith#5802
I guess we can all create a new chain and sell it to some noobs

[31-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Smith#5802
If it's testing, why its tradable

[31-Aug-18 10:14 AM] jorian#4555
well it's not, at least not for PIRATE

[31-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Smith#5802
Anything that's not designed to be destroyed is not testing

[31-Aug-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED may be tradable in the future, but there are huge problems to solve for that to happen.

[31-Aug-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need more people to use it aswell to be worth it... Right now its just a competiion between a few people to see who can get the most 😄

[31-Aug-18 10:16 AM] Smith#5802
When more chains coming out, I will create a Hopium chain

[31-Aug-18 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the idea of PIRATE chain came from the chat while talking in #ask-jl777 
I guess we wanted to have a real blockchain network which is only zk-SNARSKS tx only,
so that we can actually make live transactions and play and try things by trial and error, and not just simulate and talk in words about ideas.

[31-Aug-18 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What do you want hopium to do?

Make one transaction and all your coins are "hooked" forever :trollface:

[31-Aug-18 10:19 AM] Smith#5802
When everyone is rekt, they get to inhale one hopium on Twitter with one Hopium coin

[31-Aug-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[31-Aug-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how do we define rekt ?

[31-Aug-18 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we can prove rekt, the faucet contract can dispense a coin to them.

[31-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Smith#5802
Down 50% on Hopium exchange

[31-Aug-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
aha... whenever an address has transactions that end up at 1 sat... a free coin is given out.

[31-Aug-18 10:21 AM] Smith#5802
Shit that's a freaking awesome idea
