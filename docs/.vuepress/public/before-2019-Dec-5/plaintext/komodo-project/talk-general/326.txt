@modereck the Komodo Team is working hard on it.

[05-Jun-19 08:45 PM] madjester#0881
Any ETA on when funds will be sent back to owners?

[05-Jun-19 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
@madjester not yet

[05-Jun-19 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
an announcement will be made once the fire has been put out entirely

[05-Jun-19 08:46 PM] modereck#4269
@TwilightPunkster K64  I  have no doubt for sure and they get it

[05-Jun-19 08:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
main priority now is securing funds

[05-Jun-19 08:48 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@madjester there is no ETA yet.

[05-Jun-19 08:48 PM] LesDudis#3792
good job handling this so far guys, keep it up

[05-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Mr. HashEm#3357
It's a big leap for the project.

[05-Jun-19 08:59 PM] lluisin#7655
It seems only 8-9mil KMD were affected, while the supply is 114mil.

[05-Jun-19 09:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
100 kmd is a lot to someone

[05-Jun-19 09:02 PM] lluisin#7655
Agree, but i thought this was worse. This is not going to damage KMD long term

[05-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
most of that 8M was protected by the devs.  8-9M stolen could be really bad, less than 1M stolen is very recoverable

[05-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im just worried about my KMD on digitalprice now

[05-Jun-19 09:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Alexfrog don't be. Stay calm, the Komodo Team is working hard on finding solutions. And we - Komodore64 - will help in every way that we can.

[05-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah

[05-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i am working on a plan to restore 80%+ of funds, which will be painful, but survivable for all

[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i want to protect the small accounts with 100% coverage

[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the larger ones, we need to socialize the loss so 90% for the people whose funds got swept, 80% for those who got stolen. make up the different with 5% APR from late claimers and I will chip in 500k

[05-Jun-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it should all work out, but we need to verify that the damage is indeed at the 1 mil KMD level

[05-Jun-19 09:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if the hacker has KMD that they cannot move to sell, and its all visible because its public, you might be able to negotiate with them in some way

[05-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I think in 2014 all the NXT got hacked from some shitty exchange, and they got like 80% of it back

[05-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Keppie#5156
Was wondering the same. He's sitting on a pile of cash he can't use. He might be willing to trade

[05-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Llama#1330
were the losses only on digitalprice, or did they get into other wallets too?

[05-Jun-19 09:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps users can set a repayment date on claims, to faciliate building the repayment fund @jl777c

[05-Jun-19 09:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would be fine "staking" my repayment for 3-6 months to help the other users and myself.

[05-Jun-19 09:21 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I was planning to keep this announcement for a lot later, but as the CEO of Komodore64, I can give you the following statement.
When Ben Fairbank visited us in the Netherlands, we put some things in writing - but also had some verbal agreements. That there will be a Komodo Foundation and that K64 will migrate to a Komodo "Enterprise" edition in the future. 

For other projects, I have requested our advisor, Lord Ajay Sharma from ASR ventures, former president of Rotary to find the right people to take chair in what we call the K64 Foundation. We already have found a suitable secretary who will be announced on June 14th, and two other positions are still in negotiation. As soon as its passed legal procedures - notary, statutes - the K64 foundation will donate to Komodo Foundation to ensure its health.

Do not worry. Let the Komodo Team investigate and perform fact-finding. We will overcome this.

Together we are strong.

@FishyGuts is it safe to use the Verus agama for ARRR coins too?

[05-Jun-19 09:25 PM] lwkl72#7664
@jl777c digitalprice will be first refunded or last

[05-Jun-19 09:25 PM] lwkl72#7664
Because this big account but with many small

[05-Jun-19 09:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
@cryptojace yes

[05-Jun-19 09:28 PM] cryptojace#7102
@mrlynch thank you will send from old agama to verus agama üëç

[05-Jun-19 09:29 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@lwkl72 when Komodo Team is ready, they will announce it as soon as possible. As James already said, that plans are being made. Once they are ready, you will find it back in the announcements here and at DigitalPrice.

[05-Jun-19 09:30 PM] lwkl72#7664
Ok

[05-Jun-19 09:30 PM] lwkl72#7664
Thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:33 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
Are KMD funds safe if you only used native mode and never did a seed for lite mode?

[05-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Alexfrog#1338
no, move them

[05-Jun-19 09:37 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if you used agama in any way move everything

[05-Jun-19 09:39 PM] kp#3190

Hi. I've got problems with Agama. The switch to 0.6 Verus version in order to secure my lovely KMD coins. Then, I send them to the new wallet, but they never arrived. Now I 'm getting this notification at my old wallet

[05-Jun-19 09:47 PM] marv101#8481

[05-Jun-19 09:48 PM] marv101#8481
Isn't that much text actually: "blockchain.address.get_balance"

[05-Jun-19 09:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
spv servers might also be overloaded

[05-Jun-19 09:48 PM] kp#3190
i see

[05-Jun-19 09:48 PM] marv101#8481
I did acruve komodo in verus agama

[05-Jun-19 09:49 PM] kp#3190
is it safe for me to send JUMBLR from rekt agama there either way?

[05-Jun-19 09:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
send to new address.. if it's not supported by verus agama now you will be able to retrieve it at a later date with your new secure seed

[05-Jun-19 09:49 PM] kp#3190
great, thx

[05-Jun-19 09:50 PM] marv101#8481
I couldn't send my coins. What can I do? It stuck for about 40 minutes now

[05-Jun-19 09:50 PM] kp#3190
üò© seems like web wallet is down

[05-Jun-19 09:52 PM] kp#3190

[05-Jun-19 09:57 PM] marv101#8481
@mrlynch  It seems my transaction stuckfrom the old wallet to the verus agama. This is keep popping up: "blockchain.address.get_balance"

[05-Jun-19 09:57 PM] jcooper#1100
So this is still an issue?

[05-Jun-19 09:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
@marv101 you can't send from agama

[05-Jun-19 09:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
you need to import your seed in verus agama and send to a new safe address

[05-Jun-19 09:59 PM] marv101#8481
I did send it already

[05-Jun-19 09:59 PM] jcooper#1100
Is pirate affected?

[05-Jun-19 09:59 PM] jcooper#1100
Is this just 3.6 issue? Can we use an older agama?

[05-Jun-19 10:00 PM] marv101#8481
When I do import the old seed into the verus agama, will my transaction be confirmed?

[05-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
jcooper, use veruscoin's version of agama, make a new pirate address, move to it

[05-Jun-19 10:03 PM] marv101#8481
But, watch out... apperently the coins you send my stuck with an error notification. That y situation

[05-Jun-19 10:05 PM] jcooper#1100
@Alexfrog I just dl the wallet from veruscoin.io

@marv101 please copy paste the exact question

[05-Jun-19 10:12 PM] jcooper#1100
@gcharang thx

[05-Jun-19 10:14 PM] kp#3190
any chance that atomicexplorer's web wallet gets up again?

[05-Jun-19 10:14 PM] kp#3190
i really cant move my jumblr, rev etc unless it goes up

[05-Jun-19 10:19 PM] gcharang#6833

@gcharang problem is that my Verus wallet cant connect

[05-Jun-19 10:20 PM] kp#3190
and syncing native will take ages

[05-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@marv101 verus isn‚Äôt for sending

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It‚Äôs for storing them safely for a very short period of time until new agama wallet is out

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then you can just import verus address private keys into new wallet

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@kp same thing as above

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just use litemode

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It‚Äôs temporary safe address to hold funds

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] kp#3190
pls try litemode yourself
