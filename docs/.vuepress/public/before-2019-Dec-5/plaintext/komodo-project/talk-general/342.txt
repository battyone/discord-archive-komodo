So may be older mining pools are sending outstanding payments of KMD.

[07-Jun-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for now i am only doing the special tx from 1) of the three parts

[07-Jun-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
will be sending it to all addresses, so even if you get it it doesnt mean there is no dispute

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] Allen#8663
Ok,. I will keep you posted. I am already logged in to safer version of agama.

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
step 2) is up to each person to send at least 0.0001 to the claim address

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] Allen#8663
BTW, I'm a huge fan of you Mr J777.

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
once somebody does that, i can manually test 3), after that works, i will automate the rest, but after i analyze all the claims for disputes

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
that will definitely take a long time

[07-Jun-19 11:57 AM] tafen#3000
I made the request "Agama 5th June Missing Funds Claim". But I did not understand what to do next ...

[07-Jun-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can go ahead and send the special tx 2) at any time

[07-Jun-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain itself will keep track of the progress

[07-Jun-19 11:58 AM] Keppie#5156
@tafen Now you wait & follow the discord channel. Check latest pinned post

[07-Jun-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it also validates you have access to the privkey and used the correct claim address from the form, and also will prevent a double refund using the second vout in the special tx as an indicator as to whether the refund was sent

[07-Jun-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
so by looking at the status of your special tx from 1), you can tell if the refund is processed

[07-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Allen#8663
Sounds like a plan @jl777c

[07-Jun-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so far it is less than 150 lines of code

[07-Jun-19 12:00 PM] tafen#3000
Follow this room, or the information will be in some other?

[07-Jun-19 12:00 PM] Allen#8663
@tafen follow pinned post

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@tafen what language?

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Keppie#5156
So the 0.0001kmd is only sendable to the given destination address?

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe someone that speaks the same can explain in that language

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I haven't received any tx id yet

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
altough I have more than 77 kmd

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@Keppie you can send to any address but if not valid the refund wont work

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Keppie#5156
Clear

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it would go into the disputed category

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
please wait, if you have more than 7 KMD

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@jl777c  is it possible to change still my claiming addr

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
generatng the script now

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
or not?

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you can change it, but do it soon

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I already submitted the claim form

[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
or rather, dont send the special tx 2) until it is updated

[07-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
a few days ago

[07-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Keppie#5156
@Buddz1993 check your browser history & search for doc.google

[07-Jun-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i will only check for validity AFTER you send the 2) tx to the claim address

[07-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Keppie#5156
you can edit your claim

[07-Jun-19 12:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Yea I'm in a different PC now

[07-Jun-19 12:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I did that fro main laptop at home

[07-Jun-19 12:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but I prefer to use and addr from the verus agama rather than the one I have which is from Magum wallet

[07-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Keppie#5156
I believe @jl777c  said the most recent claim form will be used. If so, you can make a new claim

[07-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My brother received 0,0002 at 13:29

[07-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll have him send to his new claim address so you can check if scripts are working

[07-Jun-19 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
my bro had just his intrest from last tx, so was <7kmd

[07-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent started the send yet. it will also take about an hour to complete

[07-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
So if I Make a new claim with the new claim addr they will use this one?

[07-Jun-19 12:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the most recent one?

[07-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the tx for 1) has started. sending to all over the next hour or so. I will post when it is completed

[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ok Cool will sort that out today.

[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Keppie#5156
To all addr with <7777 kmd ?

[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
all addresses

[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i figure we can get 1) and 2) done ahead of time and 3) will take me the most time to get sorted so we can overlap people doing 2) and me coding for 3)

[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that should shave a couple days of this refund process

[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Allen#8663
I see form has changed a bit. I had filled it yesterday. Do I need to fill it again?

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Keppie#5156
No need to @Allen

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, this sort of iterative coding/debugging is basically my typical day. just usually doesnt have 8 million directly at stake

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Allen#8663
Thank you/

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] tafen#3000
As I understand it, after I made a request for a refund, I have to wait for a special transaction to my old address and then transfer some amount of money to a new address. After that, I have to wait for a refund to my new address on June 15th. Right? I apologize for my not very good knowledge of the language, but I am learning.

[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Allen#8663
Correct.

[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Keppie#5156
'a new address' being the address you mentioned on the form

[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Keppie#5156
destination address

[07-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@jl777c the address being used to send the 0,0003 kmd is R9JCEd6xnCxNUSpLrHEWvzPSh7CNXm7z75

[07-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Right?

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] 22naru#4311
hello, readying about the issue, i have some q: i can send safe my coins from agama  v.0.3.4-beta to any new adress?

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Allen#8663
No, @22naru  use the version mentioned in second pinned post.

[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@Cryptoon yes! it should have 3 outputs

[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] tafen#3000
Thanks for the help. I hope for a successful solution to my problem. Unfortunately, I canâ€™t sleep until now until 15, I have entrusted all my savings to the Komodo coin . And bought them for $3

[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
first one to your compromised address, the second is the refund marker. it will change to (S) after the refund is sent

[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so i just submitted a new claim from with the new claim addr

[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the form was quite different than the last one I did

[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i have not even started on reconciling the claims data

[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
more intuitive I guess

[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be days before I will be able to do more and a few tests

[07-Jun-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i will post here when i process a batch, based on size

[07-Jun-19 12:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its Ok as long as my claim addr gets updated ðŸ˜ƒ

[07-Jun-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so after I post that all undisputed claims < size is processed , if yours wasnt, then it is disputed

[07-Jun-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as someone posts a txid of their special tx 2), i can start on 3)

[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Let's see the only thing I changed there was the claim addr which is now the Verus Agama addr instead of the magnum wallet

[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the rest is exactly the same

[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Keppie#5156
That's fine

[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
I will start from the most up to data claims data before sending out anything more than small test claims

[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Keppie#5156
@Cryptoon Did you manage to send the kmd to the destination address ?

[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ok.

[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
RWXL82m4xnBTg1kk6PuS2xekonu7oEeiJG Sent in one TX 3 payments: 
1 to old compromised address (U)
1 to new claim address (U)
1 to RWXL82m4xnBTg1kk6PuS2xekonu7oEeiJG that is (S)

[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Keppie not my address, but urging the person who's it it to do so promptly so jl can do more testing

[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] tafen#3000
Guys, how long after the request can I hope to get a test transaction?

[07-Jun-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
within an hour all the special tx 1) should be sent

[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] tafen#3000
Well, thank you very much. I will wait...

[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
266 of 1100 have been sent out so far

[07-Jun-19 12:27 PM] p.#1126
@jl777c  you are handling this situation very well, thank you.

[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks. this isnt my first rodeo (hacker attack crisis)

[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
until you have been through one, nobody knows if you are able to handle such pressures

[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] 22naru#4311
can i send my kmd to magnum wallet + ledger ..... without issues or 1st i need to send to versus agama and after i can do what i want?

[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you still have funds in your agama address?

[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] 22naru#4311
yes

[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, send it anywhere is fine

[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
magnum+ledger is a good choice

[07-Jun-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing else for you to do, the most work is by people who had their funds swept

[07-Jun-19 12:30 PM] 22naru#4311
ok thx  for all the good work
