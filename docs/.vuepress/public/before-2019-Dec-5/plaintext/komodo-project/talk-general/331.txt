Coin Name(s), Address(es), Balance & TXID(s) *
Please write them in one line. If you have multiple coins or multiple addresses, add them in separate line (press Enter to start a new line). Include "Coin Name - Address - Amount - TXID of the funds leaving the wallet   .......Is that serious I have 35 accounts that I manage  and each had 10 additional assets ...asset is missing everywhere and I do not know exactly which...that takes foreveruntil I have it all together There are no other options ???

[06-Jun-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@peddycb we need information to validate claims. With that many addresses and assets in each, scripting the output would be more efficient.

Hi just a quick simple question so i can get this one out of my head: All my KMD's were lost in Digital Price hack yesterday, apparently I transferred my coins as a precaution from Agama to DP just in time to be lost there. Do i personally have to do something, fill the form or anything? Or will it be dealt by DP and Komodo team? Just want to be sure I have done everything right.

[06-Jun-19 06:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Keytothegate please check with DP support at https://digitalprice.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
If your funds were held by DP at time of loss, I believe that the claim will be processed through DP and they will pass it on to their customers

[06-Jun-19 06:56 AM] Keytothegate#8453
I'll ask around in their discord. I know they have filled the form and are collaborating with komodo team, just want to know if there's something i have to do (just freaking out a little bit).

[06-Jun-19 06:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
The storm has past, cleanup is in progress. I'd make sure to backup your old seeds/private keys just in case needed for validation, but from here it's just time to wait until claims can be securely processed

if you understand what happened in the timeline you will realize that pretty much any project would be vulnerable to such heist

[06-Jun-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
The details
The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.

How will multiple claims on same address be handled, assuming a bad actor has matched seeds with addresses?

[06-Jun-19 07:35 AM] bogybogy#3962
we understand the situation in which the komodo passed and I can say that the situation is solved with a professionaobalism envied by other projects, important and the community shows support and we see the level of education and understanding, congratulations and we should thank  for having such a project with a fabulous team

[06-Jun-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the entire community is stepping forward to help, i really appreciate it!! First step is to get everything quantified so we can make a plan, if your address was affected please make a claim as soon as possible so we can make the rescue plan. So far about half have done so

[06-Jun-19 07:47 AM] Pumtchak#0362
there is something i don't understand, the attacker patiently collected seeds as people logs in Agama, right ? so in that case, how did the team manage to exploit the same vulnerability as you had less much time to collect the seeds ...? did you hack the hacker seed list ?? ^^

[06-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
after all funds are secured, we will reveal all the details.

[06-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
many people have still not secured their funds. just because you still have funds doesnt mean it is not at risk

Hey @jl777c is this payload in agama able to load more malicious Things like trojans or Keylogger?

[06-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Kaed#8040
@jl777c Are we sure this malicious payload only affects Agama and not the whole OS ?

[06-Jun-19 09:03 AM] ca333#0118
The payload could have been anything - it was loaded **during** the runtime. In this specific case the payload did "look" for a special variable representing the seed and passed this back to the server. So even IF you had secure code reviewed the vulnerable package it wouldnt have had the malicious bits included directly - "just" a section that loads something during runtime. Common practice of blackhats to prevent post-hack analysis and forensics.

[06-Jun-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i am most thankful to all that are coming forward with generous offers to help. cant be 100% sure that 100% of funds can be restored yet, as we dont know the exact magnitude of losses, but i am working toward a 100% funds are safu plan now

@D3b0 
the security team who has done the sweep is either busy securing more accounts, assesing the damage done
or taking a little rest after 48 hours
this transaction won't prove anything if you just think about it
please wait for the claim process to start

[06-Jun-19 10:29 AM] D3b0#9761
