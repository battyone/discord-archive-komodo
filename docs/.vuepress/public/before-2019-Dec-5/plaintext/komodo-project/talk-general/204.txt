Did we get listed on Beaxy

[06-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or is he just pushing reflink 🤔

[06-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm always weary of such things :p

[06-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah I see an announcement on their twitter so it's probably legit

[06-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Release the dragon @Khilone

[06-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Khilone#5842
No I am not pushing the reflink

[06-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Khilone#5842
You can go to https://beaxy.com/registration as well 😃

[06-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Khilone#5842
Force of habit I guess lol

[06-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Would be a good method to push reflinks in several discords though 😄

[06-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Khilone#5842
I am just trying to get all the projects that listed to learn about Beaxy

[06-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Khilone#5842
So if you have any questions about it, I am happy to answer them

[06-Feb-19 07:24 PM] Khilone#5842

I am testing a proof of concept for a game that has nonfungible tokens, it also serves as a demonstration that any deterministically random single player game can be blockchain enforced and gamified at the same time. it is cli game, and for now unix only, in #cc-rogue. I just started coding this during the weekend, so it is still pretty rough

[07-Feb-19 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it means those nodes are not working right now... its just about normal.... Can be many reasons for it.

[07-Feb-19 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
a long as they are not all on the list 😅

[07-Feb-19 11:13 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yes but how to prrvent this? Its most of time the same user

[07-Feb-19 11:14 AM] coingirl87#6489
So thats an indicator for the next election?

[07-Feb-19 11:14 AM] coingirl87#6489
These people not to vote for?

[07-Feb-19 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_looks at some of those dates and sooooooo wishes he'd ran and got elected last election_

[07-Feb-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
These are the ppl to never ever vote for yes 😃 :troll:

[07-Feb-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO most of them will probably n0ot even run... as they dont seem to care so much

[07-Feb-19 12:22 PM] coingirl87#6489
I hope before next election there will be a list with all people and there node which not running?!

With the delay of elections, I think I actually ahve a chance to amke the top 7 in SH 😮 And my node was basically used for testing the first 4-5 months as I had no idead what I was doing.

Any chances of getting SuperNET listed on any of these exchanges that KMD is being listed on? (Coinbene, Beaxy, etc.)

[07-Feb-19 03:01 PM] Acura#2748
@richardt I once read that the upcoming Zaddex Exchange will list all KMD assets.

[07-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
how come there is same ppl with multiple notary nodes, shouldnt there be any rule that u can just have 1 ?

[07-Feb-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc, you shall only have one in a given region but people may vote you into multiple regions

[07-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Meyse#0952
How to check regions?

[07-Feb-19 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
link above shows regions

[07-Feb-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[07-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Meyse#0952
I mean like, how to check if this is actually true

[07-Feb-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We checked it dont worry

[07-Feb-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS has a limit to one node per person.... but that iteslf is not 100% enforcable

[07-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Meyse#0952
How can you check this?

[07-Feb-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can check where each node is ... by tracing its IP from another notary node

[07-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Meyse#0952
Physically go to the notary nodes? 🤔

[07-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Meyse#0952
Ah okay interesting

[07-Feb-19 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We actaully did check it.. it took a long time... som cheaters were found and it was rectified fast

[07-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Meyse#0952
What if you use vpn or something?

[07-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS removed regions because its to much hassle

[07-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would sloe your node down

[07-Feb-19 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you would not be able to get auto elected

[07-Feb-19 03:34 PM] Meyse#0952
Hm alright

[07-Feb-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To be a top preforming notary you need a FAST response time

[07-Feb-19 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
using a VPN would destroy that

[07-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Meyse#0952
Makes sense

[07-Feb-19 03:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is `a-team` and is in Perth Western Australia.... the most isolated city in the world ... it has struggled to remain in the top 9 of the worst preforming region. 😦 But I will not move it.

[07-Feb-19 04:03 PM] ca333#0118
i think you re doing ppl in that region a favor @blackjok3r - by giving them a close seed/sync node for all dpow coins and assetchains. so even if its not a top performing node it might be a bigger benefit for the community (in that specific geolocation) and network. e.g. if you did move your NN to a location which would turn it double as efficient you would for sure climb up the NN ranking - but would that also be the best thing for the community/network? I agree to your view.

`But I will not move it.` - and i respect it. Instead of boosting up your NN ranking your thinking beyond the ranking.

Hope this is something new node at next election thibk about

[07-Feb-19 04:11 PM] PTYX#6840
One can only hope 👍

[07-Feb-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If everyone does it the problem of being isolated and having low counts goes away

[07-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Markus#5464
what is the average votes needed to have a chance?

[07-Feb-19 04:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Maybe there Should be other metrics to judge performance if some nodes have an inherent handicap

[07-Feb-19 04:13 PM] PTYX#6840
@Markus one millon more or less if I'm not mistaken depending on the region

[07-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Markus#5464
hm okay so chances to get elected being a "nobody" is very slim i assume

[07-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Markus#5464
close to 0

@Markus you have to promote yourself well before the election

[07-Feb-19 04:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes and no...

[07-Feb-19 04:19 PM] PTYX#6840
some people got elected last year that didn't do any promoting but were part of the community in other ways

[07-Feb-19 04:19 PM] PTYX#6840
for someone that isn't active in development, marketing, or the community in general it would take promotion or you knowing a whale

[07-Feb-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
theres 64 notary nodes right? and in that votelist from 2018 so top 64 got elected?

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Top 7 in each region

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] PTYX#6840
only 32 get elected, the top 32 get to stay another year

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464
ah ok

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I won't make that u less luck... But I think I'll et the vote again

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464

“I’ll vote for you for 50 KMD”

[07-Feb-19 04:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO being just outside and winning by vote is better than just getting top counts

[07-Feb-19 04:21 PM] Markus#5464
so roughly 500k votes for EU 2018 if top 7
