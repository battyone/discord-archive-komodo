The kmd app has to be installed to connect the ledger to agama wallet... So I have to wait until they fix the problem...

[12-Jun-19 07:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Marten ledger blue is a POS

[12-Jun-19 07:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just buy a ledger s, put 24 words into that then use https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/ to claim. After the 15th the fees will be changed to 0%

HERE'S WHAT WORKED BEST FOR ME. After struggling with the instructions and thinking I was an idiot because no server would work, I downloaded the Utrum wallet (thanks to @Deleted User ), entered my compromised seed, and my KMD was there. I immediately transferred to Ledger until this mess gets fixed. The servers being down adds to the complexity of the problem.

I'm beginning to think that wallets are almost as risky as storing on an exchange. The exception is hard wallets. The little dab of money I'm making from interest by keeping funds on different wallets is not worth the risk for me. Perhaps I'll gain more trust down road.

Just wanted to pop in and say AMAZING JOB to the Komodo team dealing with the recent hack and reclaim process. Thank you very much. I'm very impressed with the integrity and competence of the core team. Sucks there are low life thieves out there but I'm very confident Komodo will learn and be even better going forward. So glad to be sharing the future with you guys in this amazing space. :Komodo: üöÄ @jl777c

Yesterday, one user, @jl777c#5801, DM me with an offer to double claim my KMD. He was impersonating @jl777c and notice that the real jl777c has #5810 as his discord user number. The scammer has 5801. Careful out there.

Announcement, the Atomic Labs Ledger reward claim app is now free to use üéâ

In light of recent events we want to encourage more secure asset storage, so hopefully this can convince a few more people to move over to hardware wallets, and give the users who are now moving over an easy way to claim.

It‚Äôs totally free, we take no cut, try it out: https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

You have @hyperDEX  (Pondsea) mainly to thank for this. He funded me to develop it out of his own pocket and was hoping to make his money back with the fees. He‚Äôs nowhere near breaking even but has decided to remove the fees for the benefit of the community.

Ty hyperdex sir

[13-Jun-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the number of refund claims is way down, i only see 6 ready to process. I think after today, we will go to a twice per week schedule, so make sure to get your refund claim in and send the smartdust to the new address you claimed

[13-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
after today, i think the next will be the 18th of June

[13-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
this will allow us to shift over to the assetchains

[13-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 07:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
an assetchain can have channel-CC for instant payments

[13-Jun-19 07:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
in future there may be even more options but that will take time

[13-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg#3393
@KomodoWorld ok, that sounds good. i personally think that this function komodo would move even more into the focus of the masses

Hello, has the Komodo team started refunding the swept BTC yet? 
I couldn't find anything about it in the channel.
Thanks

[13-Jun-19 10:29 AM] rob#8269
Hi. Received email from Komodo freshdesk support to download new v06013 verus pbaa

[13-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
not yet, that will need to be a manual process to do BTC refunds

[13-Jun-19 10:29 AM] rob#8269
Do I need to uninstall previous agama first ?

[13-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
a good idea, just dont lose your passphrase or wallet.dat

[13-Jun-19 10:31 AM] rob#8269
So uninstall my previous agama 036b

An may I know where is the wallet dat located ? Hi

[13-Jun-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if lite mode, no wallet.dat

[13-Jun-19 10:34 AM] Yassin#3685
if native mode, for windows go here C:\Users\......\AppData\Roaming

[13-Jun-19 10:37 AM] mrlynch#5735
data dir is in the following folders depending on OS:
- Linux
`~/.komodo`

- Windoz:
`%AppData%\Komodo`

- MacOS:
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo`

[13-Jun-19 10:38 AM] rob#8269
For windows version. The downloaded file is a zip file. Correct ?

[13-Jun-19 10:40 AM] rob#8269
Windows. Appdata Komodo default directory for the wallet.dat !?

[13-Jun-19 10:40 AM] rob#8269

[13-Jun-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. we made an update that forced the hacker to spend the stolen funds and thus validating the claims of all the users that said they were stolen from. We know this as all the stolen funds got grouped together, so whoever did that had all the privkeys and it is just not believable that all the users who got stolen from are sharing privkeys

[13-Jun-19 10:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Those are ALL the stolen fudns?

[13-Jun-19 10:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[13-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all the identified ones, maybe there are a few more

[13-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
but after all this time, it would require the user to not notify us and also for it to be a new pattern of theft, all those utxo had a similar pattern

[13-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Kaed#8040
But what will happen to the stolen funds ?

[13-Jun-19 10:55 AM] rob#8269
Hmm I try to Chk balance from a weblink by support. The Bal oso 0.00

[13-Jun-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
to prevent KMD from becoming non-fungible (by marking those funds as separate), i would like to just "write off" those funds as a bounty to the hacker. the hacker has proven he is clever and patient enough that over time he would be able to sell of small amounts at a time anyway. or just over 12 years the 5% APR will almost double it

[13-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not like we can stop him anyway
