current iguana notarizer is pretty complex as it evolved over the years. definitely can be improved and actually we were thinking it a good idea that a new version be written from scratch.

[18-Oct-18 04:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
Thank you @jl777c, glad there are devs like you and not ignorant and building such technology and making it better and better.

[18-Oct-18 04:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
It is very interesting for me and to understand the architecture of iguana. For me it is a big honour to one day i hope see a improvement in the new iguana i helped with. I wrote before now its good to show small pow tokens how DPOW can safe them. From attacker standpoint DPOW is nightmare

@forkwitch glad to hear that üòÉ

[18-Oct-18 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
üòÉ that was my goal, to make attacking a dPoW chain to make the big headache that the attacker would just attack some other coin

[18-Oct-18 05:00 AM] forkwitch#6080
You reached your goal! üôÇ I needed 3 attack trials and first two i failed to reorg because a notarisation happened during my 51 session. This is when attacker becomes nervous and hands start shaking. With the dpowconfs from the fsm codes attacker will curse Komodo Platform and DPOW.

[18-Oct-18 05:04 AM] forkwitch#6080
All hackers gonna be mad on you jl777c. You made a Blockchain POW firewall auto-checkpoint machine with btc security. Attack simply not affordable but foremost not funny

Do i read and understand this correct?  With the CC technology of Komodo i can design any boolean circuit with whatever logical gates i want that means fully touring complete??

[18-Oct-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Oct-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it allows to add new consensus rules and as long as you have a boolean evaluator it will work

[18-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
many example CC, each about 1000 lines of code that extend the normal consensus rules with a new vout type

[18-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
when spent the vout evalcode validation must be passed and return true. the C/C++ code that executes on validation can do whatever code inside the daemon can do

[18-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
miketout of verus, solve the Nothing at Stake problem with one CC

[18-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
channels CC is a better variant of Lightning Network for low cost chains

[18-Oct-18 05:13 AM] forkwitch#6080
THis is interesting. THen i can provide data to my circuit (if i understand correct any data that can be from blockchain or other sources) and the processing gets evaluated.

after this i have the result from the circuit because it knows the evalution and if its gonna be true or false result

[18-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC gets offchain data onchain and your CC can use that data

[18-Oct-18 05:14 AM] forkwitch#6080
this is really more interesting

[18-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes dPoW is just needed to have secure chains

[18-Oct-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
CC allows to make a revolutionary new blockchain, with 1% of the effort as the 99% of the normal coin behavior is already implemented

[18-Oct-18 05:16 AM] forkwitch#6080
I believe maybe in some time dPoW will be interconnected with CC. If i can i would use notarisation information in my circuits for security layer. Then CC uses also the DPOW info for more security.

[18-Oct-18 05:16 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on gateways CC that will tokenize external coins and it is almost fully decentralized, also 1:1 sidechains are in the near term goals so legacy coins can continue to trade on exchangs, but to use with CC you swap it for the sidechain

[18-Oct-18 05:17 AM] forkwitch#6080
gateways CC will connect the different CC chains?

[18-Oct-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
The CC already are calling internal functions that can determine notarization happened or not, we do need to implement that, but it wont be hard

[18-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC would allow to tokenize BTC onchain of the CC chain. then you do CC things to the BTC tokens and when done can redeem it back to a BTC address

[18-Oct-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically any bitcoin protocol coin can be gatewayed onchain. it is an improved version of multigateway from 4 years ago

[18-Oct-18 05:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
I believe i understand the idea. WIth gateway CC i can make my CC chain with my new consensus. Now i want to trade and do things on the real chain. I can use gateway CC to turn my CC token into real bitcoin like a swap beacuse the system accepts it as a peg.

[18-Oct-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
CC in general allows you to create a new consensus rule

[18-Oct-18 05:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
Improved version of multigateway from 4 years ago.... i dont know the multigateway

[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC in specific has the ruleset so that externally deposited BTC is converted into onchain tokens (from assets CC), the other ruleset is that the BTC tokens that are redeemed are sent to the designated BTC address

[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so using the gateways CC and a set of BTC custodian nodes, you can get a BTC equivalent token onchain

[18-Oct-18 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
this then allows betting or whatever with the BTC equivalent token, ie. giving all the powers of CC to the BTC

[18-Oct-18 05:22 AM] forkwitch#6080
Now understood! Thanks for explanation

[18-Oct-18 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the various CC are able to use each other so can be combined, the gateways CC uses the oracles CC to get the merkle data from BTC, that way it can validate a BTC deposit was actually made, using only onchain data

[18-Oct-18 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
really, your imagination is the only thing that limits what a CC can do

[18-Oct-18 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
best part is with very small amount of code you can test a live chain with the new consensus

[18-Oct-18 05:26 AM] forkwitch#6080
There are no limits. The creation of hybrid blockchain systems is a exciting vision of this CC technology

[18-Oct-18 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and once it has dPoW it can be secure enough for realworld use.

[18-Oct-18 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810

Dont understand me wrong. DPOW is cool thing and big help for the POW world. But CC i believe you all underestimate it. I am reading ref specifications. I am impressed

[18-Oct-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it acts as a "GDP based" inflation tax

[18-Oct-18 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
I personally believe CC is one of the biggest things in blockchain in the last few years, much more than dPoW

@forkwitch  in your first tweet you asked KMD for  permission to attack emc2, did you get that? I doubt

[18-Oct-18 06:04 AM] forkwitch#6080
I requested permission and got permission from Komodo Team! I have proofs!

[18-Oct-18 06:04 AM] sipecusa#7970
could I see it here?

[18-Oct-18 06:06 AM] forkwitch#6080
I have got permission for a 51% pentest. I was asked to not double spend or exclude transactions which i did not.

[18-Oct-18 06:06 AM] sipecusa#7970
how you could double spend when emc2 wallet on all  exchanges is disabled

[18-Oct-18 06:06 AM] sipecusa#7970
so who gave you permission

[18-Oct-18 06:18 AM] forkwitch#6080
some here posted earlier: it happens also during normal mining

[18-Oct-18 06:18 AM] sipecusa#7970
Lets talk openly here. So many things are wrong here:
- first it is wrong to ask komodo if you could attack emc2
- second emc2 is in the process of deploying dPoW and was not done, no test is welcome
- many people are moving coins from Poloniex to other wallets, and they might be on wrong chain now and not able to move  if Poloniex does not upgrade the wallet. They said they will, yet to see.

It was asked to test DPOW. Not to attack emc2.
- second emc2 is in the process of deploying dPoW and was not done, no test would is welcome
This is nothing against emc2.
- many people are moving coins from Poloniex to other wallets, and they might be on wrong chain now and not able to move  if Poloniex does not upgrade the wallet. They said they will, yet to see.
Longest chain = longest chain and has not anything to do with todays reorg test

[18-Oct-18 06:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
Komodo Team did not authorize to attack a token. They authorized to test DPOW. Excuse for misunderstanding.

[18-Oct-18 06:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
As a team member I can say on our behalf we did not authorize any attack on emc2 or any third party chain save for self spawned assetchains .  In fact we chastised geocold for not thinking of the potential ramifications if something were to happen.
