i'm not going to make fans by saying this: if it works for you, use ocean

[30-May-19 09:34 PM] 0x03#8822
agama _is_ clunky *ducks*

[30-May-19 09:35 PM] atlas#9008
I just need a wallet to store my kmd

[30-May-19 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm hard-headed and stuck in my ways

[30-May-19 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Try ocean

[30-May-19 09:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Let us know how it is

[30-May-19 09:36 PM] atlas#9008
A am new, just want to know from you guys

[30-May-19 09:36 PM] 0x03#8822
oof, all i will do is confuse you. so i'll shut up now üòÉ

[30-May-19 09:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I can only speak to agama, which can have big problems on older systems

[30-May-19 09:36 PM] atlas#9008
Ocean is from a third party?

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Kolo or somebody?

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Somebody within the ecosystem

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or was it ptyx

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@PTYX

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
decker

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
and ocean

[30-May-19 09:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I like agama

[30-May-19 09:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Been using it since 2017

[30-May-19 09:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Heard good things about ocean as well

[30-May-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
@Hollowman9000 have you used Agama within the past couple months?

[30-May-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
a long way since "clunky" IMO

[30-May-19 09:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No, still using an older version

[30-May-19 09:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So I guess I can‚Äôt speak to shit

[30-May-19 09:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@atlas use Agama lite mode only. Fastest and no blockchain data download required
all you have to do is, create a new wallet which will give you 24 words seed phrase, write it down somewhere safe. this will always generate same address as long as you don't add or remove any words or space

[30-May-19 09:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@atlas older versions were clunky

[30-May-19 09:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
fin

[30-May-19 09:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@Hollowman9000 which version you are using now?

[30-May-19 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôd have to boot it up and see

[30-May-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
0.3.2 or similar wont work

[30-May-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
electrum implementation has been upgraded

[30-May-19 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was shortly after interest button was unfucked

[30-May-19 09:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nov 18?  Aug 18?

[30-May-19 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
sounds very old

[30-May-19 09:42 PM] atlas#9008
@SHossain thanks. Is the ico.komodoplatform.com not available anymore?

[30-May-19 09:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now that‚Äôs ancient history

[30-May-19 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
that is long gone

[30-May-19 09:43 PM] atlas#9008
I thinks i still have to claim

[30-May-19 09:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ehh

[30-May-19 09:44 PM] 0x03#8822
agama has improved, i ack that.

[30-May-19 09:44 PM] 0x03#8822
it still has no 'coin control' dialog tho

[30-May-19 09:44 PM] atlas#9008
I have a 12 word phassphrase. I think it is the seed. Is that possible?

[30-May-19 09:44 PM] PTYX#6840
Chameleon is the lite cousin of Agama

[30-May-19 09:44 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have the 12 words seed from ico dashboard, use that to login into Agama. if you don't then there is nothing can be done anymore after few years

[30-May-19 09:45 PM] atlas#9008
Ahhh

[30-May-19 09:45 PM] atlas#9008
Thanks

[30-May-19 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
get the latest wallet 0.3.6b and follow this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026360-restoring-an-address-in-agama-lite-spv-mode-with-a-wallet-seed-or-private-key

[30-May-19 09:46 PM] atlas#9008
I will

[30-May-19 09:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You don‚Äôt have any Sasha Ivanov assets do you?

[30-May-19 09:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
From Nxt

[30-May-19 10:03 PM] atlas#9008
@SHossain the guide says enter the 24 word seed. I suppose i have to enter the 12 word phassphrase i have.?

[30-May-19 10:03 PM] atlas#9008
at this step

[30-May-19 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
don't worry, you can use either 12 or 24 or any other number of words phrase

[30-May-19 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
24 is being the new standard

[30-May-19 10:04 PM] atlas#9008
ok, thanks, just checking

[30-May-19 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
while 12 is secure, 24 for just being extra protective.

[30-May-19 10:08 PM] atlas#9008
@SHossain before i proceed. I read that a pin file is going to be created. Is it possible to restore the coins in case i loose the pinfile?

[30-May-19 10:08 PM] atlas#9008
restore with the 12 word phassprhrase?

[30-May-19 10:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, your passphrase is the key

[30-May-19 10:09 PM] SHossain#0007
pinfile is only for easy access with a password

[30-May-19 10:09 PM] atlas#9008
ok

[30-May-19 10:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
@0x03 i used to use gpg, but depending on my peers i just sent e-mails to myself :abusedsmily:

[31-May-19 07:22 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
I started using agama for kmd and arrr in full mode. What I noticed is that I can bypass the pin by adding kmd and/or arrr, let it sync and voila, I‚Äôm presented with both balances ( kmd and arrr). What‚Äôs the recommended way to prevent this? Apart from that everything works fine.

[31-May-19 07:25 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
Full mode = native mode

[31-May-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Current functionality of pin in native mode is just saved coins preset protection but not wallet.dat access restriction

[31-May-19 08:57 AM] hastrup#8742
Was it this or next week the realese of mobile dex? Am a bit confused about the wording in the announcement.

[31-May-19 10:10 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
@TonyL I'm thinking of creating a symlink for the wallet directory to a luks encrypted disk/usb? Would that be a feasible option?

[31-May-19 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/encrypt-wallet.html#how-to-encrypt-komodo-wallet-dat-with-password-to-make-it-more-secure there is a `encryptwallet` call for thing which you expected from Agama

[31-May-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
But I advice you to make unencrypted wallet copy first (you can place it in some cold storage)

[31-May-19 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ql2do/350_bitcoins_encrypted_walletdat_deleted_lost/ there is a lot of sad stories like this, so be careful with wallet.dat manipulations

@TonyL Thanks for that. That's helpful and would sort out security for kmd. However, ARRR is not based on a ac_public chain and this wallet only holds z-addresses. So, that's a no-go for ARRR, unfortunately.

[31-May-19 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Hold most on some cold storage, smaller sum too which you might need access fast store in hot storage, thats my advice

[31-May-19 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats how exchanges do for example

[31-May-19 10:30 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
Hmmh, that's exactly what I previously did with kmd, until the new version of agama removed that feature üòâ But, yeah, I agree to put the bulk of coins back into cold storage and store that in an encrypted area somewhere safe. Good advice!

[31-May-19 10:32 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
I used to enter the wif key into agama to claim the rewards on a monthly basis, that's a bit of a challenge now. That's what I meant...

[31-May-19 10:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@h6y34ui98 you will get that feature (just login with wif) back in the next version

[31-May-19 10:37 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
@gcharang I love you guys üëç üòÑ

[31-May-19 10:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
current version allows it if you ./agama hardcore

[31-May-19 10:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
linux only dont know how other systems will allow it

[31-May-19 10:51 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
@hyperDEX Cool! Just tried the hardcore parameter and it's back again üòÉ That's all I need. Thanks, you're a star üåü

[31-May-19 10:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
All good!

[31-May-19 03:10 PM] modereck#4269

a guy on Telegram is writing me: Hi Acura, I am Sam Monac an associate of Ian Balina‚Äôs. We are currently creating an application with the goal of scoring all ICO‚Äôs using data and analytics. It would be greatly appreciated if you could answer a couple questions. 

Komodo is one of the highest performing ICO's of all-time and will be used to help us with our formulas.

 1. Was your token generation event 11/19/2016?
 2. Was your mainnet 01/01/2017?
 3. What was the largest bonus you gave to private investers?

[31-May-19 07:35 PM] Acura#2748
Any good answers for him? üòÑ

[31-May-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
search for timestamp of height 1 on KMD explorer for 1. mainnet was height 180000

[31-May-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i think very large investment got 5% more discount, but there was a time based discount also, open to all for the time based

[31-May-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
answered above. why do you ask the same question 4 times?

[31-May-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
