@webworker01 vbro...my KMD adress shows zero coins....its a little disconcerting...no matter what happened

[07-Jun-19 03:49 AM] klein#5233
Says he isnt new to the crypto bandwagon

[07-Jun-19 03:49 AM] QuadraQ#5617
I'm using 0.6.0-13 Agama version. How can I get the seed for my new address?

[07-Jun-19 03:49 AM] klein#5233
Never heard of z transaction

[07-Jun-19 03:49 AM] ecbuddy#8524
plus it ws wiped out by the KMD team, which I get is a noble thing to do....nevertheless...its alarming...to say the least!

It's not an ideal situation, and it is a challenge for those that are not so computer savvy to understand how to do the things in the guides without some help. The stress of the situation makes communicating it a bit more difficult, but we do what we can. The bloke who did that vid, I've personally replied to and tried to talk things through a few times. I think he's secured his funds now

I've asked him to add links to the claim form and announcement in his video descriptio so we can help his subscrivers secure their funds also

i also thinks he represents the majority of users at this point

[07-Jun-19 03:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
He recommended KMD earlier, so he's not a retard. Understands fundamentals it would seem, just not tech savvy. Plenty in crypto are not much different. We cant all be notary nerds

I consider myself decently experuienced with this stuff, and I was having a hard time synching or even installing a simple QT with KMD yesterday

[07-Jun-19 03:57 AM] ecbuddy#8524
weindows and mac, both gave issues

[07-Jun-19 03:57 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i still can not install the windows QT

[07-Jun-19 03:57 AM] ecbuddy#8524
its insane

[07-Jun-19 03:57 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i finally got the oceant QT for mac to work...but holy crap....I had issues

[07-Jun-19 03:58 AM] ecbuddy#8524
I am in PIVX as well...so I am used to problems lmao

[07-Jun-19 03:58 AM] ecbuddy#8524
but i believe it will succeed just like KMD

[07-Jun-19 03:58 AM] ecbuddy#8524
grand scheme its a minor setback, but at first glance...its all so very alarming

[07-Jun-19 04:02 AM] klein#5233
There are laws against giving people invesntment advice, which he has told people "buy komodo" I do not have a problem with non experts, I am not an expert.

[07-Jun-19 04:03 AM] klein#5233
I am not being harsh enough

[07-Jun-19 04:05 AM] cunningstunt#7258
Damn, the guy in that video is a perfect example of someone blindly investing in something they have not researched in the slightest.
Some people have too much money.

[07-Jun-19 04:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s not entirely true, but regardless I can understand why he is angry, we are trying to make the best of a bad situation and hope to get everyone their funds back

Which we do have .

[07-Jun-19 04:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
However he conflates a wallet issue ( one from outside of Komodo ) with the integrity of the platform and its developers , that’s my bone of contention .   Many other projects would have left users in the cold, we will not

[07-Jun-19 04:09 AM] klein#5233
Thank you for proving my point, this person should not be giving investment advice, doesnt know his arse hole from his ear hole

[07-Jun-19 04:09 AM] cunningstunt#7258
Any basic research will tell him that coins are written with code. He speaks like common crypto terminology is alien to him.

[07-Jun-19 04:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The fek are z transactions? 🙄

[07-Jun-19 04:09 AM] cunningstunt#7258
@klein 
Agreed. I was trying to put it more politely 😉

[07-Jun-19 04:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is all this talk still about the old guy that can't figure out how to show password using the icon? and thinks OS names are a result of giberish and redbull?

[07-Jun-19 04:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That video shows what kind of usera cryptocurrency in general need to deal with.
He is right, cryptocurrency as a whole in general is just not there yet.

[07-Jun-19 04:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodoplatform's first view point is devs. I believe others will leapfrog komodo in User Interface and User Experience terms than official komodo.

[07-Jun-19 04:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Personally have never believed mass adoption will come from normal people,   Companies and bots. Like how the rest of the internet is run.  I digress

that a random 60 year old can figure out an overly simplistic GUI is moot if no utility forms around it

[07-Jun-19 04:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
We can't put what will help mass adoption to some single or few things. It will be multiple segments.

[07-Jun-19 04:14 AM] cunningstunt#7258
Do we need people that will just dump to make a quick buck? Is that mass adoption?

I am not worried in the slightest because I do not plan to cash out for a very long time.
Sure am missing those stakes though!

[07-Jun-19 04:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also agree qith Emmanuel, but the cryptocurrency funds users are as of now special kind, and aince it's money, the level of cryptocurrencies user's knowledge and understanding kn managing their own money responsibilities with good understanding of using a tech will raise by time. They will learn by experience.

`Do we need people that will just dump to make a quick buck? Is that mass adoption?`
Imo, that's the likely "status quo", if "point and click" becomes the main focus
Utility 1st and then worry about people with allergies to "techy thingies"
Does anyone actually believe that modern microPCs masquerading as "phones" are designed for those people? No, function comes and they get drug into the future or left behind.

[07-Jun-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

fwiw, I'm not saying that there shouldn't be an "easy option", I'm just saying that if dumbing shit down becomes the main focus then all you have is a bunch of dumb shit

[07-Jun-19 04:35 AM] ecbuddy#8524
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 wrong...youhave dumbed down shit, and you have the more complex shit for those thast dont need hand holding and know how to navigate

@ecbuddy ever wonder why core only made a daemon and a QT (and literally don't even test QT 99% of the time) and have the highest market cap?

[07-Jun-19 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if BTC can do it with QT (while leaving anything else to the space at large), saying that it "needs" to be done is 💩

it's technically possible to do a lot of things with a ledger, but that doesn't mean they will push the code even when it's spoon-fed to them

[07-Jun-19 05:05 AM] klein#5233
Ok
