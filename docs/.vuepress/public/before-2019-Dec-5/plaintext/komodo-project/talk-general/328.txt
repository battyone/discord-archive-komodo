AAAAAAnyway....

From what i learnt so far: one of the upstream module used was vulnerable, like when you build wooden table, one of the part is bad, example the rusty nails/ bolts or termites infested wood.
so any other projects that use the module might also be vulnerable

But FR I don't blame anyone.  Thank goodness for a healthy wallet ecosystem and active dev team.  This could have been worse.

Waiting for official release from KMD. üòÉ

[05-Jun-19 11:28 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD team demonstrated a lot of technical skill to race the hacker to most of the coins

[05-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
so if my coins still here doesn't that mean i am somehow safe from the hack ? because hacker or devs would have withdrawn already?

[05-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if you have used the private key in agama / native agama even recently , it's safer to just move the fund

[05-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
only in native mode, maybe only lite mode affected?

[05-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If It were up to me, I won't take any chances

[05-Jun-19 11:32 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
well i got this new agama technical preview, now i am in native mode , can i just add 'new receiving address and send my funds there?

[05-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
create a new address from a new seed

[05-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
verus enhanced agama you mean?

[05-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
yeah that one from the link

[05-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it should be fine

[05-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
i got new address and new private wif key, is that alright?

[05-Jun-19 11:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, it is fine, that is the safe wallet, not affected by the whole shebangs

[05-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
only see private eky

[05-Jun-19 11:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
`So, purely as an outsider looking in, I'd be greatly concerned if coin devs could just up and take everybody's coins`
oh the hypocrisy.. go away vbk lover

[05-Jun-19 11:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Crazysoldier priv key is enough

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] modereck#4269
guys someone knows a program like gparted for windows?

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
there is no gparted for windows üò¶ searching this since 10 years üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] crunchycat#0726
so lemme get this straight

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
@modereck yes - search for `create and format partitions` in start menu

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] crunchycat#0726
KMD devs found out about the hack after the hacker only got 1 million, then they had the time to steal the other 8 before the hacker

[05-Jun-19 11:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's called disk manager i think, built in

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
alternatives are there not that nice tho üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
I really feel for these guys that they have to deal with this situation.. but hey atleast the team is able secure the funds before the hacker was able to wipe it clean üôÑ

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] crunchycat#0726
So the hacker decided to only steal 1 million then, what...he had to take a shit?  Meanwhile KMD devs swooped in and stole the rest

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@crunchycat they started trying to save funds before the 1m was taken

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
@crunchycat no, found out about the exploit, found out what the plan was through security research and then proceeded to beat him to the punch

[05-Jun-19 11:43 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Haha

[05-Jun-19 11:44 PM] crunchycat#0726
it all sounds so unrealistic

[05-Jun-19 11:44 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
i hope ahcked coins will get ban on exchanges or better taken out of supply somehow

[05-Jun-19 11:44 PM] BigCat45#4982
Does this mean we all buy Mike from now on?

[05-Jun-19 11:44 PM] crunchycat#0726
is there an effort to get the 1 million coins back?

[05-Jun-19 11:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
`it all sounds so unrealistic` yes, technical stuff does look like magic sometimes

[05-Jun-19 11:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's all a ploy to get us on verus wallet I'm sure. miketout is actually a henchman of Bill Gates

[05-Jun-19 11:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
`i hope ahcked coins will get ban on exchanges`
exchanges will most likely be notified

[05-Jun-19 11:45 PM] crunchycat#0726
No, I'm saying the much more obvious explanation is KMD team took all 9 million, then claimed 1 million was "stolen"

[05-Jun-19 11:45 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
warren buffet finally collecting his bags i guess üòõ

[05-Jun-19 11:46 PM] crunchycat#0726
LOL I'm sure he will, he's got almost 9 million to spare

[05-Jun-19 11:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
`No, I'm saying the much more obvious explanation is KMD team took all 9 million, then claimed 1 million was "stolen"`
oh fekk off already

[05-Jun-19 11:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
this is how the big boys play

[05-Jun-19 11:46 PM] crunchycat#0726
true, but prove to me they didn't also take the 1 million that was "stolen"

[05-Jun-19 11:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
if you ignore it it goes away

[05-Jun-19 11:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
that avatar is fitting though

devs are gods, they don't steal üòõ

[05-Jun-19 11:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
mate, after 30 hrs this lil shite is the last thing i wanna see

[05-Jun-19 11:47 PM] crunchycat#0726
lmao yes, they are gods and would never...

[05-Jun-19 11:48 PM] crunchycat#0726
okay so there are outside parties that can verify what actually went down?

[05-Jun-19 11:49 PM] crunchycat#0726
Well I don't have any KMD, but if I did you'd be damn sure I would demand some proof of exactly what went down and when

[05-Jun-19 11:49 PM] crunchycat#0726
tracking of the stolen coins and all that jazz

[05-Jun-19 11:49 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
my KMD are safe now so i can chill this out now üòÉ good evening guys see you next hack üòõ

@crunchycat  let us know when you get vbk's mcap up to arrr's. then you can talk shit about fishy

[05-Jun-19 11:54 PM] KanarDMD#9092
What is stopping others from claiming my "saved" tokens for themselves?  All of the transaction information is on a public ledger

[05-Jun-19 11:54 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@KanarDMD they don‚Äôt have your priv key

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] KanarDMD#9092
but the private keys were compromised, correct?

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Only to the hacker not everyone

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
lol

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I doubt the hackers going to make multiple discord‚Äôs

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
that's comforting

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Message saying these 100,000 addresses are mine

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
The team have a method

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] KanarDMD#9092
ok

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
To know who owns what

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
he'll just hit the big fish

[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Trust in them they did the right thing ‚úåÔ∏è

[05-Jun-19 11:56 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I agree.  Just sounds like a mess to sort everything out

[05-Jun-19 11:56 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I'm glad they did what they did

[05-Jun-19 11:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
@KanarDMD it will be sorted out
