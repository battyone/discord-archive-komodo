[15-Jun-18 10:44 AM] gcharang#6833
IMO It should be a small GDP country too. Its GDP must be much smaller than Bitcoin's marketcap for it to securely use Komodo's scalability solution.

[15-Jun-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why, though smaller is better

[15-Jun-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like a 51% attack can be don on all 4096 chains at once

[15-Jun-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and notarizations are not subject to double spends. they are valid or invalid and the cross chain process is designed to piggy back ontop of the notarization data

[15-Jun-18 02:05 PM] gcharang#6833
My thinking was if the country's GDP was greater or around BTC's market-cap, then the dPOW argument of securing smaller cap chains with BTC hash power(because it isn't worth it to double-spend on the smaller cap chain if it means to rewrite BTC's blockchain endpoint) goes out the window when  the chain being notarized has a similar value as BTCs then any entity that has the power(monetary/political) to mess with the notorized chain also theoretically has half the power needed to mess with BTC's chain.  Now the difference in effort required to mess with both the chains is not so great anymore. (Before the hashpower difference between notorized chain and BTC would be astronimical)

[15-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Gcharang, that has no logic whatsoever.

[15-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> It is harder to break two doors instead of one, to forcibly enter a room.

[15-Jun-18 02:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Yes but breaking two similar sized doors is a different problem than breaking open a mouse hole and a nuclear shelter.

[15-Jun-18 02:14 PM] gcharang#6833
Also the notorized chain is expecting to be reorged thats why it's opted in for notorization. So there exists an entitity that has the power to reorg this chain's endpoint. That means, if this chains' value is similar to BTC's then the entity has the level of ability to mess with BTC's chain too

[15-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> If there are 3 BTC tier blockchains (in hashpower), and either you are one of those or none, the best scenario would be notarizing in the 3 of them. The worst scenario would be notarizing in none of them.

[15-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Yes, it has, but not at the same time.

[15-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> That's the point of dPoW, redundancy of Truth.

[15-Jun-18 02:16 PM] gcharang#6833
I haven't exactly thought through the implications of having 4096 chains connected through smart contracts and notorization data being written to all of them, but this seemed to be a valid train of thought.

[15-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I have thought of it, and I think that it is a good idea. I'm sure that James can tell us more about it.

[15-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> It would be not easy to implement, that for sure.

[15-Jun-18 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I think you are assuming 100% of the GDP can be double spent at any given time. that is not realistic. So as long as the amount that is not protected by many confirmations of BTC is less than the cost for BTC reorg attack, we would be ok

[15-Jun-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a courageous change to consensus rules. I am not sure how all nodes will be able to differentiate from an attacker's private chain vs bad connectivity, nor how all nodes will reach consensus about how to deal with things that are not in consensus, since there is no consensus. Also, requiring 200 blocks is better than not, but if it means doubling the attacker's hashrate cost then it isnt cost prohibitive. I also dont like the implications that satoshi consensus is not worlking. It works fine for BTC. It just doesnt worl if you have very low hashrate.

[15-Jun-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810

@ResoluteCrypto @GemCrypto Komodo is not a BaaS Platform who are you fooling?  Poor zcash fork/clone at best. Only true BaaS Platform competing vs IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle is #Ardor. Multichain, scalable, bloat-free built on proven NXT consensus https://t.co/TB8bYHuO...

[17-Jun-18 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ARDR is just the block creation mechanism from NXT where all slave chains need to pay in ARDR to even get blocks accepted. totally bottlenecked by the ARDR nodes. also all slave chains need permission of the ARDR devs, the license is restrictive. Anyway the depth of his understanding of KMD as a pure zcash fork shows how tech (un)knowledgable they are
