Why is this the case, "Even if you have upgraded to the latest version of Agama and your KMD is in a Sapling z-address, you must still move these funds to a transparent t-address by February 15, 2019." ?

[21-Dec-18 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because after February 15, 2019, sprout z-transactions will no longer be allowed

[21-Dec-18 09:44 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
I'm talking about Sapling, not Sprout.

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Mentions it twice, "If you have KMD stored in a z-address and have already updated Agama, then you may choose to hold your funds in a Sapling z-address for the time being. However, all KMD must be moved out of z-addresses by February 15, 2019. This includes new Sapling z-addresses." is second mention.

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Week 51: Komodo Five Bullet Friday

[21-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
The source is correct.

[21-Dec-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
In the coming weeks, the Komodo team will make additional announcements regarding this new requirement. This information is being released now to ensure all members of the Komodo community have ample time to move any funds they have stored in a z-address.

[21-Dec-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm thinking that page is worded incorrectly

[21-Dec-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not sure how you get to Sapling z without a t tx

[21-Dec-18 09:48 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
ALL z-addresses will be burned it sounds like.

[21-Dec-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
not burned, there will be a claim process for sprout funds but much easier to just transfer it out directly

[21-Dec-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
99.9% of funds are already in transparent addresses, so it is only about 0.1%

[21-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody will lose their KMD in sprout addresses and nothing to do if you only have Raddresses like 99.9%

[21-Dec-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
from the article: "In the coming weeks, the Komodo team will make additional announcements regarding this new requirement. This information is being released now to ensure all members of the Komodo community have ample time to move any funds they have stored in a z-address."

[21-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
You may want to consider rewording the language to be accurate, those two sentences are inconsistent: "all KMD must be moved out of z-addresses by February 15, 2019. This includes new Sapling z-addresses" and ""Even if you have upgraded to the latest version of Agama and your KMD is in a Sapling z-address, you must still move these funds to a transparent t-address by February 15, 2019."

[21-Dec-18 10:38 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
BTW, on Saturday it was said "it would be a shame to burn your coins by not migrating to sapling".

[21-Dec-18 10:38 PM] bishop#9773
Yeah, it's confusing... makes it sound like you can't have funds in a sapling address

[21-Dec-18 10:38 PM] bishop#9773
I was waiting for the additional announcement regarding not having them in sapling addresses so the entire network is in a taddr

[21-Dec-18 10:42 PM] SHossain#0007
you still need to migrate other coins to sapling before 15th Feb 2019

[21-Dec-18 10:54 PM] bishop#9773
Yes but the comment above is saying that you can't keep your stuff in sapling addresses

[21-Dec-18 10:54 PM] bishop#9773
which makes no sense

[21-Dec-18 10:54 PM] bishop#9773
sprout is what should be stated

[21-Dec-18 10:54 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD should be only in R address

[21-Dec-18 10:55 PM] bishop#9773
why

[21-Dec-18 10:55 PM] SHossain#0007
no sprout or sapling

[21-Dec-18 10:55 PM] bishop#9773
so if you migrate from sprout to taddr to sapling, you have to move them back to taddr?

[21-Dec-18 10:55 PM] SHossain#0007

`KMD should be only in R address`
there's exactly 0 chance I'm doing that with more than 10% of mine

[21-Dec-18 10:56 PM] bishop#9773
I would like to know why the entire network is suppose to be taddr

[21-Dec-18 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
please read jl777's message above

[21-Dec-18 10:56 PM] bishop#9773
again, it doesn't say anything

[21-Dec-18 10:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, more details will be announced, but please wait

[21-Dec-18 10:56 PM] bishop#9773
ugh

[21-Dec-18 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a bit complicated so taking time to make a proper announcement especially this time of year

[21-Dec-18 10:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if we need to **keep** in t addy, then why did we see so much about migrate already (or was that **only** supposed to be for PIRATE?)?

`PIRATE is totally different`
I get that, but are you saying that it was a waste of my time to have already migrated?

[21-Dec-18 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you migrated KMD?

[21-Dec-18 11:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[21-Dec-18 11:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the good news is that sapling is fast.

[21-Dec-18 11:01 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why it was announced to prevent more funds in sapling that just need to be transferred out

[21-Dec-18 11:01 PM] bishop#9773
why do I feel like you guys are snapshotting the chain

[21-Dec-18 11:02 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no snapshot

[21-Dec-18 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
in a week or so, there will be all the details about new tech and other benefits for this

[21-Dec-18 11:02 PM] bishop#9773
ok

[21-Dec-18 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a bit longer due to new years, but certainly very early in january

[21-Dec-18 11:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_waits until Feb 14th, because he's not seeing the "benefit" of having his coinage in a t addy for the next 2 months_

[21-Dec-18 11:03 PM] bishop#9773

[21-Dec-18 11:03 PM] SHossain#0007

but absent that

[21-Dec-18 11:04 PM] bishop#9773
I'm just hoping there is a very logical reason for this and I am blown away by the reason the entire network has to be transparent. Right now, I'm 🤔

[21-Dec-18 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
security trumps rewards for the guy that lost 29k in a t addy one stupid day

[21-Dec-18 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 99.9% transparent now, but there will be new tech to solve this issue, and other benefits, but plz wait

👍 

[22-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
So what changed from six days ago to decide to remove ALL z addresses?

[22-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
It went from "no sprout z" to "no z" pretty quickly.

[22-Dec-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be ways to do private tx for KMD, but let us wait for official marketing announcements, ok?

[22-Dec-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the team has been working triple overtime in recent weeks and needs a well deserved break, thanks

[22-Dec-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there are several advantages to be taddr only for KMD, and with some clever tech we can have our cake and eat it too. I am still working on parts of this so even if the marketing was 100% ready, some significant details can change. I figured with 0.1% of actual usage it isnt really that significant of a deal to have to rush things out immediately. all the sprout funds are safe. there will be a way to do private tx.

[22-Dec-18 09:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you want private, you should try Pirate 😃

[22-Dec-18 03:57 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Have a great break @jl777c ... my guess is KMD is moving privacy to the Pirate chain instead, and removing all Z addresses.

[22-Dec-18 07:15 PM] haha#6652
What is the point of the mainchain if all tokens are going to be on seperate chains using DPoW?

[22-Dec-18 07:16 PM] PTYX#6840
The independent chains notarize onto Komodo

[22-Dec-18 07:16 PM] PTYX#6840
And subsequently to BTC

[22-Dec-18 07:16 PM] haha#6652
So do they pay fees in KMD?

[22-Dec-18 07:16 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] PTYX#6840
It costs around 2100$ plus 365KMD annually

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] haha#6652
Isn't that kinda harsh? I mean what's the positive in that?

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] PTYX#6840
Bitcoin level security

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] haha#6652
Yes but can't you use DPoW by itself?

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] PTYX#6840
That is dpow

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] haha#6652
o I guess

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] haha#6652
you need the 64

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the mechanism

[22-Dec-18 07:17 PM] haha#6652
nodes to secure the chain

[22-Dec-18 07:18 PM] PTYX#6840
Exactly

[22-Dec-18 07:18 PM] haha#6652
ok bye

[22-Dec-18 07:18 PM] PTYX#6840
And not to mention the funds to notarize directly onto bitcoin

[22-Dec-18 07:18 PM] haha#6652
I'm guessing the 64 nodes pay the BTC transaction manually

[22-Dec-18 07:18 PM] haha#6652
and recieve KMD

[22-Dec-18 07:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't understand the full mechanics. I am actually not a notary node this year. However, when I did run one there were many people making sure all notaries were funded and properly notarizing. They receive both KMD and btc and each year 30 of the notaries are elected.

[22-Dec-18 07:21 PM] PTYX#6840
I know jl777 can provide a better answer

[22-Dec-18 07:22 PM] haha#6652

[22-Dec-18 11:02 PM] MaJoRa#0131
hey guys - looking for some information from anyone who uses coinbase and hoping someone can help out. I signed up earlier today, and for the first time ever, I'm getting spam into my inbox. In fact, I started receiving said spam only 2 hours after signing up, and a fair bit of it.

I didn't sign up with a specialised email address because I was under the impression coinbase were trustworthy - this means I can't prove 100% that it was signing up to them that caused the influx in spam. But my concern is that my email has been leaked or shared with third parties. 

I haven't given them any card information yet - but obviously this is rather concerning considering what coinbase is supposed to be for. Can anyone speak to their trustworthyness?
