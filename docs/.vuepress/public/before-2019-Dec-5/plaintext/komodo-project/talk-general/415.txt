you're too smart for that, my friend

that's alright if you think wrong of me.

I stand my thoughts on the work Komodo Platform is doing.

https://twitter.com/Chainzillaio/status/1169131748472631296 We've already got DASH on board and they are thrilled to do a joint collaboration. It makes sense to leverage other projects to increase awareness.

[04-Sep-19 06:19 AM] PTYX#6840
In the past days we've had a few projects also ask about API integration which means we will likely see more versions of the mobile dex or even a webdex running on the barterdex network.

re: ```After all I ve been through...```

Poor you üéª

You aren't the only one here with immense difficulties in their personal lives. 

Fortunately some choose not to wallow in sickening self-pity and self-righteous anger, justified or not.  Some choose not to dump their pain and suffering onto everyone they encounter.  Some choose to deal with the more painful and difficult matter of dealing with the true cause of their troubles: themselves.

There is hope, and a solution, in that.

K64 appears to be an effort to disrupt the komodo. so far they make only statements, but never produce any results. if you give such things equal weight to people that have actually delivered results, then what to do. i still wait for any actual results from K64. until they produce something, they havent produced anything, other than drama

Hello guys,

I read the messages posted here. I read the K64 AMA. Nothing has changed, no new information has been presented apart from another claim that it is all true.

Look guys, we have discussed this situation extensively within the team and

a) the investment claims are way off the chart and unrealistic
b) the K64 team has been unable to verify the claims with publicly nor directly to our team since the announcement was made (over 3 months ago)

Our conclusion still stands and we strongly recommend people to stay out of it. We don't cencor our Discord but I ask everyone to move this discussion to #talk-other-topics. Please do not promote K64 on our Discord.

I don't get why you guys are trying to spin up some drama about all this but I can assure you that our team is alligned on this matter.

@Deleted User I read the website. I understand what you are saying but maybe you are over thinking? I see the issue tho, maybe governance can be fixed a bit. The problem is no crypro has good governance.

[04-Sep-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
dwy issues are not about blockchain consensus issues, not sure how governance comes into play

[04-Sep-19 08:05 AM] rainbro7#4735
Is the 3 VPS problem a real issue?

[04-Sep-19 08:05 AM] rainbro7#4735
That he lists*

[04-Sep-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the problem with 3VPS?

[04-Sep-19 08:06 AM] rainbro7#4735
I think you were mostly kind to him so I am not sure why he can be so mad :(

[04-Sep-19 08:07 AM] rainbro7#4735
"Sorry Dude, if 3 VPS are able to take down the entire Notary Nodes network, don't you think it would be a good idea to ask how, and what can we do to fix that, instead of constantly insulting ?"

[04-Sep-19 08:09 AM] jorian#4555
why is komodo so much involved in 3rd party companies that happen to build on komodo tech? as an open source platform, no-one, not even bitcoin benny with his double hat, should be involved in K64 from a komodo point of view.

[04-Sep-19 08:10 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not on either side of this debate, but i really think KMD should refrain from making statements about 3rd party projects that happen to build on KMD.

[04-Sep-19 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
is this really what is going to happen with every new project that comes on board? investment advice? every KMD 'official' having a say about what we should or shouldn't do with regards to 3rd party projects?

we are only clarifying some things about baseless accusations

[04-Sep-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and the position is that we are taking no specific position, which seems to be what you want

[04-Sep-19 08:12 AM] Audo#5667
@jorian this situation was different as the community considered our team to be a little involved. It was publicly known that Benny went to see K64 and created a lot of speculation. We also tweeted some k64 news and talked about it in the beginning. We also featured the expo on our newsletter. Because of this we felt that we should clarify the situation as we were not able to verify the claims.

[04-Sep-19 08:13 AM] Audo#5667
plus the name is similar, and they talked about Komodo SDK

[04-Sep-19 08:13 AM] rainbro7#4735
I think clarification is good and skepticism is good. I hope komodoworld wasnt tricked.

this conversation here was triggered by the K64 team and we of course have to now talk about it .... again

[04-Sep-19 08:14 AM] jorian#4555
but suddenly KMD is raging

There are now two separate things: K64 and Dwy transparency report that is making me judge what us happening with mining notary nodes.

What are ethics of devs in kmd team?

[04-Sep-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
with the NN mining, it is stated they get 75% of blocks

[04-Sep-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and implicit with that is that they should get 75% of mining rewards

[04-Sep-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
however, it was closer to 50% of the mining rewards, so i made the decision that the NN should get 75% of the blocks and 75% of the mining rewards

üö´ 

[04-Sep-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i believe i got one lucky block when i was notary mining, but we had a large mining pool that came in to snipe the large blocks which reduced the NN rewards from the expected 75% to 50%. that is statistically impossible in a randomly distribution

[04-Sep-19 08:34 AM] rainbro7#4735
Thanks for clearing the air.

[04-Sep-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
dwy was most upset that he didnt snipe the big blocks himself, but in any case now binance is claiming rewards, the days of big blocks are likely gone, so it is a moot issue

[04-Sep-19 08:38 AM] jorian#4555
> dwy was most upset that he didnt snipe the big blocks himself
nah, this is unfair. i think he was one of the first who had the ability to snipe blocks, but didn't do it for the sake of peace

even had evidence

[04-Sep-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i asked him not to and he listened

[04-Sep-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but he was ranting against me for thousands of messages for me having suggested to him to not snipe

[04-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Mark81#4505
I think he will come out with database showing evidence who has done this.

[04-Sep-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
he was upset at me for suggesting that to him

[04-Sep-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
we know who has done the hunting

[04-Sep-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it was a big controversy in the NN group, we solved it by creating a common hunting pool
