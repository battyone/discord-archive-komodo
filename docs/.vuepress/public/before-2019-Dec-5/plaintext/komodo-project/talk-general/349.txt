If someone can point me out to a easy wallet address for kmd to send my coins to that would be great

@jl777c What about BarterDEX? Is it same?

[07-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Instel7#1416

[07-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

Has this question been asked already when will kmd get their own wallet that doesn‚Äôt come with a bunch of warning signs admitting the product is flawed and only a beta project and shouldn‚Äôt not be usedpermanently not trying to be a dick but do other coins have similar wallet issue

@psalm when crypto comes out of beta, then maybe so will the apps.

[07-Jun-19 07:21 PM] PTYX#6840
All of these new technologies take time to develop and polish. There isn't a wallet out there without a warning about possible loss of funds.

[07-Jun-19 07:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I just wanna say that the Equifax CEO didn‚Äôt answer individual users questions when they had hackers who stole your entire life personal info  
Thank you @jl777c for being so communicative.

[07-Jun-19 07:24 PM] miles#6381
Is there a specific  recommended  uninstall method  for affected  agama version or will just binning to trash can in Mac and deleting do it?

So for a laymen, like myself... 
I‚Äôm getting ready to send the 0.001 FROM my affected wallet TO my new wallet.   Then I‚Äôll DM shossain about asset chains, yes?

Size of account will determine timeframe of repayment?   
Thank you again team.

Bleachbit that junk

[07-Jun-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, same process for all chains (other than PIRATE)

Hi, my new kmd adress is an exchange one witch daily limit overextends my kmd, is it a problem?

[07-Jun-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the refund process will just look at the blockchain

[07-Jun-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be sent to your claim address if it matches where you send the special tx 2)

[07-Jun-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
whether you get proper credit for the refund, that is between you and the exchange

[07-Jun-19 07:42 PM] tumik#4710
Ok i already verified my account to increase my limit, should work then.

[07-Jun-19 07:43 PM] tumik#4710
Thx for all your effort btw. Koudus to the devs and the awesome comminity.

I've just looked how to submit a claim and I think someone has already claimed for my address, as there's dust gone in and out, how are the team going to make sure I get my funds and not the scammer?!

[07-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the hacker doesnt know your claim address, so if the dust is spent to a different address it will be invalid

[07-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
plz DM me your address

[07-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the compromised one

[07-Jun-19 08:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@C Adi the dust went to all swept addresses

[07-Jun-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
he says "in and out"

[07-Jun-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
presumably to a different destination address

[07-Jun-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody else that sees this, make sure to report it.

[07-Jun-19 08:23 PM] gcharang#6833
he is thinking we sent dust to only addresses from the form

[07-Jun-19 08:23 PM] C Adi#8432
Yes sorry I thought dust only goes when someone submits a claim for that address. My mistake

[07-Jun-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, good there isnt a problem

[07-Jun-19 08:24 PM] C Adi#8432
Please ignore, I think everything is ok

[07-Jun-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody got special tx 1) (the dust) and it is up to each user to send it to the proper claim address

[07-Jun-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if it doesnt match, then it becomes disputed

[07-Jun-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
this is how we prevent the hacker from making a false claim

[07-Jun-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but it means you MUST make your claim ASAP if you havent, as the hacker could make a claim and if you dont claim, then it wont be disputed

[07-Jun-19 08:37 PM] Keppie#5156
Estimation of how many addresses that have > 7777 kmd. Quite some work handing all of those case to case

[07-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
about 100

[07-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but they wont be case by case unless they are disputed

[07-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
we just need to give them a lot more time to make claim

[07-Jun-19 08:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
hey folks

[07-Jun-19 08:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
is there a step by step guide for dummies like me on what to do?

is it all written down somewhere i can follow it without bugging you?

[07-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang there is no more need to collect txids, just the approximate amount in address, old address and new address for username is all that is needed

How do I find the new address to send the small amount of KMD from the compromised wallet? I don‚Äôt know how to go back to my existing funds claim

[07-Jun-19 08:57 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I don‚Äôt see any new small amount of  KMD in my old address anyway

[07-Jun-19 09:02 PM] KanarDMD#9092
Oh nm it‚Äôs the address from our new wallet. Brain fart. But still haven‚Äôt received small amount

[07-Jun-19 09:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@KanarDMD look in the explorer

[07-Jun-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if you didnt receive the small amount that means your address was not in the data we managed to get

[07-Jun-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
however, it does not mean you are safe as there is no assurance that we got all the data

[07-Jun-19 09:09 PM] LesDudis#3792
I'm very impressed by the way this unfortunate event has been handled jl777c. Thank you and keep it up. Particularly impressed by your own sacrifice, of course, but also the community as a whole. Great job.

Guys how do i know If iam affected i cant Login Into agama anymore

[07-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Mr Happy - just chill'in#9949
quick question --   v0.6.0.13-PBaaS   is safe to move KMD funds

[07-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Mr Happy - just chill'in#9949
I'm using a very old agama wallet.  no issue so far.. don't want to risk  anything

[07-Jun-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
verus agama is fine

[07-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Mr Happy - just chill'in#9949
but wallet versus 0.5.6a  does not work for KMD lite

[07-Jun-19 09:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
"seed storage Error - only alphanumerics" - i am only using alphanumerics....

[07-Jun-19 09:13 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I also submitted the forms twice and may have had different info on it the second time. The team can contact me either through here or my e-mail (which has the same username) to figure out any discrepancies

[07-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Mr Happy - just chill'in#9949
My coins are very old.   all mined before anybody knew Komodo

[07-Jun-19 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
v0.6.0.13-PBaaS should work with KMD lite

[07-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Mr Happy - just chill'in#9949
thank you
