Shady business partners are no partners of mine. Duke already wasted enough time with those jokers helping them refund all of our holders that we had redirected there before delisting

excellent article about Ethereum plans

@Berg Hey man, First of all: JL777 paid all the registration fees, which was only 1000$. If you/ HUSH team cannot muster a mere 200$ for a wallet update, that's your personal problem, not a problem with Digitalprice exchange. Hush has about zero volume, nobody knew about it anyways.

[15-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Alright#0419
@Zanzarismo the problem is that these wallet update fees were not disclosed until after listing

[15-Jan-19 11:36 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
THAT distinction is understandable.

[15-Jan-19 11:36 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
But still, There is simply NO OTHER exchange even close to as reasonable as DigitalPrice when it comes to listing fees.

[16-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Justaguy#6181
(respond to me with @ so i get a notification please), could you use python to code a chain and smart contracts? or is python not supported?

[16-Jan-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
@Justaguy a linked library would be required to code contracts themselves in python, but you're able to code dapps in python on top of contracts. Here's an example of python dapp https://github.com/stakedchain/trollbox

so to be clear, it is possible, just not yet

[16-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Justaguy#6181
right, so if i wanted to code a platform with smart contracts right now, i should probably use c++ or java

[16-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Alright#0419
C and/or C++

[16-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Justaguy#6181
gotcha

[16-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Justaguy#6181
learning c++ right now to code a project, just wanted to check if i should go with a different language instead

[16-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Justaguy#6181
thanks man! @Alright

[16-Jan-19 03:53 AM] Alright#0419
@Justaguy the oracles contract itself has many many different use cases. You may be able to use it along with existing contracts to accomplish what you need

[16-Jan-19 03:55 AM] Justaguy#6181
ill check it out

[16-Jan-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@KomodoWorld the ETH2 sharding sounds like it is an order of magnitude harder than LN, what happened to plasma? wasnt that supposed to solve all the ETH scaling issues?

[16-Jan-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
unscrambling an omelet seems like a scary hard problem to solve, interesting intellectual problem, but if your blockchain future depends on solving it...

[16-Jan-19 09:31 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jl777c  is there anything in Hush that could build better encrypted decentralized messages system then what there is in KMD Lab you mentioned?

[16-Jan-19 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I heard wall st is called wall st as they make/made things difficult to understand for regular Joe. üòÖ  
so is it like ETH2 is doing that same?

[16-Jan-19 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
looked at ETH 2.0 I was confused too

[16-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD doesnt have a built in encrypted messaging in zksnarks, so HUSH can fill that gap

[16-Jan-19 09:39 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
generally speaking such service is also a economic network - system supporters get reward for the service and those using it pay some small fees per kB of data or so ?

[16-Jan-19 09:40 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is anyone capable of estimating working hours needed to acomplish such decentralized encrypted email system? even with 100% error ?

[16-Jan-19 09:41 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
1st version could just be txt messages, ?messgaes encrypted stored on blockchain? or same as normal z-tx - no blockchain info ? idk how it works

[16-Jan-19 09:42 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
2nd version could be including IPFS to be able to have tmp storage for email + tmp storage for attachments too

[16-Jan-19 09:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
when I speak working hours to accomplish I mean not only background tech but also gui + mobile -> as the real test is live test with scalability with userbase growing

[16-Jan-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Is it too much for me to ask people to not DM me about basic wallet issues? especially if it is GUI issues?  I dont do GUI, I dont use GUI. I cant support GUI and really I shouldnt be spending time on customer support, should I?

[16-Jan-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810

I am surprised that you are still reachable by a DM or @ from a genpop... If discord allows this, you could just block everyone but admins and maybe KMD team members. Discord admins would then ping you if anything requires your input... just a suggestion...

while this is good idea to be isolated to team DM, then I think the potential devs coming to ecosystem will miss on having a kind conversation with James directly. ü§î

i dont mind answering DM, I just dont like having to tell people that I dont know how to solve Agama GUI related issues

[16-Jan-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems telling everyone to just use cli isnt effective

[16-Jan-19 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
they should use #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel for initial troubleshooting of Agama or create support ticket.

@grewalsatinder  (sorry, don't know how to quote stuff here...) re: James isolation. He would still be able to come in and communicate, the @ tag & DM just would not work for him. If relevant, the admins or team members could 'summon' him if something needs his attention. If we want to get real fancy, maybe he could 'whitelist' people he does not mind getting DM's from or tagged by? Like he said, he ain't frontline support any more. (yeah, I am done) üòÉ

If there is a "support" role added in the member list, that may deter people from reaching out to anyone other than those people for help.

@Smedley  I suggested the Agama wallet add a new feature to help track your addresses. A simple "name" column that can be edited, that is paired to the address.

[16-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
@Smedley right now it's possible to set a "username" on any assetchain via the KV feature. This could likely be used as a way of linking something human readable to a specific address

[16-Jan-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
Would actually be very simple to implement

[16-Jan-19 09:51 PM] Smedley#8094
Wouldn't you be able to have two of the same human readable addresses attached to two different addresses using KV?

[16-Jan-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
Yes, hadn't really considered it. Could easily make it use the first set, but then that leads to problems of people using the same name unaware that someone is already using it

[16-Jan-19 09:58 PM] Alright#0419
believe it it would be best suited for a new contract, but a proof of concept would be viable right now with some dirty hacks

is someone here able to give me a ballpark figure as to the cost of dPoW when launching a chain? as in is it thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousand? (of USD)

[17-Jan-19 02:18 AM] Hermes#6934
I think you could ask the service providers...for more details #chainzilla  or #chainmakers  @Justaguy

[17-Jan-19 02:18 AM] Hermes#6934
they should be able to give you a quick quote

[17-Jan-19 02:18 AM] Justaguy#6181
thanks man!

[17-Jan-19 02:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Justaguy I believe you can launch a chain for free then add dpow later. I think it's around 300 kmd a year?

[17-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Justaguy#6181
yeah, you can. I just wanted to see how much adding dpow is beforehand, because if it was absorbent I would rather go develop on another platform. 300 kmd a year doesn't sound bad though

[17-Jan-19 02:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I saw something about 6000 for 30 years too.

[17-Jan-19 02:25 AM] Justaguy#6181

@Justaguy  it depends all on your setup.  If you are using a Komodo assetchain  cost will be a couple grand,  if it‚Äôs  not, expect to pay more for integration and a code audit ( a couple thousand more possibly depending on work that needs done and a couple tens of thousands for a reputable code audit )
