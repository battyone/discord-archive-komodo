Same as kmd height for vote2019

[29-May-19 01:30 PM] Mark81#4505
Any reasons then why i didn't had any?

[29-May-19 01:32 PM] Mark81#4505
Who did airdrop?

[29-May-19 01:34 PM] Mark81#4505
I fid have my vote2019 coins

[29-May-19 01:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
Most likeley you moved it nefore the airdrop ow or maybe the airdtop was not at the same height. I acctualy dont know that just saw the same amount as vote2019 but that does not need to have been the case

[29-May-19 01:37 PM] Mark81#4505
And coins have not been moved from that address. Also if i got my vote coins and didnt have ninja coins then it doorsnt add up.

[29-May-19 01:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that is was on another height...

[29-May-19 01:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe just testing maybe something real nobody knows...

It looks like the blockchain and gaming combination is heating up.  Anyone care to race CryptoKitties ?  Don't think they will get out of their garages if they rely on etherium.

yikes- I am having a problem with agama0.3.6 (it started with 0.3.5 already)
when I enter seed, and activate coin, I get 
'unknown method
blockchain.address.get_balance'
I then get to a screen with 'no TXs available..
when I enter complete fresh seed w/o balance, I get to a regualr '0' balance wallet
this does not happen for Pirate chain, which is running native

[29-May-19 06:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@LocoMB update to latest version of wallet and aso #support is a better channel

[29-May-19 06:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
i saw those same errors when i was using an older agama. Your coins are safe, it's that the GUI wallet is too old to talk to the newer backend servers. Upgrading will fix stuff

[29-May-19 06:37 PM] allbits#5898
Upgrading today fixed same error for me

[29-May-19 06:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
I'll give it a shot- although I am using 0.3.6 .. if it doen't work I'll get to #support tomorrow .. I suspect some sticky .conf file- using *.deb

Hello,

Regarding the supernet coins, are any of them still active? Correct me if I am wrong, but I thought all coins related to supernet got combined into the Komodo ecosystem we see today. I saw some people trading supernet coins in one of the Komodo apps, so I got curious.

[30-May-19 06:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The Supernet assets moved from Nxt to Their own blockchain .   They are independent not Komodo itself though Komodo is leveraging the tech.  They are active , in various stages of development, some complete some nearing completion some with a bit of work still to do

[30-May-19 07:01 AM] 006vl#9488
Thank you for your response. 
I found KMD 3 months after its ICO, so I am not aware of what happened in the BTCD era.

If you know, could I ask why Komodo decided  to break off from Supernet? (Or was it the other way around? Idk)

[30-May-19 07:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
This is what started it all

[30-May-19 07:02 AM] 006vl#9488
yes

[30-May-19 07:03 AM] 006vl#9488
but I guess, I'm looking for the history of Komodo, prior to the declaration of independence

[30-May-19 07:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo wasn‚Äôt around

[30-May-19 07:05 AM] 006vl#9488
I am aware that DoI is what started KMD, I was just curious of the groundwork of komodo prior to its release. I guess I don't really know what I am asking myself I suppose.

[30-May-19 07:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Basically Komodo came about because James needed a blockchain and btcd wasn‚Äôt good enough and nxt was falling apart.  Supernet and KMD kept separate for many reasons , different scope, different community ,  different offerings, different utility

[30-May-19 07:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Those supernet assetchains that were migrated to komodo ecosystem are there for a reason and that is revenue flow for original supernet investors that invested to james vision. Once things are set in place various services that are build on komodo ecosystem will bring revenue flow for those asset addresses that hold coins like dex, supernet, revs to same address on kmd chain.

[30-May-19 07:20 AM] Mark81#4505
Assetchain holdings present revenue share size of total amount to be paid in each address that hold coins. If i remember correctly assetchains have 1 million coins and payout is always done when it reaches 1 million dollars in usd. So one asset coin gets you one dollar worth of KMD.

[30-May-19 07:28 AM] 006vl#9488
I see. One question, though:

What do you mean by "payout is always done when it reaches 1 million dollars in usd"? 

What are the conditions in which they receive the payout? Is the payout done multiple times depending on the growth of KMD in terms of USD? Or is the payout done already?

I skimmed the Komodo whitepaper and it doesn't really mention payouts of superNET assetchains.

[30-May-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET assetchains are INDEPENDENT of KMD

[30-May-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
they are built on top of KMD, but not in KMD itself

[30-May-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
in some jurisdictions, having revshare makes it regulated and I didnt want to entangle KMD in such things. (yes, I foresaw this years before it became an issue)

[30-May-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if KMD is the infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, ...) think of the SuperNET assetchains as the buildings that are built on top of it

[30-May-19 07:36 AM] 006vl#9488
But I thought SuperNET was made Prior to Komodo, if that is the case how can SuperNET assetchains be built on top of KMD?

Is it something like:
SuperNET had great ideas but they didn't really have the infrastructure necessary, so KMD was born out of necessity to be a fuel for all these ideas, in a sense?

[30-May-19 07:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
Supernet and it's related asset chains is one of the best kept secrets in crypto.  so keep it secret

[30-May-19 07:39 AM] Mark81#4505
Fees that services collects happens in kmd and will be converted to kmd. If kmd price surces then payout can happen faster. See CRYPTO assetchain that gets revenues from notarizing services to bitcoi nand is collected in btc. Once conditios are met then conversion happens and payout happens in kmd to asset holders. Currently hold over 400k kmd to be distributed to CRYPTO, Supernet and REVS assetholders.

[30-May-19 07:41 AM] 006vl#9488
@stupidfish I think Verus is a project that uses dPoW of KMD. It was made way later down the road iirc. Maybe others can chime in (not knowledgeable enough lol)

[30-May-19 07:41 AM] Mark81#4505
Only takes advantage of kmd technology and improve it and then it can be bringed back to kmd.

[30-May-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
verus is probably one of the most advanced tech in the industry

[30-May-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
since they have all of komodo tech and adding a lot on top of it
