CC Interpreter would not be used by default if i understood it correct it is more a plugin thing and can be referenced for runtime. This thing looks mighty.

[18-Oct-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if a notarisation has happened and you have the correct version of the daemon with the dpow included ... you cannot reorg back past a notareisation.

[18-Oct-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
He is saying you can reorg between notaisations, which is true ... but if you wait for a notaisation then you cannot double spend.

[18-Oct-18 11:14 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok so all good 😃

[18-Oct-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once the "fix" is put in to count a notarisation as confirms=2 then exchanges are autmatically protected by dPoW
