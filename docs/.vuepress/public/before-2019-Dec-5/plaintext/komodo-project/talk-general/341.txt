WAIT

[07-Jun-19 11:11 AM] lion#5837
So special transactions will be made up to the 15th if the address meets special conditions? It could be like tomorrow and 15 numbers - I understood everything correctly? If so, then great!

[07-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i am right now working on sending out the special transactions for addresses with less than 7 KMD as  test

[07-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 11:20 AM] lion#5837
@Deleted User  and did VERUS perform a similar audit of the build package vulnerability?

[07-Jun-19 11:20 AM] plazma#1625
then what about....agama 0.3.6

[07-Jun-19 11:22 AM] tafen#3000
Guys, I lost all my savings in Komodo. Today I look at the wallet completely empty. What to do? I have saved Komodo since its inception ... It was all my savings.

I understand that the best now is cold storage! Who kept in cold wallets or even on the stock exchanges - stayed with him!)

[07-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are one of these, please let me know you got funds and then send to your claim address

[07-Jun-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I want to make sure the basic process works before scaling it up to all the < 7777 addresses

[07-Jun-19 11:28 AM] istante#3749
I have not installed  verus agama. For the form i have inserted ledger nano andress. If and when the special tx come to me, i must enter in agama wallet. So my question is : can i enter with agama or i need verus agama?

[07-Jun-19 11:28 AM] tafen#3000
jl777c, Please help me with my problem of losing a Komodo. From the very beginning, I believed in your project and transferred all my savings to Komodo. And now they are gone. I'm in a panic.

[07-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
file a claim form

[07-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
did you read the instructions??

[07-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
already the first people that filled out the claim form are starting the process to get their refunds

[07-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont fill out the claim form, i cant process it

[07-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
i help those who help themselves

[07-Jun-19 11:30 AM] tafen#3000
Which wallet is better to use now? Or is it better to go to the exchange, such as Bitrix? Do I need to remove the old version of Agama?

[07-Jun-19 11:30 AM] miles#6381
@tafen - the first thing to check for your address is if the funds were swept to the safe address - do that and breath - amazing amount of support and help on hand here to help, just stay calm and work through it

[07-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
did anybody get the small tx yet?

[07-Jun-19 11:32 AM] lion#5837
@jl777c  Sorry to be a stupid question: And how can you optionally wrap the phrase seeds in special cryptographic packages with cool encryption for example KECCAK? Does the structure of such wallets generally imply quick implementation and testing of such functions?

[07-Jun-19 11:33 AM] tafen#3000
Sorry, I understand that you have probably all been tortured, these questions, I just need help with finding information where what is written. I just don‚Äôt speak English very well and it‚Äôs hard to find quickly.

[07-Jun-19 11:34 AM] istante#3749
@jl777c  for the eventual special tx, can i enter in my wallet with old agama version ?

[07-Jun-19 11:34 AM] tafen#3000
Thank you so much, I'm already getting acquainted. I hope all I get right to do.

@jl777c will this arrive in the compromised agama, or could we check in the verus agama?

[07-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Malti#3948
i have more than 7 so can't check

[07-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Malti#3948

I transferred balance to agama versus, how do we claim interest? Has it been reset to zero? I was going to claim with the old agama wallet but thought it was better not to.

[07-Jun-19 11:40 AM] gcharang#6833
Pinned a message.

[07-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Malti#3948
interest will start to accumulate again in verus agama

[07-Jun-19 11:40 AM] zafar177#6208
From zero?

[07-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Malti#3948
your 'old' interest might be still on your previous address

[07-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Malti#3948
interest needs to be claimed every month anyway

[07-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Malti#3948
so at max you lost 1 month of interest

[07-Jun-19 11:41 AM] zafar177#6208
I had 50 kmd to claim......üò™

[07-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Malti#3948
@zafar177 you can use the new agama verus to log in into your old address if I'm not mistaken

[07-Jun-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think it matters what wallet is used to make the claim tx

[07-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Malti#3948
interest is sent to your address when you make a tx

[07-Jun-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an already compromised seed anyway, but just better to use the verus agama

[07-Jun-19 11:42 AM] Malti#3948
no?

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Malti#3948
yes, so @zafar177 just log in into your old wallet, interest should still be there

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Keppie#5156
@zafar177 Log in to your old address using Verus agama and you'll be able to claim those rewards

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Malti#3948
you can send it to your new address

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] zafar177#6208
Thanks guys üòÄ

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Malti#3948
happy your funds are safe üòâ

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody see the special claim tx?

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] zafar177#6208
Yeah, was a bit worried.

[07-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Keppie#5156
People with less than 7kmd in their wallet might not be reading..

[07-Jun-19 11:46 AM] miles#6381
does the process ping a message to their Discord User ID?

[07-Jun-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
no, i just sent a txid to the compromised address

[07-Jun-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody?

[07-Jun-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
who is online now and has less than 77 KMD ?

[07-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Kaed#8040
Not me

[07-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Kaed#8040
:p

[07-Jun-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810

I got 0.10272331 KMD in my old address but I sent 0.001 KMD to new one for claim. This would work?

[07-Jun-19 11:50 AM] istante#3749
Which is link to verus download ?

[07-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Allen#8663
@jl777c I've 0.10162331 KMD in my old wallet

[07-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@Allen what is the txid?

[07-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it could just be left over rewards

[07-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody should have gotten more than 0.0003

[07-Jun-19 11:52 AM] Allen#8663

Originally I had ~9KMD left.

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] Allen#8663
who sent me that?

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like mining pool payout

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] Allen#8663
I don't mine.

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
or exchange withdraw

[07-Jun-19 11:53 AM] Allen#8663
I used to, like 1 year back.

[07-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Allen#8663
I did not buy or withdraw any KMD.

[07-Jun-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
