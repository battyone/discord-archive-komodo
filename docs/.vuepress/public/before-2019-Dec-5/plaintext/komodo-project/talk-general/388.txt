[07-Jul-19 11:51 PM] joejewson#7282
bear with me guys, thank you if you can stay there

[08-Jul-19 12:04 AM] joejewson#7282
in native mode which resource should i use to fetch the zcash params?

[08-Jul-19 12:05 AM] joejewson#7282
im using v0.5.7-3

[08-Jul-19 12:05 AM] joejewson#7282
downloaded from verus

[08-Jul-19 12:07 AM] crumb#2550
try using default

[08-Jul-19 12:08 AM] crumb#2550
it should not matter really, sometimes there are issues for some users so try what works for you

[08-Jul-19 12:08 AM] joejewson#7282
thanks

[08-Jul-19 12:14 AM] joejewson#7282
ok zcash params done, now when selecting native its asking me for deamon params, default is none

[08-Jul-19 12:16 AM] crumb#2550
none is good

[08-Jul-19 12:17 AM] crumb#2550
or what other choices does it give?

[08-Jul-19 12:17 AM] crumb#2550
i can't look now myself

[08-Jul-19 12:17 AM] crumb#2550
i'm doing things by heart

[08-Jul-19 12:17 AM] crumb#2550
memory

[08-Jul-19 12:18 AM] joejewson#7282
i chose the default which was none and now its downloading the chain from komodo daemon

[08-Jul-19 12:18 AM] joejewson#7282
this could take days!

[08-Jul-19 12:19 AM] joejewson#7282
thank you so much man

[08-Jul-19 12:19 AM] crumb#2550
ok that will take a while. did you copy wallet.dat

[08-Jul-19 12:19 AM] joejewson#7282
yes

[08-Jul-19 12:19 AM] crumb#2550
good

[08-Jul-19 12:20 AM] joejewson#7282
when this is done i want to import my seed?

[08-Jul-19 12:20 AM] crumb#2550
you could also use bootstrap file to download the blockchain. it will be much faster

[08-Jul-19 12:20 AM] crumb#2550
you don't need seed if you recover from wallet.dat

[08-Jul-19 12:20 AM] joejewson#7282
ok (y)

[08-Jul-19 12:20 AM] joejewson#7282
awesome!

[08-Jul-19 12:21 AM] joejewson#7282
i didnt realise that but did suspect it, been out the loop for sometime so just catching up a bit as a none techy is hard sometimes

[08-Jul-19 12:21 AM] joejewson#7282
where can i find bootstrap file?

[08-Jul-19 12:21 AM] joejewson#7282
i take it i copy that into roaming data too right?

[08-Jul-19 12:21 AM] crumb#2550
https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
is the location of bootstrap files. choose Komodo

How would you explain what antara is & does to a teenager?

[08-Jul-19 12:22 AM] crumb#2550
i'd explain it exactly like i'd explain it do adult üòõ

[08-Jul-19 12:22 AM] joejewson#7282
crumb once that downloaded where do i copy it too sir?

[08-Jul-19 12:23 AM] joejewson#7282
thanks so much for your help!

[08-Jul-19 12:24 AM] joejewson#7282
and shud i now close the agama app as im currently downloading in two places which is obvs unnecessary

[08-Jul-19 12:27 AM] crumb#2550
ok, so firstly close Agama

[08-Jul-19 12:28 AM] crumb#2550
then download bootstrap and extract it to %/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/

[08-Jul-19 12:28 AM] joejewson#7282
ok cheers

[08-Jul-19 12:28 AM] crumb#2550
there should be two folders: blocks and chainstate

[08-Jul-19 12:29 AM] joejewson#7282
i see them

[08-Jul-19 12:30 AM] crumb#2550
then turn on Agama again and choose reindex and if that doesn't do the trick then do also a rescan

[08-Jul-19 12:30 AM] joejewson#7282
reindex once the wallet ha opened u?

[08-Jul-19 12:30 AM] joejewson#7282
opened up*

[08-Jul-19 12:30 AM] crumb#2550
so current blocks and chainstate you can delete, because you'll get new ones from the bootstrap rile

[08-Jul-19 12:30 AM] crumb#2550
file

[08-Jul-19 12:31 AM] crumb#2550
there should be a drop-down menu when you activate Komodo in native mode.

[08-Jul-19 12:32 AM] crumb#2550
like i said i cannot check now. guiding you from memory

[08-Jul-19 12:33 AM] joejewson#7282
thank you, I will check back in tomorrow. Much appreciated! send me your kmd address Crumb, when this works I will send you some

[08-Jul-19 12:34 AM] crumb#2550
i'll PM you üëç

Hello guys

[08-Jul-19 04:38 AM] stock999#4818
I noticed AtomicDex  in the news channel. What is the project? Where can i find more details about it?   Have they a Discord?

[08-Jul-19 04:40 AM] stock999#4818
In particular i'm interested if they are going to develop the application for other operation systems except android&mac, for linux for instance.

[08-Jul-19 04:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Hello! AtomicDEX not a separate project but Komodo product: it is mobile cryptocurrency wallet with marketmaker2  atomic swaps protocol support

Good morning to everyone

[08-Jul-19 07:29 AM] bogybogy#3962
A quick question,is any possibility by a centralised exchange to implement atomic Dex from kmd?maibe looks stupid my question

[08-Jul-19 07:33 AM] Audo#5667
yes @bogybogy , anyone can use AtomicAPI to builda DEX product. All the products would share the same liquidity pool, so the more products/users there are, the more liquidity we will have.

[08-Jul-19 07:34 AM] Audo#5667
Think of AtomicDEX as a reference product that we use to showcase our technology to get others to come in and develop with it.

[08-Jul-19 07:34 AM] bogybogy#3962

Hey Rich, sucks you got demonitized

[08-Jul-19 09:22 AM] Keppie#5156
even worse, they got removed lol

[08-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Lennart#9331
THx for your videos Rich, you can improve in sound quality but I enjoy watching them a lot. So far the only youtuber that "gets" the KMD ecosystem and it's strength

[08-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Malti#3948
heh, why did he get demonitized??

On the website, in the section 'Partner with us' it says 'list your asset, become a liquidity provider and bring in a new volume to your platform'. 
Is this for new projects to list their token on Atomicdex? Or is it for other exchanges to partner with Dex to share the liquidity?

[08-Jul-19 02:04 PM] datab0t#8565
@waazaapp feel free to dump your KMD into my buy order. And stop shilling stratis please..

[08-Jul-19 02:30 PM] Malti#3948
stratis used to be an amazing ICO, but then failed to deliver on any of their promises, hence the 94 rank and 7k sats pricepoint.. @waazaapp

[08-Jul-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`ICO, but then failed to deliver on any of their promises,`
there were more than a handful that didn't?

[08-Jul-19 02:42 PM] Malti#3948
lol

[08-Jul-19 02:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
so many amazing ideas, so few succesful executions of amazing ideas. and whenever one dies it's like 5 pop up in it's place

[08-Jul-19 02:42 PM] Malti#3948
like only 90% of ICO's @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ :troll_lol:

[08-Jul-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if 1% of ICOs produced a product, much less a working solution, I'd be suprised

[08-Jul-19 02:44 PM] Malti#3948
there are 2 kinds of ICO's imo. 
1) Hype ones => live on marketing and hype. Uneducated people jump in and price fluctuates on announcements
2) tech ones => educated people join the community and follow developments. If these projects fail to deliver, people drop out, no matter the hype (as they weren't hype machines in the first place)

[08-Jul-19 02:44 PM] Malti#3948
hybrids also exist

[08-Jul-19 02:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think it's about 50% intentional scam bs, could be 75%

[08-Jul-19 02:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
no one even cares. completely acceptable

[08-Jul-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`no one even cares. completely acceptable`
That's what made it even worse; there became an "army" of people knowing they got screwed on 1 ICO and prebuying the next one hoping to double up in order to preprebuy the one that hadn't been thought of yet in order to 400x

[08-Jul-19 02:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
now we get bitfinex ieo, anus sad leo where they can arbitrarily wipe your coins from your address

raising a billion USD tends to do that

[08-Jul-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why just maintaining #50 spot is quite an achievement. always there are new massively financed projects popping up above

[08-Jul-19 03:02 PM] Malti#3948
did all these people get away with all that money btw?

[08-Jul-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810

just by setting up a website and writing a whitepaper?

[08-Jul-19 03:06 PM] Fukblm#3067
is it me or does this Antara sound to good to be true ? I mean why isnt the price of KMD  going throught the roof ?

[08-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Malti#3948
it is just true

[08-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Malti#3948
this project has never slowed down, even during bear (proof is that they were hiring during bear e.g.)

[08-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Fukblm#3067
I mean atomic swaps between 99% of the coins no fees

[08-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Malti#3948
but it's still to difficult to understand for most people

[08-Jul-19 03:07 PM] Malti#3948
that's why the antara campaign is much needed imo
