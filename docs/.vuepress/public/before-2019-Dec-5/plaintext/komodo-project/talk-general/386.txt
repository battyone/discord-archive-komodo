dex has been around since before kmd

@Sharifa not sure if you're getting this, but fees aren't required to be paid in kmd or dex, they're paid in the coin that you trade

are you a tester? @tomkronx

Did we receive the mail to start testing already?

[06-Jul-19 10:34 AM] Resistor#1215
craig wright the notorious trickster is in a florida court over an estate of several billion btc. claiming the first 70 blocks were mined by him and kleinman.  also maxine waters a democrat suggested public concern over bitcoin's legitimacy and... facebook libra lol.  so.. do the math
just before bakkt comes in.. bitcoin is scarce. institutions want their hands on this.  what better opportunity is to cause fear, and panic dropping the price?
is it any coincidence that july 21st bakkt testnet goes online. and then wright is also in court in july?

[06-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Resistor#1215
either outcome results in 20K+ btc..  stop shorting spread the word

[06-Jul-19 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Resistor You're saying that you believe that the Kleinmans knew in Feb 2018 that the launch of bakkt testnet would be in July of 2019 and that's the real reason they sued CSW and not to get what is rightfully theirs? Really?

[06-Jul-19 10:44 AM] Resistor#1215

`is it any coincidence that july 21st bakkt testnet goes online. and then wright is also in court in july?`
The answer is "YES, because the court case has been going on for **seventeen months**"

[06-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Resistor#1215
ha.. i blocked this clown months ago.   secondly how do you mine the first 70 blocks in 2012?  lol. come on now i was mining before that.

[06-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Resistor#1215
is it any wonder that your glorious leader maxine waters has expressed the legitimacy of digital currency,bitcoin, and facebook libra coin?  instituions are approaching big mining farms and youtubers to buy their bitcoin at a premium. i'm done.

[06-Jul-19 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm neither a Dem or from MO, so, it seems you were done before you even started 🤷🏽

[06-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Resistor#1215
you don't like threats of intelligence. never have.. i'm done talking to you.  thank you for your input though.  btc on the way down unless you stop shorting.  he doesn't have btc.

`you don't like threats of intelligence.`
that could be true and could also explain why I never saw you as a threat 🙂

you're also in other discord servers under different names.. and when you don't get your way you have to talk shit.

Outside of a single conversation (which was in a private channel), I'm not aware of any instance where my comments have been deleted here
Aside from that, here's the main difference between you and I:
I'm forever etched in your little mind for whatever reason....
You're so irrelevant to me that an hr from now, much like an hr ago, I'll have no memory or caring of you or your silly opinions....

Why agama kmd not updated from then??

@mazyar_lp VerusCoin is taking over the Agama wallet. I heard we may be able to use AtomicDEX sometime next week.

[06-Jul-19 11:23 AM] mazyar_lp#3486
@yorklab take over? Kmd would not update agama? Then which wallet is the main wallet of komodo?

[06-Jul-19 11:24 AM] yorklab#7270
There are various wallets to use, but I suggest Verus Wallet in lite mode.

the nSPV is very cool and it is so simple, it was fast to code and debug

[06-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure there must be more bugs, but i dont expect any will be hard to fix

[06-Jul-19 02:07 PM] Malti#3948
Is there something in particular that we can see is different in that Tx? (From the explorer)

[06-Jul-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
best part is that it isnt a hardfork and can coexist with existing nodes

[06-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
you can launch an nSPV client and within seconds "sync" to the mainchain, receive funds and send funds, within a minute or two

[06-Jul-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it makes totally compatible tx, though i dont support nLockTime yet

[06-Jul-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it should support rewards once i set nLockTime

[06-Jul-19 02:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
Does it work with fully private chains?

[06-Jul-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if by work, you mean can you validate a txid is confirmed on chain, then yes. if by work, you mean to magically know what txids you care about, then no

[06-Jul-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
however...

[06-Jul-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV it is so easy to connect to a chain, we can make a special chain to use to communicate txids (inside encryption)
