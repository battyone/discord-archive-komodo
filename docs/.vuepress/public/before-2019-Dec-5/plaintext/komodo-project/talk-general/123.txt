most of the time reverse engineering a trojan will lead you directly back to who made it

well, I shouldn't say "never could", but it would take me more work than I have time for to learn how to do it

[01-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
let me just clarify what I meant by "commendable". I'm not saying that stealing is commendable. What I mean is that the OPSEC/balls required to setup that kind of operation is.

not really sure that it "takes balls" to set up a worm and wait (even if it takes years) to find a target

[01-Nov-18 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as far as I can tell, it was a passive action

Best way is to encrypt your machines with good softwares like vercrypt, truecrypt - Lesson to be leaned

_finally gets xorg working ... saves conf in 132000 different locations so as to never need win setup again_

[01-Nov-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it's mostly because xorg + 3 screens + nvidia = annoying as fek to set up

[01-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Tek#5253
yeah i've had some issues with getting gnu working here too with my nvidea card

12 seconds to run 3 screens from 1 GPU ... 12 years to set up 3 screens from 3 GPUs 🤦🏼

[01-Nov-18 11:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but all is good now, I got debian that I wanted and all 3 are working... which means by this time tomorrow, life will be back to "normal"

Once the hyperdex or chainzilla guys got reward support ready for hardware wallets I’m switching to those

@Tek Far too many still use win (tbt, it's most of the reason that Agama use is far more popular of an option than daemon alone)
In my "defense", until just recently I was a VB dev and Win was a work requirement (and most crypto stuff was on vm, but I got lazy and complacent)

[01-Nov-18 01:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so after reading above, the main suspect is virus in a torrent file? Are there virus that automatically look for wallet.dat files?

[01-Nov-18 01:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For sure there are ...

[01-Nov-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@KomodoWorld yes, that seems most likely

[01-Nov-18 01:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this seems especially bad since Zec wallets aren't yet encrypted

[01-Nov-18 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
even if they did, encryption only works if you use it....

[01-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
virus only works if you use windows :trollface:

@Deleted User  Thats how I was using it last few weeks on my box, but found linux host to be mroe stable, only kept windows 10 incase I ever get time/want to play games again.

[01-Nov-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To get my CPU/RAM with OC stable windows was required though.

[01-Nov-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll keep a win7 vm to support the clients I have that are within their support life, but beyond that I'm done with win now that I've learned an easy way to do xorg screens the way I need/want them

[01-Nov-18 03:55 PM] BlockTech#6895
Do you think it's safe to buy an hardware wallet ( Ledger nano S ) on ebay from second hand ? Or could he have done something to it ?

[01-Nov-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
dont do it

[01-Nov-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
save a few dollars, lose all your crypto. has a bad risk/reward

[01-Nov-18 03:57 PM] BlockTech#6895
Ok thank you for your answer, the seller claim it's still in it's original box, but i'm just gonna buy it from a trusted store then.

[01-Nov-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are 100% sure you can validate the firmware to some known good official release

[01-Nov-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you are trusting the seller to not having replaced the firmward

👌 

[01-Nov-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
for testing and if you are updating the firmware yourself, it would make sense

And very hardcore about it.. laughing at everyone with a different opinion.

it is true that BTC will remain largest marketcap for a while

it is also true that BTC wont be largest marketcap forever

`So.. some people are so convinced that all alts are shit and only bitcoin will survive.`
Continuing to call them `alts` does nothing to dissuade that.....

[01-Nov-18 04:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
what they say is that BTC has by far the largest network effect and for "money" that is the main feature and becomes an increasingly self-fulfilling profecy, regardless of "tech"

[01-Nov-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that is true until the new tech is so much better, ie. Model T was a great car compared to horse drawn buggies

Is that about latest pompliano podcast? I tried that and the guy was saying any tech built on alts can be applied to bitcoin if it goes more in use and value than bitcoin. Also saying that alts to his opinion are doomed to fail in future except bitcoin.

I couldn’t believe what I was listening to. I don’t agree with both these statements.

[01-Nov-18 04:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Not sure who’s that guy, but I with lesser knowledge in Blockchain space understand that what he said is not true.

[01-Nov-18 04:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It’s not straight forward to adopting any tech to bitcoin. The reason I understand is the architecture and the community dev support among alot many other things.

[01-Nov-18 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
that guy is just an investor who likes to hear himself talk

[01-Nov-18 04:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If bitcoin struggles to change the variable value and do political things on that variable value change what hopes I should have with it?

[01-Nov-18 04:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Investors has to have technical understanding to talk about technology and be sure on telling it’s future.

@jl777c  from your experience how much testing increases cost/time of new code/app creation? is it 50%/50% codint testing, or testing, finding bugs and so might take longer/cost more?

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 I spend the majority of my time testing/debugging. it doesnt increase the cost of new code/app creation, it is most of the cost

[02-Nov-18 10:56 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
thx, while discussing the medicine creation business they costs are said to be mostly for testing and I was wondering if similar relation would be for coding (my guess was yes)

[02-Nov-18 10:56 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
with coding even when you got production sometimes you got bugs

[02-Nov-18 10:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but when new drug is on production "bug"  would be people death or a bad disease , so to secure from such heavy tests for many years are needed

Hi guys. Not sure where this belongs- I just went to DL Agama .43d, found the website text quite ironic. "If you log in and do not recognise your public address, your must have mistyped your seed". Made me double-check I was on the correct site and not a cloned site that was giving me a virus. Sorry for being pedantic, but even a small mistake like this made me really wary

[02-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the mistake?
