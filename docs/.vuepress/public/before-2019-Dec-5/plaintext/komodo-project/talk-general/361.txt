Thank you  @jl777c  @SHossain and the entire Komodo team. I have received all my KMD back. I will move it again to my ledger soon. I can't say enough how well the team has handled it. Appreciate all the hardwork.

@CobraComm you need to make sure both nodes are connected. Make sure the p2p port of each is open.

[11-Jun-19 11:06 PM] CobraComm#7798
i pinged to both systems and it was a success.

[11-Jun-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
You can also add `-testnode=1` to the startup params to make a network with a single node

[11-Jun-19 11:06 PM] Alright#0419
try `nc <ip> <p2pport>`

[11-Jun-19 11:07 PM] Alright#0419
the `-testnode=1` functionality isn't in master branch yet, use `beta` or `dev` branch for that

Support ticket sent; sure enough my $KMD seems to have been moved. Sorry for being slow to this; trying to check in monthly for the staking reward more; actually forgot for a long long time.. until recently

You guys have been pretty trustworthy over the years; Bitcoin dark fork to KMD, etc.. appreciate the effort to save peoples funds

Claiming interest on ledger works if I send entire balance back to itself right? Strangely I just sent my entire balance back to my account, but the percentage gain was only about 1.6%

[12-Jun-19 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
@tolken need to use a 3rd party app or it won't claim it

[12-Jun-19 03:12 AM] tolken#2655

I just found out a friend of mine had some KMD but didn't know about the hack.  I had him check his address and his funds were moved to the following address RVjDUCE3NDV72gghTrMTsBx4hvByKiN7gM.  It looks like his funds were stolen and not swept as thats not the safe address I read elsewhere.  Can my friend still file a claim  with the normal claim process?

[12-Jun-19 10:49 AM] Steve10#5203
He said there was a dust deposited into the account.

[12-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Audo#5667
Yes, that means he can claim it. He should follow that were posted

[12-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Steve10#5203
ok, thanks I'll let him know.

[12-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Audo#5667
I don't know about the addresses but if there's dust then it seems like it's on our address

[12-Jun-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it was a change address to the sweep tx, the sweep address is in that tx also

[12-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Steve10#5203
ok thats what I missed. Figured that address might have been the hackers address.  Thanks for saving his funds!

[12-Jun-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
only 47 valid claims for today...

[12-Jun-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i will wait an hour before processing, so you have a bit more time to send the smartdust from the old address to the new one. waiting on 161 such transactions. if you dont send the transaction from the old address to new, you wont get a refund. the almost 400 that have done all the steps have already gotten a refund.

Although, I did fill the form in before sending the dust, could that be an issue?

[12-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
likely there is a mismatch in your form vs where you sent the smartdust

[12-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810

[12-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Without exposing your seed? Not sure

[12-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Marten#0725
And what are the possibilities with exposing my seed? And if I do so it's not enough to create an new address because it's the same seed?

[12-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Marten#0725
Thinking of changing my hardware wallet, because I had similar issues before and I'm not happy with it...

[12-Jun-19 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
New seed new address

[12-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you use the seed in verus agama you should be able to access your funds but you need to extract your seed first I think

[12-Jun-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont have experience with ledgers myself

[12-Jun-19 06:52 PM] Marten#0725
