not sure if you ever heard of kickstarter, but I assume crowdfunding should be super easy with cryptocurrency.

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I only wished to play Need for Speed Underground on PS4, which is no more available on these models üò¶

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder mark my words, never sell your playstation

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and did not enjoy new NFS on it

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Really? ü§î

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that is one fantastic piece of hardware more than you will ever know

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Specifically one of the things that's powerful about decentralized gaming , giving indie devs the power to raise their own funds with their own chain.

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not much of a gamer

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
dude

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the PS2 was already revolutionary

[07-Mar-19 03:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I made my first renderfarm with a bunch of PS2

ARM ftw

[07-Mar-19 03:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the only usecase so far for PS4 for me would be for testing üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Markus#5464
@grewalsatinder  yea new NFS sux

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but the PS4, good god

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is good indeed, very powerful

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
with my devkit I can omit the framerate cap

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess testing VR on it would be good

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the Witcher at 80 fps is just blazing

[07-Mar-19 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I don't have VR, nver needed

[07-Mar-19 03:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I do have a DK2, but VR is difficult for design games in, also a small market for the better hardware

[07-Mar-19 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
bang

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
tokens can be made

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hahaha

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
this stuff is too easy

[07-Mar-19 04:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist besides rogue, has gaming been covered in those fancy tech Tuesday thingies?

[07-Mar-19 04:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Not much to my knowledge.

[07-Mar-19 04:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
A little bit.

[07-Mar-19 04:18 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm using our info here^^^^ to push this  to the game community ,i'm thinking the progress on bridging the gap for devs will excite people and bring a new wave of interest.  I'll need some fact checking in a few hours. üòÄ

[07-Mar-19 04:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist probably Twitter, Twitch and Medium are the gamedev social media of choice for the game community; are you a community manager?

[07-Mar-19 04:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep, not on twitch yet. It's the only new one to me.

[07-Mar-19 04:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm in Game Dev League too.

[07-Mar-19 04:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Oh, thats awesome, I am in that server too, I think.

[07-Mar-19 04:28 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Any other spots (aside from niche forums) I should get acquainted with?

[07-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am not super active though, mostly in GDN, GDU, IGD, RRG, GameJolt, Devdog and Brackeys

[07-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
depends mostly what you have to say.

[07-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
There is of course Reddit, but you have to understand that blockchain has a bad reputation among game developers

in your DM @Cryptofist just so you know, some Loomers have ruined it a bit already üòÉ

[07-Mar-19 04:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably best to avoid general channels and making big statements, or you are gonna be trolled üòõ

[07-Mar-19 04:31 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I know how the internet works, sheesh.

[07-Mar-19 04:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, GDN is one of the better moderated communities, lots of my AAA friends are there too.

[07-Mar-19 04:32 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Excellent üëç

[07-Mar-19 04:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Well, just so you know that the game industry is small - and once you get booted out of GDN, you are pretty much toast elsewhere.

[07-Mar-19 04:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am there too, but not super active (usually just #unity and #gamedev)

[07-Mar-19 04:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, its the largest and most variant amount of game developers together (unreal, unity, godot, source, etc)

[07-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, getting the nitty bitty from events, opinions, trends

[07-Mar-19 04:35 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm not even going to promote things. I'll be in #art

[07-Mar-19 04:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
is from my buddy Tim

[07-Mar-19 04:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist see DM

[07-Mar-19 04:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there is are monthly feedback fridays, and Tim does streams and vlogs, also contributes a lot to the indie scene and beginning developers.
