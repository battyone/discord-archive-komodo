tonyL is finalizing the GUI, so when it is done people can start sudoku-ing

Your not worried about automated solver's?

[30-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
for now there is no captcha, but once I get actual human solved sudoku then I can have a DB of what human solved sudoku looks like

[30-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
each square gets a timestamp when it is updated, and all timestamps are submitted as part of the solution

[30-Jan-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and likely we simply reject any solution that is faster than humanly possible

I started thinking about this Monday, implemented it yesterday, GUI started yesterday and we hope to have initial release out today

[30-Jan-19 09:35 AM] ch6ris#5240
I would imagine there is a ton of research on something as popular as sudoku.

[30-Jan-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
using the dynamic CC library method

[30-Jan-19 09:35 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
The speed you guys work amazes me

[30-Jan-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
I couldnt find sudoku square timestamp data

[30-Jan-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
I think a determined coder can get around most any captcha system, but with a 10 minute (about) solve time limit, it seems not much can be gained by cheating, so it would just be a way for people who like sudoku to earn some SUDOKU coins to keep score

[30-Jan-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
@CryptoNinjaa there is no validation code yet, so it isnt secure, just wanted to make the cclib more general and needed a simple new CC to plug into it and figured might as well make a fun game out of it

[30-Jan-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
validation code will take at least another day, plus likely machine learning on the square timestamps to make a reliable captcha and then an incremental commitment tx for in progress timestamps to prevent spoofing of them

[30-Jan-19 09:40 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
oh cool , Still from idea to test has been fast, Its a good idea a really good idea. Im happy to test and im a bit rusty tho haha

[30-Jan-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810

[30-Jan-19 01:28 PM] crypto#5644
So it doesn't work from the CLI wallet.

[30-Jan-19 01:30 PM] crypto#5644
@Acura thanks, but talking about a transaction I received from bittrex, I think you call this a transaprent address. I need to send those to a sapling address. This tool requires me to send Sprout inputs.

[30-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think you can just send from transparent adress to a sapling adress?

[30-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But for kmd z adresses will be disabled in the near future

[30-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
for privacy features a separate tool will be built using crypto conditions

[30-Jan-19 01:33 PM] crypto#5644
Thanks, I think I got what I need. Traded some KMD for PIRATE which is what I need.

[30-Jan-19 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, the pirate does need to be in a sapling adress

by 2030 close to 1b of human being will speak French (3 times more than in 2018). A majority of those people will live in Africa and mostly in West Africa where we try to be present. Most of  the population leaving in this area having issues when it comes to money and price stability. Seems like Komodo have a bright future with the French speaking population.
