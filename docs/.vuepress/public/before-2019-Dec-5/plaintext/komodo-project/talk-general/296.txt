Actually it's quite easy to participate in publication or publish some

[11-May-19 08:07 AM] TonyL#3577
So quite easy to create scientific "fake", there are tons of magazines

@tramp 99% of what we care about is code. Send some Github PRs and many things will be forgiven 👼

Publications in some not very well moderated and just matter of money. So in general it's better to not trust just names in publications

Solid thread @grewalsatinder !

[11-May-19 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
using some big position or past history is I guess a lame way of making a trusted respected profile in cryptocurrency/dev community.
the highly recommended way is: 
- Be Completely Anonymous.
- Code, make it public, and contribute to existing Open Source Projects.

>> The Quality of the contributions builds the trusted and respectful profile much much better than the previous history of whatever big someone was in industry. <<

[11-May-19 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There was one project last time I doubted about. That was kinda the reason for me there as well. And it's the same with this imposter too.

[11-May-19 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is no need to be someone. Just be your own self. Be Anonymous. Contribute. Gain wealth.

In the age of information, the human society only gave boost to the the real world gossip via social media at the most dangerous levels in our human history.

[11-May-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is hard to find the truth in this noise much of the time.

[11-May-19 10:09 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
there's a world of difference between being anon and faking an identity/credentials using bought/hacked accounts, the latter is going to raise huge red flags. This is a space full of sharks and scammer. He/She pretendes not to see the difference 🤦  pls grow up and blame yourself

It looks like a poor try to be anonymous. Hence my comments.

who knows that was the intentions 😅 except only imagining a negative since the initial profile being negative.

[11-May-19 10:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm closing this conversation. Moving back to what I was doing. think it was enough for a day worth chat.
you guys continue 😄

since I'm here for a lil while @Deleted User how's your JavaScript work going with Komodo CC? 
I was almost away from all things for a month. Must have missed a lot of things in dev

It's not working for me anymore

[11-May-19 11:21 AM] Pepe#1333
It only works when I immediatly click confirm, not even time to check addresses or amounts on device.

[11-May-19 11:22 AM] Pepe#1333
If I wait a few seconds for checking, "Failed to sign with Ledger device: U2F TIMEOUT"

[11-May-19 11:22 AM] Pepe#1333
@lukechilds

[11-May-19 11:22 AM] az#1921
It happens also with me. I use the first try to remember the address and the second time to check it.

[11-May-19 11:24 AM] Pepe#1333
Should be fixed asap, especially because we're paying 5% service fee ....

[11-May-19 11:24 AM] Pepe#1333
I hope luke looks into it

[11-May-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
be aware if you use that tool and mention it here, you're basically linking your identity to the coins 
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/RQzv9tVzCHXN9j3kF5qNzms555zzLC9HQF
All the fees go to that address, just saying

[11-May-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
it's a good tool, but if you're paranoid, don't mention you just used it

Their service doesn't charge the 5% and it's working well. (if that's something you'd like to avoid)

magnum wallet isn't working for me at least for a month.

[11-May-19 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007

magnumwallet said they will look into it

[11-May-19 02:05 PM] PTYX#6840
They tend to fix things fast. I'll check to see if I can claim on my ledger.
