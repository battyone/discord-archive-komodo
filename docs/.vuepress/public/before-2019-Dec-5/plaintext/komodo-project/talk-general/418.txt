`why do you continue this?`
because you continue spouting inconsistencies 
`the funds come from the 75%, it is then uses as an incentive bonus`
if anything other than 75% is a "bug"/"flaw" then 75% cannot be a "bonus"
either it's a bonus or it's what is due
**This** is my contention, you mince words on this subject regulary to conflate concepts and make them *seem* cohesive, and since people don't read words for what they are (but rather they use interpreted meanings), they tend to not call you out on it

[04-Sep-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@dukeleto I don't disagree as to where (especially since I muted that channel 4 minutes after it was created), I'm just reacting to/commenting on what's presented here 🤷🏽

[04-Sep-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are still against the hunting pool even though it solves a lot of issues and rewards NN for working together

[04-Sep-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and are obsessed over some grammatical crime i commit along the process to achieve such a solution

[04-Sep-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
75% is the targeted amount. some of that is currently coming in via the hunting pool, so it is used as reinforcement of good behavior

[04-Sep-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so you are still against the hunting pool`
again, you're conflating 
I'm against you saying 1 minute that it's a "donation" "bonus" and the next justifying its existence by saying it's NNs getting what they deserve
If it's NNs getting what they deserve than it cannot be a gift of your grace
`are obsessed over some grammatical crime i commit`
because words and expressions are all we have here in this text based format

[04-Sep-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i was faced with a problem, i solved it the best i know how, and included the affected parties (all the NN) in the process

[04-Sep-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i apologize for any liberties i took with grammar along the way

[04-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the bottom line is there is (mostly) peace in NN land now

[04-Sep-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i was faced with a problem, i solved it the best i know how, and included the affected parties (all the NN) in the process`
again, this isn't that
My objection or agreement with that is wholly separate for the presentation of the "why"

[04-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so your point has no real purpose, other than to prove that i am some sort of grammar criminal?

[04-Sep-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my point is that if it's a thing due to NNs because it's right and proper for them to have it then it cannot and should not be lorded over them like a bunch of Pavlovian dogs salivating for a meal

[04-Sep-19 01:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_at this point I just has to accept that next 24-48 hours will be wasted on this resolved issue and to not expect any other productive work._
_also hating to catch up on chat_

[04-Sep-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
why am i not allowed to use a revenue stream to reinforce good behavior?

[04-Sep-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
do you not want good behavior reinforced?

[04-Sep-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and all a NN has to do to be eligible is to notarize

[04-Sep-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a reasonable thing to reinforce

[04-Sep-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why am i not allowed to use a revenue stream to reinforce good behavior?`
because if it's right and proper that NNs have that amount then it's not your right to withhold it from them
`do you not want good behavior reinforced?`
again, you conflate things

[04-Sep-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so you would want a NN that doesnt notarize all month to get the same as one that did??

[04-Sep-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more conflation

[04-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Slyris#2880
This is a nonsense conversation ^^'

[04-Sep-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the current NN rewards isnt directly linked to notarizations, this hunting pool created a way to directly reward actively notarizing NN

[04-Sep-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so you would want a NN that doesnt notarize all month to get the same as one that did??`
The greed in me says no
but....
If it's their due then it's their due

[04-Sep-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i made a judgement call that it was the right thing to do. you disagree and go on and on for days and days

[04-Sep-19 01:54 PM] TS#7923
Hey hey, stop, please. All I see is nonsense. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do you actually have an alternative solution / recommendation / _whatever_ ? Because I don't see any.

@TS my solution is simple:
it's either
a) through the grace of james
or
b) it's what is due to NNs because it's right and proper
pick one....

[04-Sep-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
a NN that doesnt notarize does not deserve any bonus

[04-Sep-19 01:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@VoskCoin there is actually no drama, and most NNs are happily running the network. Greer has been a good contribution to the network this year, motivated and interested to help. We wouldn't be sad if you mentioned your KMD notary stats on your channel once in a while 👼

This is not a solution. What is your solution? In 3 full English sentences. I think this is bad because of (a) , I propose (b) and (c), and I think we should do (x) and see if others agree.

thanks @CrisF 🤦🏽

[04-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Slyris#2880
I think we are a community and what we want is to improve as much as possible. But for that it is necessary to expose the problems clearly to allow debates on the duration as for example through a github issue.

[04-Sep-19 01:59 PM] VoskCoin#1869
@dukeleto lol I know I just referenced greer here because we were recently discussing NNs & I'm going to start my Komodo series soon, ~2 weeks
I have a really cool video I've been compiling info for to kick it off with -- sometimes just a good headline can really help to propel a video forward(or upward 🤔 )

Nobody is right or wrong, it is a discussion supposed with all the nodes operators which will allow you to find a suitable solution, not worth barking between you.

[04-Sep-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
a solution is already in place and there is no change proposed

[04-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Slyris#2880
transparently, not in a private discussion of course

[04-Sep-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a change in how it is described? not even sure what change would make CG stop

[04-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Slyris#2880
If no change is proposed is that the current system suits the majority of you then there is no debate to have?

[04-Sep-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you would thing so...

[04-Sep-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
apparently, my reasoning was justified in some way that offends

[04-Sep-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
submit a change request, vague complaints about grammar. this is not a fixable bug

[04-Sep-19 02:02 PM] Slyris#2880
No, but we have all our states of souls we are all human.

[04-Sep-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@TS 
I think this is bad because of (a) , I propose (b) [or] (c), and I think we should do (x) 
a) a thing cannot be rightfully yours **and** given to you only due to someone else's like or dislike of how you act about their whims and random "rules" set in place at any random time they see fit
b) these rewards are seen as what is the notaries due
or
c) these rewards are seen as some "bonus" given to them through the goo and free will of another and the claim that they "deserve" 75% never be spoken again
x) pick b) or c) and go back to doing something useful

that better now?

[04-Sep-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but what specific change to the current hunting pool do you propose?

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the rules for distribution are indeed subject to change, but current one seems to be working fine, so there seems no need to change them

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the rules are not randomly changed

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
they are updated based on new conditions, if needed

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but what specific change to the current hunting pool do you propose?`
that's an entirely different topic (one that you keep conflating back into the conversation and refuse to accept that I have acquiesced on a while back)

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if a NN notarizes, they get the bonus

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] Slyris#2880
I do not want to go into details but sometimes decisions are to be made and sometimes have all made mistakes or sometimes we just make the right decision but that does not please everyone. It's super simple to come after and say I would have done like that and all would be pass wonderfully.

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810

@kolo
This isn't "just about distributing" anything
This is about the constant need to keep conflating conversations to skew the topic, muddy the waters, and sway perceptions 
The fact that people still think otherwise proves that the tactic seems to work quite consistently

[04-Sep-19 02:11 PM] costa2439#3771
everything that is discussed about the notary nodes seems a point of centralization

[04-Sep-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
75% of blocks split between 64 NN

[04-Sep-19 02:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Slyris those are and were internal for monthes, and nothing and no action was done to fix. how to make devs change their mind is noone is aware.

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
closed discussions may require the community acknowledgment when nothing is done after so much time

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly centralized. the hunting pool is indeed via a centralized mechanism currently, but this is not any big issue that needs a hardfork over

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the amounts from the hunting pool is estimated to be about a 20% boost to NN revenues, but that might be shrinking

[04-Sep-19 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
yet NN are free to hunt, but you don t provide the tools for. They got an illusionary choice

[04-Sep-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
any consensus change would require a hardfork, and that is only something you can do so often, unless there is some big attack issue, which this is not

[04-Sep-19 02:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
provide the script publicly then they will really have the choice

we could just burn the unclaimed rewards with the next hardfork if that is what people want

putting my "miner hat" back on for a moment....
That unclaimed rewards existed as a bonus to miners (despite 3 **major** changes to the process since then) is why I stayed mining KMD rather than any one of a dozen chains
Profitability breeds hashrate which breeds stronger blocks
