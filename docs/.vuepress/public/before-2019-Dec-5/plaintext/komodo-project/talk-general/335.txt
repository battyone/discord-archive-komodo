They would've had to have their own server in place to receive everyone's keys as their wallets are opened.

`Cyber Security Team used the same exploit to gain control of a lot of affected seeds and secure the funds at risk`
`used the same exploit` = accessed the compromised keys

[06-Jun-19 10:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
if u opened your wallet 3 weeks ago your seed was compromised and was sitting in a db

[06-Jun-19 10:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
no, your assumption is incorrect

[06-Jun-19 10:01 PM] smalls#0439
Hacking a db that the attacker used is not "the same exploit". At all.

[06-Jun-19 10:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
```jl777c Today
we actually took the coins from the hacker as he had the privkeys```

[06-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Vertigo#0439
So in conclusion lightning network won't be secure because servers can get hacked too?

[06-Jun-19 10:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
```
exploit
n.    A program or system designed to take advantage of a particular error or security vulnerability in computers or networks.```

[06-Jun-19 10:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
the team took advantage of the exploit therefore used the same exploit

[06-Jun-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
they just had a different way of accessing the compromised seeds üòâ

[06-Jun-19 10:05 PM] smalls#0439
I could see that. If the attacker had imported all of the keys into the same wallet, and the team pushed an update that caused the attacker's wallet to send all of its keys to the team's server - using the same exploit- that would make sense.

[06-Jun-19 10:06 PM] smalls#0439
But can a single wallet have multiple keys?

[06-Jun-19 10:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
of course it can

[06-Jun-19 10:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
You can have multiple keys, but only one seed phrase

[06-Jun-19 10:07 PM] crunchycat#0726
You'll have a private key for each derived address, but the seed phrase there's only one

[06-Jun-19 10:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
you can extract priv keys from seeds and import in a cli wallet üòâ

[06-Jun-19 10:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
therefore have multiple keys in a wallet

[06-Jun-19 10:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you try to correct someone at least be right

[06-Jun-19 10:08 PM] crunchycat#0726
Do you have any idea how many private keys/addresses can be generated from one seed phrase? Lol

[06-Jun-19 10:09 PM] smalls#0439
Using the same exploit on the attacker would've required the attacker to update their wallet to the one with the team's exploit.

[06-Jun-19 10:09 PM] crunchycat#0726
Just pointing out that one seed phrase is all that's needed to restore any of the millions or whatever of  addresses  associated with it

@smalls nobody said they used the exploit on the attacker

```used the same exploit to gain control of a lot of affected seeds```

[06-Jun-19 10:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
the exploitation happened already... they just used it through different means
i don't get why english is so hard?!

[06-Jun-19 10:13 PM] smalls#0439
That's probably why you're struggling with it.

[06-Jun-19 10:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
i have no struggle with english, i'm just wondering why it's hard for some to grasp a simple sentence

[06-Jun-19 10:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
not to mention some use words they don't understand

[06-Jun-19 10:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
and by some.. i mean you

[06-Jun-19 10:15 PM] smalls#0439
It they didn't use the same exploit on the attacker, then they used it on us. Like I said, that would've required them to have known about this when I last opened my wallet 3 weeks ago.

[06-Jun-19 10:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
wrong again

[06-Jun-19 10:16 PM] klunex#3191
is the malicous code just limited to agama or does the trojan infect whole computer?

[06-Jun-19 10:16 PM] smalls#0439
Maybe you should take the time to read the npm article, so you can understand what the exploit actually was. https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm

[06-Jun-19 10:16 PM] richardt#2807
@smalls I think you have a valid concern that there could have potentially been another backdoor that the team was aware of and used.  But I think it's the wording of that article that's not clear.  Technically it is the same exploit because the team gained control of the server to which all the seeds were being saved, but they gained control of the server through different means

[06-Jun-19 10:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
again you don't seem to understand what an exploit is

[06-Jun-19 10:17 PM] richardt#2807
they "hacked the hacker"

@smalls if I just now found out that 5 minutes from now someone was going to poke you in the eye and I poke you in the eye 4 minutes from now, does that mean that I knew 3 weeks ago that you'd get poked in the eye?

@Warkid how much volume you want?

[07-Jun-19 12:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
Not saying this is what was done, but let's say hypothetically the KMD team (or some member of it) was the one that published the package that got included in the Agama wallet.  They proceed to steal 9 million coins, then claim "we saved 8 million coins, you're welcome".  Pocket 1 million coins, even give some back "out of their own pocket to make people whole".

[07-Jun-19 12:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
Is there any way to prove that this scenario is not what occurred?
