Im french and i need a reponse in the french channel but they are noboby...

[12-Aug-18 10:29 AM] ECA Fr#7195
I am really shocked by the lack of people in the discord, I do not want to criticize, besides I had even come to have information on the project because I want to invest ...
I am myself on another crypto that I keep, yet it is ranked 260th on coinmarketcap and yet there is a lot of activity on the discord, the community and very active ...
Honestly, I have heard from some important crypto personalities just as the boss of Binance say that Komodo would be a very good investment in the long term compared to what it offers and its technology,
I would like if it's possible with simple words that it's finally Komodo's technology please?
I heard about an application that can be created by the komodo platform but it's the same that does not speak to me at all ...
Could you please with simple words and metaphors (if it's too complicated) explain to me what Komodo is.
thanks

[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Komodo is the nexus in a multiple blockchain ecosystem. It gains that value through its necessary usage in delayed proof of work and other applications which are utilized by other blockchains in the ecosystem.   Using Komodo tech to create their own independent but technologically compatible blockchains they (developers and community )retain full autonomy of their project even if in the future they decide to part ways with Komodo.  It prevents projects from having to start from scratch by providing access to bitcoins hashrate for security, BarterDEX protocol for atomic swaps,  anonymity through zksnarks  as well as other features and customizations,  such as tokenization and custom consensus .  People are / will build projects on Komodo. Those people will utilize komodos functionality that require Komodo to use.  This creates a feedback loop/circuit in the ecosystem.  There is a lot more but that's the simple version of it

So this might be a weird question but this team is focusing on the future tech of this industry so you might have some ideas. What's the plan to deal with quantum computers? They will be here faster than we realize and could/will wreak havoc. I don't know enough about them to formulate any real opinions but from what I've read they will be able to correctly calculate every single seed to every single crypto address all at the same time. How do you combat that? Has this been thought of at all?

[12-Aug-18 02:19 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Quantum computers are further out than you think IMO.

[12-Aug-18 02:19 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
Seeing the tech we have now if you lived 20 years ago would BLOW your mind

[12-Aug-18 02:19 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Plus I'm quite sure asics will incorporate quantum computing which will put quantum computers in the same class as regular computers.

[12-Aug-18 02:20 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I never read that QC allow to immediately find all priv keys, this is a very wild exaggeration. There are new algo that resolve it and coins can transition to them. Don't worry

[12-Aug-18 02:20 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
@KomodoWorld ah so it has already been discussed?

[12-Aug-18 02:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Do you understand what a quantum computer is it's quite literally the advent of delivering a digital signal with more than 1 piece of information. They use to be just boolean values but now they will encompass multiple signals.

[12-Aug-18 02:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Yes you can find many discussions on internet related to Bitcoin that are valid for KMD as well

[12-Aug-18 02:21 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
@BlackJesus no I really don't I've read stuff but it's a bit over my head

[12-Aug-18 02:21 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
ill admit that

[12-Aug-18 02:22 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
@KomodoWorld ok cool thanks

[12-Aug-18 02:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They won't be that fast were nearly on the ceiling for the thermal threshhold without quantum signals.

oh nice i didn't know about that

[12-Aug-18 02:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
die shrinks are important because it's literally the ability to preserve performance and reduce heat. That's the only reason die shrinks are so big. Going from 14nm to 7nm is the same performance with a reduction of upward of 70%heat output.

[12-Aug-18 02:23 PM] —ï‚ÑìŒπ–º#1031
honestly I think humans will destroy themselves via war or climate change before we can reach mass quantum computing

[slack] <Catalyst> @#6934 I synced the blockchain using Agama native for Chainzilla, but when i try to run it using Komodo Ocean from @#3767  it gives this error. What should i do.. üòû

Hi there I cannot see the error image , please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com

[12-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Hermes#6934
One of the reasons of ruling classes not wanting Quantum computers is that it will solve many issues, and can also be used for war. There is a even a theory that says that the explosions in China were focused in taking down their super computers...at the end they will solve a lot of issues and for some ruling elite or governments they are not convenient

[12-Aug-18 07:37 PM] ca333#0118
@Catalyst we are glad that the ZILLA fix worked. Did you try to use Agama again after the "corrupted DB error"? If this only happens with the QT wallet than its possible that the codebase is not fully up2date - @Decker can hopefully help you with that - he is one of the QT wallet lead developers.

I'm launching a new chain tomorrow to incentivize testing. 
http://pad.supernet.org/staked 
Post an address there, you will receive an equal amount from the initial premine as everyone else. The plan is to snapshot/airdrop every 6 days with 1 day in between.(testing different params each week) If you find a bug or break the chain, you will receive extra coins from the premine of the new chain. We will continually do this until we arrive at a stable chain, and this stable chain will live on as STAKED.(name up for discussion) 

premine will be distributed tomorrow at 3 PM GMT
pay attention to the POSTEST64 channel in the CHIPS discord if you're interested 
https://discord.gg/9YX6GJ

If anyone has ideas for test scenarios we could do, please let me know

[slack] <Catalyst> @ well i clicked the okay button and it is still syncing.. downloaded like around 1.4 GB of data and and 25% to go still. I wanted to see what happens when the QT itself downloads it. So will update if it works or not.
I would actually request @if he can have a look at it.
But I am really happy that you took the time and helped @

[13-Aug-18 11:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just a question for everyone. What do you think about a donation button for hyperDEX? Would anyone consider donating towards development or just like most donation buttons, it would be pointless?

[13-Aug-18 11:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Second question - If we were to make a ledger reward claiming app that you paid 1-2% of the interest amount (not 1-2% / 5%, 1-2% of whatever the interest amount was), would you use that and be happy to pay the fee?

[13-Aug-18 11:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
1) I would donate from time to time of there is an address / button yes
2) Sounds like a good idea yes. It's like the 0conf bots deposit with you pay a fee

[13-Aug-18 11:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just for reference, bounty will be about 30% of the total dev costs by the end of the year. That is why i am asking the questions.

[13-Aug-18 11:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
bounty to implement a reward claiming app?

[13-Aug-18 11:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The bounty received for making hyperDEX.

As much as i would like to keep funding development, there is a point where I wont be able to. So just trying to figure out if the KMD whales want to help or not and if a donation model will help.

[13-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll donate a bit, not a whale by any means though üò¶

[13-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Regarding the ledger app, I dont use a ledger myself, but I can assume people would be happy to pay 1-2% to be able to claim from their ledger

[13-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yearly intrest drops to 5,049% when taking 2%

[13-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is still hella fine

[13-Aug-18 12:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What would be the yearly volume required to be able to sustain hyperdex through the dexfee? 15M USD?

[13-Aug-18 12:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
at 100m volume the dex fee is 770k -> 77k for gui

[13-Aug-18 12:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k

[13-Aug-18 12:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
so that's 275k a day and we have been that

[13-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah, but not all volume is through hyperdex, some is through CLI/Barterdex etc

[13-Aug-18 12:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah bulk of the volume would be CLI

[13-Aug-18 12:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We will not make enough to cover dev costs until we do probably at least 1m/day through the app lol

[13-Aug-18 01:12 PM] PTYX#6840

Does anyone know how to send interest to another address whenever i claim

[13-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
(using lite mode)

[13-Aug-18 01:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
mr governments taken enough of my kmd this year

[13-Aug-18 01:17 PM] PTYX#6840
ü§î that's an interesting option for the claiming mechanism. But not possible yet on Agama. You would need to claim it and send afterwards or probably you'd be able to do it by using the cli.

[13-Aug-18 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Deleted User there was such an option, @jl777c mentioned it somewhere, can't find it anymore

[13-Aug-18 01:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah i remember he mentioned it but cant find it atm

[13-Aug-18 01:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
a way to set a different address where intrests are deposited different from your main wallet

@Deleted User 
jl777c07/23/2018
there is an untested -donation=<pubkey> option that will send interest to the donation's address if you dont want to deal with having income into your wallet

[13-Aug-18 01:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
native only and not (well) tested so you might want to try with snall amounts

[13-Aug-18 01:56 PM] xRobeSx#5136
a -donation=pubkey option hmm that's pretty cool

[13-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
this solves the taxation issue, especially for people who might have to pay taxes on accrued rewards

[13-Aug-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the argument is that it could end up where you run with -donation= mode and never even get it

[13-Aug-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you could always not collect it but that is a long time away

[13-Aug-18 04:52 PM] Llama#1330
what are the fees on KMD transactions?

[13-Aug-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
normally 0.0001

[13-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Llama#1330
0.0001 kmd?

[13-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Llama#1330
on any size transactions?

[13-Aug-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
in almost all cases, only exception is if you have a lot of small change utxo, then it could be more
