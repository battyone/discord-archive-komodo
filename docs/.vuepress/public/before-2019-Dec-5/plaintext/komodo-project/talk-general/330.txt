So lets say this one guy I know was an idiot and misplaced some important information and the only thing he has in the QR code to access his wallet from Agama how would one recover his funds?

@polycryptoblog how do I recover based off secret code from Agama?

[06-Jun-19 01:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can import your key into other wallets. Follow instructions in the guide

[06-Jun-19 01:16 AM] The Digital Link#1826

do we just send the funds to a new wallet?

[06-Jun-19 01:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  make sure new address WAS NOT generated by Komodo Agama.  Make sure to uninstall Komodo Agama as well

What do we need to do to send from our agama to verus wallet?

[06-Jun-19 02:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Agama is a third party app, and the first thing written in the Git is `This is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk! No warranty for any kind of damage!`

Found the link, just asking if it can be pinned, so others don't have to hunt for the link.

[06-Jun-19 03:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it is somewhere

[06-Jun-19 03:07 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Well, there are a lot of channels in this Discord, maybe it should be pinned to general?

[06-Jun-19 03:09 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Anyway, I got the link, my friend had a smaller wallet, all KMD I paid him for running my merchant website, he hasn't gotten swept, trying to help him move it.

[06-Jun-19 03:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Please check the #support channel for all the details

@Alexfrog in veruscoin wallet I am getting invalid public address for chips.

[06-Jun-19 03:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i think a lot of people were having that

[06-Jun-19 03:12 AM] kpprabhu#9635
How to create a new address and move Chips?

[06-Jun-19 03:12 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Is it safe login to old agama wallet to send out coins ?

[06-Jun-19 03:13 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I have to download the Veruscoin wallet again myself for a smaller KMD wallet I had, got interrupted by an internet outage 😦

[06-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
create the new address first kpprabhu

[06-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if you havent logged into agama for a long time

[06-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
not sure if it matters

[06-Jun-19 03:15 AM] kpprabhu#9635
@Alexfrog that is my issue. I am unable to create new address. The address creates on Verus wallet is not working.

[06-Jun-19 03:25 AM] Edward#3177
Saw people saying to completely uninstall Agama. Is there a keylogger or something? I haven't been able to follow the excitement enough so maybe this was covered, but are there any more details about what's going on since last night?

[06-Jun-19 03:26 AM] Edward#3177
Also HUGE props to the dev team for staying up all night racing to get this all handled. Best team in the space by miles.

[06-Jun-19 03:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
To be safe we recommend people uninstall , transparency report will be released in the upcoming days

[06-Jun-19 03:37 AM] PTYX#6840
@kpprabhu if you login and see funds, move them to a new address

[06-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the issue is , it keeps saying "invalid pub address" when he wants to send from verus agama chips lite @PTYX

[06-Jun-19 03:41 AM] Edward#3177
Any info about where is safe to move ZEXO? Had to use the keys to load from the fork but in Native mode, DP deposits are down, and I saw someone say DP was targeted and using Agama. What's the play here? Kinda feel like nowhere is safu right now.

[06-Jun-19 03:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can send them to an address created by Verus Agama.  Zexo has the Same key format as KMD

[06-Jun-19 03:43 AM] Edward#3177
Got it, thanks.

[06-Jun-19 03:50 AM] rocketboy#5757
Hi everyone, what's going on with the missing funds?   What's the plan for disbursing these funds?

[06-Jun-19 03:51 AM] Edward#3177
So the Agama v.0.5.6a is the Verus one and it's good? Looks the same as normal Agama so just making sure.

[06-Jun-19 03:53 AM] Edward#3177
@rocketboy There's a recovery process. Check the blogs.

[06-Jun-19 03:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Correct

[06-Jun-19 03:59 AM] Edward#3177
Looks like there is no ZEXO in Verus Agama though, so not sure what to do other than wait and hope for the best. I've already uninstalled the old Komodo Agama. Even if I reinstall it there isn't a lite mode or native ZEXO in the Verus Agama to move them to.

[06-Jun-19 04:00 AM] Edward#3177
Shit nvm, I see it.

[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] rocketboy#5757
"the blogs" told me to come to discord @Edward

[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Edward#3177
@rocketboy There's a form you'll fill out for redistribution from the white hat wallet if I recall.

ok...fill out a form...then what?

[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Edward#3177
@rocketboy Then the heroes send your coins back to you.

[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] rocketboy#5757
LOL...the "heroes" that took them...are you effing serious?

[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Edward#3177
@rocketboy They are saving them from someone else taking them bro. That's the best you can ask for right now.

[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
U wouldnt be having those coins if the team didnt sweep them 😓

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] rocketboy#5757
How did you come to that conclusion @WorldOfCryptos ?

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We will be making transparency report after we have concluded investigating , moving the coins was the only way to save as many peoples funds as possible .  It was a race against the attacker

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
If u read completly what info has been put out u would know.

[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] rocketboy#5757
Well at this particular point my wallet is empty

[06-Jun-19 04:09 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
"After discovering the vulnerability, our Cyber Security Team used the same exploit to gain control of a lot of affected seeds and secure the funds at risk. We were able to sweep around 8 million KMD and 96 BTC from these vulnerable wallets, which otherwise would have been easy pickings for the attacker. "

[06-Jun-19 04:09 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
That was from the komodo team post

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] rocketboy#5757
Able to get it back...until that happens...

[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
Now u tell me would u want the attacker take ur funds or have team sweep them for u and save ur komodos ?

@rocketboy check if your coins were sent to the white hat wallets. If so, be patient. This could be much worse.

[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719

I haven't seen anyone who says they weren't saved by the team or actually lost coins. Maybe I missed it, but as usual the team is ahead of the issue.

Everything seems locked up and market makers are keeping the charts clean too. Can't complain. ARRR may have some activity, but can't complain about it much after the last month either. Solid damage control guys.

You can send your HUSH to your new Raddress. It might not be visible in the wallet, but you can confirm it exists in the address by searching it here - https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
