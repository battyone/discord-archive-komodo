"the btcd swap for kmd"
Didn't that end like 6 months ago after a *year* of time to swap?

[29-Jun-18 09:53 PM] Koko#1210
Yes, it ended but I had xxx ico kmd on the platform that was promised it was going to be transferred to my wallet some months ago

The block explorer at https://kmd.explorer.supernet.org/block/044199301f37194f20ba7b498fc72ed742f6c0ba6e476f28d6c81d225e58d5ce  (level 850000, mined five weeks ago) and all subsequent blocks as giving a block reward of only 1.5 KMD.  But the coinbase transaction in each block pays 3 KMD.  I assume there's a bug in the block explorer code?

[29-Jun-18 11:38 PM] 1TheGhostProject#3962
kmd stealing from miners  lol

[29-Jun-18 11:40 PM] mv#8810
Nah.  The coinbase transaction is sending the right amount.  If anyone is misled, they might underestimate coin issuance and future money supply.  That doesnt hurt miners.  Doesn't help them either.

Why do we "chalk it up" to something (or someone)?
What is the etymology and meaning of the phrase "chalk it up"? For instance:
"I will chalk it up to a colloquialism" (source).
"Just chalk it up as an odd case and move on" (source).

I was going to say that the internet has destroyed much more than jokes, but it's really people and their use of social media. Majority seems to be mindless drivel.
