[13-May-19 04:51 PM] PTYX#6840

{Reactions}

[13-May-19 05:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in what way seed is worse then file name / user name + password ?

[13-May-19 05:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
got it but why not leave a nerdy options for me ? 😛

[13-May-19 05:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im not against innovation, just if it possible to set some param and use "old style mode" that is nice then why not

Dear voters, dear komodo hodlers,

If my candidacy as NN is SH region is accepted, 20% of mining rewards will go to CHIPS devlopment, 20% will go to #kmdlabs and I will support and help KMD ecosystem and DEX (tools, stats, dockerfiles, block explorers, mining pools and pools with profit switch).

Thank you to everybody who supported me and voted for me. I arrived few weeks prior to the election but I received as many votes as I was in komodo ecosystem since a while. In my eyes, komodo community prooved to be fair.
Thank you everybody!

Remark: my performance on testnet is good thanks to the training provided by @Alright , @blackjok3r and whole KMD community

[13-May-19 05:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I tend to think if sth is depracated then must be strong security reason - some part of code was not safe or sth... but if not the can then I would vote for putting this as an advanced options somewhere 😃

[13-May-19 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 old style still supported for advanced users. you need to start Agama with `hardcore` option

[13-May-19 05:14 PM] SHossain#0007
so, for linux portable, it will be `./agama hardcore` to start with old interface

{Reactions}
👌 

[13-May-19 05:15 PM] SHossain#0007
for windows, you need to create a shortcut with that param

[13-May-19 05:18 PM] D3b0#9761
do i nedd to uninstal previous version of agama wallet?

[13-May-19 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
always better to uninstall old version first before installing new version

{Reactions}
👌 

[13-May-19 05:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if you meant the 0.3.5 portable version, then you don't have to, because it wasn't installed at the first place

[13-May-19 05:24 PM] pbca26#5430
it was part too many user typo support cases and part to make it easier to use @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 
certain old school features will still be supported for hardcore users but using them may have untested/unexpected results
@SHossain listed a proper command for old style login

[13-May-19 05:30 PM] pbca26#5430
btw tg bot @kmd_rewards_notifications_bot has only 4 addresses subscribed so far, very few
i was under impression it's a much needed reminder service for kmd hodlers
the more subscribers there are the sooner i can optimize and polish it

[13-May-19 05:32 PM] D3b0#9761
how to enable advanced features  for BTC or ETH ?

[13-May-19 05:32 PM] D3b0#9761
