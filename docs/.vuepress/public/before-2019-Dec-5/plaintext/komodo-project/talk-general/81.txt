DO u realize how unnecessary complicated is to read line on Github in comparison to that same text being placed in PDF or on a web page ?

[29-Sep-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why I am not in marketing.

[29-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
😃 well .. that is why KMD is one of the top 100 cryptos with lowest velocity

[29-Sep-18 07:15 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Hungry_BullBear KMD gets Zcash privacy (tech superior to Monero) adds up scalability better then EOS (while still being decentralized) and adds crypto conditions to get dapps escaping Eth which cannot scale currently.

[29-Sep-18 07:16 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
How is the scalability achieved  ? Is there a quick way to explain it - I dont want to read ugly docs with no clear answers on github ?

[29-Sep-18 07:16 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Current goals I know are 1. [simple] prove 1 mln TX/S 2. [hard] get more dapps

[29-Sep-18 07:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
scalability is achieve by running many chains + some way of joining payments or so..., idk details ask in #dev-scalability

[29-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 thanks for ur time answering some quick questions.

[29-Sep-18 07:18 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
What is supposed to happen once 1 mil TX/s are proven ?

Any business plan ? Any ideas where u would apply those capacities ?

[29-Sep-18 07:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
then you may market and sell the solution

[29-Sep-18 07:19 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
where to apply? attract projects escaping Eth

[29-Sep-18 07:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
like Cryto Kitties for example

[29-Sep-18 07:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Eth scale less, EOS is not decentralized... some projects that are serious must find a better tech

[29-Sep-18 07:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but likely most projects (Eth ICOs) were  just run for money and will disappear

[29-Sep-18 07:21 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
😃

[29-Sep-18 07:21 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 KMD team should be paying u

[29-Sep-18 07:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
they are maybe

[29-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
^^

[29-Sep-18 07:22 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
KMD has 5% APR

[29-Sep-18 07:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and some airdrops from tiem to time 😃 so I can als oadd soem value sometimes

[29-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
it is good to "oadd soem value " sometimes

[29-Sep-18 07:24 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
😄

[29-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 What would u say is the biggest development in KMD in the past 12 months

[29-Sep-18 07:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
JL better answer this

[29-Sep-18 07:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also depend what biggest means... hardest to do , or most futuristic, or adding more value in the future

[29-Sep-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810

[29-Sep-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810

a way to create custom consensus rules changes

[29-Sep-18 07:50 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Smart Contract on the bTC chain ? Is this the big deal?

[29-Sep-18 07:51 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
"For now, just four basic Crypto-Conditions-based smart contracts have been activated on Komodo Platform: Assets, Faucet, Rewards, and Dice. " How are any of these applicable to real use case ?

[29-Sep-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the next ones are channels, oracles, gateways

[29-Sep-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
channels is an improved Lightning network

[29-Sep-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles creates a market for data onchain

[29-Sep-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways assetized other cryptos

[29-Sep-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you think assets has no real world cases, it seems you have a lot to learn

[29-Sep-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
these are just the initial ones, have to start somewhere

[29-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I am asking questions . I`m a trader not programmer

[29-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
And U dont seem keen on giving simple answers

[29-Sep-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant give simple answers

[29-Sep-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
because there are no simple answers to broad sweeping questions

[29-Sep-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a very specific question, then maybe a simple answer is possible

[29-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Here is a simple question - what is the first real use case( the most likely one)  for KMD u are envisioning . Real use case means = actual business or platform that deals with real goods and services adopts it

[29-Sep-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the prices CC will implement a decentralized bitmex. is that real enough, or does it have to have actual real goods ?

[29-Sep-18 07:57 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
that is real enough

[29-Sep-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the first use case is securing chains against 51% attacks

[29-Sep-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
that is already live for almost 2 years

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I dont consider that use case - I consider it condition of existence of the chain

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
for other chains

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
exchanging tokens in atomic swaps could also be counted as real use case

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Not a condition of existence komodo can exist without notary nodes.

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is securing other chains

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not any requirement for existence of KMD

[29-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
oh,yes, forgot about barterDEX

[29-Sep-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
if privacy matters, then JUMBLR is working for a while

[29-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
ok - can u give some realistic ballpark for when exchange will be functional on KMD ... or at least some time frame u see as possible

[29-Sep-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is working for me for a long time, but if you mean something that works for someone that has no technical expertise at all, then I dont know when that level is reached. it seems quite a high requirement to have

[29-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
yes , I do mean when there will be exchange with graphic interface like bittrex on the KMD chain

[29-Sep-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean like hyperDEX that had a beta release recently?

[29-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
link please ?

[29-Sep-18 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the rpc calls already work, but I have a feeling hungry_bullbear wont give any credit to a cli solution

[29-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
u are right - I wont ... and I do it not to disrespect any1`s efforts but because people dont care . They want ready to use service and they dont want to do any work or learn anything ( including me ). So the big questions is : When potential DEX will have all the functionality of Bittrex + the Grapghic interface of Bittrex and all u need to do is register and use it and U dont even have idea it is DEX  ?

[29-Sep-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
never

[29-Sep-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there isnt any need to register

[29-Sep-18 08:05 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
are u hanging on technicality just so u can give me 1 liner - never 😃

[29-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
is this the interface of the HyperDEX

[29-Sep-18 08:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes

[29-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
So why is @jl777c replying with - never ?

[29-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
makes no sense at all

[29-Sep-18 08:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
but don't expect much Volume at this stage

[29-Sep-18 08:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
never register

[29-Sep-18 08:10 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Guys guys ,,.,, U need marketing help ..... with answers like what programmers give u`ll never break through 😃

[29-Sep-18 08:11 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U can have the best product and it will not be the most successful one if u dont market it well

[29-Sep-18 08:11 PM] snowdamn#2414
jl777 is on another level, bro!
he doesn't communicate like us peasants 😂

[29-Sep-18 08:12 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Do u know what that is called ? Elitism 😃

[29-Sep-18 08:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, more like AI

i manage to get under its skin once in a while though lol

[29-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
So how long is HyperDex gona be in beta - is there any projection on that ? @Deleted User

[29-Sep-18 08:15 PM] PTYX#6840
I would expect until marketmaker 2.0 is ready or an improved atomic swap mechanism is created.

[29-Sep-18 08:15 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah it's in beta

[29-Sep-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So how long is HyperDex gona be in beta`
Until it's fully tested and determined "release ready". 🙂
