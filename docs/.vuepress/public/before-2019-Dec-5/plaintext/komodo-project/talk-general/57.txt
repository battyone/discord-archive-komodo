the thing is I saw a conversation somewhere here in discord exactly about this same subject

[05-Sep-18 08:17 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but couldnt find it

[05-Sep-18 08:23 PM] jorian#4555
there will always be 128 blocks initially without ac_reward

[05-Sep-18 08:23 PM] jorian#4555
after that it's on demand

[05-Sep-18 08:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
actually the amount of coins is increasing

[05-Sep-18 08:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
during this first 128 blocks

[05-Sep-18 08:24 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so I dont exactly understand how ac_end=1 is working...

[05-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
can you give me the exact params you used

[05-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
will test it

[05-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
@kimmel (Pungo.io)

[05-Sep-18 08:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
found conversation:

jl777c19/08/2018
the problem is ac_reward was 0
set ac_reward to non-0, otherwise it uses the default 0.0001 reward
and set the -ac_end to be 1

[05-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
ac_reward is denominated in satoshis not coins

[05-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
ac_reward=0.0001 will surely bug out

[05-Sep-18 08:56 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I set ac_end=1 and ac_reward=0.0001

[05-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
do -ac_end=1 -ac_reward=1

[05-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
or no -ac_reward at all if you want on-demand blocks

[05-Sep-18 08:57 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but on-demand blocks will lead to a 0.0001 miner reward by default

[05-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
ac_reward is definitely going to bug out because you're trying to set the block reward to 0.000000000001

[05-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
yes but ac_end will stop those .0001 block rewards

[05-Sep-18 08:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm right will check

[05-Sep-18 08:58 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
thx

[05-Sep-18 09:43 PM] danielkaye#6246
@cipi, will do

[05-Sep-18 09:44 PM] danielkaye#6246
PIVX doesn't? Sure not just a different implementation / equal ?

the 20k tx/s is only on testnet?

[05-Sep-18 09:57 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
what's KMD tx/s on mainnet?

[05-Sep-18 09:59 PM] danielkaye#6246
So there are no PIVX based coins listed on the DEX ? 😕

[05-Sep-18 10:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Scaling channel is where that aspect is being done.  I would advise doing some research on how Komodo plans on scaling.

[05-Sep-18 10:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@danielkaye  Pivx is on the Dex

[05-Sep-18 10:01 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I know about the plans to scale , curious what current tx/s on mainnet is right now

[05-Sep-18 10:01 PM] danielkaye#6246
ah, was wondering about what cipi wrote

[05-Sep-18 10:01 PM] danielkaye#6246
re bip65

[05-Sep-18 10:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah,  I must be mistaken,  cipi knows best,  I could of sworn though pivx was in there though.

[05-Sep-18 10:03 PM] danielkaye#6246
PIVX has nLockTime, if that counts

[05-Sep-18 10:03 PM] danielkaye#6246
Guess I could force into the code worse case

[05-Sep-18 10:04 PM] danielkaye#6246
force it*

[05-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
@zainshoukat590 maybe try @benohanlon ? 😮

[05-Sep-18 10:04 PM] cipi#4502
there are some pivx-based coins, can't remember them, but they all have BIP65 implemented... PIVX it self is also on BarterDEX, but i can't find nothing about BIP65 in the code... maybe i am wrong

@polycryptoblog Thank u

[05-Sep-18 10:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@cipi  we have so many coins it's hard to remember them all

[05-Sep-18 10:06 PM] danielkaye#6246
@cipi is the whole point to secure the spending?

[05-Sep-18 10:07 PM] danielkaye#6246
i.e. would nLockTime be sufficient

[05-Sep-18 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
don't know, feel more comfortable if i see matchings like these in the code
```OP_NOP2 = OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY```
or if `dash-cli getblockchaininfo` shows me
```      "id": "bip65",
      "version": 4,
      "enforce": {
        "status": true,
        "found": 1000,
        "required": 750,
        "window": 1000
      },
      "reject": {
        "status": true,
        "found": 1000,
        "required": 950,
        "window": 1000
      }```

[05-Sep-18 10:18 PM] danielkaye#6246
Well I see PIVX listed, will see if any other PIVX based one are (pretty sure they are)

[05-Sep-18 10:19 PM] Tort#9226
why is my wallet stuck at 99.98% sync?

[05-Sep-18 10:19 PM] danielkaye#6246
Otherwise....long night

[05-Sep-18 10:19 PM] cipi#4502
simply grep your code for CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, then you know if it there or not

I know the BIP, and I've grepped both my fork and PIVX which results in nothing, the nearest thing being nlocktime

[05-Sep-18 10:23 PM] danielkaye#6246
But I mean, if PIVX is listed on the DEX and other PIVX forks too...I wouldn't see an issue unless the requirement is fairly new

[05-Sep-18 10:24 PM] cipi#4502
the requirement was there from the beginning... all coins that i added to BarterDEX have the BIP implemented, i always checked that

[05-Sep-18 10:32 PM] danielkaye#6246
@cipi can't see it in pivx

[05-Sep-18 10:36 PM] cipi#4502
my personal conclusion is that if you don't find CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in the code, then it is not implemented... i don't know why it worked for PIVX without, but i would not implement coins without BIP65... worst case is that you loose the security from the atomic swap protocol, not sure

[05-Sep-18 10:39 PM] danielkaye#6246
I see (And see the no CLTV under pivx)

[05-Sep-18 10:39 PM] danielkaye#6246
So unless bip65 is implemented, it won't be listed on the DEX

[05-Sep-18 10:42 PM] cipi#4502
you could try to convince jl777 to accept your PR to https://github.com/jl777/coins, even without BIP65, but i would not run LP nodes myself for coins without BIP65 😃

[05-Sep-18 10:43 PM] danielkaye#6246
Which is harder, convincing or implementing BIP65 :p

[05-Sep-18 10:43 PM] cipi#4502
lol

[05-Sep-18 10:43 PM] danielkaye#6246
we'll guess I'll see how the latter goes

[05-Sep-18 10:44 PM] cipi#4502
i fear implementing is harder

[05-Sep-18 10:44 PM] danielkaye#6246
well*

[05-Sep-18 10:45 PM] danielkaye#6246
We could move it all to a dash code base, the most important parts are mn and mnbudget

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] cipi#4502
sound easier, although i don't know the code internals of dash or pivx

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] danielkaye#6246
but then we lose other stuff :/

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] danielkaye#6246
fair enough

[05-Sep-18 10:49 PM] cipi#4502
someone else had the same problem, but i don't know how he solved it... he just came back after a while with a new wallet and i took what i got without asking how he did it... but i remember it was a similar problem dash->pivx->coin, no CLTV

[05-Sep-18 10:52 PM] danielkaye#6246
Sounds good, thanks for all the advice! and how does the test tx work if the coin is not listed ?

[05-Sep-18 10:54 PM] cipi#4502
i have setup an LP node on a server with all the coins that i test and use a BarterDEX client on my home PC to test the swaps... if you don't want to setup an LP node just for testing, you can send me some of the coins and i do the test swap

[05-Sep-18 10:55 PM] cipi#4502
i simply add the coins to test in my `~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts/coins` file manually

[05-Sep-18 10:59 PM] danielkaye#6246
Great, I'll get working on the bip since decentralization is a main factor

[05-Sep-18 11:11 PM] danielkaye#6246
surprisingly, looks easy enough as one commit

[05-Sep-18 11:11 PM] danielkaye#6246
Thanks for all the help!

[06-Sep-18 02:19 AM] danielkaye#6246
well that was fun /s

[06-Sep-18 02:20 AM] danielkaye#6246
would love to do the test exchange @cipi - just let m know what you need 😃 thanks again!

[06-Sep-18 02:20 AM] danielkaye#6246
Is the volume normally this low btw? (anyone)

[06-Sep-18 02:32 AM] PTYX#6840
It's been difficult getting trades to go through. The volume has been low recently since there hasn't been heavy testing

[06-Sep-18 03:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Stupid shapeshift will ask for membership

[06-Sep-18 03:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I stopped using CEX for barterdex and shapeshift

[06-Sep-18 03:12 AM] cipi#4502
I use https://changelly.com, it is cheaper then shapeshift
@danielkaye please tell me the link to the wallet source, i need to setup the chain on 2 nodes first

[06-Sep-18 05:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but changelly asks for email too

[06-Sep-18 05:37 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
business is business, most people trading btc do not even know if crypto must be decentralized or whatever, so they will not be offended by "know your chicken" policy

[06-Sep-18 05:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅 yeh

[06-Sep-18 05:38 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also it's possible there are some legislative changes or a regulations that gov could interpret and close shapshift, idk

[06-Sep-18 05:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I still believe there is room for proxy token exchanges as faster version for dex, which might be a decentrlaized shapeshift maybe

[06-Sep-18 05:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no bothering with utxo size and so on

[06-Sep-18 05:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make a tor shapeshift like service using barterdex

[06-Sep-18 05:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
users (me also) praise ease of use daily more then high tech, 99% security is enough, 100% usually not needed

[06-Sep-18 05:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
must be possible today

[06-Sep-18 05:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
question if it is ready to be easy - just set a transaction price and volume, no utxo thinking 😃

[06-Sep-18 05:41 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
plus no conf needed (like in proxty token also)

[06-Sep-18 05:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think @ca333 figured the shapeshift like cex based on barterdex

[06-Sep-18 05:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
user perspective - 2 major advantages of proxty token above atomic - 1. proxy is quicker (100x - 1000x ?) 2. proxy no need for utxo split

[06-Sep-18 05:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
disadvnatage I see as 99.99% vs 100% security

[06-Sep-18 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
assets CC will allow token based exchange, missing ingredient is MGW CC

👍 (4) Komodo (3) yassinkomodo 

[06-Sep-18 05:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
having hyperdex with 3 modes 1. default proxy (attracting 99% newbies) 2. spv mode 3. natives would have all in 1 - potential to attract diff kinds of users

[06-Sep-18 05:46 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes if I understand CC correctly this kind of break through

[06-Sep-18 05:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jl777c  so my guess with CC one can do example a revenue chain like REVS or DEX which automatically pays dividends every 1000 blocks in KMD ?

[06-Sep-18 05:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this would be super advantage comparing to any rev token existing in the market (anyone having that?)
