Hi

[14-Dec-18 08:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hola

[14-Dec-18 08:41 PM] JZ#9706
Does Komodo pay every second for hodling?

[14-Dec-18 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards calculations are based on minutes

[14-Dec-18 08:42 PM] JZ#9706
Ok

[14-Dec-18 08:42 PM] JZ#9706
Is there a time frame to collect these rewards?

[14-Dec-18 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no time limit to claim

[14-Dec-18 08:42 PM] JZ#9706
Or can we collect them when every we want

[14-Dec-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but it stops accruing after a month

[14-Dec-18 08:43 PM] JZ#9706
Why is that?

[14-Dec-18 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
those are the consensus rules

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] JZ#9706

[14-Dec-18 08:50 PM] JZ#9706
Thanks

[14-Dec-18 08:50 PM] JZ#9706
Right now im just experimenting POS cryptos

[14-Dec-18 08:51 PM] JZ#9706
On other wallets would you need to  keep your wallet online to receive POS rewards. ?

[14-Dec-18 08:51 PM] JZ#9706
like on my desktop?

[14-Dec-18 08:51 PM] SHossain#0007
Komodo doesn't require your wallet to be online.

[14-Dec-18 08:52 PM] JZ#9706
Do some other wallets need you ?

[14-Dec-18 08:53 PM] SHossain#0007
As long as you have 10+ balance in your address and locktime is set for the received transacton, your address will accrue reward. Capped to max 1 month. If you claim, the clock starts again.

[14-Dec-18 08:55 PM] ph03nix#3115
i wonder if there is another wallet that supports more coins than agama ü§î

[14-Dec-18 08:56 PM] SHossain#0007
if you count open-source, then NO

[14-Dec-18 08:57 PM] SHossain#0007
there are few closed source ones

[14-Dec-18 08:57 PM] ph03nix#3115
nice

[14-Dec-18 08:58 PM] ph03nix#3115
_doesn't trust closed source wallets_

[14-Dec-18 09:17 PM] werthjuke#3412
do i uninstal the old agama before updating ?

[14-Dec-18 09:17 PM] Hermes#6934
I think some exchanges are still trading...but the thing is that you will need to wait for the update to actually make a withdrawal

[14-Dec-18 09:18 PM] Hermes#6934
If you use installer version it will do this automagically ...MAC OS is a dmg that you replace in your applications folders.

[14-Dec-18 09:18 PM] werthjuke#3412
i see, ty

[14-Dec-18 09:20 PM] werthjuke#3412
while i download the new agama on your link, it says ''existing data is detected'' and ask me to check delete user data or/and delete zcash params

[14-Dec-18 09:20 PM] werthjuke#3412
oh  or reinstall current version

[14-Dec-18 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
don't delete user data or zcash params.

[14-Dec-18 09:22 PM] SHossain#0007
just uninstalled the app and it's modules and install new version

[14-Dec-18 09:22 PM] werthjuke#3412
ok i'll try dat

[14-Dec-18 09:25 PM] crumb#2550
@Vertigo trading KMD is not going to be interrupted by the update. just deposits/withdrawals

[14-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Vertigo#0439
I'm buying on digital price I don't know if the will update their wallet

[14-Dec-18 09:27 PM] crumb#2550
all exchanges will update

[14-Dec-18 09:27 PM] crumb#2550
doesn't make a difference in terms of trading

[14-Dec-18 09:28 PM] Vertigo#0439
They never freezed the  deposit and withdrawal so I was wondering

[14-Dec-18 09:28 PM] crumb#2550
just wait for official confirmation it's safe to deposit/withdraw

[14-Dec-18 09:29 PM] crumb#2550
use your common sense and don't send tokens when update in progress

[14-Dec-18 09:29 PM] crumb#2550
you don't need exchanges to tell you that during protocol updates it's not a good idea to move coins

[14-Dec-18 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
