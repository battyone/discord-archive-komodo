as suspected he repeats the same points about front running with DEXs that don't apply to the way BarterDEX works  So in the end he recommends centralized orderbooks.

[31-Oct-18 07:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
His points could be valid for the proxy-token DEX though

Just say no to blockchain (for now) advises Gartner
​In response no doubt to the huge amount of interest it receives from chief information officers about the technology, Gartner hosted eight sessions on blockchain at it's annual Symposium event on the Gold Coast this week.

There is about 90% of government jobs that would be made redundant by properly applied block chain technology its no wonder they don't like it... You cant just change the entry on a block chain like you can a database

Funny you mention that @blackjok3r , I happen to know of a project aimed at creating a sovereign country, basing everything on blockchain technology. It hasn't been announced yet but is an amazing idea if it can be pulled off.

[01-Nov-18 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Wow that is pretty crazy in scope, not impossible but very ambitious

[01-Nov-18 12:27 AM] Rendezvous#3467
Erm, anyways, holy channels. I was looking around on Barterdex and wondering what tokens need to do to be listed? How does that work anyways?

[01-Nov-18 12:27 AM] Rendezvous#3467
Yeah seriously, I can ping you when there's info to publicly share if you're interseted in following it.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 are there non-verified accounts on Binance?

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Hermes#6934
yes but you can take out no more than 2 btc per day

[01-Nov-18 05:38 AM] Hermes#6934
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Hermes#6934
still you need a 2fa verification

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Hermes#6934
and an email address ...

[01-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Hermes#6934
still they are sure to be on top of things like this

[01-Nov-18 05:40 AM] Hermes#6934
tell me if I can do anything to help... you see it in Binance right?

[01-Nov-18 05:42 AM] Hermes#6934
sorry I tagged you by reflex l ...but yeah Binance is very risky or this reason no verification

[01-Nov-18 05:42 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, so if their Support moves quick, the hacker will get 2 BTC at the most

[01-Nov-18 05:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
they can give rest to Genie

[01-Nov-18 05:43 AM] Hermes#6934
@snowdamn  Haven't tried support with Binance

[01-Nov-18 05:43 AM] Hermes#6934
is it fast?

[01-Nov-18 05:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
he posted a response from them here yesterday which wasn't really helpful, but he did get a response at least

[01-Nov-18 05:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
but now all KMD has been deposited there, so even if they're exchanged no more than 2 BTC can be taken out

[01-Nov-18 05:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
Genie proves his case, gets everything transferred to him
may no longer be KMD, but he can buy it back

[01-Nov-18 06:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wait is binance only 2btc month

[01-Nov-18 06:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thought it was 1btc daily fuck LOL better get verified in advance

[01-Nov-18 06:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
For the day I cash out 😅

[01-Nov-18 06:06 AM] Hermes#6934
I used the verified account but I think is 2 for day  not for month I thought it was per month...but still the security is very low and still they should be able to flag this if it's a new account

[01-Nov-18 06:07 AM] Hermes#6934
the 2fa at the end doesn't do a key part of the job because it can also be used from an anon phone and the email verification not sure if it helps if anybody wants to stay anonymous

[01-Nov-18 06:11 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's 2 BTC / 24 hours from the second of your last withdrawal

What surprises me is that (judging by your reaction) you may have expected more from them, or any exchange for that matter.
Truly, I feel your pain Genie and can only wish for you something good will come from this shitty situation.
This is a wake up call for all of us to remain vigilant and not rest on our laurels ... for if it can happen to one of our smartest, it can happen to anyone of us.
Sending good vibes your way @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

The last person i would have expected this to happen to. That Sucks Genie

[01-Nov-18 09:23 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
sounds like binance are only interested if its their platform that has been hacked and casued you a loss. doesnt sound confident that they are going to freeze sent funds

[01-Nov-18 09:24 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
even though they are technically holding stolen "goods" / "money"

[01-Nov-18 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@house I really wasn't expecting them to do anything and mostly posted so that people know the results. To a certain extent, I'm kind of glad they didn't; expanded to a different scenario, it would be shitty if alice sent funds to bob and Binance locked bob's funds just because alice *said* that bob stole them.

Interesting that they are now looking for kmd.dats and not another bigger coin.

[01-Nov-18 09:53 AM] Alright#0419
looking for *any* file named wallet.dat

i get that alright but a wallet.dat is exactly that until its in the right wallet no?

[01-Nov-18 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i get that alright but a wallet.dat is exactly that until its in the right wallet no?`
basically like:
`if found $file then copy to $folder($file.parent_folder.name)`

The good thing is that it didn't "wipe me out" since the bulk of funds are in cold storage and hopefully some folks that would be rekt by having it happen to them learn to not let it happen to them

not that I believe in "karma", just making a point

[01-Nov-18 10:02 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Shame there is no way to mask a file like a wallet.dat that can be traced or something and then bait them with it

[01-Nov-18 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you could just reverse worm the worm and name it wallet.dat and then commandline what wallet file you use
