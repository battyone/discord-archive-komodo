is it possible do an airdrop?

[25-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course many have told me to just work on one thing and nothing else....

[25-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
I ignore that "advice" as I am a multitasker

[25-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like running just one process on a multicore CPU. what is gained from this inefficiency?

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it might make for a simpler result that is simpler to explain

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, PIRATE has something very unique working for it, but it's not the only one

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but my solution is to enable independence

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is a purely mined coin

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for an airdrop, donations would be needed from the pirates having the PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 09:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
i see

[25-Sep-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
no premine

[25-Sep-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
no founders fee

[25-Sep-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
just mining

Dont go outside for craps sake

raining tears

[25-Sep-18 09:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
Idk I've been around for awhile, judging by the hashrate increase, there may be something to this Pirate deal.

[25-Sep-18 09:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
when an independent dev team/party talks about having a dICO or creating an assetchain it's expected to be promoted by them

[25-Sep-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is almost the same hashrate as KMD was a month ago

[25-Sep-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is not any premine, no dICO

[25-Sep-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
community created

[25-Sep-18 09:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
PIRATE whales should pay up and promote

[25-Sep-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it is not even clear who created the chain

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
I think PIRATE has a very clear and concise message, ultimate privacy secured by bitcoin

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so this should be easy to market compared to the complexity of KMD

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] snowdamn#2414
also, it's disingenuous to see people asking to buy bulk when chances are they're the ones holding most PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
for all the peoples constantly criticizing KMD's marketing, now is the time to step up and show how to properly market something

[25-Sep-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
what is wrong with offering to buy in bulk? regardless of how much you have?

[25-Sep-18 10:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah but market to whom? miners with the command line chops to actually play with it?

[25-Sep-18 10:01 AM] snowdamn#2414
because of the limited supply, James! you're not stupid, i'm sure you understood what i said

[25-Sep-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
all the buy offers I have seen are valid and backed up with actual buys

[25-Sep-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly it needs to be marketed beyond the miners

[25-Sep-18 10:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
joe schmo chainlink guy cant touch it yet

[25-Sep-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
a new agama will be out very soon with PIRATE support

[25-Sep-18 10:03 AM] snowdamn#2414
that's good! official software should support/promote the ecosystem

[25-Sep-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe what we need is some sort of PIRATE onboarding process... people pay some amount and gets some PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
should be a matter to get agama running with PIRATE, generating a zaddr and then receiving the ztx

[25-Sep-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
we could fund the onboarding with PIRATE so the onboarding fee can pay for the cost to do the onboarding

[25-Sep-18 10:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
pay pirate to a z-address created in agama. can you set up kmd deposit box inside the wallet that would payout a proportional amount of PIRATE. like a mini shapeshift or something?

[25-Sep-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a centralized service can be setup

[25-Sep-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
at first a manual process, which can then be automated

[25-Sep-18 10:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
dexstats.info is giving me a 500 error. anyone else?

[25-Sep-18 10:14 AM] snowdamn#2414
need to ask, who's funding? have PIRATE whales pledged? will it be from Komodo Official funds? if from official funds, i say better buy the Ledger app off Pondsea and offer it for free without the fee, keep it in Komodo IOW

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
funding what?

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] snowdamn#2414
last comment should have made more clear where i'm coming from, so that's it from me! üòÉ

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there are pledges from PIRATE whales for general bounties

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, yes, i was talking about the PIRATE that would need to be sent out üëç

[25-Sep-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
plz dont conflate different things, PIRATE is an independent effort

[25-Sep-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, PIRATE whales fund the PIRATE to be sold for the onboarding, the one supporting the onboarding get to keep the KMD. 15 KMD for 777 PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
understood

[25-Sep-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are non-technical, here is the chance to contribute. there is no need for much technical skills for marketing PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
or onboarding

[25-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so the marketing creates a demand for onboarding, the onboarders get paid per person

[25-Sep-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE "usage" spreads

[25-Sep-18 10:20 AM] snowdamn#2414
more wallet downloads (whether it's for PIRATE promotion  or not) is NEVER bad! üòÖ

[25-Sep-18 10:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
fuuck, there was an airdrop announced on bct and I missed it

[25-Sep-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
missed out on 8000 PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
well I guess bct is back in the research rotation.

[25-Sep-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
we also announced it in #pirate

[25-Sep-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
current price for PIRATE is 0.02/0.05 KMD for the bid/ask

[25-Sep-18 10:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
well it seemed like a funny little project until I got a look at the difficulty chart

[25-Sep-18 10:27 AM] snowdamn#2414
isn't doing z -> z like holding PIRATE on the second z, especially if you were only to send to another z? ü§î

[25-Sep-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
dont understand the question

[25-Sep-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
all PIRATE tx are sending to zaddr

[25-Sep-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we ignore the notarizations

[25-Sep-18 10:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
if i send KMD t-.z, then z-z, and only send to z again, isn't it the same no t that PIRATE offers?

[25-Sep-18 10:29 AM] SHossain#0007
you don't have funds in t address for PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
except PIRATE has 7 million coins in z

[25-Sep-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and all PIRATE tx just increase the anon set

[25-Sep-18 10:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok

[25-Sep-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the difference is that there is no pool of transparent tx in PIRATE for any cross correlations

[25-Sep-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
we assume you are not sending to notary addresses

[25-Sep-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
granted doing a t->z and z->z and keeping it in zaddr for a while is quite effective

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] snowdamn#2414
is the pool of transparent txs relevant after z->z? really curious, not busting your balls üòÄ

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as you are changing the total amounts when coming back out to taddr

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not relevant in zaddr, but the issue is the z->t

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
now you can apply timing analysis and knapsack attacks

[25-Sep-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE avoids this by not allowing z->t

[25-Sep-18 10:33 AM] snowdamn#2414
definitely got it, thanks! üëç

[25-Sep-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is simply the best privacy possible and with the current level of activity already order of magnitude more private than XMR, and only gaining quickly. like its hashrate

[25-Sep-18 10:40 AM] snowdamn#2414
can i hit you with one more hypothetical?

[25-Sep-18 10:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
assuming PIRATE gets listed on centralized exchanges they could also list z-KMD, right or wrong?

[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] snowdamn#2414
if they wanted to, that is

[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once they implement zdeposit/zwithdraw, then all the zcash coins can be supported that way

[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i doubt the chicken overlords would allow them to do it though

[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, it was kinda obvious, but making sure i wasn't missing anything, thanks again! üëç

[25-Sep-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
The sole PIRATE pool operator is now making some good money, estimated at over $10,000 per month rate

[25-Sep-18 10:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
if they're smart, they will not convert

[25-Sep-18 10:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
at least not yet

[25-Sep-18 10:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
although i'm pretty sure my loyalty to KMD will not be questioned after today lol üòÇ

Bitcoin and R3 is an oxymoron

There was some discussion on the Reddit infographic page about using 'interim' colors instead of the 'legacy' colors. What does this refer to, more precisely?
