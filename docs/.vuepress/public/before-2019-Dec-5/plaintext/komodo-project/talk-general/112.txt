I somehow used 340Gb syncing the agama wallet..

[22-Oct-18 08:53 AM] crumb#2550
interesting... how did that happen???

[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have no idea. The same day I was syncing agama, my usage was 340gb. I was away from home the entire day, so I have no idea what else it would have been

[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
ahaha

[22-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe also uploading to other peers?

[22-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or only download?

[22-Oct-18 08:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
only download. My komodo file is just under 8gb. I don't know what else would have been causing it

[22-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Check for big files in your storage?

My friend called me: i generated KomodoPaperWallet and sent KMD this address. Now downloaded Agama wallet trying to restore private key, but give different address. I think he lost it, am I correct?

[22-Oct-18 03:56 PM] Vertigo#0439
Sup guys is the website rebranding only the website or the name and everything?

[22-Oct-18 03:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it seems only the website and presentation, etc.

[22-Oct-18 03:57 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
name change is unlikely

[22-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Vertigo#0439

Does anyone know the approximate time it takes for a KMD transaction to show up in your wallet?

[22-Oct-18 11:18 PM] kremer#4440
wallet -> wallet is quick, a few minutes

[22-Oct-18 11:18 PM] kremer#4440
exchange -> your wallet is longer

is WIF key the same as my seed?

[23-Oct-18 04:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[23-Oct-18 04:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Either can be used to log into agama though

[23-Oct-18 04:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And if you need to import  the import function has options for both

[23-Oct-18 04:19 AM] DingDongSoLong#0148
How does one go about finding what their WIF key is?

Wouldn't using CC be cheaper?

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
utxo makes smart contracts more secure, efficient and cheaper.

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
much safer.

[23-Oct-18 03:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
solidity in any form in the end goes to a balanced based contract

noob question here: what's the difference between BarterDex and HyperDex?

[23-Oct-18 06:50 PM] wookie#7663
I downloaded BarterDex but all I can see is KMD, Etomic and BTC

[23-Oct-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wookie about the difference between a Ford and a Chevy

[23-Oct-18 06:52 PM] wookie#7663
🤣

[23-Oct-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
b uses native and/or electrum and has a different look/feel and coin selection than h (which uses electrum only)

[23-Oct-18 06:53 PM] wookie#7663
I've been reading that one of the dex's Barter or Hyper(?) has trading of kmd assets?

[23-Oct-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both have assetchains

[23-Oct-18 06:54 PM] wookie#7663
I'm running BDex, and all I can see is etomic, btc and kmd.

[23-Oct-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
bdex gui has to have coins enabled under "manage coins"
