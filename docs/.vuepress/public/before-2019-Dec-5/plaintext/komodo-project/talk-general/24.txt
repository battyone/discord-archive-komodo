Hello @PTYX  I have sent you a DM pls respond , I have no other way of contacting you...

[08-Jul-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I created #axo, which is a mexican fiat gateway/exchange that has been in development for a while

is KMD the sole coin that JUMBLR can mix?

[08-Jul-18 02:06 PM] ch6ris#5240
@Shinsoo did you leave the one star review? Just curious? üòÇ

[08-Jul-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@Dr.Terminus yes

[08-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Cool. And do other coin projects who want to utilize KMD DPOS to strengthen their blockchain have to regularly buy / spend KMD on a regular basis to achieve this ?

[08-Jul-18 02:31 PM] PTYX#6840
yes we have a few in the pipeline who have been attracted to Komodo for that particular reason

[08-Jul-18 02:31 PM] PTYX#6840
GameCredits is one of those projects.

[08-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
right, super cool

[08-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what I'm curious about is if Gamecredits has to buy and spend some KMD to continue to retain this DPOS service

[08-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
DPOW, not DPOS. please excuse me! üòÉ

[08-Jul-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes, it costs around 300 KMD annually

[08-Jul-18 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
for 1 year of notarizations with a 10 minute intervals

[08-Jul-18 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
If i'm not mistaken*

[08-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Shinsoo#0021
@ch6ris no not yet

How is your portfolio looking today üìà or üìâ ?

[08-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@PTYX do you happen to know is the 300 annual kmd require to have your chain enforced by DPOW 'burned' when spent.. If not burned like transaction fee / gas where does this KMD go ?

[08-Jul-18 05:09 PM] PTYX#6840
Not burnt, it goes to the miners

[08-Jul-18 05:10 PM] PTYX#6840
A notarization is a transaction

[08-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I see, so it is paid to the KMD network

[08-Jul-18 05:10 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes

[08-Jul-18 05:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
KMD being capable of mixing via proprietary Jumblr and made quite anonymous / untraceable attributes much value to KMD coins

[08-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
KMD coins being continually required to purchase DPOW security service also attributes real world use-case value to KMD coins

[08-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
But is the Barterdex decentralized exchange solution made by the same team as KMD primarily to further the cryptocurrency space as a whole?

[08-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I haven't figured out how KMD coins could gain addition intrinsic value by Bartderdex become highly utilized by tons of traders. No KMD is required for fee to swap on Barterdex is there?

[08-Jul-18 05:19 PM] PTYX#6840
Barterdex was never meant to force Komodo fees

[08-Jul-18 05:19 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the opposite of a DEX

[08-Jul-18 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840
However, Barterdex is part of the Komodo ecosystem and by proxy adds value to the project. All fees are distributed to DEX asset holders. Supernet holds some of those assets and it ensure a stream of revenue for development

[08-Jul-18 05:21 PM] PTYX#6840
The SuperNET fund is managed by jl777

[08-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Cool, sounds legit. Excited for Hyperdex, looks awesome. Tired of exchanges.. The irony

[08-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Decentralized ICO's of course, so cool. Surprised more attention isn't on this yet... High AF max network transaction speeds as I gather, staking KMD also adds allure to the coin.. Such a list!! Is there any other value driver I'm not recognizing?

[08-Jul-18 05:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Jumblr

[08-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yep, listed that on, can it do more than mix ? (which is awesome) !

[08-Jul-18 05:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Oh, cryptoconditions

[08-Jul-18 05:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Enforceable contracts on Komodo paid in KMD

[08-Jul-18 05:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
OOoooh

[08-Jul-18 05:31 PM] PTYX#6840
We have already successfully fulfilled a contract between two separate Komodo chains

[08-Jul-18 05:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
well that sounds practical and great

[08-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
seems like the killer coin really. It has it all

[08-Jul-18 05:37 PM] PTYX#6840
It has many aspects which make it formidable. We now need a state of the art wallet, smart contract creation and management, and a dashboard for Liquidity Provider nodes

[08-Jul-18 05:39 PM] PTYX#6840
A liquidty provider dashboard would have the greatest impact on Barterdex though

[08-Jul-18 05:40 PM] PTYX#6840
So anyone can launch a BOB and manage their marketmaker easily. It would encourage many individuals and companies to provide Liquidity to profit from the spread.

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] yorklab#7270
Over time I‚Äôm realizing how many people want to use Decentralized Exchanges. When regualtions hit that may be the only place many alts can trade.

[08-Jul-18 06:04 PM] yorklab#7270
Everyone seems to think that they need to make BarterDEX/HyperDEX look like a centralized exchange so it will feel familiar, but I disagree. It can be different, people will adapt quickly, especially when they see some of the advantages. I think the issue is that it has to work every time. I keep hearing that the secret sauce to this will be marketmaker 2.0. If so, then when that‚Äôs ready I think the flood gates will open and people will flock to BarterDEX/HyperDEX.

[08-Jul-18 06:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
The thing I've yet have anyone explain is the advantages of mm2.0

[08-Jul-18 06:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Mm is coded in basic C. Mm2.0 will be a recode in rust. What are the advantages of going from basic C to rust?

[08-Jul-18 07:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@PTYX I thought the Komodo notarization fee went to holders of the CRYPTO asset chain.

[08-Jul-18 07:35 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not 100% on that. I am sure that miners need fees to proces the transaction so that would make more sense to me.

[08-Jul-18 07:35 PM] PTYX#6840
Jl777 is the man/woman  to answer

[08-Jul-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
txfees need to be paid, there is also excess, which goes to CRYPTO

[08-Jul-18 07:39 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea the Lionsshare is basically dividended out

[08-Jul-18 07:44 PM] jorian#4555
I've been doing a good amount of Rust learning and it's a tough journey for someone who only did University level Java. But it's a nice language and the article you mentioned points out the good things. What it's missing is Rusts concurrency, which is missing now in mm1.0. I even think it's the main reason a marketmaker2.0 was announced

[08-Jul-18 07:45 PM] jorian#4555
I'm curious how far along Artem is

[08-Jul-18 07:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Thank you for that response @jorian

[08-Jul-18 07:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So with mm on rust. Should be akin from going from single processor power to multi threaded barterdex

[08-Jul-18 07:48 PM] jorian#4555
Yes. Or at least, that's what I hope.

though in the beginning I had to use paper and pencil to draw out how things connected to each other, but over the years I found it much faster just to write the code directly

[09-Jul-18 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i mostly now just copy and paste working methods from the past and just morph it a bit

[09-Jul-18 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
well, when I say copy, I mean recall how I solved a similar problem, and write the customized code for the current problem at hand. no need to waste time looking through millions of lines of old code

[09-Jul-18 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the hard part is to simplify a bigger problem into two or more simpler problems. keep doing that until one of the problems is similar to something you solved before. morph a solution for that and the entire problem is now one simple sub-problem simpler. keep doing that until there are no problems left.

[09-Jul-18 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
seems to work effectively in most all cases

[09-Jul-18 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but sometimes, i need to take a step back and just refactor the entire thing, if it evolved into too messy of a thing to be easy to maintain

[09-Jul-18 08:40 AM] okthen#8167
Good morning I have a question about the following address: RJt3kSRU3XxikWoixmyoA8CFT8kMaSs72M
 WHen I installed the agama-wallet a few months back I sent >550KMD to this address, thinking it was mine, because in the wallet it said "your KMD address". It appeared that somehow this address was fraudulently used to receive payments. I contacted @Nabob  and @PTYX  about it back then. @PTYX  assured me, after some messages back and forth, that "everyone who had sent coins to that address would eventually get their KMD back", but it would have to wait until after the dICO.  Fast-forward a few months to today, I've tried to contact @Nabob  and @PTYX  again to see if they could give me an update about the status of this issue, but they simply ignore my request. Am I the only one having this problem and/or can anyone point me to a solution, and/or am I missing something?
BTW: I just checked the TXid again and it seems that the transaction cannot be found on the chain anymore...Also, the address I sent it to seems to have not received any coins since the 1st of March, which was BEFORE my tx to it...I'd really like to understand what is going on here, can someone undo transactions on the chain? Since I'm really not a technical guy I really need help with this...

[09-Jul-18 08:42 AM] okthen#8167
the TXid is e070f7612e1965220907d5accc4b036f27e782a0eac3db07d385912ad40f3aeb btw, date march 9

[09-Jul-18 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
plz contact @SHossain

[09-Jul-18 08:49 AM] okthen#8167
thanks @jl777c  I just sent him some details of the issue, I hope he can help. In the meantime, can you tell me if the blocnation dICO is finished/completed?

I know there is little volume on the dex but why not have a kmd holding incentive like how bnb or kucoin have

[09-Jul-18 10:28 AM] jorian#4555
a dex isn't a dex when it needs to depend on something
