fabricating things about BTCD, which we still have all the coins exchanged for KMD, so how can that make an exit pump. over a year later it was still on exchanges that didnt listen to us to delist and it got zombie pumped, totally out of our control. In any case I didnt even start BTCD but had joined after the coin was launched

[27-Apr-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a blatantly biased article by a paid shill. dPoW is battle tested and proven. Also, when a coin will be updating their source code, it is a good thing that the two dev teams are coordinating to make sure things go smoothly. if that is called centralization, it seems it is unavoidable. We do have to charge a nominal fee to cover expenses, but we dont require anybody to pay for the BTC txfees, nor for a coin to change their emission schedule to payout a percentage, nor do we spam the BTC chain 500x with the same data with something that likely cant differentiate from the attacker chain vs. the real chain. and of course no coin actually uses this now, so all the BTC spam is just $1.5 mil per month being wasted

[27-Apr-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not clear if even VBK is using the data on the BTC chain at this point. As it is closed source there is no way to know. We do know that aggregating data from random nodes on the internet wont create any trustless data. that just doesnt work as the attacker can just buy the winning chain, if chains actually used the PoP data, it would help the attacker double spend. so they have many problems left to solve. 

dPoW has already solved all this, it is effective, cost efficient, open source. It just makes me sad that people can post blatant lies about our tech

[27-Apr-19 10:03 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469

1. already half a dozen external projects have dPoW and over 500 coins integrated into barterDEX. it seems this is well underway
2. agreed and we have projects in the works to solve this
3. the pegs CC will utilize KMD as backing to create stablecoins, but in general I prefer to just expand the ecosystem and KMD benefits indirectly. Artificially constraining supply, is pretty artificial and charging fees in KMD just because we can will slow down adoption.
4. the design of CC is such that each one creates its own set of rpc calls, so just by calling various rpc calls (in any language) you can create a dapp, this is much easier than even writing interpreted smart contracts
5. LN could work with blockchain protocol that doesnt have txid malleability, but they made it also require segwit. KMD will never have segwit. That being said channels CC solves the latency issue for payments and creates a hubless (no centralization) payment channels
6. as you say we are working with projects to integrate in all directions, gaming included
7. last time i checked, we have no way to force the community to do anything, but of course any community help is appreciated

thanks for your article, it seems most is covered but always we can use more help in the areas that we are not full covered in

the reality of the komodo platform is invariably much more than peoples perception, even if you are up to date on all the official posts. the reason is that things are being developed very fast and there is no way to keep up, especially when there is the cutting edge tech that not many understand.

Maybe my problem is that I can't imagine that RPC calls may be flexible enough for the implementation of complex business logic which we have in projects of my company. We use blockchains and have to implement some kind of smart contracts service based on multisig to handle our business logic in a decentralized manner when used blockchain itself has RPC API. 
So it is really mind-blowing design of RPC if it will handle all possible cases. Other possible interpretation is that API is designed to make possible integration of decentralized services which will emulate some kind of smart contracts. Then it is possible to design service templates to handle flexible business logic using RPC by the community developers.

I will try to set up a Watchtower for Chips + Lightning. Unsure that I will succeed

[28-Apr-19 12:21 PM] phm87#7395
I found an implementation of watchtower of LND but chips'lightning fork is using c lightning. I did not find implementation of watchtower of Blockstream'c-lightning. In theory, watchtower of LND should work

[28-Apr-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would highly doubt it works

[28-Apr-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
Chips was written a while ago, and LN devs have changed everything 7 times since then

[28-Apr-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
Highly doubt that chips is compatible with the current LN ecosystem, but it could be made to be with some work

[28-Apr-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS works with current LN

[28-Apr-19 02:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's hard to keep track of LN changes across the 3(?) implementations now

[28-Apr-19 02:40 PM] phm87#7395
I don t follow details of c lightning only major developments. More in depth with lnd and eclair.
A dev copy paste important stuff about lnd and eclair in slack of CryptoFr. 2 or 3 french lnd devs are also present. But it was difficult to follow at the beginning

[28-Apr-19 02:42 PM] phm87#7395
But in this case, watchtower of lnd should work with c lightning LN because they should respect the same spec

[28-Apr-19 02:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but you dont use it with btc but with chips as currency?

[28-Apr-19 02:47 PM] phm87#7395
I don t read all the code except some parts + for some details that I need

[28-Apr-19 02:48 PM] phm87#7395
I used it with btc testnet last year. Never on mainet. I will try to use my old code with CHIPS and its LN and play a bit with it

[28-Apr-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS uses a modified LN that uses CHIPS instead of BTC and only in a hub and spoke network to avoid all the routing issues

[28-Apr-19 02:49 PM] phm87#7395
Is there only one hub or several in network ?

[28-Apr-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the network might spontaneously connect out, but the dealer is the hub and the players are the spokes for each table

[28-Apr-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
which are managed independently

[28-Apr-19 02:54 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you. Cross-tables makes no sense now

[28-Apr-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in LN the sender/receiver needed to specify the path. I didnt see how to do that in any reasonable way

[28-Apr-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but I only needed a hub and spoke

[28-Apr-19 03:08 PM] phm87#7395
I understand, so we'll have less LN possible problems and questions about network, scaling, channels, hops and inbound/outbound balances of each channel.
The path (route) finding was optimized in each LN implementation. Now, you can still specify the path but in 99% of cases, you don't specify any it will find the best path (route) with the less routing fees. I used only testnet and with 2 or 3 channels, I had no problems during months but I heard that some ppl had unbalanced channels after few payments and were not happy (mainly with beta mobile wallets without some features)

[28-Apr-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
in small networks wont have much problems

[28-Apr-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
when you get to half a dozen or more required hops...

[28-Apr-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an always changing problem, seems impossible to make anything optimal, traveling salesmans type of problem with always changing values.

[28-Apr-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is possible to get things working most of the time, but there is that trust point for the very small amounts which seems a pretty big problem

[28-Apr-19 03:14 PM] phm87#7395
With a direct path (route), on BTC testnet, I was able to send 1 satoshi (pay an invoice of 1 sat) with few millisatoshis of fee. (I knew the guy on the other side and we configured it to accept that ... we heard we can also exchange with 0 fees) I'd like to test and measure it with a satoshi of CHIPS

[28-Apr-19 03:15 PM] phm87#7395
But the watchtower can still be good to protect everyone (if somebody is disconnected from Internet and the other party try to close the channel with a previous state of the channel to steal coins)

[28-Apr-19 03:17 PM] phm87#7395
I won't lie : whatever watchtower was developed, it seems that nobody is using it on mainet or testnet. They prefer to take risk and assume it (or maybe they have a secret watchtower that they told nobody, impossible to know)

[28-Apr-19 03:17 PM] phm87#7395

I'll look at this article but as bitcoin.com is owned by BCH guys (Roger Ver), I'm not sure they understood everything about what they do not develop. I prefer to read comments of LN devs who puke on LN, it is way more fun
Similarly, the best guys to know dpow problems are on this discord (and maybe few hackers, who knows)

[28-Apr-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
just because ver is not a dev that understands tech, does that mean peter rizun cant understand the tech?

[28-Apr-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ive worked with the bch devs when they were bitcoin unlimited and they seemed normal and competent

[28-Apr-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if rizun says there is a trust point and posts the details, i would be very very surprised if it isnt true, regardless that roger ver is involved in the non-tech side of things. what does that have to do with a security analysis?

[28-Apr-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
was there any rebuttal to this trust point by the LN devs?

[28-Apr-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont care about the various personalities involved and dismissing something due to a coin having some personality involved and not the tech itself, is quite dangerous

[28-Apr-19 03:29 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that LN puts back concept of third party (watchtower as I wrote) and risk of misbehaving of the other party.
I'm reading the article, I didn't know its content. I was just surprised of bitcoin.com

[28-Apr-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810

Sorry, I don't want to politicize the tech. But I still think that I will still more learn about KMD by reading what KMD community wrote about KMD instead of reading articles from VeriBlock or SAFE (in general I mean). But I agree that a VeriBlock dev can find a bug in Komodo (if tech side is valid). Same apply for LN and their implementations (and "spec")

[28-Apr-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
here is what appears to be a very valid problem with LN, regardless of the source. no idea why you keep politicizing it

[28-Apr-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont believe peter rizun because you are convinced everything he writes has an agenda, then maybe you listen to me that the article sounded technically valid

[28-Apr-19 03:38 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that it is a valid problem (still reading though), I don't try to politize. I am confinced of nothing and when I saw rizun name I understood that it is serious. I don't think that he have an agenda (edit : I don't know in fact)

[28-Apr-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so in this entire exchange, there was no point to even mention roger ver, was there? that instantly politicizes things

[28-Apr-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
lets stick with tech issues

[28-Apr-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
is there an LN response (technical) to this?
