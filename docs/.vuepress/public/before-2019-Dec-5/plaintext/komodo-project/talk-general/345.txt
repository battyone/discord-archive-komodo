I received the txs on all 3 compromised addresses. In one I received 0.00025008 and when trying to send 0.0001 Verus tell me inside a red box: Balance is equal to or less than transaction fee of 10000, and no extra funds are available for fee.

you can just check that the destination address got 3 tx

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
About 99% sure

[07-Jun-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
notice we are using the blockchain itself to register official claims, that is what special tx 2) is

[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and the second output in the special tx 1) is a one time use, to prevent double refunds

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and the special tx has the refund amount encoded in it, just subtract 0.0002 and whatever satoshis are left is the refund amount in KMD

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang maybe such details can be mentioned in the article

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Azzie001#9397
ok, thx

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c what about dp when refund

[07-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
stolen funds have to wait until after june 15th

[07-Jun-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
all 1100 have been sent

[07-Jun-19 01:42 PM] Keppie#5156

[07-Jun-19 01:44 PM] tafen#3000
I received a test transaction at the old address. And sent 0.00011 KMD to a new one. I saw the flow of funds at the new address. Did I do everything right?

[07-Jun-19 01:45 PM] miles#6381
@tafen - yes

[07-Jun-19 01:45 PM] miles#6381
now just wait

[07-Jun-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810

or basically any other hack recovery

[07-Jun-19 01:46 PM] miles#6381
i think you have done that already!!

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
still the actual refund 3) must be done, i have a very messy spreadsheet to reconcile. it seems a lot of people thought making many claims over and over will somehow help. it makes it worse. my first step is to extract the clean claims of a single compromised address to a single claim address

[07-Jun-19 01:49 PM] joe201#9786
I was able to restore my seed to the original address. Hooray. But now the wallet screen is just white and I only see the original address for a second before the entire screen goes white. So I can't operate within the wallet. Anybody else seen this issue? I'm running Agama v0.3.0.4-beta

[07-Jun-19 01:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@jl777c your contribution to the community with your development work, along with your public relations and openness to discuss all things Komodo with everyone and anyone has been of huge benefit to the community and project. You're an extremely open and honest person to talk to. You take no shit and say it how it is, whilst taking into account other peoples point of view. I dont know any other project that has any developers that do that. You should take pride in that and people should appreciate that. 
Specifically, I'd like to thank you for all the work you do. 
I'd also like to remind everyone about tbe experience they're having with you, and how valuable that is. What other discord would you be having 1 on 1 conversations with such a talented developer of such a professional organisation.

I have a noobie question here. What if im not aware of all this and i discover this 'hack' in a month or 2. Will it still be handled through the claimform? Our hacker has access to the old wallets and can make the transaction from there to a new address that he gave up in the form.

[07-Jun-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i am delaying the processing of the large addresses

[07-Jun-19 01:52 PM] lion#5837

[07-Jun-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that way, if the hacker did make a false claim, when the real owner makes a claim, it triggers the dispute resolution and the added scrutiny

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i know people are in a rush, but for this very reason, we need to take it slower for the larger amounts

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Keppie#5156
and disputess follow a yet to be determined verification path?

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
considering the press this has gotten, you need to be not following crypto at all to not notice and this hit only the active agama users

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
each dispute will be resolved on a case by case basis, based on the specifics of each case

[07-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Have you sent small TX to all KMD adress  below 7777? Because I did not receive any

[07-Jun-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if drones are needed, they will be dispatched

[07-Jun-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
DM me your address, all special tx 1) have been sent to all address sizes

[07-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Keppie#5156
Aye Sir. Slow & secure. Just the way I like it

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I need to go home first, end work in like 30 min

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I made two sends to my claim address with my special small amount.. (why am I like this?) will that be a problem?

[07-Jun-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
did you receive two different special tx 1)?

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] miles#6381
@joe201 that's a fairly old Agama version by the looks - i have been using the Verus Agama as per the advice in the official KMD channel and works for me

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
no. only one address

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, then one of your claims is invalid

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Did you send it to the old address or new?

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
to the old address

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ahh okay

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it is to prove that you control the privkey of the old address

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I was looking at the new

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to send to the new address, to prove you filled out the form

[07-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Alright

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
But I removed agama, what version should I install or does it not matter?

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I sent to the new address twice, because I hit the "subtract fee from amount" switch and then I got worried that I didn't send enough or something, then I realized that this was a mistake.

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Or can I just use some online wallet?

[07-Jun-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
anything is fine

[07-Jun-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
just send 0.0001

as long as one of them is valid, it will be picked up. that s why i made the second output

[07-Jun-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain is designed to prevent double spends, which is exactly what is needed to prevent double refunds

[07-Jun-19 01:58 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I will DM you @jl777c when I get home and we can fix it

[07-Jun-19 01:59 PM] lion#5837
@jl777c  if I have already sent a transaction to the claim address and it is successfully credited - will I still need to return to the compromised address for the FINAL completion of the return? Or will everything be done automatically in the future?

[07-Jun-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
60 hours after the hack, all affected users are now able to finalize their claim on the blockchain

once special tx 2) is done to the claim address, if there is not dispute, you wont need the old address anymore

however until you get 3) refund tx, hold on to the old passphrase

ok, now i really need to concentrate on coding the claims analyzer to find the dispute free properly done ones

[07-Jun-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
separately i also need to make a refund tx generator that follows the rules of the special tx

[07-Jun-19 02:02 PM] joe201#9786
I have my special tx of 0.0002 in the old wallet. So I just send that to my new address to prove I own the old address, correct? Do I need to enter that transaction ID in the form?

[07-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is needed

[07-Jun-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810

@joe201 - yep - just send from old to the address on your claim form and sit back and wait
