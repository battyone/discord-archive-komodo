Hi there I need to ask if its possible to perform atomic swap with Cardano on BarterDex?

[01-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Nabob#5004
@cipi  can explain you better, atm , It Is not supported on our BarterDEX platform

[01-Sep-18 01:30 PM] cipi#4502
It is pretty simple: BarterDEX needs a wallet with an RPC-interface that supports some basic RPC calls like gettxout, importaddress, sendrawtransaction and so on... i couldn't find such a wallet for Cardano

I believe that the reason is, that ADA isn‘t in BIP32 format.

[01-Sep-18 03:52 PM] Seko#7408
Same reason as Iota, correctly?

[01-Sep-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
not really

[01-Sep-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin protocol uses secp256k1 and a 2of2 multisig is needed to be supported

[01-Sep-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
many of the newer coins use totally different signing, hashing and encoded

[01-Sep-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
encoding

[01-Sep-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
each difference needs to be adapted to in order for it to work and in some cases it isnt possible

[01-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Moeed#8715
so you think its not possible to integrate Cardano with any other chain?

[01-Sep-18 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible, anything is. just how practical and when it will be is the issue

[01-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Moeed#8715
for atomic swaps*

[01-Sep-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly lack of any external bounty for doing it, we are not likely to just say one day, "hey, lets start a big project to add atomic swaps to cardano and slow down the other projects we are working on"

[01-Sep-18 05:29 PM] Moeed#8715
😄 okay

[01-Sep-18 05:30 PM] Moeed#8715
can you please give me a direction on what to look if I want to build atomic swap for cardano

[01-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is so much ground to cover... I would start with google

[01-Sep-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a big giant project that would require intimate familiarity with cardano source code, bitcoin protocol and crypto in general

[01-Sep-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be the cardano core devs would not find it easy to do

[01-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Seko#7408
Cardano is at the beginning, but eventually ADA could be important. Currently Cardano has a lot of work to do until it starts...

[01-Sep-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so unless you are a pretty experienced blockchain dev, I would advise against thinking you can do it this decade

[02-Sep-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not if a coin is a fork of a fork that makes it good or bad, it's what is done with it after that matters 😉

[02-Sep-18 10:56 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - I love people who say that a coin will have a huge market cap when FIAT collapses.
I thought the whole point was - if FIAT collapses we will need an alternative method of bartering for product and services - FIAT value would be irrelevant.
you need a new method of pricing - a website that values the currency against a tangible asset.
We need a goldmarketcap (in ounces) or breadmarketcap (in loaves) because that is real value and decoupled from FIAT.

[02-Sep-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree. I also thought of such scenarios. I'm nowhere near economic knowledgeable enough to comment on this, but I guess it would be not higher in fiat value but lesser in fiat value to buy/sell crypto.

[02-Sep-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
please correct me if my understanding is not correct.

[02-Sep-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if fiat collapse, kinda every thing collapse

[02-Sep-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
including cryptocurrencies

[02-Sep-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
that is not what happens in hyperinflation, ie. venezuela

USA burning dollars since 2017

[02-Sep-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
um... USA burning dollars for a lot longer time

[02-Sep-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
at least the value of what a dollar is

[02-Sep-18 11:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unfortunately cryptocurrency is being weighted in fiat, and if ppl will have trouble earning and buying stuff with fiat they have, how will they buy cryptocurrency?

[02-Sep-18 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Before 2017 they just printed hehe) But they had plan to burn some trillions of dollars from 2017 to 2020, each burned dollar decrease investments to development economics on ~10 cents. Less dollars - other economics in trouble

@jl777c you mean to say in case of fiat collapse the price of cryptocurrency will skyrocket and not go down ?

[02-Sep-18 11:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess in such times ppl will realise converting to fiat won't be any good idea 😄

[02-Sep-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at the BTC/bolivar price

[02-Sep-18 11:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and just direct trade things via cryptocurrencies

[02-Sep-18 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c this time they just physically burning it, so less dollars on market, so other currencies which trade to dollar loss in value. So usual people in trouble just because of US government descicions

Is there a possibility that a team Member can make a tutorial video for youtube about the whole jumbl process (testmexing) ?

[02-Sep-18 11:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1 BTC = 71731.50 VEF 🤔

[02-Sep-18 11:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if FIAT collapses financial market will decide how to price values, and they have their traidtions + standard methods. From what I read collapse is just dramatic value decrease. In such case what holds value or make it even better isa said to be:  farming land (food production), expensive art works and gold. This is what historically was used by rich families at least.

[02-Sep-18 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
2020 should be good year for crypto. A lot of macro-economics models predict collapse/new crisis of current USD based monetary system

[02-Sep-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
VEF appears to be the "doover" bolivar, not the one that hyperinflated to billions for a chicken

[02-Sep-18 11:09 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but if just one type of curr collapses this means nothinh, until USD and EUR is relatively strong

just persuade everyone your money best

[02-Sep-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not exactly printing machine. you learn the skill of long term. 🙂

[02-Sep-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if the money you print goes down, you still can survive.

skill is what matters in that case.

Found skills the best investment as well. Most important to have a proper picture of different macro/micro processes and learn technologies which suites or may suite it in future. So can be ahead in decisions. Just part is creating, masses using. Especially with current consumption model of society.

medium sized komodo have written: „Time to become an artist then“ and you „or a cryptocurrency developer“...

Maybe I misunderstood, then I‘m sorry. I‘m still learning English...

I wanted to say that a masternode would suffice for later passive income.

[02-Sep-18 02:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
masternodes require funds if coming from dash ecosystem's point of view. I have 0 dash.
other ideas I'm not looking forward to.
hodl kmd, so I guess that will be good for future income.
my point is if for example I lose all whatever crypto I have, I'm left with nothing.
then only my skills will be of any help to me to restart my life again.
working and using my skills to earn a meal and a roof to live.
just holding is not enough.

[02-Sep-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards pool lasts until block 7777777
