probably for big transaction, i can see it happening

[21-Oct-18 10:55 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That would have to be used in specific examples. For everyday transactions it wouldn't work (im thinking buy something at a store). Edit: I shouldn't say wouldn't, I will replace that with "may not"

[21-Oct-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be the other way around for purchasing things. use channels CC so the store knows it can collect the funds, regardless of if the chain is reorged or not

[21-Oct-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so there can be instant payments that are irrevocable instantly

[21-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
normal payments subject to the reorg rules

[21-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and these cancellable payments, which are not final until enough time passes

[21-Oct-18 10:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So you're saying having a 'paypass' for crypto. Where under x amount of funds is irrevocable, but above that requires time delay/confirmations

[21-Oct-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
2 of the three available now

[21-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
channels CC needs to be setup first by creating a channel directly, but for commonly used services, shouldnt be an issue

[21-Oct-18 11:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`Only systems that provide all the features of the old system plus brand new features achieve mass adoption` I think current crypto lacks a lot of the 'old system', thus, not achieving a high level of mass adoption

[21-Oct-18 11:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The article lays out a lot of the problems with current crypto usability

[21-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. it seems only KMD + some new CC will have all the tech needed to solve it, even if just at the core level. then a few easy to use GUI are needed on top

Yes

[21-Oct-18 11:40 PM] PTYX#6840
Well, launching an independent chain on Komodo is very simple. So if you have the team with the necessary skills you can launch a chain that is fully independent, is secure by btc hashrate, and you have all the tools you need to ICO, create your wallets, explorers, and so forth.

[21-Oct-18 11:41 PM] PTYX#6840
We also have BaaS providers like Chainzilla.io that offer those types of services at a cost.

If you have specific questions about tokenization or would like more information about paid blockchain services please write us at hello@chainzilla.io and we'll be happy to answer your questions.

yes, I think that is possible with CCs

[22-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[22-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Nano#1742
Well that means that no one knows how to develop those smart contracts.

[22-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Nano#1742
Or a very small number of people for right now.

[22-Oct-18 06:14 AM] gcharang#6833
Yes. These contracts don't work the same way as eth smart-contracts. For one, they aren't in the blockchain. They are in  the source code and are part of the consessus rules of any chain that runs them.

[22-Oct-18 06:16 AM] Nano#1742
So they are like NEM smart contracts?

[22-Oct-18 06:19 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't know much about NEM's smart contract implementation. But the website post I linked to has a good explanation of how Komodo's smart contracts work. Just skip the introductory parts

[22-Oct-18 06:20 AM] gcharang#6833
In broad strokes, any contract added will be in the source code, all the nodes will run the same software. Dapp developers will take advantage of RPC calls to use the contracts like Tokens.

[22-Oct-18 06:21 AM] gcharang#6833
Tokens contract allows for onchain creation,tranfer and trade of tokens. Here are the RPC:https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/tokens/introduction.html

When you have time go through the links at https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-cc.html it will give you a fair understanding on the current state and future direction of contracts on our platform. You can always stop by in #cc-general . If any of the existing contracts aren't enough to satisfy your need, you (or someone from your team) can submit a PR to repo with the additional features. https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/index-book-jl.html has almost all the info for a develo[er to get started writing CC. Currently writing in C++ is a straightforward process. Support for other languages might come in the future. You can always talk to @jl777c about any questions related to adding a new contract or modifying an existing one. The Tokens contract appears to have all the necessary features and it is augmented by the Gateways contract, which is similar to Blockstream's Liquid.
