of course if your chain wants to use the legacy version, then you cant expect to be having the latest

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
any chain that doesnt want to update, should let us know and we will make the appropriate provisions for those chains

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] PTYX#6840
So then we would have people running the updated software and some running the old software. I don't see this as a scalable solution. Given the platform is growing. Each time Komodo updates it halts the other chains too or they face forking, maintaining their own code base, or worse.

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] PTYX#6840
Right now yes, it doesn't matter. We have less than 10 chains that are trading

[28-Nov-18 12:59 PM] PTYX#6840
But when we have 500-1000 chains, this would be more chaos.

[28-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
well, we dont expect another sapling level update, so it can be the normal annual cycle

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is we are solving todays issues today

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] PTYX#6840
No, but surely there will be other forks. As there were last year.

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] PTYX#6840
We need to think of a better way to keep everyone updated

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
well if there is a need for a fork, there is a need for a fork and not having to make any source level changes vs having to make them, it seems the latter is more work

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
having software that never needs to be updated is likely not a reality for some years

[28-Nov-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and automatically updating is a worse "solution" as it creates a monster attack vector

[28-Nov-18 01:02 PM] PTYX#6840
I've looked at several other networks and when they update, their tokens or sidechains don't usually halt. What I'm pointing out is a flaw in the he scalability of the assetchain in the longterm.

[28-Nov-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not assume that in the future we will use the same methods as now

[28-Nov-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the assetchains dont have to update. they wont halt if they dont

[28-Nov-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
plz dont make a problem when there isnt one

[28-Nov-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
also if there is a hardfork and you dont update, then any tokens on the old fork indeed have a problem

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
being an independent chain creates more flexibility in the update process than if it was a token on the main chain

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not that a token on the main chain is directly comparable to having its own chain

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you have your own chain, you have your own chain, with all that means

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
including the need for updating at times

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] PTYX#6840
Maybe that solution will be more scalable: "let us not assume that in the future we will use the same methods as now"

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
a key point you seem to be missing is that assetchains that choose to not update, wont have to update anything on the exchanges

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the new codebase using -ac_sapling=farfutureheight is interoperable with the old version. So not sure why you claim this isnt scalable

[28-Nov-18 01:07 PM] PTYX#6840
I claim it isn't scalable because what we have to do to update chainzilla has to be done to all chains if we want to be on the latest update.

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] PTYX#6840
So the amount of work we are doing times 1000x or however many chains we will have in 1-2 years. It's not scalable unless you expect each token to have a dedicated team to do all the manual work to update. it's not something companies want to hear.

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there wont be any regular sapling level updates

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what your point is

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be at least an annual update for new notaries

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
that is just a matter to update the daemon, and not the entire infrastructure

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] PTYX#6840
How many hardforks did we have this year non-sapling related

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
what are the changes that a chain needs to themselves to update?

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
to get the new version, you need to get the new version

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont, you wont have the new version

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yet, we have provision for the new version to be backward compatible with the old version

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
still you are complaining about a "problem" that seems is not a real problem now

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] PTYX#6840
i guess i'll stop complaining then

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] PTYX#6840
üôÑ

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I try to make the process as smooth as possible and think I achieved that this time.

[28-Nov-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have chains that dont want to update, let us know

[28-Nov-18 01:12 PM] SHossain#0007
the code is bening prepared along with Aagama wallet, notary nodes, spv servers, explorers. all an assetchain user has to do is use the latest version. if the chain is in exchange, the exchange has to update komodo daemon. if the assetchain is in an exchange with KMD, it is already being updated. all the exchange has to do is restart the chain after the daemon update

[28-Nov-18 01:12 PM] PTYX#6840
I dont know anyone that wants to run an outdated chain .

[28-Nov-18 01:12 PM] PTYX#6840
but if we do, i'll surely let you know

[28-Nov-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if they dont want to update, then we just need to add -ac_sapling=farfutureheight and then the new will interop with the old and nobody is forced to update

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just bild you platform to have instant updates thats all ayutoamted liek KMD:LABS does ü§∑  just make sure there is aperson that pulls the trigger and dont make it do automatically

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt very hard

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we can handle 100 branches

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no proble

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
like node.js! automatica updates

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its sutomatic

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not a problem and very convenient, until it becomes a problem

[28-Nov-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
on a small scale it is fine

[28-Nov-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Id rather use just 1, but thats not always practical

[28-Nov-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the point is... you dont need 1 person to upgrade every coin .. its a 30s job to update eveyr notary

[28-Nov-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or a few hours, f they want to check the code first

I don't know if this is a proper place to ask, but I just saw on AWS that Komodo's headquarter is based in Ho Chi Minh city , Viet Nam, is that true ?

[28-Nov-18 08:37 PM] crumb#2550
Komodo has no headquarters

[28-Nov-18 08:37 PM] crumb#2550
it has developers, testers, etc all over the world

[28-Nov-18 08:37 PM] Kellhus#1055
so, the dragon has no head.

[28-Nov-18 08:37 PM] crumb#2550
different companies need addresses sometimes. so an address is given

[28-Nov-18 08:38 PM] crumb#2550
it doesn't mean it is automatically headquarters

[28-Nov-18 08:40 PM] crumb#2550
i remember someone saying that Komodo is russian, just because he saw an explorer with .ru extension

[28-Nov-18 08:41 PM] Kellhus#1055
TIL Komodo isn't Indonesian.

[28-Nov-18 08:43 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok, it's because I saw the address on this page so I just wonder https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Komodo%20Platform&id=0010L00001sCXagQAG&t=psf-locations
