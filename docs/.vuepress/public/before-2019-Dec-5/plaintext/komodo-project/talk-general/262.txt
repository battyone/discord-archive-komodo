we can offer 99% cost reduction to develop a custom consensus algorithm

[11-Apr-19 06:24 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I will come up with the list of ideas.. this week...

[11-Apr-19 06:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
how we can help grow komodo's ecosystem

[11-Apr-19 06:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Developing usable products

[11-Apr-19 06:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Educating people on how to use them

[11-Apr-19 06:29 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"0x is a company, KMD is open source community project"  correct..

[11-Apr-19 06:36 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
example -- 

Komodo educational academy, other educational content creation, case studies and other
Tie up with blockchain educational platform such as blockgeeks 
Announcing Grants for cool project build on komodo
 organising meetups and events
Using podcast and other mediums to tell what happening inside komodo
Working with Infra companies such as digital ocean, heroku to provide asset chain templates 
dev documentation designed to get started various things 
Reaching out to developer and find ways to train them ..

will add more

[11-Apr-19 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
add less, get more done

All of that is being done/worked on ,  best thing @coinmonks || CoinCodeCap  is to get familiar with with KMD has to offer.

Komodo Documentation
Documentation for developers building on Komodo

[11-Apr-19 06:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes.. I went through them already before

[11-Apr-19 06:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap I think the issue is that Komodo doesn't have a Joseph Lubin or the DCG group or other VCs pouring millions into it. So there's only so much that can be done at the same time with what funds are available. Considering this I think Komodo is doing well and using resources very wisely, as someone who's followed this for years I'm very bullish on how it's all coming together...

[11-Apr-19 06:45 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I get this part...

[11-Apr-19 06:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've been donating a lot of bounties on the tech side, I only wish I could do more once it's at least 1kmd=10$

[11-Apr-19 06:47 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
that will make komodo a unicorn 😃

unicorn -- a company with billion dollar valuation

[11-Apr-19 06:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ignoring the company part, it did reach over a billion marketcap

[11-Apr-19 06:49 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes.. I know

[11-Apr-19 06:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap you seem to have left the words `privately held startup` out of your definition 🦄

[11-Apr-19 06:50 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
yes.. correct

[11-Apr-19 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
komodo is neither of those things

[11-Apr-19 06:50 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 its an Ethereum community thing.

[11-Apr-19 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, there's two groups of a community "we" and they sometimes do overlap, but are generally separate
example:
We have a great and open community ☑ 
We coded a great daemon 🚫

```Komodo educational academy```
Welcome to Discord. The academy here old school. Spartan. Sorry, it's rtfm. Learned that the hard way. When you understand that part, you seek a trainer. Like Tony the Barbarian, Siu The Great, Regnar the Wise, Paladin Fishy. Be careful of that 777 dude, he's like Zeus shooting thunderbolts and stuff.
```other educational content creation,```
That's DIY, the hacker way. And when you get something working nifty, you get fancy green on you with "Ecosystem Developer" 
```case studies```
Tech Tuesday, Five Bullet Friday, Ecosystem Spotlight, Wha-wha-wha-white-paypas.
```Tie up with blockchain educational platform such as blockgeeks ```
Careful, pioneers, makers of chains, chameleons, cakeshoppers, gamedevs roam here!
```Announcing Grants for cool project build on komodo```
Like Unreal Engine grant applications? Nope, don't happen around here!
```organising meetups and events```
High on the clouds the two Barts live. They have bar, called Blockbar. We drink beer there. No meetups. No events. Only co-working and expo's.
```Using podcast and other mediums to tell what happening inside komodo```
You probably missed Bitcoin Benny. He's like Oprah, only more handsome and more interesting.
```Working with Infra companies such as digital ocean, heroku to provide asset chain templates ```
Does Amazon as technology partner say something? 
```dev documentation designed to get started various things```
A developer that can't read the markup on GitHub and doesn't understand Python, should probably start to learn programming first prior calling themselves a developer.... (unless its business developer, but those are scared of GitHub)
```Reaching out to developer and find ways to train them```
Certain people who are nicknamed the machine will train any decent willing, brave student up to speed in two weeks.
