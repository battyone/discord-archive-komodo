I don't know if LN guys replied sorry

[28-Apr-19 03:44 PM] phm87#7395
but the dust problem and fee problem is discussed regularly on LN chats/forums, I agree that these are problems, actual problems.

[28-Apr-19 03:44 PM] phm87#7395
Back to CHIPS : without routing and hops, I will have way less problems 😃

[28-Apr-19 03:46 PM] phm87#7395
and more liberty to set fees to avoid to be stuck

[28-Apr-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, and if LN is only in demand when BTC txfees are high, and that breaks LN by making it require trust...

[28-Apr-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems as scalable as ETH

[28-Apr-19 03:48 PM] phm87#7395
at the end of the article, they wrote 
```Rizun’s paper notes that the issue adds unneeded friction from layer one to layer two by “forcing complex and poorly-understood work-arounds to the L2 protocol.”```
I cannot agree more with the end of the sentence : few solutions that were explained (on LN chats/forums) were not realistic. Poorly understood work around is also a risk that these work arounds are performed by paid services (exchanges ?) because too complex for users

yes, that was SHAttered: http://shattered.it/

[29-Apr-19 09:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
Quite the big deal when it came out. That is the main reason why Git is migrating to SHA256

Git is not vulnerable to the exact SHAttered attack, but it sure does not make them sleep well at night

Hello everyone,
Someone would have an opinion on the Blokcnet XRouter?
Although I read their recent publications, I still can not understand the purpose of the project and all seems really approximate.
Do you know what can actually be achieved with this router?
If indeed what is in question is relevant, could not the CCs also achieve this?

Finally, to return to their "DEX", we agree that there is a nuance to be made compared to Barterdex and MM2 coming because of the use of proxy token with BlockDX?

[29-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jorian#4555
iirc, BlockDX didn't use a proxy token

[29-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought they did for the xrouter stuff they were going to use for liquidity

[29-Apr-19 10:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also remembered them already announcing xrouter like end of 2017 early 2018 or so?

[29-Apr-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand how xrouter can be made without changing each coin daemon code. maybe they have a way of securing data from other chains, or maybe the masternodes are just to be trusted

@jl777c isn't blocknet router very similar to what basilisk was?

[29-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Alright#0419
basically allows you to do rpc commands on different chains via BLOCK MNs

[29-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
so you issue a command on blocknet router network that says "give me getinfo from LTC"

[29-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
and it does

via BLOCK MNs running LTC

[29-Apr-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is, but it relied on NN to have some trust in the results

[29-Apr-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
trusting random MN is a different thing

[30-Apr-19 02:37 PM] m_maria_a#0348
question about sha family: why those logical functions where chosen for hashing and not any others? I mean why for example  there is f(i, B, C, D) = (B and C) or ((not B) and D) used for 0>= i >=19 in sha1 and not any other values of i or any other function? Or why there is shift 5 to the right in the sha2? or even how do i choose first 5 H for sha1 algorithm?

[30-Apr-19 02:38 PM] m_maria_a#0348
i cannot find any detailed explanation in the internet

[30-Apr-19 02:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@m_maria_a you will most likely need to read the academic papers that describe the algorithms

[30-Apr-19 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@m_maria_a every value is extremely important and changing one value could make everything break

[30-Apr-19 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326

[30-Apr-19 02:45 PM] m_maria_a#0348
i found some academic papers however they do not really explain the source of choosing those algorithms, thank you very much for the link

[30-Apr-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
the algorithms are chosen such that they are very hard to attack

[30-Apr-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
the numbers/constants are discovered via experimentation, optimized to make attacks the least efficient

[30-Apr-19 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
very few people in the world can come up with new secure cryptographic hash functions

[30-Apr-19 02:47 PM] m_maria_a#0348
i know the general idea and the hierarchy of the algorithms as well as some more advanced mathematical tools used in them however the understanding of them do not really help me in understanding why thy not any other where chosen. However, as i am very new to the topic most of it is still dark matter for me

[30-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@m_maria_a it's trivial to "backdoor" an algorithm by changing a few constants, governments do this

[30-Apr-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@m_maria_a are you asking why a certain constant was chosen in 1 algorithm, or why certain algorithms are chosen over others?

[30-Apr-19 02:49 PM] m_maria_a#0348
why a certain constant was chosen in an algorithm
