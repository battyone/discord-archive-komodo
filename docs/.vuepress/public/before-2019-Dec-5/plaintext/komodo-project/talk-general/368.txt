separately we are notifying all exchanges and mining pools to update to latest version, this means exchanges can open at their own pace

[16-Jun-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and i plan to start refunding some of the assetchains later today

[16-Jun-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, we have contacted almost all exchanges today to update

I sent in the claim some days ago, sent the dust as instructed but no sign of any funds return. Also I have a claim to yet do from another computer that I can't access for a week maybe. There is no time limit on this is there? Also HOW do KMD access my wallet to 'retrieve' my coins?

cool

[16-Jun-19 03:12 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am trying to understand Komodo's atomic swap .. I have few questions 

1- 0.15% fee for commiting against an order.. How you decided it should be 0.15%  and this fee will be paid in which token? 

2- In the example where, it's detailing process of BTC <--> KMD swap .. It's saying if Bob want to swap 100 BTC against KMD , it needs to deposit 112 BTC first.. Then again send 100 BTC for swap ..am I understanding this correctly?

[16-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that has been changed

[16-Jun-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
only the taker pays 0.15% in the coin they are trading

[16-Jun-19 03:13 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
So extra deposit has been removed ..correct ?

[16-Jun-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[16-Jun-19 03:13 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
do this atomic swap can support BTC<--> ETH too?

[16-Jun-19 03:14 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
on KMD blockchain

[16-Jun-19 03:16 PM] bartwr#6773
The mm1 supported 'etomic' (ETH/ERC20) swaps. mm2 will support this in the future, I expect. Any chain that can support locking of funds as well as multisig can be supported. ETH/BTC as well, via a smart contract deployed on ETH having these 2 features

[16-Jun-19 03:17 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what is mm

[16-Jun-19 03:17 PM] gcharang#6833
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap 
our DEX is p2p and blockchain to blockchain
there is no involvement of KMD blockchain when a BTC-ETH swap is taking place

[16-Jun-19 03:17 PM] bartwr#6773
mm = marketmaker, the name of the software that implements the BarterDEX protocol for doing atomic swaps.

[16-Jun-19 03:18 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I want to understand..how this atomic swap working technically ..any good resource?

The video above. And also the white paper does give good information. Recently in moving from mm1 to mm2 there have been some changes in the protocol. But in general the white paper explains it well.

[16-Jun-19 03:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@bartwr mm2 doesn't need etomic
now ETH swaps are direct too

[16-Jun-19 03:21 PM] bartwr#6773

Ok.. Now in that video.. deposit not need... 

So process looks like this 

Bob want to swap 1 btc against eth with Alice  

Now I go to barterDex.. create an order with 1 BTC 

Alice see the order pays .015% fee and deposit the ETH on  a secure address (what is this secure address, who is controlling it)

Then Bob send his BTC on a secure address (What is this secure address and who is controlling it)

Now swap happens (Who is signalling this swap, checking if funds a re deposited and settling trade  )

Hello all, I received the dust in my new account on 12 june but I have not yet received the funds

[16-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Kay Gee#2313
I was expecting the funds to arrive on 13 June

[16-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Can anybody please confirm the status?

[16-Jun-19 03:35 PM] gcharang#6833
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap it is called an address for the sake of simplicity, its actually a p2sh (pay to script hash)
this p2sh can be unlocked with a secret by Alice or it will go back to bob after a specific time

[16-Jun-19 03:37 PM] gcharang#6833
Alice also locks her coins with the same secret bob has already done

when bob claims alices coins, he is exposing the secret thereby allowing alice to claim bob's coins

[16-Jun-19 03:38 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok cool.. gonna ask few more question after dinner

[16-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Steve10#5203
Once a claim form for missing kmd is filed how long should it take to get a response?

[16-Jun-19 04:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@Steve10 have sent the small transaction after filling the form?

[16-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Steve10#5203
@gcharang I checked the balance of the wallet and the funds were gone but there was a small deposit of dust after the funds were taken. I filled out a claim form and haven't heard anything back. Should I send that dust to someone? If so sorry I missed that step.

[16-Jun-19 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to send the smartdust to your specified refund address

[16-Jun-19 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
until then, no refund will be issued against your claim

[16-Jun-19 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
we are using blockchain to refund

[16-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Steve10#5203
Ok so I misunderstood that obviously lol. So I send the dust to the new address I created and put on the form. Once done then the process continues

@SHossain ok I'm feeling stupid. When I go to send the dust to my new address its ok that the amount is different because of the fee correct? I just clicked on send all but it is 0.0001 less because of fee.

[16-Jun-19 04:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that is ok

[16-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Steve10#5203

any benefit to running lite vs native for komodo?

[16-Jun-19 05:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
lite is quick accessible
I like native via cli, the command line way. full blockchain copy gives better sense of security than lite wallets.
