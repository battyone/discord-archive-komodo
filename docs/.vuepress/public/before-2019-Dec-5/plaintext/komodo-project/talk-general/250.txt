okay guys, with dudes like duke leading your group, good luck.  You're gonna need it.  later

As somebody who has contributed to free software and open source for 22 years, I can tell you for free: all closed source software is evil until proven otherwise. Many of you haven't even been alive that long

@crunchycat  just keep it up dude, you're doing great. really.

[03-Apr-19 03:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
The market must be hungry for anything if closed source scams are appealing

[03-Apr-19 03:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
they have not proved they are secure against a 51% attack + double spend in production, like KMD has

[03-Apr-19 03:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
so to promise that, without proof, is a scam, in my book

[03-Apr-19 03:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
like selling an ox to a farmer a year before it's born, and then that salesman conveniently leaves town

[03-Apr-19 03:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
financial incompetence?

[03-Apr-19 03:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
or technical incompetence? or both?

[03-Apr-19 03:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
do you think they have discovered things that jl777 hasn't thought about and thrown away years ago or improved upon for years in prod? Scam is appropriate, until they are proven

I wouldn't promise I was a brain surgeon without knowing how to do it

if the code is ever open sourced, I will be sure to take a look. Let's see if that ever happens.

[03-Apr-19 06:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
seriously- why don't you ban that twat until he refrains  from using such offensive avatar?
using literally feces as avatar is obviously inflammatory behaviour and nobody needs to tolerate that- tell the moron to use a non-offensive avatar if he wants to have a meaningful conversation

[03-Apr-19 06:48 AM] LocoMB#8593
what an obnoxious little creep, expecting replies using an an approach like that is really very aggressive and should not be tolerated, this is trollish by definition

[03-Apr-19 06:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Still havent seen any technical explanation as to why vbk should work let alone be superior to dpow

oh well, he uses that avatar on veriblock discord too, just a trollish little noob acolyte of the latest crypto fad

Thanks @radix42 for updating the build and getting it running again!

For notary votes.. what about those that hold on a ledger?

[03-Apr-19 07:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Do vote2019 go to the ledger?    I wouldn’t think so

[03-Apr-19 07:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
If you have the seed than you can access it via agama Shossian had a document on that

[03-Apr-19 07:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
the simplest might be to move it out of the ledger for the snapshot and than move it back

[03-Apr-19 07:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Snapshot on 4-14 yes?

[03-Apr-19 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362

when sapling was activated Dec 15th, it took effect. As of Feb 15th, no more sprout in the ecosystem. all in the Dec 1st release, which I believe predates any 3.x agama versions. someone should verify this

coincidentally, it serves as a cautionary tale of what I've always said about BTC not being a viable currency

good thing i bought kmd with all my btc 😁

[03-Apr-19 11:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure vbk will use another strange perversion of common sense to say that this demonstrates their project's effectiveness. "Look!, see, it's working!"

[03-Apr-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my asics are happy mining CHIPS`
plural? 😕
