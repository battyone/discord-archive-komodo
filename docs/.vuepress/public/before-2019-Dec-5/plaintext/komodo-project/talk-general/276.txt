One more question. I noticed Komodo doesn't force at projects built over the platform to use $KMD at all, that's a non common approach in this space. Despite I understand its good for technical reasons, which adds value to $KMD?

Ecosystem coins can optionally apply to be protected by DPoW, which carries a cost to cover notarisation fees. 
There are also ecosystem assets like DEX, which get a small fee from atomic swap transactions.  Basically, developers are given a wide variety of tools, but not constrained by having to conform to KMD's parameters. If you want to use PoS instead of PoW, you can. Hybrid PoS/PoW, no problem.
Some devs expand the toolkit with their own innovations, and we can merge that back upstream for others ecosystem projects to benefit from.

Recent evidence of this is demonstrated in the Custom Consensus (CC) tech which is expanding rapidly based on the visions and requirements of ecosystem projects. jl777 clears a path in the jungle and lays foundations. Developers who appreciate adaptability, low financial barrier to entry and freedom to create then build it out with their own applications and innovations. Everyone wins, noone is a vassal.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator appreciate your insight bro, I'm definitely enthusiastic about Komodo

[20-Apr-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same as last year I expect there to be most votes near the end, as its safer not to waste votes that way to elect who you want. Should you have enough to sway the result üòÉ

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
I won't do that, thats for sure- so if I follow that link to the alleged pdf, I land in their support system, which has a separate account from the exchange

when there are 1000+ chains they will be worth a lot of revenues, it's a long term thing though

[20-Apr-19 05:02 PM] PTYX#6840
@LocoMB we've luckily had no issues with bittrex using a company account

[20-Apr-19 05:03 PM] Jsam#3113
@jorian yes yes but ownership of those assets - today - brings any revenue? why should I buy those assets?

[20-Apr-19 05:03 PM] jorian#4555
why should you buy KMD?

[20-Apr-19 05:03 PM] Jsam#3113
no, the assets in assetchains

[20-Apr-19 05:03 PM] jorian#4555
yes, but i'm asking the question back

[20-Apr-19 05:04 PM] jorian#4555
or why should you buy BTC?

[20-Apr-19 05:04 PM] Jsam#3113
are the revenue streams those assets are supposed to bring working atm?

[20-Apr-19 05:04 PM] jorian#4555
they are

[20-Apr-19 05:04 PM] jorian#4555
and have happened before

[20-Apr-19 05:04 PM] jorian#4555
it's the bear market making everything of lesser value, so it hasn't happened in a while

[20-Apr-19 05:05 PM] Jsam#3113
when was it the last time asset holders got dividends?

[20-Apr-19 05:05 PM] jorian#4555
no idea. 2 years ago? @jl777c handles these things, he knows

[20-Apr-19 05:06 PM] Jsam#3113
so, it's not automatic, like a smart contract or anything

[20-Apr-19 05:06 PM] jorian#4555
not yet

[20-Apr-19 05:07 PM] Jsam#3113
and the only distribution was at the time of the migration to komodo?

[20-Apr-19 05:07 PM] jorian#4555
i believe when the time is ripe, it will move to something automatic

[20-Apr-19 05:07 PM] jorian#4555
no

[20-Apr-19 05:07 PM] jorian#4555
you can buy some of them at coinexchange.io

[20-Apr-19 05:07 PM] jorian#4555

[20-Apr-19 05:08 PM] jorian#4555
the others you can buy otc in #talk-trading

[20-Apr-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
A year and a half ago about $2 mil worth of KMD was distributed to holders of SUPERNET, CRYPTO and REVS

[20-Apr-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
please dont feel like you have to buy them

[20-Apr-19 05:10 PM] Jsam#3113
why aren't these assets working more smoothly? with regular, automated profit distributions?

[20-Apr-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
because it isnt generating much revenues now

[20-Apr-19 05:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
Because it has to accululate somehing first? Payout happens aprox eatch 1m usd

[20-Apr-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
CRYPTO generates about 50 BTC per year

[20-Apr-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is the only one with steady cashflow, a lot of that flows into SUPERNET and REVS gets a 5% share

[20-Apr-19 05:22 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you expect. but if people dont use the service (JUMBLR) then there are no JUMBLR revenues and thus no revenues to share

[20-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Jsam#3113
a page for each asset in komodo.com would be nice

[20-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Jsam#3113

@Jsam distributions will wait until there is enough funds to make it worth doing

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have this expectation that the will be like AAPL, then it is best not to buy them

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Jsam#3113
unless these assets are not meant for widespread distribution

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Jsam#3113
oh I see

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
who is pushing people to buy them?

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
they exist, they do what they do. markers to allocate the revshares, if and when they come in

[20-Apr-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
they are not operating companies like AAPL with quarterly reports, officies, workers, etc.

[20-Apr-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that being said, a fully automated business on the blockchain will generate revenues with very little (zero?) expenses and the final pieces of the tech that enables this is coming into place

[20-Apr-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
however there is nobody to hold the investors hands and give quarterly reports, etc.
