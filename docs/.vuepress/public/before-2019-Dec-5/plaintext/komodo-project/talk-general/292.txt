Thanks @az  I usually smell such things from a mile but in this case I was owned. I remember having a very small doubt once but I set it aside

looks like plump pump attempt, so maybe made to fall back negatively on KMD?

[10-May-19 03:03 PM] LocoMB#8593
you think a 'real' pump attempt by some impatient KMD buyer?

I think it's something more sophisticated. She wrote this today "Thank you for your interest. In the next few weeks I will make an official release and answer your question". Let's wait. But at least people know.

[10-May-19 03:41 PM] ca333#0118
if i set up a fake i would also ensure that the data used is 'faked' to a certain degree making it impossible to track it back to veritas

A little investigation found it's a bought account & there's no such people working for IBM. Fake Linkedin, stolen photo, etc..
