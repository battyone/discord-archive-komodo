Hi @Pumtchak, good idea about a 'Pokemon' lesson!
We are setting up a framework to help people build on top of the current modules.
@Regnar  has a PR in that has a list of many new resources `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/pull/28/commits/12821388f3fe3f59a9f982fb0af9cda94e2759a0`.
We have created a Trello to help with developing on the Assets Module here `https://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assetshttps://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assets`.
I'll add a card for your lesson/tutorial suggestion (you can add/modify it if you like :) )
Please jump in and join the fun! 🎉

[07-Nov-19 09:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Btw, @Pumtchak , in case you haven't seen, the learning launchpad has some great tutorials.

@komodoTeam- can anyone give me a hint- my KMD asset blockchains seem to have a hitch synching, as of 5 weeks ago, I can not get any new blocks, until then it was no issue- eg SUPERNET  and CRYPTO etc... since then, Komodoocean Wallet just says ' 0 active connections' - I am using KomodoOcean binary distribution version 2.0.15.rc2-109ed3e - Komodo Blockchain itself works and gets 4 active connections

[08-Nov-19 07:16 AM] TonyL#3577
@LocoMB Try to update to latest release (https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-6) Btw there is relevant #support channel

@Cryptoon  You mean the kmd network update has been completed?

Not sure what block it’s active but I think notary nodes are already updated. The updated is active from a certain block activation height.

[09-Nov-19 08:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

[10-Nov-19 05:53 AM] joe2x4#5987
```https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Pegs-CC```

In current peg system kmd 5% rewards are unavailable to user once kmd is locked for stable coin.

Is it possible or is there any benefit to allowing the stable coin creator to split and keep a portion of their locked kmd 5% reward if they take a reasonable loan of say 50% or less deposit for a long period of time. Ex: User gets  2.5% reward accruing per month for locking their kmd for a year, and creating stable coin from 50% of deposit, multisigners get the other 2.5%

[10-Nov-19 06:14 AM] joe2x4#5987
I guess what I'm trying to describe is a system for longer term loans that might compete against a shorter, potentially higher risk loan system. If it is just up to the cc pegs code then can't we expect to see different cc pegs modules with different loan terms ?

[10-Nov-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be very complicated, but maybe if there was a way to have a predefined percentage that is borrowed and also predefined term. so, ok, it is possible, but first we need to get the basic system working

[10-Nov-19 06:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
> One of these modifications was to allow users to create a new type of quantum-secure address. First, users register a handle of their choosing. This registration process executes a transaction on the blockchain, which takes both the user’s quantum-secured blockchain public key and chosen handle into account. This allows a mere 32 bytes of data (the transaction ID of the registration transaction) to refer to 3 kilobytes of data (the uncompressed Dilithium public key).

it is a "hardfork" in the sense that nodes that don't update in time will go on a fork
but there is no creation of two different cryptos
it could be called a "hard software update"
