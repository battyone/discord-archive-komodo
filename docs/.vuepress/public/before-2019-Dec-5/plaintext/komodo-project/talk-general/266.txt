New $HUSH mainnet in less than 3 hours, so we wanted to show off amazing $KMD tools!
This is what it looks like to mine a genesis block.
Fun Fact: Komodo + all asset chains embed the $BTC genesis block as block 0 and build upon it from Block 1, which is why you see height=...

It's hard to describe how much easier KMD tools make life for coin devs

[14-Apr-19 02:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's the difference between a firehose and carrying tiny cups of water uphill

@jl777c do we have an estimate of how much KMD/month a CHIPS UI dev would cost?

[14-Apr-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
wouldn't that depend on how many are deving it and the timetable to expected?

[14-Apr-19 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
depends on a hell of a lot of things, just trying to get some sense of the situation

[14-Apr-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810

you would need a basic scope of work to get a quote

NINJA ?

I think it's was used as a test prior to the vote airdrop.

I'm not sure if the chain is meant for something other than that

turns out only about half are actively claiming rewards!

[14-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this means the net inflation rate for someone that is actively claiming is very close to 0%, even counting the mining

[14-Apr-19 07:52 PM] richardt#2807
@PTYX That's also probably one of reasons why KMD price is where it is and not higher.  Too many day-traders and people looking to make a quick profit rather than holding it in their own wallets

[14-Apr-19 07:54 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not sure if that affects the price but many of the users are waiting for easier to use interfaces. Some of them don't know they can store coins in the ledger and claim rewards now.

[14-Apr-19 07:54 PM] PTYX#6840
Recently a user with over 250K Komodo was surprised to find out he could use a Ledger now. He had funds in an exchange.

Not saying it's the biggest factor, but likely one of the factors

[14-Apr-19 07:55 PM] richardt#2807
That's why I'm hoping with the rebrand, the team could emphasize more on all the benefits of holding KMD

[14-Apr-19 07:58 PM] richardt#2807
Wow 250k all on an exchange all this time?  He's been missing out on a lot of rewards! Not to mention being at a much higher risk for getting hacked the whole time

[14-Apr-19 08:04 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
If I had 250k Komodo sitting on an exchange I might put a little effort into moving it off that said exchange and into something more secure. Unless you are day trading that much.

[14-Apr-19 08:06 PM] richardt#2807
Maybe the guy has millions of KMD and the 250k is just play money for him üòÑ

[14-Apr-19 10:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@CHMEX do you remember last years turnout in terms of % of votes that took place? It will be interesting to see if more people vote this year than last. (assuming a higher percentage means more people of course)

[15-Apr-19 01:54 AM] PTYX#6840
@klein on Magnum if your using the ledger your keys are not exposed

[15-Apr-19 01:55 AM] PTYX#6840
If you arent using Ledger, then it's like any other web wallet

is this just your master public key?

[15-Apr-19 01:56 AM] klein#5233
(with ledger)

[15-Apr-19 01:56 AM] PTYX#6840
Not master public key but it is your pubkey to the addresses that hold funds.

[15-Apr-19 01:57 AM] PTYX#6840
As I explained in the video, the backup file acts like a watch only account

[15-Apr-19 01:57 AM] PTYX#6840
Similar to Ledger live without the ledger plugged in
