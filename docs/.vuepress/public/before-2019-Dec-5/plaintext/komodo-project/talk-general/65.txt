but  we have a front end and back to go up so need to waste time on nothing

[13-Sep-18 12:39 PM] lucifer#6636
if your investing into superficial then fine we are focused on underficial

[13-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Killua#2635
@Deleted User just because you say it's the "truth" doesn't mean it is. I 100% disagree that marketing is "kinda" everything . But it's the truth

[13-Sep-18 01:21 PM] Killua#2635
@Deleted User tech>marketing. Both are important but tech before everything by a significant margin. If I wanted a marketing first crypto I'd buy Tron,  Ripple, or EOS

if no one knows about your great tech you have a problem. if no one wants to look more into your great tech, because your presentation is shit, you also have a problem

[13-Sep-18 01:29 PM] lucifer#6636
Presentations should be shit and delivery should be everything

[13-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Meyse#0952
presentation, packaging, user experience, however you want to call it. it should not be shit, because it will turn people away from you, which you do not want

[13-Sep-18 01:31 PM] lucifer#6636
we already have user action with our surveys

[13-Sep-18 01:31 PM] lucifer#6636

IN THE MEDIA

[13-Sep-18 01:32 PM] lucifer#6636
the key core function is delivery and showing what technology can do on an economical development level

[13-Sep-18 01:32 PM] Killua#2635
@Meyse Yes true. Like I said BOTH are important but I believe Tech first. Invest in people, not promises. Look at the devs. Their literally madmen behind the computer. Look at Steve Lee. He's a mad man when it comes to marketing and will bring KMD to the main light. The people behind Komodo are insane from all directions. Can't say the same about most projects

problem is media is not the main objective

[13-Sep-18 01:34 PM] lucifer#6636
in the 1st run of things

[13-Sep-18 01:35 PM] lucifer#6636
When we did the project in Greece which was backed by Jl777 as he sponsored it to get started it snowballed into mainstream media as it was Physical usecase with physical people

[13-Sep-18 01:35 PM] lucifer#6636
Media had something to touch, play and experience

[13-Sep-18 01:35 PM] lucifer#6636
and the website then was shit too

[13-Sep-18 01:35 PM] lucifer#6636

When you want media need to decide blog or crypto media or do mean the financial corperate media

Hi folks..

If a new coin is created with komodo.. is this on komodo blockchain or is it an own independent blockchain?

[13-Sep-18 02:30 PM] dan.#2473
its own blockchain

[13-Sep-18 02:34 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a KIC or Komodo Independent Chain.

[13-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Meyse#0952
this the new marketing term? KIC?

[13-Sep-18 02:42 PM] lucifer#6636
Independant chains are very valuable but fast question does that mean they control there chains NODES

[13-Sep-18 02:49 PM] Khorosho#5642
@lucifer  +1 (nxt holder)

[13-Sep-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the term I introduced at Chainzilla and people seem to like it. There will be other types of tokens that you can launch on Komodo so it only applies to the traditional "assetchain". As I understand it, with Cryptoconditions you will be able to launch proxy tokens. I still need to dig into the CC documentation though.

[13-Sep-18 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
@lucifer i believe you can now launch a blockchain with your own node network. It's still in early stages.

[13-Sep-18 02:52 PM] lucifer#6636
YEs thats what I came in here for and was chatting to Jl777 about earlier

[13-Sep-18 02:53 PM] lucifer#6636
as we have  the E-Gagauzia project that can fit onto it

[13-Sep-18 02:53 PM] lucifer#6636
but to deliver it theres more than just tech involved

[13-Sep-18 02:53 PM] lucifer#6636
as its a partnership with regional government

[13-Sep-18 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
I've not heard of that project.

[13-Sep-18 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840

[13-Sep-18 02:56 PM] PTYX#6840
