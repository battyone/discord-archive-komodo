Yes as soon as we start moving them the hacker found out and it was a race

[08-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Ok.

[08-Jun-19 01:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Most were saved, still waiting to see final damage ,  but early estimates 90% or so were saved

[08-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Easteregg69#4081
I think FUD will make price go lower so whales can move in.

[08-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Just an idea.

[08-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Ups. Trading.

More worried about people getting their money back than Komodo price

[08-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Easteregg69#4081
How about that UTXO? I can not send 0.0001. Wait it out?

[08-Jun-19 01:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
First thing I would do is try another good wallet, like Chameleon  as it may just be a local issue.  Not seeing any reason why it couldn‚Äôt be spent.  The #support  channel has more technical devs if other clients are not working , they can better assist you.

[08-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Easteregg69#4081
Ok. Agama_windows_portable_0.3.6b. Here goes.

[08-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Easteregg69  please use the latest Verus wallet

Is our pin to access the Agama mobile compromised too?

[08-Jun-19 01:44 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bimbles we can't be sure one way or another
assume it is compromised and take necessary steps to protect other accounts if they use the same pin

Do I transfer the 0.0001 from my compromised to new address now? or do we wait till the 15th?

got my small tx sent to me, so i sent the whole balance minus the fee to my new wallet address that i listed as recovery address in the google form after the fund sweep yesterday.

[08-Jun-19 02:29 AM] ecbuddy#8524
wondering how long before it will be processed?

[08-Jun-19 02:30 AM] gcharang#6833
if your amount is less than 7777 KMD
it should be by june 15, it could also be sooner

just got an update on blockfolio that there is a new claim form, i already filled out the first claim form, do i also need to fill out the newer one?

[08-Jun-19 05:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no, previous info has been recorded. New form is to make claims involving multiple entries simpler.

When will the assets be returned? Did the hacker steal some amount of assets? supernet, dex etc ...

[08-Jun-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
assets will be refunded using same mechanism, but after the KMD is mostly processed. most assets there is much less time urgency. we just have not had the time to analyze all 50+ blockchains for theft utxo. please understand it is like the building is on fire and there is only time to take protective action. rather than take a chance we swept many (but not all) assets.

[08-Jun-19 07:23 AM] costa2439#3771
ok, thanks, I just wanted to know if the most important, supernet, dex, crypto. they had suffered a great robbery

[08-Jun-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
they could have, but were put in safety

[08-Jun-19 07:58 AM] bubu#1031
hello and good day everyone

[08-Jun-19 08:04 AM] gobi#1545
In the instance you have multiple accounts that have been swept, with multiple assets swept in each account, is it a case of filling out a separate form for each individual asset in each of the accounts? Or can we aggregate all the coins/assets into 1 form for each address/account?

[08-Jun-19 08:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
1 claim per asset

[08-Jun-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just state for all assets to go to the same address

[08-Jun-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
one compromised -> one claim address is the easiest for me

[08-Jun-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
one address -> one address

[08-Jun-19 08:06 AM] gobi#1545
perfect

[08-Jun-19 08:07 AM] gobi#1545
to clarify - single form per compromised address, no matter how many assets in it?

[08-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i will ask support to make a special form for ALLASSETS

[08-Jun-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so just that one, that will actually make it easier for me

Sounds like a plan - I'll hang tight and wait for that form then

[08-Jun-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain a single claim for all assets will be much simpler

[08-Jun-19 08:47 AM] nocturnal#2177
when i checked the explorer for my address it said there was 5x the kmd i actually had in my wallet

[08-Jun-19 08:47 AM] nocturnal#2177

I have to say I am really surprised that bitcointalk  et al. are not crawling with gibbering trolls and poop slinging monkeys right now! üêí Amazing! 
This seems to indicate that the whole crypto scene has changed drastically over the last 2-3 years, all the toxic bilge dwellers seem to have lost interest and moved to other things to hate- maybe soccer clubs or so

[08-Jun-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i think most of it is due to the silo-ing within discord/slack

[08-Jun-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
bitcointalk was just become a waste of time, most prefer to not have to deal with silly trolls all the time

[08-Jun-19 09:55 AM] bogybogy#3962
komodo covers a market segment with a certain type of high moral integrity, we notice through positive discussions on various social channels, in 2018 I was the victim of a hacker who stole my 5000 iota  from the wallet, the biggest disturbance was his answer of Dominik shiener where  should to change few letters from  the private seed...really ruthless the way how iota deal with this issues,they where using a intermediary company who provide the private seed for the iota wallet, anyway is the past, I'm glad that Komodo deal so well with the issues

@jl777c  Hello ... Sorry to ask silly question ... I have a residual balance like 0.0004 or less, in KMD old seed (I remembered this morning) .... Is it important for you that those funds are safe?

[08-Jun-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
no, you MUST send those from the old address to your new secure address. that is how you make the claim official and in the blockchain

[08-Jun-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it MUST match your claim form

[08-Jun-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
follow instructions! namely send the special tx 2) to the claim address: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

i'll make new claim forms for each separate assetchains. users who already submitted claims for assetchains doesn't have to do anything. only new users who will submit new claims need to fill out those forms. having asset specific forms will also be simplier to fill out

From those of us in the crypto community that have been here a while....Komodo shined brightly under immense pressure. JL777 (James) stayed up 30 hours straight until he had saved as much Komodo as possible. You one the other hand, merely being late for dinner, melted down into irrational diatribe. When you calm down and become reasonable you might be able to see the flip side and how amazing of a job Komodo Team did in response and under a rush of immense pressure. Komodo acted like Fire Fighters running into a burning building to save the children, while you broke down into a ball of hysterical babble curled up in the fetal position...and then ran to Youtube to sensationalize the drama and grow your Patreon revenue because the burning building made you late for dinner.

Give it some love.

Hey @jl777c : this guy @discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh is saying that DigitalPrice team made things up and didn't get robbed by a hacker using the agama exploit, but he doesn't seem to have any proof about that. Do you have a way to check if this guy is just a troll defaming another team or if there's evidence that DP team made things up ?
