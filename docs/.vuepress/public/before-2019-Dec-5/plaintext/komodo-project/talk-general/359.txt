this is just the first step for the assetchains and until i announced that refunds are processed for a particular chain, refunds would not have been processed

[11-Jun-19 10:04 AM] peddycb#5889
were already distributed all kmd?
I claimed about 37k

[11-Jun-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
only clean claims up to 17777 KMD have been refunded

[11-Jun-19 10:06 AM] peddycb#5889

On the Chainzilla site there a guide to launching blockchains on Komodo.
At the bottom of the page there is a link to the source on the Komodo website, but the page is not working, it gives a 404 error: https://chainzilla.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/43000006423-how-to-create-a-komodo-assetchain

smartdust for CHIPS has been sent. for BTC it wont work to do smartdust as it is too expensive the txfee, so you will need to either submit a signed message from the old address or send some small amount from old address to the new one

[11-Jun-19 12:39 PM] miles#6381
Chips smartdust received and the numbers in the dust tally with balance. You are a machine!!!! Don’t have access to wallet for a couple of days but will be sent to claim address as soon as I do. Thank you again.

Hello, is there any support if you want to offer KMD as a means of payment in an online shop from germany?

[11-Jun-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
coinpayments.net supports KMD

[11-Jun-19 01:11 PM] skerberus#7584
if destination address of all assets and KMD are the same, is it sufficient to just send the "smartdust" of kmd or is it necessary to send smartdust for every asset?

[11-Jun-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it will require manual handling. if you want to be processed automatically (first batch), best to send the smartdust on each chain, and also to make the claim form

[11-Jun-19 01:12 PM] skerberus#7584
Ok, thanks

[11-Jun-19 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
if you already submitted claim for each coin or address, no need to submit again. one claim per coin/address is enough

[11-Jun-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
finished the batch for today, all refunds in happy state up to 77777 KMD has been made, almost 1.5 million KMD!

approx 400 refunds have been fully processed, approx 200 have only to make the transaction of sending the smartdust from old to new address, the rest have some inconsistency or is for a very large amount

also, whatever rewards that were also swept is being returned. however the rewards from the last few days it is in the sweep address is not being allocated as that is just too complex logic and the primary goal is to get everybody their funds back as soon as possible

Will I have to smartdust all my addresses? For each coin individually?

[11-Jun-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
plz, it will make it easier to process

[11-Jun-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise we need to do some error prone manual process

[11-Jun-19 02:09 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I've made transactions to my new wallet, because I was mining post sweep to it and had coins in there waiting

[11-Jun-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
only the smartdust tx is what is being looked for by the refund processor

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it is spent from the old address to the new and it matches claims data, it will be auto-refunded

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Ok what if I sent 1 big tx with the smartdust included

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Well if it was in a separate utxo I guess it wouldn't matter when it bundles then up in the new address

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
native ledger support when?

[11-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
;/

[11-Jun-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i check all vins for the smartdust utxo,

[11-Jun-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so if all funds were sent from old to new, it will work

[11-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
seriously tho, in case i haven't missed anything, why is native ledger support still not a thing? it's literally the only reason i haven't invested yet

[11-Jun-19 02:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
you mean claiming the 5% annual reward with ledger ? It's possible to do so

[11-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
without exposing private keys*

[11-Jun-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there are wallets with ledger support

[11-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
last time i checked one had to enter their private keys online to claim rewards

[11-Jun-19 02:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530

Two of my claims are not solved. How should I know if it's disputed?

[11-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
is there a list of wallets that support both ledger and claiming through atomiclabs?

[11-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
does atomiclabs have their own wallet? if so, why not use it?

[11-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
fair enough, would you be a doll and link me the verus agama wallet? don't wanna click on anything fishy

Komodo’s Lead Developer James ‘jl777’ Lee has pledged donate 500,000 KMD from his personal holdings to compensate users who lost their funds in this attack.

[11-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
holy cow, what a bro

[11-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
you gotta claim rewards once per month, right?

[11-Jun-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it stops accruing after a month

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
Or that, right

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
Fixed date or 30 days from last claim?

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
31 days from last claim

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
things like Feb are ignored

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
all months are assumed to have 31 days

[11-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
So just claim on every 15th and all is good?
