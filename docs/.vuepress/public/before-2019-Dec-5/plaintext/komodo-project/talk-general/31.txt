thank you

[18-Jul-18 05:26 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
who can modify the get-kmd page from the website?

[18-Jul-18 05:26 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Maybe we should remove HitBtc or at least put a bold red disclaimer on it

[18-Jul-18 05:26 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
There's a thread on r/komodoplatform from an user that has kmd locked without answers

[18-Jul-18 05:27 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
A google search turns up a lot of similar HitBtc horror stories, it looks a really shitty CEX

[18-Jul-18 05:31 AM] smellycouch#3071

hi there. "CAST YOUR VOTE FOR KOMODO TO BE LISTED ON KUCOIN" - is this still going on?

[18-Jul-18 07:56 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
no, on Kucoin website it says the vote lasted until july 15

[18-Jul-18 08:02 AM] RuiCC#6029
ok, tks. Didn't find it

@Bryan_Beus sorry to bother you. I’m just kinda lost. I’m looking for Benny and James.

[18-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hi bud

[18-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You should see him in the upper right corner, on the team list

[18-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c is his name.

[18-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you're looking to ask about how we got listed on exchanges, I don't think he would be the best person to ask. 

You'd need to ask Benny or ca333.

[18-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Bitcoin Benny

[18-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And @ca333

[18-Jul-18 08:09 AM] skadoosh1#2083
Awesome. Thanks for all the help 👍

Good luck! It was a pleasure meeting you. Thank you for reaching out.

本月将免费上市的2个硬币是KMD和VOT，投票会议将继续进行，8月18日将挑选另外2个投票率最高的硬币。对于这两个硬币的支持者，请与我联系。

[18-Jul-18 08:16 AM] 花果山#5224
The 2 coins that will be listed free of charge this month are KMD and VOT, the voting session will continue and on the 18th of August another 2 coins with the highest votes will be picked. To those supporters of these 2 coins please contact me.

Jan? That’s a bit away

[18-Jul-18 03:33 PM] PTYX#6840
The airdrop is happening on August 30th and the ico will be in January that's correct.

[18-Jul-18 03:34 PM] PTYX#6840
However, we are on boarding our first project and they will launch before us. So there are definitely some interesting projects coming to Komodo.

anyone who did bitconnect for any more money that they could afford to lose... darwin award, just saying.

[18-Jul-18 04:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my own mother did a similar thing, and could not be told... but didnt put in money she needed to live.

[18-Jul-18 04:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Are not the organisers of bitconnect already breaking existing laws... they certainly have enough of them to prosecute anyone at any time for any thing.

i'm waiting for him to verify his payout address

[18-Jul-18 05:27 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I didn’t mean it in a bad way @PTYX goodluck! Just with the amount of work you’ve been doing already, I would’ve assumed the ico would be sooner.

[18-Jul-18 05:34 PM] t10Wor#3816
@Angelina  @SHossain  Thank you SHossain for proccessing the payout. I was send the transaction ID and it looks good!!!! i really happy that you where able to help me out....will now go and maybe buy $500 KMD and start mining. thank you sooooo much!!!
