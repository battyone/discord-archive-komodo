Well done in this case

[14-Jul-18 07:13 PM] bogybogy#3962
I was watching a interview with CEO from binance today and he mentioned decentralised exchanges will be huge

[14-Jul-18 07:13 PM] bogybogy#3962
Anyway the guy is smart and I believe komodo didn't pay any fees to binance to be listed

[14-Jul-18 07:14 PM] ItsFlashtime#4842
Decentralized exchanges will be the future, Binance is also making their own DEX using BNB.

[14-Jul-18 07:14 PM] bogybogy#3962
True ...some rumors in the past that kmd are helping them

[14-Jul-18 07:15 PM] bogybogy#3962
Same with bitpanda exchange in Austria

[14-Jul-18 07:17 PM] ItsFlashtime#4842
Is anyone really tech savy about komodo, I want to ask about interoperability questions.

[14-Jul-18 07:18 PM] ItsFlashtime#4842
Is cross-chain smart contracts being planned to be across sub chains of Komodo or can it be applied with other protocols such as eth for example?

[14-Jul-18 07:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this was asked a few days ago

[14-Jul-18 07:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
from my understanding other coins as Btc or Eth would need to implement a new transaction type for full interoperability

[14-Jul-18 07:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
otherwise a transaction on them (but that coin must be notarized) could be used to trigger on action on a Kmd chain but not viceversa

[14-Jul-18 07:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I hope some dev can confirm if this is correct

[14-Jul-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
interop with existing chains would require some sort of BTC-> BTCinfo chain that is notarized to allow cross chain BTC -> KMD

the #1 coin apollo only had 3000+ yesterday and all of a sudden came up with 23000+ votes. KMD isn't even in top 50 anymore.

[14-Jul-18 08:04 PM] wookie#7663
do we even care at this point??

[14-Jul-18 08:06 PM] wookie#7663
the only coin on there that's legit top 100 on cmc is zcoin.

Elastos is great project also but agree, very few real good projects in top 50. Tbh, I have heard about 5 out if this list

just voted for Komodo üòÑ

[15-Jul-18 05:07 AM] kh4567#1136
I wonder how do they achive that.. maybe a bot is voting for them ?

[15-Jul-18 09:10 AM] KMD55#1455
Projects can win a vote by either having an airdrop, which includes voting. Or they have early investors w/very large pockets..

[15-Jul-18 09:41 AM] bogybogy#3962
Good morning

[15-Jul-18 09:42 AM] bogybogy#3962
Gents I find something which I believe can be related well to Komodo platform and I I do any mistake pls corect me thanks

[15-Jul-18 09:42 AM] bogybogy#3962
i believe that blockchains will rise and fall, and that there will be greater fragmentation before we see consolidation along vertical use case lines. And i believe that ultimately, decentralized apps will rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains.
In short, there isn‚Äôt going to be one clear-cut ‚Äúwinning blockchain‚Äù you can select for decentralized app development. Instead,  i  believe that the best way to future-proof your investment is to take a blockchain-agnostic approach, building decentralized apps on a platform that lets you interact with any blockchain .i believe in this so firmly that komodo  platform this way: integrating with all blockchain networks, and giving you the flexibility to quickly build decentralized apps with whichever blockchain meets your needs.
When your app needs to interact with other blockchains, you already have the inbuilt capabilities to do so‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven in a competitive situation when you can‚Äôt be told which blockchain it is. And rather than forcing you to deal with all the different development languages, they  simplified smart contract creation so you can use natural language expressions to automatically generate code.
As your business‚Äô and industry‚Äôs use of blockchain and smart contracts evolves, you have the ability to quickly respond to changing conditions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether creating new smart contracts, or interacting with entirely new blockchains.

[15-Jul-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, clearly we are headed to a future with millions of blockchains. a system that is able to manage that is needed

[15-Jul-18 11:56 AM] bogybogy#3962
Logical decentralization has the zero probability of system failure and can tolerate any accidental faults in the system. A attack aimed at disestablishing the system will have minimal or null effect on it. Lastly, a local system cannot act independently which also maximize the efficiency of the decentralized system as a whole.

[15-Jul-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
in #ask-jl777 there is a discussion about chain independence which also relates to what you write

[15-Jul-18 12:01 PM] bogybogy#3962
Thanks

You get rewards/interest for holding assets like DEX and SUPERNET right?  How does it work?  Do I need to claim the rewards somehow?  I have been holding for I guess 8-9 months now.  Thanks in advance.

Which branch should non-NNs be on? Dev, master, or dpow?

I was using dev, however I see dpow listed on https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/

Master I think

[15-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Alright#0419
depends on what you're doing

[15-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Alright#0419
Master is stable, but it might be missing some new features that dev has. Dev should always be relatively stable also

[15-Jul-18 04:13 PM] bishop#9773
Thanks, I'll stick with dev

[15-Jul-18 04:13 PM] bishop#9773
Got confused this morning when I popped in and saw an error regarding hdd space (still only 10% of the drive used) and then said to update to latest or resync the chain

[15-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
that seems to be the error telling you your db is corrupted

[15-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
in such case just a full resync fixes the issue

[15-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
as we re running dev branch for notary node, I think you can assume it's pretty stable. At least here I have no crashes or problem with it. Maybe someone will correct me but : master : what pools run, dev : what NN run, jl777 : experimental : used for tests and refining, for example the PoS contest that is live.

[15-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Had that error for no reason even on dev on one of my seed node, and a rebuild with latest dev / full resync made it, in fact this error was on every single asset, just don't forget to `git checkout dev ` then `git pull` then `make clean` then `./zcutil/build.sh -jX`  (X depending on your available threads)

[15-Jul-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, beta is a much less frequently updated branch, but is ahead of master and has most of the latest

[15-Jul-18 11:35 PM] DynamicPimp#0206
It's  been awhile since ivv been around are we still using barterdex or only hyperdex now?

Interesting developments in bitboost (formerly freemarket, and once affiliated with supernet), as they run up against the limitations of building an app on ETH. Time to return to their supernet roots?

I got some back as well, although I'm missing some kmd

[17-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
KMD was also sent to the address I was holding the BNTN, not the address I bought it from, so I think they are just refunding it with a fixed kmd price per bntn or something like that
