reorg 100 blocks, broadcast to as many peers as you can find, shuts down their nodes

[25-Jan-19 03:46 AM] Tek#5253
im seeing "prune"

[25-Jan-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
if you keep hashing both chains, I believe you can sustain the attack

[25-Jan-19 03:47 AM] Tek#5253
hmm

[25-Jan-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
should probably clarify that "killswitch" is hyperbolic

[25-Jan-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think it's intentionally like this

[25-Jan-19 03:52 AM] Tek#5253
i have to google translate hyperbolic ü§î

[25-Jan-19 03:53 AM] Tek#5253
I wonder if Dash is affected

[25-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Tek#5253
since they have masternode and some extra stuff

[25-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Alright#0419
zcash introduced that mechanism

[25-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Tek#5253
oh.

[25-Jan-19 04:14 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
hyperbole
: extravagant exaggeration (such as "mile-high ice-cream cones")

[25-Jan-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I put a limit to txsize at 200kb

[25-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I dont think the new 'attack' on monero is a real problem, and XMR is still the best privacy coin.   I definitely wouldnt dump it based on this, especially at the bottom of a bear market.   But of course, Komodo is also great and is cheap currently.  I'd be dumping something else to buy KMD, moneor is one of the few good coins to hold on to.

Monero + RingCT + BUlletproofs > zkSnarks imo.   Also the Monero dev team and research team is exceptional.  They have historically found and fixed flaws in their own code.     zksnarks is 2nd best imo.  I dont like the zcash dev tax but I am interested in other coins that use the tech which don't have that, so I will check out Pirate.  The dPoW is interesting, though I feel like my main investment in dPoW is to own Komodo.  I'm not convinced it actually completely works and provides bitcoin level security to other coins, though I think its very interesting and might work (and at the very least, its a PoW coin with an extra hurdle required to 51% attack, so its still more secure than some other low hash rate PoW coin.

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Is Pirate only purchaseable through komodo dex?

[25-Jan-19 11:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I dont see it on CMC

[25-Jan-19 11:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
So Pirate is ONLY z transactions?  Mandatory privacy?     That is good.  One flaw of zcash is that barely anyone does z transactions so there is a small pool for private transactions to hide in

[25-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
@Alexfrog both projects have their strengths. The only reason XMR continues to have such strong development is because the majority of devs bought around $2 and have been living off it since. Development relies on it continually going up where zcash doesn't. I'm not saying founder's reward is good, but objectively, it has served it's purpose.

[25-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
And yes, dpow does work, I can give you the knowledge to prove it yourself if you like

[25-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
XMR would be dead without initial DNM pumps IMO

[25-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
would have no one willing to develop it

[25-Jan-19 12:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
xmr had people willing to develop it in 2015 when it was worth 25 cents, it will alwys have people willing to develop it üòõ

[25-Jan-19 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
I know many of these people personally. They would not be able to devote nearly as much time to it if they couldn't live off selling it.

[25-Jan-19 12:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im sure its more rewarding when its valuable

[25-Jan-19 12:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
anyway,

[25-Jan-19 12:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
You guys being anti XMR just makes me less likely to invest more in komodo or pirate üòõ

[25-Jan-19 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
if you're lumping me in with the "anti XMR" crowd, please don't

[25-Jan-19 12:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I was reacting to his 'its a bad investment' üòõ

[25-Jan-19 12:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
XMR is the coin I am most sure about long term of everything, even more than btc

[25-Jan-19 12:07 PM] Alright#0419
I was an XMR maximalist until i saw XMR people trashing Jumblr in a telegram channel üòÇ

[25-Jan-19 12:07 PM] Alright#0419
and now look where I am

[25-Jan-19 12:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
people understanding XMR and liking it doesnt mean they understand something else enough to know if that coin is good

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its good to be inherently skeptical of every coin's claims until it thoroughly proves them to you

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you have to prove it yuorself

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or your doing it wrong

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
Agreed, want to pentest dpow?

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Try as hard as you can to break it

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so DPoW, what happens if someone manages to corrupt 51% of notary nodes?

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you cant

[25-Jan-19 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then its good

[25-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
with bribes/their own elected nodes that are bad/whatever

[25-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
notary nodes who cheat publicly ousted pretty much, good luck doing that though

[25-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it reminds me of DPoS somewhat, though better in that its still a PoW coin, nad its just for the snapshotting onto BTC

[25-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
what happens to a POW coin if you manage to corrupt 51% of pool ops?

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you still cant make invalid notarizations

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you can double spend it, obv üòõ

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you could stop notarizations

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
no double spends possible

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
ok

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
orders of magnitude less power than dPoS delegates

{Reactions}
‚òù (2) 

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so somoene who controls 33 notaries can only stop notorizing from occurring, and thats it?

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[25-Jan-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty much

[25-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and then you can 51% attack komodo, but everyone knows that they shouldnt trust it right now because no notary happened

{Reactions}
üëç üíØ 

[25-Jan-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but at that point, security degrades to a normal PoW network,yes. but the entire network knows notarizations stopped

[25-Jan-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
dpowconfs stays at 1 confirmation until valid notarizations resume

[25-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and then how do you recover the network from that state?

[25-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
can you replace bad notaries quickly if that happens?

[25-Jan-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
would require a hardfork

[25-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
k

[25-Jan-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so no big double spends, no funds lost. network a mess for a week

[25-Jan-19 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think there is enough KMD inexistance to bother buying/extorting enough nodes to do it

[25-Jan-19 12:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
right

[25-Jan-19 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
can give you a basic guide for selfish mining if you do actually want to pentest dpow, just pm me

[25-Jan-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is AFTER majority of notaries are corrupted. which is a very very unlikely scenario

[25-Jan-19 12:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah blackjok3r, we are thinking of the hypothetical worst case here, to test dpow

{Reactions}
üëç 

[25-Jan-19 12:14 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if the worst case is we do a hard thing, to turn komodo into a standard pow coin, then its still inherently better than a normal pow coin of whatever hashrate it has, at least

[25-Jan-19 12:15 PM] Alexfrog#1338
and also, you get a warning when that happens, so people know to watch out for a 51% attack/double spend on the komodo pow, so thats another benefit

[25-Jan-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and most exchanges automatically stop processing deposits during network events as confirmations stays at 1

üÜí 

[25-Jan-19 12:16 PM] Alexfrog#1338
right

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its probably the most promising alternate consensus algorithm

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
imo

[25-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah

[25-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i like the Komodo is also PoW be default, youre not relying totally on some unproven thing

[25-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If Ethereum goes to PoS, I dont know whats going to happen

[25-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it will test PoS harder than its been tested so far, thats for sure

[25-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Ive always been vary wary of the chain bloat in Eth, which is another reason Komodo is very interesting

[25-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Alexfrog#1338
It definitely feels like putting all these app tokens on side/child chains is the way to ahve a platform, not everything main chain like eth

[25-Jan-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
#kmdlabs  is using hybrid PoS and PoW chains wiht dPoW

[25-Jan-19 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
These seem to be the msot secure...

[25-Jan-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant see how anything that requires to put everything in a single chain can scale, the txfees, the TB disk space, GB/sec bandwidth to sync... so many problems

[25-Jan-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so they decide to unscramble the omelette instead

[25-Jan-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems to be a pretty difficult problem.

[25-Jan-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
much simpler to not scramble all the eggs in the first place

I dislike how most of the XMR community only likes XMR and says everything else sucks

[25-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Tek#5253
also somewhere above someone said that zksnarks is not better than ringct+stealth+bulletproofs

[25-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Tek#5253
but it is.

[25-Jan-19 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I see the ZEC+forks and XMR+forks world as 2 different, competing, research + development labs, trying to improve on the lack of privacy in Bitcoin. It's good to have both, and it's ok that each side thinks their tech is better. As long as both sides keep improving, we have more secure/private options than BTC alone

[25-Jan-19 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you could compare them to Bell Labs and Xerox PARC

[25-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
yeah both are nice tbh

[25-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
