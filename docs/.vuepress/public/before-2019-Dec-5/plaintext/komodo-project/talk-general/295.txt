@tramp your twitter account appear to be bought hacked accounts that have existed that have existed for longer than " last year only" as you say

[11-May-19 06:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What do people have to gain by acting like this towards lydia?  If you‚Äôre right, it will vet itself out.  If you‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs really irritating especially if you‚Äôre the person who everyone claiming is fake. 

Meritocracy 100%.  Let her earn her way and stop being a roadblock.

@FishyGuts  let's invite her to the pirate Monday evenings talks, not many girls pirates on board :pirate:

[11-May-19 06:24 AM] tramp#0851
@FishyGuts  thnx, but now my network don't will build on assetchain and General techologies. I will make a hardfork of the network and  will develop my platform separately from Komodo.

[11-May-19 06:25 AM] tramp#0851
How say @klein : let that talk for it self

[11-May-19 06:26 AM] Mark81#4505
She's is imposter. How will you make sure that your network us now secured in hardfork?

@tramp your project has a much better chance of success with komodo support and you know it.  dont be vindictive just because people here are really good at figuring things out.

[11-May-19 06:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@tramp  do you claim to work for IBM

[11-May-19 06:30 AM] Mark81#4505
In komodo network is secured with dPow. How you're going to resolve that in hardfork?

[11-May-19 06:33 AM] tramp#0851
@Mark81  Whithout dPOW, at first asic's resistance and cloudmining resistance, merge protection. About the rest of the will learn later. I don't need dPOWüòã

Nice to meet you @tramp . Sorry i had to exposed you.

[11-May-19 06:42 AM] tramp#0851
@polycryptoblog  I can, only then I'll have to resign for breach of contract. Why would I? For you? You can consider that there is NO, you so easier will.

[11-May-19 06:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@tramp  sharpen your social engineer skills.  Your profile(s) have listed you as working at IBM , if breach of contract was a concern you would not have listed it,  your nonsensical response is an attempt at sidestepping my question

[11-May-19 07:04 AM] LocoMB#8593
@tramp - you must understand: there have been sooo many really ugly scams and frauds, that every crypto community is extremely afraif of sucht hings

[11-May-19 07:04 AM] LocoMB#8593
esp. Komodo has had some realllly ugly things happening in the past before it was Komodo

[11-May-19 07:04 AM] Mark81#4505
@tramp Please tweet something right now on your account So we know its really you..

[11-May-19 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
once such things have happened, nobody wants to experience this again

[11-May-19 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
ah - good point

[11-May-19 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
in crypto in general, fraud is soooo rampant and takes on sooo many forms, the slightest sign of fraud ausually means- it IS fraud..

[11-May-19 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
I'll digf up a good example, sec

[11-May-19 07:08 AM] LocoMB#8593

I have the precedent scam which we all want to avoid, but I am not sue if I even want to drag it up here- anyone knows what I am referring to?

[11-May-19 07:14 AM] az#1921
There are so many things wrong about you @tramp (if you are the one from twitter of course). First, you changed both twitter and LinkedIn pp but not the ResearchGate one. My guess is: you don't have access to this account, you just stole info and pp from it.  (you used the RR profile pic before). Second, you are not able to give us any proof you are from IBM., which should be so easy if it was true. So no need to cry here or on twitter. Move on and try to scam another project. And a real researcher would never act and react like you did.

[11-May-19 07:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Welcome to our home chat @tramp 
Nice to see you here finally.

[11-May-19 07:22 AM] tramp#0851

@grewalsatinder  hi

[11-May-19 07:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To me it doesn't matter if you or anyone else working in IBM or wherever else. I'd love to see komodo tech used for projects this way or another. Feel free to fork and make it your own from fork.

[11-May-19 07:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
@tramp you must understand that things like this can DESTROY a cryptocurrency- any kind of other project too at that..

[11-May-19 07:26 AM] dukeleto#7326

[11-May-19 07:37 AM] tramp#0851
The Ricardian contract to create easy to CC, the question is how it will be stored. Centralized server link - no. Here we decided to use nodes. A kind of security nodes zencash giving rewards and synchronizing contracts.  The rest I can't say yet. Thank you for listening.

Your researchgate is still full of publication which don't belong to you, so no, not good yet.

[11-May-19 07:45 AM] tramp#0851
@az I will work on it

[11-May-19 07:45 AM] ca333#0118
@tramp - for cryptos sake (you ve already noticed we have a clever community with a triple layer tinfoil hat on) - plz dont start justifying the mess you created. So for now best is to not speak about that anymore but rather apologize, focus on the tech-side of things and proofing your claims. I am sure you understand that its hard for us to trust you after:

a) you have used someone else profile pictures, name and even bio on all of your social media profiles - DONT you dare to compare this to me using a penguin or someone else using a bear profile pic. Yes they do exist as well - but dont have a unique socialID and name. so that move was 1) illegal and 2) xtremly unethical. Just for the protocol: you have pretended to be Elke Schroth: https://www.bellevuehill.ch/%C3%BCber-mich/ !!! Dont try to turn it now - thats the wrong way. Apologize and hope to not meet ban-hammer or pwny-pengiun.
 
b) even after we revealed this you kept claiming to have that name and you didn't  bother to change the stolen biography! 

c) and your post above ref. Ricardian contract is just :troll_hmm: 

d) i will add e), f) and g) if you keep going that way.

point is: this is not something someone picks up en passant while doing other things- these are lifetime commitments

@tramp you can always tell to @ca333  what he did dm you via twitter to prove first that you are same entinity.

[11-May-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
So it looks like obvious falsification attempt on `L. Shafer` initials

how about Kathode types?!?! vacuum rigs?
