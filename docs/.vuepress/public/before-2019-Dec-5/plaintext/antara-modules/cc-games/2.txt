Created game, registered

[26-Mar-19 07:50 PM] TonyL#3577
The screen is flickering very hard - maybe it's because I'm playing via ssh. Building on local machine now

[26-Mar-19 07:53 PM] TonyL#3577
On local PC it's flickering but not so hard

[26-Mar-19 08:03 PM] TonyL#3577
`You finished with 2100 points on level 2.`

[26-Mar-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can post extract rpc call I can debug it

[26-Mar-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
In replay blocks just falling on middle

[26-Mar-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577

i need a non-zero points game

[26-Mar-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
You finished with 2100 points on level 2.

[26-Mar-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Mar-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
In this game

[26-Mar-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
But in replay blocks just falling on center

[26-Mar-19 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Do you need one more or this one is enough?

[26-Mar-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
one is enough

[26-Mar-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed fix. all rpc other than bailout and highlander should work

[26-Mar-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the rpc interface is close enough to rogue, the rogue TUI will work with tetris

[26-Mar-19 09:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it seems so - just have to change executable name from `rogue` to `tetris`

[26-Mar-19 09:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try it now ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
also, bailout and highlander might actually work

[26-Mar-19 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
cashout is set to points * level * 1000 satoshis

[26-Mar-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe there is no need to multiply by level as higher levels pay more points

[26-Mar-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Changed `rogue` to `tetris` and `ROGUE` to `GTEST`  - checking if TUI will work ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it should make a keystrokes tx every level

[26-Mar-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i see many messages coming in!

[26-Mar-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess I need to add some sort of realtime replay

[26-Mar-19 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
```Game over!

spooky

[26-Mar-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it just worked?

[26-Mar-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it seems so ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
`and is 1500 points a good game, no idea how to calibrate the payout` - 1500 it's not very hard actually

[26-Mar-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
no validation yet, but good to know bailout worked. I wonder if multiplayer works

[26-Mar-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a 3-4 minutes game

[26-Mar-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so payout might be ok

[26-Mar-19 09:38 PM] TonyL#3577
balance: 0.06309999

[26-Mar-19 09:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Balance increased

[26-Mar-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
lets get multiplayer sorted. the gamesCC code base is almost the same as rogue, i just removed all rogue specifics (or most of it even though data structures is still using rogue stuff)

[26-Mar-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you are running another node, you might see a bunch of messages

[26-Mar-19 09:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Is player who earned more points winner in multiplayer?

[26-Mar-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, I guess that is what we need to do, will think about how to figure that out

[26-Mar-19 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, because not much sense in "who bailout last" system in tetris ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Building second node

[26-Mar-19 09:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Or better will make second rogue node first from bootstrap and test rogue multiplayer

[26-Mar-19 09:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And tetris multiplayer can test when will be points coparison multiplayer system for it

[26-Mar-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe rogue can use that system too?

[26-Mar-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise an immortal can race to the amulet and back out to win

[26-Mar-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I think rogue needs two gameplay modes

[26-Mar-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
If players wants to race on immortals - it's "collectioner mode"

[26-Mar-19 09:44 PM] TonyL#3577
If players wants something sportsman-like - it's "competition mode" and only fresh warriors are allowed (other words registration with playertxid not allowed)

[26-Mar-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, that is really easy to do

[26-Mar-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and it matches tetris, which has no playerdata

[26-Mar-19 09:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Some points/best gold result I've proposed before and it can be an interesting game mode as well

[26-Mar-19 09:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Also timelimited ones

[26-Mar-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
And I think I can print in realtime all players extracts and timer

[26-Mar-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be dramatic ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
After block X keystrokes just stops to accept to extract

[26-Mar-19 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the baseline is working much better now

[26-Mar-19 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's say you can choose timelimit ( in blocks to make easy) on multiplayer game creation - after this block keystrokes stops to accept and bailout based on extracts executed

[26-Mar-19 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all such changes wont be that hard, but now that rogue and tetris are running mostly the same code, it feels needed to make a games plugin and have rogue and tetris plugin to the same games CC

[26-Mar-19 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Player who have most gold on extract - winner

[26-Mar-19 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all such variations of who wins can then be added once to the games CC and all the games inherit

[26-Mar-19 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool, #cc-games opening new horizons  ðŸ˜ƒ
