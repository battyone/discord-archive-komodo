Can you check tokenbalance from that node where are you trying bind?

Reproduced on my side also (latest FSM), before on a little out-dated (built from FSM with commits around March 6) daemon it worked fine

seems like we have some conflicting commits going on if that is the case. we need to do a full regression test to make sure nothing else has broken

[10-Mar-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
for all the CC

[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Tests passing - seems nothing really bad happened (in regtest mode at least)

[10-Mar-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Just interesting - we had issue with same prints in september (tokenconvert was in flow this time)

@dimxy has anything been changed with tokens recently?

I cannot check this now, will do it in couple of hours

Hmm created new chain on latest jl777 (trying to isolate it now)
On mining node (no any daemon prints):

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I think you are not on latest FSM, looking at your printout I cannot see those in the code so it must be some older version.
Pull latest FSM and try, and also now the printout has a debug category so start the KMD daemon with -debug=gatewayscc to get gateways print

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I see in the end that you are on FSM and it seems on latest commit. But please rebuild the daemon it may be on some older code...

will try again tomorrow on completely frsh vps, on fresh chain.

[11-Mar-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I setup fresh chain on latest FSM with only my nodes in it and binded 1of1 GW succesfully @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator :

[11-Mar-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
I did it from node which not mine (transferred coins from mining node to it)

[11-Mar-19 02:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I rebuilt daemons without `CONFIGURE_FLAGS='CPPFLAGS=-DTESTMODE' flag

[11-Mar-19 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try now to do the same but with daemons built with such flag

will update once mine is up and running with fresh chain

[12-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator You're definitevly on wrong version. Perhaps some other komodod is in your path and it is using that one intead of latest. Try to rebuild the source and start it with ./komodod from komodo source dir.

[12-Mar-19 10:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just about to start again, new VPS, FMS built zcash params almost downloaded

[12-Mar-19 10:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
apologies for confusion, was using established VPS with LABS chains on, but used different folder for FSM, and ./komodod from fsm/src folder so thought it should work

[12-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well, the chain should not affect it if you are starting from beginning. Probably the VPS was using some other daemon from path... It should be fine now on new VPS, but basically there is no need to make everything fresh, you should be able just to use latest FSM and start daemon from there...

[12-Mar-19 10:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is it safe to use older vps to mine new chain on launch?

[12-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Mihailo#5902
You can use any VPS you want, but you must be on same version of KMD daemon on that node

[12-Mar-19 10:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, might be cause of issue before... will maintain 2 completely clean vps for testing just in case.

[12-Mar-19 10:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
When you broadcast the tx, if the two nodes differently validate the tx one may reject it. And then you have fork....

[12-Mar-19 10:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had symlinks to komodod on other vps, thought was running ./ in FSM maybe did it wrong

[12-Mar-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
I advice to not use symlinks for komodod on testing machines because usually many different komodods needed

@Smk-High  This usually happens when TX is created and broadcasted later but the default number of blocks when it expires passes. I think it is 60 by default. Did you get this on broadcasting gatewatsdeposit?

I'm gonna do it a few more times to get the hang of it.

[13-Mar-19 12:23 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and make some notes on the way so I dont forget...

[13-Mar-19 12:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
After that, I suggest you try multisig gateways. There will be more stuff to learn, and ofc more stuff to go wrong üòõ

tbh, some bits werent working and then they did, and I wasn't sure why lol. could be waiting for confs, but I switched around pubkeys a bit too.

made it work, but keen to make sure I know *how and why* it works

pubkey not given as a param returns different address/balance to if pubkey param is `""`

also same as if no pubkey given, so odd one out is empty quotes

[17-Mar-19 06:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is this expected behavior? if so please enlighten me üëΩ

[17-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
no args defaults to the -pubkey

[17-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
having an arg means it uses what is passed in as a pubkey, in this case 0000000000... 00000 is my guess

[17-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the code has different behavior based on number of parameters

[17-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a parameter, it parses it

@Mihailo the claimvout value usind in gateways deposit -  in docs it says, `on the first use, this value should be 0`.
Does this value increment for subsequent uses?

[18-Mar-19 12:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
@@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator No, that is wrongly said. It will always be 0.

Btw if it const - why is it using as call argument?

[18-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Well, I've just looked at the code. It could be variable, but we made it to be 0 and the marker to be the vout.1 in the docs and always used it like that. So you can put any vout, and the sentence `on the first use, this value shoule be 0` was meant when you start using gateways, until you figure out everything lets keep this at 0 üòâ
