jl777 branch and repo on latest works, but only with 2 nodes

[24-Feb-19 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it gets extemlly complicated with more than 2, and the daemon has a bug where you will get stuck after the `commit` step

[24-Feb-19 07:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to test, so that I can make it included in my kmdgo package 🙂

[24-Feb-19 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
testing also makes things clearer and gives more ideas how it can be used in different usecases

[24-Feb-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool. its reasonably easy for 2 nodes... I had some trouble early on, but the example and gcharngs docs will clear those up well.

[24-Feb-19 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also I have not been involved in testing for much long, so trying to do it

[24-Feb-19 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
test is a lot of fun, that I missed, while busy learning go language

[24-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
me either really, so much time on labs, got pretty good at C++/C in that time though.

[24-Feb-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its good to be able to test and also debug it, so james has more time to write more contracts 😄

[24-Feb-19 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
testing is what got me so much involved in SuperNET at the first place that I quit my day job! 😄

[24-Feb-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... Havent worked a "real job" for so long now, it would be difficult to go back to it lol

[24-Feb-19 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree mate

[24-Feb-19 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
isn't it possible to just copy the cclib.cpp file to the komodoplatform repo which compiles on mac?

[24-Feb-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh... I guess it wont' be just that simple

[24-Feb-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are more dependency files

[24-Feb-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
alright, making more vm then

[24-Feb-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a bug fix needed to handle more than 3 pubkeys in the jl777 repo?

[24-Feb-19 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so yes.

[24-Feb-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my repo's fix doesnt seem like a good way to go about it for multiple nodes.

[24-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the steps `commit`, `nonce` and `partialsig` where the data is swapped between all nodes, needs to make sure that all the data is in there before creating the next hash.

[24-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did it by sending each lot of data in exact order and only generateing hash on the last node.

[24-Feb-19 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure in real world thats practical...

[24-Feb-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It should just check to make sure all feilds are populated somehow.

[24-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
is that restriction for nonce only, or also partial sigs?

[24-Feb-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I can add a counter at the required steps and only do the combine after all are there

[24-Feb-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I ended up adding it for all 3 of those steps, not 100% sure if it needs it for all, but I know 100% that it works when used for all.

[24-Feb-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to generate nonce, you need all commits. Pretty sure to generate partialsig you need all nonce, and to generate the combined sig, you need all partial sig.

[24-Feb-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doesnt check this currently and as such gives wrong outputs.

[24-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will add this

[24-Feb-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I found my node 1 got komodod died after command `commit`

[24-Feb-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn't had it run with gdb, started it again

[24-Feb-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just execute `commit` command agian or start from `session` command ?

[24-Feb-19 09:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
started from session again

[24-Feb-19 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, executed nonce command on node 1 and it died just by executing it.

[24-Feb-19 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
found git pull had updates

[24-Feb-19 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna compile that again

[24-Feb-19 10:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

without that gdb , it works

[24-Feb-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810

clear them or maybe continue or something like that

I think I did something wrong.....

[24-Feb-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I used 0 on node 1

[24-Feb-19 10:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the example commands says 1

[24-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes thats the bug I encountered

[24-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your trying to do something when it doesnt have the required data

[24-Feb-19 10:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead of erroring out, it just crashes

[24-Feb-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I couldnt figure out how to check if the data was there or not so worked around the issue, with executing the commands in an excact specified order using a python script

[24-Feb-19 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to really pay attention to what order things are done. One tip I will give you is that the 3 steps to trade data are all the same RPC call, so just use the absh history and change the single hash, along with the name of the cclib call.

[24-Feb-19 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, this time it gave at least errro instead of crashing komodod

[24-Feb-19 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```$ musig-cli cclib nonce 18 '["fdc05d65d1de360fe09ffb53fd51b4e52f4138860e0f49bff03654c39749a850",1,"0206e0a0528cd7d9218f0c1999394c242058d793e89147edfe0576f9d93d55ae21"]'

changed 0 to 1, as per examples for node 1 command

[24-Feb-19 10:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not using script, just manually copy/pasting commands in VM after editing it on my host sublime editor 😛

[24-Feb-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah, I did that the first time. its took me 4-5 goes and nearly a whole day just to get 1 sucessful spend 😅

[24-Feb-19 10:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[24-Feb-19 10:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yea, it's my first time right now with these API calls 😛

[24-Feb-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one fixed bug and made script did  a spend of 100 pubkeys in a couple of minutes.

[24-Feb-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
dilithium support is almost complete.there is detailed comments explaining how to do a dilithium signing at the end of the dilithium algo code and before the dilithium CC code in dilithium.c
everything other than the actual spend is working

OK, added guards so that you can now do the commit, nonce, partial in any order as long as you are not duplicating for the same ind

👌 

[24-Feb-19 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
🤔 I was doing nonce after session -> commit -> nonce.

[24-Feb-19 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonnna compile with any updates and try again

[24-Feb-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
session, commit, commit, commit..., then nonce, nonce, nonce, ...

[24-Feb-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes need all commits to be able to generate a nonce

[24-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
need all nonces to be able to do a partial sig

[24-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
need all partial sigs to be able to do a combined sig

[24-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
think multisig in three stages. all participants need to do each stage until you can start the next stage

[24-Feb-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the dilithium is much easier, as it is the normal keypair model

[24-Feb-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, was doing the same.
I execute command one node 1 till command `calcmsg`

after than, execute command `session` on node 1, and save the `commitment` output
then execute `session` on node 2, and save the `commitment` output in text file

then make the `commit` command based on the previous output and execute on node 1, and save the `nonce` output
and make the `commit` command based on previous session output and execute on node 2, and save the `nonce` output

and then execute `nonce` command on node 1 and there I got that error and status outputs.

[24-Feb-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[24-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Feb-19 11:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
