I died early. üòÑ

[27-Feb-19 11:13 AM] ronyi#5719
I quit in lvl 14 (with 1700 exp)and I see my warrior doungen lvl 5 and exp 1062.

[27-Feb-19 11:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I imagine someone will make a betting dapp to bet on tournaments and even games at some point.  
Seems I would have lost a few KMD with your early death @ronyi  :yassinheartbroken:

[27-Feb-19 11:19 AM] ronyi#5719
I think betting dapp is good, maybe Rogue betting dapp? üòÑ but i never betting

[27-Feb-19 11:19 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I was last standing, so I quit at the end. The other two died. Take your time. I won't mess with it more.

[27-Feb-19 11:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Imagine something that could cover many blockchain games...

[27-Feb-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
rogue multiplayer is a betting dapp already

[27-Feb-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
until I fix the keystrokes reliability, keystrokes and thus game status will be unreliable

They mean external parties betting on the players.

[27-Feb-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
oh... yes it would be possible

[27-Feb-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
bet on your favorite player to win sort of thing?

[27-Feb-19 11:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes

[27-Feb-19 11:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Aye.

[27-Feb-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I will think about how to do this

[27-Feb-19 11:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
As far as a broad eSports betting book.... that's been a popular thing to try and do .... and ICO. I still haven't seen one though.

[27-Feb-19 11:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Imagine sports results could be oraclized.  But these games have the proof and info right there already.

[27-Feb-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
bets would need to be placed after all are registered and before any are finished

[27-Feb-19 11:22 AM] ronyi#5719
double or nothing?

[27-Feb-19 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, before finished.  But if possible to adjust maybe up untill the final 2?

[27-Feb-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the betting would go into a betpool of all the bets. all the ones that bet on the winner would be able to split it

That would probably draw many into the ecosystem.  People who might not be otherwise.

salty bet was very popular a few years back

[27-Feb-19 12:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I wonder if there are  any good surviving ones.

[27-Feb-19 12:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I feel like people/companies realize how tough that industry is to be legitimate .... and back out.

[27-Feb-19 12:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe DBET will come through.  Maybe JL will whip up something in a weekend before everyone else.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

@ronyi e99ff21564d45e63d10ad71c7c51cd2345ffa79a91791ca2de14542f35d628d3 replay shows you died on level4,likely due to keystrokes of level5 not properly received and using the next levels keystrokes on the wrong level. very likely death results

[27-Feb-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the keystrokes reliability monster strikes again

[27-Feb-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i am still working on fixing it

[27-Feb-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I have pushed various fixes that should make multiplayer mode more reliable. keep a close eye on the numplayers and numalive, openslots fields to make sure it is sane. some complications due to 60 blocks expiration for registration and extending keystrokes

So I can sacrifice another warrior to multiplayer if anyone wants to try.

[27-Feb-19 01:18 PM] ronyi#5719
I think this was a trap. (maybe), but not dead on level4. Thank you.

[27-Feb-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, it could be that something about the gameplay looks like death. hard to reproduce. I will hopefully have reliable keystrokes later today

[27-Feb-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@ronyi I implemented a first level keystrokes reliability. you need to make clean and make the rogue dapp in addition to rebuilding komodod. let me know if it works more reliably

[27-Feb-19 02:53 PM] ronyi#5719
jl777 branch or FSM?

[27-Feb-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777

[27-Feb-19 03:13 PM] ronyi#5719
Hmm. 
1. make clean
2. git checkout jl777
3. git pull
4. ./makerogue
5. build
6. Game started with TUI and can not move and quit. I started the game with old warrior. Warrior HP 12(1).

good. as a side effect,it also reduces latency and can have as frequent as one keystrokes tx per level

[27-Feb-19 06:21 PM] joe2x4#5987
I think I hosed my files trying to update. Is there any file that can be backed up that contains my rogue coins and warriors?

[27-Feb-19 06:22 PM] joe2x4#5987
Probably need to start from scratch.

[27-Feb-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain has them

[27-Feb-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you have privkey for your pubkey, all is saved
