if so, which value

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm getting ```error code: -22
error message:

```

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
likely due to cut and paste error

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe in hex missing some symbols because it was pasted in two messages

[15-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or CRLF added?

[15-Mar-19 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
I concatenated /n 😃

[15-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or /n added?

[15-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that would cause a parse error

[15-Mar-19 08:24 AM] TonyL#3577

what does extract of that game return?

Maybe some OSX non-det

non-det as problem with my bundle

not-compatible rogue/daemon for example 🤔

But there is a hello kitty bug protection - strange

[15-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
negative vout means negative cashout, but that assumes it is vout2 that was wrong...

@jl777c Is this fix can affect many games / hardforking one?

not hardfork, should fix the malformed bailouts

[15-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL  I did get windows set up on both machines yesterday. Warriors are not saving on windows at all.

[15-Mar-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist Hmm, are you getting actual progress (dungeon level, experience, gold) in `export` prints?

[15-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep printout below 
I also (in game)made sure to kill at least one monster and get gold, then went for two monsters and gold with the same results

Oh, 21 gold it's 4410 satoshi

[15-Mar-19 02:44 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a fix for games with less than 10000 satoshies reward - but it's not in bundles yet

[15-Mar-19 02:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, So should I try to get above 10k sats  and see if the warrior saves for now?

[15-Mar-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
We have to check if latest  fix resolves wookies issue. And if it's fine now - I'll update bundles

[15-Mar-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist yes please - for games with rewards >10000 sat bailout should work

[15-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If I can make it that far with a fresh start.

[15-Mar-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Rewards calculating as: ```rogueshis = gold * gold * level * 10```

[15-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
super hard mode activated.  
Maybe ill start with an older address

[15-Mar-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
So 10000 satoshies not so long game - even 50 gold on level 2  - it's 50000 rogueshis already

[15-Mar-19 02:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok. I saw you guys talk about the level  calculation changes a bit, just to make sure I understand fully, Dungeon level 3 exit would be a higher amount of rogue than Dungeon level two, with the same amount of gold ? 
For 50 Gold on dungeon level 2
 50* 50 * 2* 10 = 50000
For 50 Gold on dungeon level 3
50* 50 * 3 * 10=75000

I belive so. 
SO i restarted and now my very first warrior is here

[15-Mar-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe just bailout transaction was not mined when you checked your warrior list

[15-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
and needed to restart the tui, the first warrior was from yesterday

[15-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I played 3 other games on this machine i believe

[15-Mar-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats strange, TUI not caching anything anywhere - just requesting data again when you calling menu item

[15-Mar-19 03:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Also, the warrior that saved was the only one I entered N to wait, when asked.

[15-Mar-19 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
If some warriors not saving - could you please check if bailout was broadcasted on chain?

Nice to hear! I'll publish fresh bundles with fix for these low gold exits soon

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds like the occasional last keystrokes missing is the only issue now

[16-Mar-19 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, very little keystrokes for one last level or not counted death from icemonster let's say

[16-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
always the icemonster. maybe there is an edgecase there

[16-Mar-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Death from hyperthermia is RNG based - maybe it's changing the seed

[16-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see anything strange in the death by icemonster path

[16-Mar-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe it's just same "last keystrokes lost" issue - just death focusing attention on it

[16-Mar-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577

Its exciting to see gameplay get fine tuned!  Seems like its closer to bug free. Maybe back to dex and multiplayer items next?
We had an issue with the sale of a warrior not showing up ages ago, i don't recall that being worked on. Also an issue with us playing three player, I won and lost my warrior.

```Maybe back to dex and multiplayer items next?

[17-Mar-19 03:40 AM] TonyL#3577
And its extracted progress for dl3 in ronyi game, so all keystroke tx were mined in order - just some last key presses missed in replay what caused not matching of gold amounts. So I think its reproducing of this last remained known bug

Last frame in replay "you're frozen by icemonster"

It don't have Qy in the end. 
Also what is sucpicious ronyi locally have empty ```rogue.2957615466801226752.2``` by some reason (but died on lvl1) - maybe it's the clue.

@jl777c https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jxW9qxk3QF/ is it fine that seed changing more than 10 times in single dungeon level game? I'm checking mine replays and seed changing only once per room or so
