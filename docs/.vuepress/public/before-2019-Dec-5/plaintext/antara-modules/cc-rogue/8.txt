Advice you to prepare some super brave warriors for future multiplayer battles

[12-Feb-19 01:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Working on it haha

[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if i bailed should i have a character to use?

[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] TonyL#3577
To save character just quit from game not dead (Q + y)

[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI will broadcast bailout transaction automatically

[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] TonyL#3577
And then as soon as this transaction mined warrior will be in your list (you can check list anytime by `2` TUI menu item)

[12-Feb-19 01:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Got a time out after pressing [2] for players ?

[12-Feb-19 01:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Now requesting Rogue RPC

[12-Feb-19 01:55 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have any warriors in list - menu item [3] of TUI automatically will ask you (after new game transaction mine) do you want choose any warrior to go with

[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
seems it crashed my deamon

[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Daemon hanged after you pressed [2] ?

[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah

[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then try to run rogue tui again no rpc connection

[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm `[2]` just calling `cclib players 17`

[12-Feb-19 01:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it some situation when some transaction isn't mined yet

[12-Feb-19 01:58 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ill have to restart and try it again

[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Daemon is on deadlock

[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
You can try to `pkill -15 komodod`

[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
didnt kill it

[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
And then check `pgrep komodod` if any komodod is alive

[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I see, I've supposed to reboot my node also to kill it

[12-Feb-19 02:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah hard resetting now

[12-Feb-19 02:00 PM] TonyL#3577
You played game before pressed [2] ?

[12-Feb-19 02:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah

[12-Feb-19 02:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i died maybe that was it

[12-Feb-19 02:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
1 bailed out 2 died 3 called for players and crashed

[12-Feb-19 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
1 bailed out - you mean exited from rogue without death?

[12-Feb-19 02:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yes

[12-Feb-19 02:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then entered and died

[12-Feb-19 02:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then pressed 2 to check players

[12-Feb-19 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
back up and running after crash now - restart solved

[12-Feb-19 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying to reproduce

[12-Feb-19 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ill try again also

[12-Feb-19 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw if you exited once without death now you should be able to choose warrior to go dungeon with

[12-Feb-19 02:05 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok , then if i just started a game as normal would that give me that player?

[12-Feb-19 02:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, just start by [3] as usual

[12-Feb-19 02:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
so thats what i did then died.

[12-Feb-19 02:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
retunr to menu and pressed 2 - hanged and crashed

[12-Feb-19 02:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i obvs shouldnt have had a character as he died

[12-Feb-19 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
If after survival trial you played again and died without warrior choose it means that previous bailout wasn't mined yet - I guess it caused the crash

[12-Feb-19 02:07 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Right ok ,

[12-Feb-19 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
When bailout with alive warrior is mined it will ask like this

[12-Feb-19 02:07 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i have just bailed again so ill enter again in a minute

[12-Feb-19 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, I can add to TUI waiting for bailout transaction mining to get back into main menu

[12-Feb-19 02:15 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe a standard countdown ?

[12-Feb-19 02:15 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"returning to menu in 30 secs ......"]

[12-Feb-19 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
If transaction not mined in 30 seconds waiting will not have sense - it's easy to check if transaction in mempool each X seconds and print "Waiting for transaction to be mined" (same as when you start new game)

[12-Feb-19 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Makes sense

[12-Feb-19 02:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive just timed out again

[12-Feb-19 02:17 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
just after a regular death this time

[12-Feb-19 02:17 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
3 new game - hangs time out

[12-Feb-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Will add waiting for `bailout` transaction mining now to check if it will help make things stable

[12-Feb-19 02:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
k. ive killed it let me know when u added ill update

[12-Feb-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh hanged on my side:
```Something went wrong.
(28, 'Operation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received')```

[12-Feb-19 02:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i died b4 i could bail lol

[12-Feb-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
As I understand it happens on very short games on `bailout` transaction attempt

[12-Feb-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Played whole day - no issues (but games were never less than block), now entered dungeon, moved fast to lvl2 and exited with bailout transaction (all took 20 second or so) and daemon hanged

[12-Feb-19 02:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive just bailed on lvl 3

[12-Feb-19 02:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
timed out

[12-Feb-19 02:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Seems it didnt send a tx - http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RP48H2AupnnSaLqwL1aN8ddk2KcFzQZcni

[12-Feb-19 02:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That killed it , hanging again

[12-Feb-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I see, so daemon deadlocking on `bailout gametxid` transaction sending attempt in some cases

[12-Feb-19 02:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah tht tx never went

[12-Feb-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to wait one block before send `bailout` to ensure that keystrokes mined

[12-Feb-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Added such check - testing

[12-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@CryptoNinjaa could you please update TUI and try now?

[12-Feb-19 03:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yes ill try now

[12-Feb-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Played few fast games - `bailout` seems broadcast if wait for a next block. Now waiting for a `bailout` transaction to be mined seems like overkill but from other hand it will help to avoid the questions like a "why I don't see warrior in warriors list"

[12-Feb-19 04:26 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
im getting time outs just after dying and pressing continue :/

[12-Feb-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you replace TUI files in `src` folder?

[12-Feb-19 04:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
does the belwo replace?

[12-Feb-19 04:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
cp -r * ~/komodo/src

[12-Feb-19 04:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[12-Feb-19 04:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah did that then

[12-Feb-19 04:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ill clone again and replace again .
