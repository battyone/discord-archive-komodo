I often wonder if my  HP recovery of  making my character run back and forth to heal is making the current chain tooo big. lol

[17-Feb-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
just do 99.

[17-Feb-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
3 keystrokes, like running 99 spots

[17-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Just type 99 ?

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
or 33. for 33 times

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
or 10 for ten times

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
oh sweet

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
or 38 for 38 times

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
or 23 for 23 times

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you can repeat any command

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is not exactly safe to do

[17-Feb-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if anything happens it is stopped

[17-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I see

[17-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Last question for now. 
There has been some debate on developing the game.  This is what I think.
You can add graphics to Rogue, a GUI interface, outside features and even maybe some new ones with some development as long as it  is based on the actual game code of Rogue. 
You cant just turn Rogue into Pixel Dungeon with out serious amounts of development work, it would be better to start with Pixel Dungeon and  make a new chain from there. 

Others think you can just turn Rogue into  a similar Roguelike

[17-Feb-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you are correct

[17-Feb-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case I wont have time to become a roguelike gamedev

[17-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I know, that was clear!

[17-Feb-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so we will have pure rogue plus whatever outside of game GUI

[17-Feb-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
all the player collectibles can be made very GUI graphical

[17-Feb-19 06:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I dont think a lot of people get that when they keep tossing game ideas around here, so I think it will help for me to clarify that in some media.

[17-Feb-19 06:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
After Rogue is running well, where in your timeline is getting tools for Gaming Devs built? I only know of a few tasks you have coming up, but those seem laborious to me already.

[17-Feb-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
today I made cursesd.c, which has enough of libncurses that rogue uses to recreate gamestate

[17-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there are many games based on curses

[17-Feb-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it is ascii based, but still many interesting things are possible, but before getting carried away, we need to get ROGUE to production level

Due to the amount of excitement and speculation around this  I'm preparing myself for the possible discussions. I had already spent a large chunk of time on the topic of advancing the game, with two different people. lol

[17-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have some timeline questions too for Rogue development. Trying to get the Gaming Dev competition info as well.

[17-Feb-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810

When is the estimated time for an "official release" of it? After browser interface and after everyone is comfortable with how the game and chain work with it is what I assumed. I think Q2 was mentioned?

[17-Feb-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not to spend huge effort on making out own games

[17-Feb-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
we need cross OS installers

[17-Feb-19 06:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying to find this dead address to be 100% sure - as I understand I can get it from bailout txid?
Can I find it somehow if I only know tokeind?
Tried to start daemon with `-pubkey=02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead`
Change gone to some address which had 0 tx so far http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9VggpGePJcq2U3r9R49XAHAjgAbxbzbcn

[17-Feb-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just look at any register tx

[17-Feb-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the one that gets the 1 satoshi output is the dead address, it will change from the normal pubkey address as it is a CCvout

[17-Feb-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
for release we also need consensus level validation and dPoW

[17-Feb-19 06:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But I have only tokenid from tokenlist - can't get register txids on scan and tokenid transaction not contains information about burn as I understand.
I wonder I have misunderstanding somewhere. Will work on scanner tomorrow with fresh mind üòÉ

[17-Feb-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Too many dungeon adventures today

[17-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
what does playerinfo return for a burned playertoken?

[17-Feb-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Same info as for alive

[17-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
in playertxid and tokenid

[17-Feb-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Exactly same info

[17-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
check the playertxid vouts

[17-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
vout1 should be 1 satoshi, so gettxout playertxid 1

[17-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if no result, it was spent (dead)

[17-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
```we need 1000x games developed using komodo. not to spend huge effort on making out own games```
Yep,  in those discussions i tried to explain that they're inspired in the right way but the game development needs to come from outside of KMD and not to have KMD devs working on games.  I want to make sure that is clear. 

I know the goal is to use this as a showpiece for others to want to use KMD for their games, that is why i'm looking for timelines on the dev tools.  If its unknown, its unknown, I can just leave it all stated as development in progress.  I would like to be able to fully promote the  idea and potential along side the game.

[17-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
by Q2 we should have decent dev tools

[17-Feb-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577

[17-Feb-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577

To update the TUI I just go back through the instructions again and use update, right?
```
git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui 
cd komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
git checkout rogue
cp -r * ~/komodo/src
```

[17-Feb-19 07:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Do I use that or something else, is what I am asking.

[17-Feb-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
To update TUI just:
```
cd komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
git pull
cp -r * ~/komodo/src```

[17-Feb-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
is the gameplay still working? maybe i broke it?

[17-Feb-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI repo now locating in` ~/komodo/src/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui` on your pc  i think
So very first command will be like a `cd ~/komodo/src/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui`
