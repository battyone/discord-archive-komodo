[28-Feb-19 04:13 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll make my wife play.

[28-Feb-19 04:13 AM] Cryptofist#7504

Installation

[28-Feb-19 04:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Installation on Ubuntu and OSX super easy now

[28-Feb-19 04:13 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI even copying config for you, ensuring that chain is in sync, setting pubkey for you

[28-Feb-19 04:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sweet

[28-Feb-19 04:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Just have to unzip, start unzipped daemon, start tui

[28-Feb-19 04:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll push those as well!

No need to compile anything or install any dependencies

[28-Feb-19 04:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Just unzip and play

[28-Feb-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm in next TUI version I also can make TUI  start daemon with ROGUE chain params automatically if start daemon looks hard

[28-Feb-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
So user will just need to execute `./rogue_tui` and if daemon not started it will start it for you.
In such case new player just will need to unzip and execute `./rogue_tui` - two steps to play

[28-Feb-19 04:58 AM] joe2x4#5987
I never got it going again. Then rebooted CPU. Will have to try again later.

[28-Feb-19 04:59 AM] joe2x4#5987
Making the TUI launch everything would be awesome.

[28-Feb-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for osx compiler issue

[28-Feb-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
also, on exit from the program, it will wait for the most recent keystrokes tx to confirm. that can take a few minutes as it waits for new blocks

[28-Feb-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
you can check in keystrokes.log the txid of what it is waiting for confirm. it does a sendrawtransaction in a loop to help it propagate and get mined

[28-Feb-19 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so far I have not heard of any keystrokes tx failures, so maybe it is good enough reliability? the next level of reliability will take a lot longer to implement. also not sure if at the end it needs to wait for confirmation

[28-Feb-19 05:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It seems fine.
At the moment I'm just waiting for a next block before bailout - I think I can check if last keystroke for current game have > 0 confirmations and only after it make bailout to make it more reliable

[28-Feb-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i removed the waiting for last tx at the end of the program as that is indeed something the TUI can do, though the bailout should work even if the keystrokes is in the mempool.

[28-Feb-19 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
For now TUI can "cut" last keystroke easily I wonder

[28-Feb-19 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
one trick for a stubborn tx that stays unconfirmed is to sendrawtransaction once per 10 seconds or so until it gets an "already in the blockchain" error

[28-Feb-19 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
latest also has a rogue.sendlog file it makes to log the results of the sendrawtransctions it does

[28-Feb-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so if there are troubles, at least there should be a log of it

[28-Feb-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
has the latest seem to make longer games more reliable?

[28-Feb-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
before the most recent changes just now

[28-Feb-19 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Sounds great, if there will be feedback that latest progress cutting I'll improve the TUI

[28-Feb-19 05:23 AM] TonyL#3577
I not played much with latest updates yet - but community feedback seems good so far

[28-Feb-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
built on osx for me

[28-Feb-19 06:10 AM] TonyL#3577
CA advised me to implement similar fix earlier and it built fine (just uint64_t type instead of int64_t) - sorry that not wrote it here

[28-Feb-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
did we ever get a windows build?

[28-Feb-19 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Not yet

[28-Feb-19 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
There was one - but chain isn't syncing with this daemon already. @ca333  working on it as I know

[28-Feb-19 06:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Windows bundle was super popular in repo, so hope we'll have new one soon

Is it started to behave like this after something specific action/transaction broadcast?

[28-Feb-19 07:30 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes i played a game, but (28, 'Operation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received'), edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b. Manual bailout failed. I think stopped before i tryed manual bailout.

[28-Feb-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, are you using latest daemon?

[28-Feb-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
It's second report about daemon deadlock already

[28-Feb-19 07:32 AM] ronyi#5719
I think yes, i updated after jl777 pushed fix.

[28-Feb-19 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Please check if manual bailout hangs daemon after daemon restart

[28-Feb-19 07:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm filling my form atm - but no deadlocks so far

[28-Feb-19 07:36 AM] ronyi#5719

Short games with fresh warriors worked great, 4  games from 4 fine - progress saved even for very low keystokes amount lvl1 game.

Ouch something really bad happening when re-using warriors, just noticed that they are not saving after re-usage at all
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/dbb8c979b96b5ccd9465a1e6c3f07e9ec684628ae0a5386988d3b1e2a335f33a gold -> rogue conversion paid to my address, but 1 satoshi (warrior) gone to address which not belongs me, so warrior not appeared in my players list

[28-Feb-19 09:11 AM] ronyi#5719
I dare not play a long game 😄

[28-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, all my 3 from 3 reused warriors not appeared in my players list after bailout (gold was converted to ROGUE like a they survived and sent to my address, warrior token was sent to address which not belongs me)

[28-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n
Hmm on initial creation they are sending to this address too, so maybe it's how it should be - but anyway warriors not appears in players list after bailout on re-usage

[28-Feb-19 09:13 AM] TonyL#3577
At least I've received cashed ROGUE

[28-Feb-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
So what we have for now:

1) Deadlock on bailout
```komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22]" -> (Minironyi) found baton 22b7f6bb559eb3919a2c0de2b51dfb0135dab73f683091ce96d756faf2ac8cee numkeys.1417 seed.1862856489122242256 playerdata.812 Node just hanging.```

2) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=36:44

3) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with"couldnt find batontxid" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

4) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in `2` (mentioned in report)

5) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - `invalid gametxid, or already started`  on game start and bailout with warrior gone

@ronyi Could you please check `2` on your side?
Just play short game with brand new warrior, then re-use him in other short game (without death) and track if he back to your list after bailout is mined

[28-Feb-19 09:37 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but tryed, no problem,  up to now.

[28-Feb-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Very strange, I erased 5 from 5 this way

[28-Feb-19 09:42 AM] ronyi#5719
I tryed again, but i quit on lvl 5, warrior in lvl 4, the gold is not right, but i see my warrior in warrior list.

[28-Feb-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, was it re-usage of this warrior?

[28-Feb-19 09:44 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes.

[28-Feb-19 09:44 AM] TonyL#3577
In first game on my side everything fine - progress/warrior saving. But when I re-use warrior and bailout - I'm receiving ROGUE like warrior was alive but warrior not appears in my list 🤕

[28-Feb-19 09:46 AM] ronyi#5719
ohhh... such are the lives of testers. Re-using my warrior and playing short games.

[28-Feb-19 09:48 AM] TonyL#3577
And I got extraction prints like everything fine (strength, health, gold extracted) - noticed that warriors not back only when 3 from 6 left in list 😂

[28-Feb-19 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw warriors created not today seems not behave like this on my side

[28-Feb-19 10:03 AM] ronyi#5719
This warrior is created today and working goog, i have only 1 old warrior, but lvl 9 and I dare not use it. to rare for me 😦

[28-Feb-19 10:12 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay, my new warrior is killed witout game. 😄

[28-Feb-19 10:14 AM] TonyL#3577
How come?

`invalid gametxid, or already started` - as I remember you've reported about same problem before

[28-Feb-19 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh seems something is not good now since a lot of problems we faced. I think it's better to wait James for our reports review. For now it looks like some problem with batons changing/scanning imo

[28-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Good Morning.

[28-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I DID keep my warrior after leaving Level 10.

[28-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
He was a previously used warrior as well. Glad he stayed hes my best one!

[28-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
