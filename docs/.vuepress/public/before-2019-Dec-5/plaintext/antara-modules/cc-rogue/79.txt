I think if each level you check the extract, then it will be clearer what action is causing the out of sync

Ok so let's assume for now that reason is corrupted warrior (before/if someone else face same problem with progress saving and warrior created without bugs in long game) üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
If inventory data was corrupted - I used something and replay broke. I think that was a case

[02-Mar-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810

Who have a luck to a) find amulet b) avoid possible gremlins with keystrokes extraction c) have not legacy warrior

[02-Mar-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's possible to make "amulet debug" version of rogue? Like a change in source code that amulet creating on lvl1

Yes, and all my warriors is dead again just quit and my warriors is dead, so unfortunately i can't play.

Adopted keystrokes log parser for windows - seems it works ( but should support only WinXP+, will not work on Windows 98 üò¶ ). 

Will beautify things a little, test a little and then publish bundles for all three OSes (in a few hours I think)

Played quite short game on Windows (quit on lvl2). Two keystroke transaction were broadcasted without problems. 

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/sBGMzxHtrd/

Extract returns error (tried to wait few blocks - but same error):
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%228f1f3c32c39fb457a1a80e1a083d91ef598d6042536669171d7064b4a3f64610%22,%22031d6340665e4be675e6b39093152b6169e546ac6885c39058c4c60afee529d491%22]\"

```

Not bailouted yet. I did very nothing special in this game - Just defeated few enemies (fight by `f + arrow `), collected armor, scroll, a little bit gold and quit. 

UPD: seems it's Windows pack daemon/rogue specific issue (same behaviour as above 3 times a row  on Windows, but on Linux jl777 branch node progress extracting fine in same games)

Reproduced issue which @ronyi had.

Game not started with:
```setplayerdata
findbaton err.-1
invalid gametxid, or already started``` 

And then TUI think that game is finished and trying to do bailout process. (if make bailout - warrior will be instadead because no keystrokes were broadcasted)

I stopped TUI by CTRL+C - gameinfo was like game is not started yet

Manually started game - and it's worked fine. I wonder some re-attempt needed on this stage.
I'll calculate time before and after execution of rogue game - and if game took less than 1 second I'll try to start it again until success instead of bailout.

{Reactions}
awthanks 

[03-Mar-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
In general for all cases when no keystrokes were sent at all it's possible to play this game again if bailout wasn't sent. Seems one more issue possible to resolve from TUI side

[03-Mar-19 02:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Pushed fix with such game duration check - hope no more warriors will be lost in games which even not started

Hmm seems that keystrokes sending on each level added another headache - played 5 levels game, first and third keystroke failed with "couldn't find batontxid" - but it was detected only when game finished and even when rebroadcasted and waited few blocks extract returned error (so game progress/warrior lost).
So I have to monitor logs permanently - not only on game finish and rebroadcast each time I see error to hope that sequence remains the same.

[03-Mar-19 05:40 AM] TonyL#3577
So now have some games like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/SNWgcvgcCg/ (played 3 levels - 1st keystroke have error in keystrokes.log so wasn't broadcasted - even after re-broadcast extract will return error because of inconsistency I think) - it should be not hard to solve: just not broadcast next if previous returned error, and try to rebroadcast one with error first until success.
It don't have much sense to make bundles now with such problem because progress of many games will be lost.

[03-Mar-19 05:43 AM] TonyL#3577
```********```
Windows one have two cases of extraction:
 1) It's just error and nothing is extracted at all
2) It's extracting state for `dl1` (but no errors in keystrokes.log for other levels). 
Extracted more that dl1 in 0 games from ~15

Trying to identify now if it's a FSM branch problem or Windows kit especially

[03-Mar-19 05:55 AM] TonyL#3577
`Information about game saved on chain: $$$gold.61 hp.18 strength.16/16 level.2 exp.10 dl.3`
Ubuntu latest FSM extracted fine in first case from first, so problem should be somewhere on Windows stuff side (build or maybe my env) - not branch specific

[03-Mar-19 06:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm even if I died on lvl1 - Windows one extracted state for lvl1 ü§î 
Already feeling that I got lost. It's time for issues tracking I wonder üòÄ

i think if you play really fast you can end up submitting keystrokes before the prior tx is confirmed. still it should wait until it is confirmed to broadcast the next keystrokes tx. I will work on adding an automatic extract verification step to the keystrokes submitting, that is too complex for TUI

[03-Mar-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810

[03-Mar-19 06:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Windows wasn't tested much so maybe it not worked before as well

[03-Mar-19 06:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Now I have a test plan - so started to test Windows with it and found these problems with extraction

[03-Mar-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
are the keystrokes files being created? also, for an extraction that doesnt work on windows, does it work on unix? i mean with the game played on windows

[03-Mar-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we can isolate what part is broken in windows

[03-Mar-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if every windows game fails, then there is no point for release

[03-Mar-19 06:51 AM] TonyL#3577
All `.1+` keystroke files are empty on Windows
