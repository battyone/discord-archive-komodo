`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getbalance` will show you if blocks are up to date

[22-Feb-19 12:30 AM] nael55#5863
blocks and longestchain should be the same

Windows ROGUE bundle - daemon, rogue and TUI included üòÉ
To use - just download, unzip. Start komodod.exe in one window with ROGUE assetchain params and valid pubkey and after blockchain is synced execute rogue_tui.exe

How come there are no tx fees when playing ROGUE?  How do tx fees work?

[22-Feb-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only the char is stored on chain. game is seperate. Just got in touch with my mate, hes keen to dev his game with this too, We already had the idea ages ago, use the blockchain to store all found items and characters. Tradable items with the games crypto currency. Hes made a few RPGs n things, with like super simple games engines 2D, but we all start somewhere. I think this stuff  can be leveraged in a really smart way to monetize the game, without loot boxes, or micro transactions, and seill be free to play üòâ

Instructions worked for me this time around. And I'm more sober :realpirate: . Question, upon reloading a warrior via the TUI, the arrows take up one space each. How to combine these? Also where do I find my Rogue coin balance from bailout gold conversations?

[22-Feb-19 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
really isnt worth it... lol.

There isn't a way yet, I 'd like to see the used arrows combined to one slot myself too.

@Mylo all the funds start out locked in the main CC address. to start a game, funds from the main address are used, also a little bit (txfee) is given to the user, kind of a faucet

Am trying to bailout but the TUI is hungup. Was working earlier.  it says 
Bailout not broadcasted yet by some reason. Let's wait. Repeating this in a loop. Is it possible to do a bailout transaction manually?

So even though TUI hung up, I tried bailout command in a new terminal using the game txid. Seems it worked. This gave me a new game txid, though not sure yet what to do with this info

Hello,

I have had an error  when i try to rogue windows bundle : Error: Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
"C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams"
Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and then restart.

How can i solve this problem?

[22-Feb-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
@anyyna As temporary solution you might download my zcash params bootstrap from http://159.69.45.70/zcash_params.zip and unzip all files to `"C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams"` (if there is no folder - just create it)

[22-Feb-19 09:24 AM] anyyna#1521
@TonyL thank you i will try

[22-Feb-19 09:26 AM] anyyna#1521

How Todo a bailout manually and reload? Thought I had it but I don't. The TUI hungup, I have some info, I'd it possible to save my guy?

[22-Feb-19 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
@anyyna sorry, http://159.69.45.70/zcash_params.zip

@joe2x4 In which cases TUI hangs?

[22-Feb-19 09:28 AM] joe2x4#5987
I bailed at level10, lots of gold

[22-Feb-19 09:28 AM] joe2x4#5987
It worked for several bailouts immediately before

[22-Feb-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"``` for manual bailout

[22-Feb-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Your screenshot not looks like hang

[22-Feb-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Sometimes rogue just breaking terminal

[22-Feb-19 09:30 AM] joe2x4#5987
Then how to restart after bailout cmd

[22-Feb-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Start new session in new terminal window, if bailout was made with warrior alive - you'll see your warrior in your warriors list after bailout tx is mined

[22-Feb-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
And on singleplayer/multiplayer game start you'll be asked if you want to use him

[22-Feb-19 09:37 AM] joe2x4#5987
Option 2 on the TUI has not worked for me. Even after successful bailouts earlier. Option 6 was allowing me to enter player Id earlier but doesn't see player.  my manual bailout didn't work to save I guess. For the manual bailout I used the txid the tui provided from the new single player training game successful created txid

[22-Feb-19 09:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me check, maybe something was changed from daemon side

[22-Feb-19 09:39 AM] joe2x4#5987
This to time option 2 worked, but it is a brand new player

[22-Feb-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Option two just printing your warriors from `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17`

[22-Feb-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
So if your warrior wasnt saved by bailout or bailout transaction not mined yet it not showing anything
