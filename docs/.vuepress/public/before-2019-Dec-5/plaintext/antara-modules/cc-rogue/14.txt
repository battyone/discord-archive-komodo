[13-Feb-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the playerdata DEX can use graphics to display the various items. you can just display placeholder graphics and we can get a graphics guy to make it pretty

[13-Feb-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the logic would be based on what TUI is doing

[13-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Yup. it's next thing in checklist after logic implementation. Will print all cute and drop not needed for user info

how does one play rogue? is there an installer or do you have to go full linux?

[13-Feb-19 09:28 PM] ca333#0118
@nocturnal as of now you need to use it on a unix based OS (OSX or linux for example) to use it according to the current tutorials/documentations. 

For windows there are some differences in executing the commands, etc. May i ask which OS you are using? We might be able to provide you a custom installer script to offer a smooth starting process.

[13-Feb-19 09:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
ah ok i have windows and mac

[13-Feb-19 09:29 PM] nocturnal#2177
windows 10 and OSX 10.8.5 (need to upgrade...)

[13-Feb-19 09:30 PM] ca333#0118
ok thanks - i will write it together for OSX which is easier to execute on. i have a 10.9.x machine around so we are not tooo far away from each other version wise.

[13-Feb-19 09:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
ah thats very kind of you

[13-Feb-19 09:30 PM] nocturnal#2177

i was just curious to see the gamplay mainplay

[13-Feb-19 09:31 PM] nocturnal#2177
is there any youtube vids?

[13-Feb-19 09:31 PM] ca333#0118
since you have asked for it there must be a demand for this and i am sure it will help someone else with a Mac to check Rogue out - it is no trouble for me. i am happy to assist the community.

[13-Feb-19 09:32 PM] ca333#0118
@nocturnal - actual yes there is a gameplay video that was created by a community member. our marketing is adding a sound and intro animation to it before it goes online.

[13-Feb-19 09:33 PM] ca333#0118
i have the raw video if that can be of any help for the time being.

[13-Feb-19 09:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
ok no worries, i can wait till its posted. If you need any sound design thats my proffession üòÉ

Are you wondering what #Komodo Rogue CC is? Some users said they never heard of Rogue. FYI: It was a very famous computer game in the 80s. Thanks to a community member we have a gameplay video to show you what Rogue actually is: https://t.co/NBivv3yjxl #KMD #DEX #BTC #Bloc...

this error from above is related to missing boost header which gets built as part of the komodod dependency compilation.
