are you going to add DEX of player data as well?

[14-Feb-19 03:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
give me a command to test that and I'll let you know üòÑ

[14-Feb-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
DEX uses `tokens` API commands

[14-Feb-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
i.e.: `tokenorders`, `tokeninfo`, `tokenask`, `tokenfillask`

[14-Feb-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
`tokenbalance`

[14-Feb-19 03:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that's for later, the first basic task is then just making the game accessible via web interface along with clickable komodo-cli actions

üëçüèΩ 

[14-Feb-19 03:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, can add those later for sure

[14-Feb-19 03:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now I'll not make it portable, I'll only work on a web interface,

[14-Feb-19 03:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will work on it tomorrow üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
also, you may want to give option to use which player they want to use. an user can have multiple players in their portfolio

[14-Feb-19 03:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
how to view and select multiple users?

[14-Feb-19 03:12 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17` - shows player list
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17` - will show how many games they played in the past and pending ones
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib playerinfo 17 \"[%22856c98ecd347fcf644b7764a25bb2288559869023275b85a23ed260e4d3572eb%22]\"` - shows specific player's detailed info
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE mytokenorders 17` - shows user token orders

[14-Feb-19 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL's TUI has implementation has user selection to play with

[14-Feb-19 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice! yes, can add these calls to kmdgo too

[14-Feb-19 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain just for quicker start, can you please give me the JSON outputs with the data for each call?

[14-Feb-19 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will really help boost start the work

[14-Feb-19 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I won't have to play the game üòÑ

nope, like this one

[14-Feb-19 03:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
playerdata empty array

[14-Feb-19 03:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I need the txids, and if those txids need next call or possible call, then those JSON outputs

[14-Feb-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to give me some time.

[14-Feb-19 03:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@Pumtchak Please ensure that you started daemon with `-daemon` at the end not forwarding of stdout to /dev/null

[14-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Pumtchak#0362
oups... ok

[14-Feb-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
To save your brave warrior you still can quit dungeon manually after daemon restart `without stdout forwarding to /dev/null`:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22 f73b10c3d8ced2573a7c3cef8f76cc7ac03be18ebc0afdabc061be5d302920ee%22]\"```

[14-Feb-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Great, as soon as bailout transaction mined you should see your warrior in list and be able to use it in a new game

[14-Feb-19 05:31 PM] Pumtchak#0362
yeah i was waiting for it to appears in the TUI. It's working üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 05:31 PM] Pumtchak#0362
trying to play in a new game

[14-Feb-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI will gentle ask you if you want to choose a player to go dungeon with after game transaction is mined

[14-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Pumtchak#0362
So nice i have my warrior back üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Pumtchak#0362
Well done thanks for the help

[14-Feb-19 05:36 PM] Pumtchak#0362
it has also auto-remove my cursed weapon üòÑ

when you are resurrected you have no armor on or weapon, dont forget to wield and Wear or you might get killed by a bat

[14-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Pumtchak#0362
it is weird, i have in my inventory the things i drop before quiting...

[14-Feb-19 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm might be a bug, let me also try to drop, quit and track stuff

[14-Feb-19 05:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Realised why mytokenorders not worked for me - seems I was tired and called it as `cclib mytokenorders`. What a shame.

[14-Feb-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible some of the last things that happen get skipped. let me know if this happens even if you have a bunch of keystrokes after the last drop

[14-Feb-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Also TUI now not waiting for a next block to broadcast bailout - tested now few quit exits from dungeon and seems it's better to wait for a next block to mine keystrokes

[14-Feb-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Because in case of very fast bailout it not generates hex and generates it only after keystokes mined

[14-Feb-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Dropped stuff, walked a little - quit

[14-Feb-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it could miss the last part of the game play

[14-Feb-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Dropped stuff not saved

[14-Feb-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
But I've pushed update already so waited for one block before bailout

[14-Feb-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
worse would be to find two-handed sword in a treasure room and have that missed

[14-Feb-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
What if player dies and broadcast bailout before keystroke with death is mined?

[14-Feb-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Interesting will he survive or not ü§î

[14-Feb-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is some small amount of cheating that can likely be done

[14-Feb-19 06:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, seems I've just saved one

[14-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is powerful magic to bring back the dead

[14-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
make sure to make him eat 3 cloves of garlic so he doesnt turn into a zombie

Hey guys I'm going to start writing some articles and building social media accounts and other things for marketing today. 

Need some info.
How does the chain work? Is it mineable? Any info here, specifically enough to write a blurb to explain the Blockchain side of things and tokens would be helpful... 

What's the official name? 
CC Rogue? 
Crypto Rogue? Kmd Rogue?  Rogue Chain ?

[14-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Any thoughts on graphics for branding? Maybe just an Ascii based logo design?

[14-Feb-19 07:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Just added new feature to TUI - own warriors trade orders tracking and cancellation (it's scanning your orders and checking if it placed for warrior)

@TonyL this time i quit the game without any error msg, but my warrior still isnt visible... anything to do except Q + y + Enter ??

[14-Feb-19 07:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe bailout not broadcasted 
Try to call:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17`

[14-Feb-19 07:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Then if there any games in `games` call bailout manually as you did before when restarted daemon

[14-Feb-19 07:16 PM] Pumtchak#0362
no games, only pastgames...

[14-Feb-19 07:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Is bailout transaction mined?

[14-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Pumtchak#0362
not sure

[14-Feb-19 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm mempool is empty

[14-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Pumtchak#0362
i can try manually ?

[14-Feb-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
If there are only pastgames in `cclib games 17` output it means that you sent a bailout tx in game from which you expect warrior back

[14-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Pumtchak#0362
did it manually...

[14-Feb-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Is there any playerdata in 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17```?
