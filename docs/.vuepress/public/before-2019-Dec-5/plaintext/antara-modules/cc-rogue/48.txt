No need ./makerogue now

[19-Feb-19 01:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just ```git pull 
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[19-Feb-19 01:33 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Feb-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
If this build is ok in singleplayer and multiplayer - I can bundle it with TUI

[19-Feb-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
So just unzip, daemon start and TUI run will be needed
