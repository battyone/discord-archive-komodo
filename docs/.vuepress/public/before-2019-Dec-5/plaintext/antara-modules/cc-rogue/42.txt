did you have -pubkey set on startup? i did, and it didnt crash

[18-Feb-19 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
No, starting without `pubkey=` param

[18-Feb-19 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying to collect backtrace now, on MacOS there is specifics with gdb

[18-Feb-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for setpubkey crash

[18-Feb-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810

[18-Feb-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
never had issues on Linux though

[18-Feb-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
with setpubkey

[18-Feb-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
it always worked

[18-Feb-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it was happily overwriting stack, then existing the instance

[18-Feb-19 03:12 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE setpubkey 027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85

``` on linux this call is working on latest FSM (maybe it's worked before as well for sure)

[18-Feb-19 03:21 PM] SHossain#0007
on Linux `setpubkey` never crashed. i'm also compiling FSM on linux now

[18-Feb-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain did you test on osx where the crash was?

[18-Feb-19 03:23 PM] SHossain#0007
testing

[18-Feb-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
no sense for tony to duplicate the test as it was a clean fix of a 100% crash

[18-Feb-19 03:24 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll test reworked strength/inventory now

[18-Feb-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is good. I liked your idea of strength determining how much you can carry

be it arrows, or potions, or food, etc

[18-Feb-19 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
1 arrow = 1 item even when arrows in stack ?

[18-Feb-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i just total the you have N whatevers,

[18-Feb-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810

35 places in inventory

[18-Feb-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the 3*strength cap adds a very interesting puzzle as to what to keep in the deeper levels and what to have duplicates of

[18-Feb-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
as the 23 different types of items is also a limitation

[18-Feb-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes it's interesting - and potions of gaining strength are more valuable now - 1 strength points = 3 inventory places (beside of damage)

[18-Feb-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Also there are rings of sustain strength - will be very valuable musthave as well

[18-Feb-19 03:51 PM] TonyL#3577
And gameplay should be less annoying now - because in original rogue you need to clean inventory way too often
