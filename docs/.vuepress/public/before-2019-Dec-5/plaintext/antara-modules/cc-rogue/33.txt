check debug.log as well if you want

[17-Feb-19 03:44 AM] Alright#0419
`tail -f ~/.komodo/ROGUE/debug.log` if you're using linux

[17-Feb-19 03:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
sweet thank you!

[17-Feb-19 03:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
all I have done for three days is ```use linux```

[17-Feb-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
all I have done for 8 years is
```
use linux

[17-Feb-19 03:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Guess everyone needs their inspiration for the curiosity to dive in

[17-Feb-19 03:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Thats awesome

[17-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
Yea, there's always something to spark the curiosity. For me it was barterdex stress tests

[17-Feb-19 03:46 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm learning some things, seems like ill be real limited unless i find some more things to learn about

[17-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
#kmdlabs a good place to learn

[17-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
literally the purpose of the coin is to foster a learning environment

[17-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I lurk in there, usually over my head

[17-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah ok!

[17-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
you just need to think of something worth coding and put your mind to it

[17-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
start simple

[17-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I want to connect game devs to KMD so I feel i need to learn alot to be of use to both sides of that

[17-Feb-19 03:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm down to be a guinea pig for kmdlabs if you need an ignorant newbian

[17-Feb-19 03:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Learning is one of my favorite things

[17-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
There are some things you could do right now with LABS, but right now it's mostly focused on people who have notary spots. There should be much more to do for non-notaries after launch such as testing/breaking/creating CCs and dapps

[17-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Nice.

[17-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
I'd recommend you try to get a notary spot +2 months after launch. That would be the quickest way to learn as it almost forces you to

[17-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Is that the election time thats coming up?

[17-Feb-19 03:53 AM] Alright#0419
you could begin to build/test a dapp or CC right now with current testnet infrastructure

[17-Feb-19 03:54 AM] Alright#0419
every 2 months we will hold a lottery for open notary positions. 75%(subject to change) of top performing notaries keep their positions. The other 25% if they wish to try to keep their spot will be put into a provably random lottery with any new sign ups.

[17-Feb-19 03:54 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah, I see, excellent idea.

[17-Feb-19 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
do believe we're adding 2 spots every 2 months as well as we're only at 20 notaries total right now

[17-Feb-19 03:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I just signed up here (Rogue) for marketing,  so maybe by then I'll know if I will have the time + attention or not.

[17-Feb-19 03:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
But working on Rogue, Pirate and learning /running a NN for a bit sounds wonderful.

That‚Äôs a twitter post if I‚Äôve ever seen one @ca333

[17-Feb-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL good bug,pushed fix. now the players current strength is preserved and when respawned it should be both the current and max strength. so if you have 17 when max is 18, on bailout and new game cur and max should be 17

I had a warrior die, but he was still playable for another game afterwards. I used him and quit two more times. Then all of a sudden he was gone.

[17-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Figured I'd mention it since it was odd.

[17-Feb-19 08:03 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If anyone drinks a potion and it says " ...feeling cosmic" and the game does the random switching and treasure room making let me know !

[17-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts Thats my first random fun piece of media. üòÑ  That is gonna be the new twitter header.  I have some copy to go with it too.

`I had a warrior die, but he was still playable for another game afterwards`

[17-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504

#metoo

[17-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
did yours disappear too?

[17-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
or stay

[17-Feb-19 08:07 AM] ph03nix#3115
mine died

[17-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I played 2 more games before he disappeared like he was supposed to

[17-Feb-19 08:10 AM] ph03nix#3115
my warrior died, then came back unexpectedly

[17-Feb-19 08:11 AM] ph03nix#3115
died my first game after that

#rougezombie

[17-Feb-19 08:17 AM] ph03nix#3115
only happened once out of a lot of games

[17-Feb-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
likely the tx that recorded the death was in mempool. I guess there are some outside of game magics that can sometimes work

[17-Feb-19 08:21 AM] ph03nix#3115
yeah mempool is what i was thinking

[17-Feb-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is life after death after all! just need to use the mempool

[17-Feb-19 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI unlikely will allow to life after death since it's waiting for one block before bailout - manually it's possible (but need to be lucky a lil bit) to resurrect if broadcast bailout super fast after death

[17-Feb-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist `Rest and peace *centralized gaming*` - Nice warrior name haha

All progress which I've achieved wasn't saved (I level up from lvl7 to lvl8 during this game) and in replay only few moves in lvl1

[17-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
keystrokes tx confirmed?

[17-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, bailout already mined

[17-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
in keystrokes.log, any errors?

[17-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Even if few keystrokes weren't confirmed - it was very long game - 14 levels

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me check

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so all 14 levels were ignored?

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it thinks you died very quickly?

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
No, warrior not dead

[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I can re-use it - just progress not saved

[17-Feb-19 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Are latest keystrokes on bottom or top of `keystrokes.log` ?

[17-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
in the replay it stops very quick, so that is what the daemon is seeing

[17-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
how many keystrokes are extracted

[17-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it appends to keystrokes.log

In some place very far from file end

[17-Feb-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
How to check to which game related keystrokes before these errors?

[17-Feb-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
how big is the extracted seed.0 file?

[17-Feb-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the sum of keystrokes data, that is

[17-Feb-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so working backwards from the end, if 2kb of data, 2kb worth of keystrokes tx

wow, 12k...

[17-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a nondeterministic replay of the keystrokes

[17-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
did you use any special new keystrokes?

[17-Feb-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, just played as usual

[17-Feb-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Was a quite long game (run to lvl14 took around one hour)

[17-Feb-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Since I'm exploring levels completely because warrior was only lvl7 when I started

[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I broke replay totally, recently?

[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I not updated today

[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
or this is an isolated case

[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
are other games replaying without errors?

[17-Feb-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that was the fix to have replay use the same data as daemon

[17-Feb-19 12:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Will play one more now with deep run and warrior re-using to check if progress save and if replay is correct

[17-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
do a short run first

[17-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810

Ok, quilted on lvl2 (in game reused just 9 experience lvl1 warrior)
