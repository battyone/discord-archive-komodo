@TonyL I get this ```error code: -1
error message:
cclib method [evalcode] [JSON params]```

[26-Feb-19 11:24 AM] barv#0867
when I execute the manual bailout

~1hrs build on my mac (10.14.4, 2,9 GHz Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM) i used  jl777/komodo repo and jl777 branch. Sucessfully builded and started. @SHossain

[26-Feb-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@barv Oh there is extra-space in command which I've provided you

[26-Feb-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Was extraspace between %22 and txid

[26-Feb-19 11:32 AM] barv#0867
Seems to work. I don't get any feedback now. Is that normal?

[26-Feb-19 11:33 AM] barv#0867
apart from this ```{

[26-Feb-19 11:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm nope it's not work - it should return txid/hex in case of success

to fix the keystrokes issue, I will need to do some major surgery, so switch to FSM branch for now

[26-Feb-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 will be under construction until announced ready for use

@TonyL yep. My colleague died and I seem alive, but I died playing the game

[26-Feb-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
If he died faster you have to ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib highlander 17 \"[%22470951049fa24bf5800d3b36c22dd3391ff13690688f538af576ff32117c32f3%22]\"```

[26-Feb-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI can't detect cases when first died player (in case of more than 2 player - it's second left alive) bailout not mined yet - so let's say if you both died in the same block or even 1 block difference maybe - it will try to broadcast bailout instead of highlander. Have an idea how to improve it

[26-Feb-19 02:02 PM] joe2x4#5987
Don't have time for playing today, but checked my Rogue balance on way out the door and it looks like the Dex transfer of SpongeBob has credited a rogue to my balance. So was successful. üï∫

Working like a charm
And playerinfo for most actual playertxid just not return batontxid key at all - so it will be easy to find the actual playertxid for tokentxid

[26-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do we manually send a warrior? An off the books OTC tx..

[26-Feb-19 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist  for OTC trading and gifts: ```[3] Transfer warrior to other pubkey```

[26-Feb-19 03:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
In CLI though... and send ROGUE too.

[26-Feb-19 03:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If that's in the manual play guide I'll take a look. Just realized I never went through that entirely.

[26-Feb-19 03:45 PM] TonyL#3577
In cli just use:
to transfer warrior `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokentransfer playertokenid destpubkey 1`
to transfer funds `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE sendtoaddress address amount`

[26-Feb-19 03:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Gold. Thank you

[26-Feb-19 03:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So we have any other CC token projects? Is this the only one? I've been thinking about  wallets lately.

[26-Feb-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
As far as I know ROGUE is the first one based on non-fungible tokens

[26-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Neat.

[26-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Anyone got a warrior for sale?

[26-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That is here?

[26-Feb-19 04:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm looking at a huge list. Lol

[26-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL are all the Freds yours?

[26-Feb-19 04:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Probably some/most of them

[26-Feb-19 04:05 PM] TonyL#3577
fred is legacy name which was given by default on initial versions

[26-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok will buy some Freds

To run two accounts at the same time on one machine do I need to make another VM or just install all in another folder?

After ask tx is mined you should be able to see my order

Setup two daemon instances for same AC on one PC is a little bit tricky

[26-Feb-19 04:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Wait until ask filling  transaction is mined and you should be able to see warrior in your list and use him in game

[26-Feb-19 04:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
warrior is mine

[26-Feb-19 04:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, can't sell a warrior for 0.000

[26-Feb-19 04:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Can we make that happen somehow or will that not work at all?

[26-Feb-19 04:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Also is there a max on amount of warriors we can have?

[26-Feb-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
only depends on how much ROGUE you have to spend

[26-Feb-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
well ok, would be hard to have more than 2^256 as they are indexed via txid

[26-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah sweet, so yeah but its a huuuuuuuuuge amount.

[26-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
bought a warrior, went right back in, warrior still there, it didn't let me re-buy though.

[26-Feb-19 04:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ü§î what else can i break.

[26-Feb-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
your description isnt precise enough

[26-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
For what to break or what I was trying to do ?

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
"bought a warrior, went right back in, warrior still there, it didn't let me re-buy though."
is that a bug report?

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
For what I was trying to do... 
I wanted to see what would happened if I tried to buy a warrior twice before the mined tx and what would happen.  

I bought a warrior ,  went back to the main TUI menu, I back into the selling section, that warrior was still there, but when I entered the same bidtx  it  gave me "something went wrong"    ... so either I was too slow or it works exactly how it is supposed to.

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Not really, I was trying to see if i could find one

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
did the purchase confirm?

[26-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep

[26-Feb-19 04:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Tried again, the warrior will stay in the sales list for just a bit after successful purchase,  you can not buy it then.  The next time in the sales section the warrior is gone.

[26-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
and i bought a bunch of warriors...

[26-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im going to try the sell side now.

[26-Feb-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a refresh issue

[26-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is it not possible to make a  0 sell ?

[26-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I did place one with 0.0000001 successfully.

[26-Feb-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be a non-zero price, otherwise its not a sale, just a free transfer

[26-Feb-19 04:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok.  The idea behind it was adding freebie warriors  to the marketplace.

[26-Feb-19 04:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So what I might do is offer some free coins to purchase warriors in the dex.

[26-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL  I put a bid on one of you warriors
