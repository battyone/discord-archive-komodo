Aha, so last item from inventory missing when you starting new game?

[11-Mar-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Ouch you had 43 items initially

[11-Mar-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
21 * 2 = 42 so last one wiped

[11-Mar-19 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
I think there is a very old bug which allow to pick up one more item then maximal strength allow

So something non-det should happens between these moments

[11-Mar-19 08:56 AM] ronyi#5719
I figured out, everything is working good, but after i reading scroll, possible to pickup +1 item.

[11-Mar-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe thats why replay is corrupted since this place

[11-Mar-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Because only thing you do between these two video fragments is drop food -> read scroll -> pickup items

[11-Mar-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
```Information about game saved on chain: $$$gold.3527 hp.51 strength.21/21 level.9 exp.2151 dl.13``` what is strange is that `exp.2151` you never had exactly such experience, and this expereince is more than you had on dl.13

[11-Mar-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
You had max. 2065 experience with 3527 gold

Yes.

[11-Mar-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please play future games in standart terminal? (I think it would be better to use same env + non standart terminal combinations might confuse replay parser)

[11-Mar-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
For example I'm not sure if replays parser was ready for such keystrokes sequence ```kkhhkkeakQQQ li ```

[11-Mar-19 10:27 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes of course.

[11-Mar-19 10:41 AM] ronyi#5719
I played terminus almost always, I don't think this would be a problem. From herre i use always terminal.

[11-Mar-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it not causing problems - but just to remove this variable from equitation
```In terminus shift+up arrow=Q``` - such key combinations may create non-standard keystrokes

[11-Mar-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
agreed, we need to get it working stable first before experimenting with non-standard things

[11-Mar-19 10:56 AM] ronyi#5719
I think keystrokes say, my warrior is not dead, just i quit, turn not. If i quit, that could be dead?

[11-Mar-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
something strange is going on for sure. i think when we fix the windows, it could stabilize these strange things
