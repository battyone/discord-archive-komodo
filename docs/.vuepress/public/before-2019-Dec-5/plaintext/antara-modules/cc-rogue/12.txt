The crowns urs for now. I think tony had a high one also

[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
btw, how do you feel with teminal and CLI now?

[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
isn't it great to use CLI?

[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Pretty good so far

[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Managed to run this lol

[12-Feb-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
you are doing good. a lot of users still didn't mange that far with CLI

[12-Feb-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007

that means that -ac_cclib=<name> does not match the libcc.so name

[13-Feb-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
since you launched with -ac_cclib=rogue that means you are not using the rogue libcc.so

[13-Feb-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
there are 2 libcc.so right now, one with sudoku and another with rogue

[13-Feb-19 04:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have the one with sudoku in ~/komodo/src when you build komodod, it uses the one with sudoku in it and that is not the one with rogue in it. rogue tech is so new i didnt want to make the default build even include it

[13-Feb-19 04:58 AM] NNoperator#3835
for step 2 of getting started:  ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]"```

[13-Feb-19 04:58 AM] NNoperator#3835

[13-Feb-19 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
@NNoperator [1] means singpleplayer game, rogue calls broadcast raw automatically now so you just can skip `sendrawtransaction` calls from manual

[13-Feb-19 05:05 AM] NNoperator#3835
@TonyL thanks.  That explains already in block chain...

If we get tired, is there anyway to stop and return to the same game?

[13-Feb-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
just keep the window open, there is no passage of time without keyboard input. it is very small footprint

[13-Feb-19 06:32 AM] NNoperator#3835
I was about to do that, but the centaur appeared and kicked my ass.

[13-Feb-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you can Q, y to quit the game

[13-Feb-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
then do a bailout rpc call

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
that will create playerdata

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can use that same player for the next game

[13-Feb-19 06:34 AM] NNoperator#3835
will experiment more after rest.  This is an impressive accomplishment.

[13-Feb-19 06:35 AM] NNoperator#3835
it will be wonderful to see what else develops.

[13-Feb-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed new version that supports pname (player name) in the nonfungible data. setname rpc call sets the name to put into characters with noname. once named, a playerdata should retain it

{Reactions}
üëå 

[13-Feb-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it totally breaks all existing characters, but with the chain name in it it can support crosschain (in theory) and it should be stable

[13-Feb-19 06:43 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c
Interesting case: 
When placed ask order to sell warrior - warrior is not in players list. From other side I can't get all tokenorders now to scan. So if I not pre-saved tokenid of warrior which put on sale - I can't find my order

[13-Feb-19 06:45 AM] TonyL#3577
So only way which I see now - scan all tokenlist, then check if any tokenid is my warrior, then check if there is any my bids for this tokenid

[13-Feb-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, interesting. putting it up for sale removes it from the handy lists

[13-Feb-19 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems quite complicated to just show list of my orders which I can cancel.
Best way as I think maybe add call `mytokenorders` to tokensCC?
Or just wait till `tokenorders` without args works and I'll scan if tokenid in order is a warrior and then if it mine

[13-Feb-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
isnt there a way to get a list of all your token orders?

[13-Feb-19 06:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, at least I don't know about such way

[13-Feb-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
given a tokenorder, can you determine if it is your character?

[13-Feb-19 06:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems like `mytokenorders` can help to avoid a lot of scans if build DEX

[13-Feb-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok @dimxy can you make a mytokenorders rpc call? it should just return a list of txids for all orders the Mypubkey has made

[13-Feb-19 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope actually I can't check if it mine @jl777c

[13-Feb-19 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's imagine that somehow I wrote down tokenid so can find my sell order for it:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokenorders 856c98ecd347fcf644b7764a25bb2288559869023275b85a23ed260e4d3572eb

    "price": "10.00000000"
  }
]
```

[13-Feb-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Then I'm calling playerinfo to check if it a warrior:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib playerinfo 17 \"[%22856c98ecd347fcf644b7764a25bb2288559869023275b85a23ed260e4d3572eb%22]\"```

[13-Feb-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no any information about possession

[13-Feb-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you could do a playerinfo on tokenid

[13-Feb-19 06:57 AM] TonyL#3577

[13-Feb-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the one with the sell for the token owns it

[13-Feb-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
until it is bought

[13-Feb-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do a tokenaddress/assetsaddress one of them should be RMThM6vMrRir8ziq3V2FTTwGksdgXeXqGh

[13-Feb-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes it's `"myCCaddress": "RMThM6vMrRir8ziq3V2FTTwGksdgXeXqGh",` in `assetsaddress` output

[13-Feb-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha so scan tokenslist first to check if it a warrior, then for warriors tokenids checking tokenorders, then if there any tokenorders checking if origaddress is mine

[13-Feb-19 07:03 AM] dimxy#2587
let's make mytokenorders call

[13-Feb-19 07:04 AM] dimxy#2587
Maybe we can do it as existing tokenorders with no params?

[13-Feb-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is good

[13-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just make sure to check for 's', having a 'b' doesnt mean you ownit

[13-Feb-19 07:21 AM] dimxy#2587
Seems, 'mytokenorders' rpc is better, because 'tokenorders tokenid' outputs all orders, mine and others
but 'tokenorders' with less param would output more restricted content (not guite logical).

One more tricky interesting thing: when show all "incoming request" from people who want to buy my warriors: warrior might be not warrior at this moment (if I already placed it in ask) so I'll not get him from playerslist. On this place I'll use `mytokenorders` as well to check incoming bids for warriors who are tokens and not in playerslist at the moment üòÉ

So in any place (related to DEX, not game process, since non-warriors  state warriors not possible to use in game)  where I need to display my warriors - I'll keep in mind to scan my orders to not miss anybody

[13-Feb-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577

[13-Feb-19 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm in general I think DEX logic in TUI is ready for gentle testing. I not merged it yet so possible to test from `rogue` branch of TUI. 
Issues it have now: 
- printing all as it is without formatting and dropping unnecessary data
- not possible to cancel your order or check your placed orders
- if you put warrior on sale you'll not see incoming bids for it (other words if warrior not  in `players` call output )
- in menu where placing bid order to buy someones warrior or checking if somebody selling warrior - you'll see your warriors and your orders in list - add filter here is in priority. Now if you'll try to buy your warrior TUI will probably crash.

[13-Feb-19 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Menus added:
```[3] Check if somebody wants to buy your warrior (incoming bids)
[4] Place order to sell warrior
[5] Place order to buy someones warrior
[6] Check if somebody selling warrior
```
[3] - checking for incoming bids for warriors from your players list. Asking if you want to fill any bid (other words to sell any your warrior for incoming bid)
[4] - showing your warriors list and offer to place sell order
[5] - Scanning blockchain and showing all existing warriors of all players. Then offering you to place buy order for any if you want
[6] - Scanning blockchain for warriors selling orders - if you want you can buy warrior

[13-Feb-19 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577
With `mytokenorders` call I'll add `My orders` menu with possibility to cancel selling order and also will scan myorders to track incoming bids for warriors which you placed in ask.

But in general if you know what do you want to do - it's already possible to trade warriors

For usual token it worked as expected

@dimxy just realised that maybe previous version of `tokenorders` which shown all orders on chain "not worked" because of the same ROGUE specific reason

@SHossain , that probably seems like easy steps to you :-). But when you don't really grasp all the technical stuff, then it's quite easy to get stuck at a certain point. I've tried (not this one, yet ; ).  I think Komodo would thrive a lot more if 'they' would make these kind of applications a lot easier accessible.

[13-Feb-19 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
