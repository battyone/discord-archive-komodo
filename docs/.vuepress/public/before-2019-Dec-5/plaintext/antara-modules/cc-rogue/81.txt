ValidateAskRemainder() got recvunitprice 5.00000000 >= 5.00000000 unitprice, new unitprice 0.00000000
somebody paid 5 ROGUE for playerdata, i think that is new record

I found intresting case, i lost warrior, but i used another, moreover TUI bailout not worked, but manual bailout worked. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1slcr2TbNAewDe4I9lCAbzHjmxZxTN1OP0-sLlK_Yeu8/edit#gid=0 Row: 149,150,151

[03-Mar-19 03:07 PM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi What means by "TUI bailout not worked" - some error or?

[03-Mar-19 03:09 PM] TonyL#3577
After game where you lost game progress please check keystrokes by:
```cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid```

There are two cases might be: 
a) error cant find batontxid (if it not in last keystroke sending attempt - progress will be lost) 
b) no keystrokes at all - if send bailout for such game warrior will be insta dead

[03-Mar-19 03:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Case a) happens in 20-30% games maybe (when moving between levels fast maybe 50%+) so you should lose warriors quite often

Such games should be on bottom of `cclib games 17` call output

@jl777c In very short game (not picked up any gold, no fights with monsters - just few steps, picked up food and quit) no any squares in extraction (moved by arrows)

Played another one - fight with snake by `f + arrow right` and picked up 5 gold, let's compare

[03-Mar-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Progress extracted fine (at first it returned error but waited 2-3 blocks and it extracted)

Played one more short 1lvl game, in this one I fight monster, picked-up gold and before I quit I checked inventory:
```.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22a7bc2fb751559302c6e709d78df0ecb4bd073a7e6f645843f231bda99932061c%22,%22031d6340665e4be675e6b39093152b6169e546ac6885c39058c4c60afee529d491%22]\"

In daemon stdout when extract: zero value character was killed -> no playerdata

[03-Mar-19 11:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Only not sure if it ok spaces around `i`

[03-Mar-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
So between last two ones only difference is inventory checking - in extracted game I not checked it, in not extracted (in game where warrior counted as ded) I did

[04-Mar-19 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's check if inventory checking showing same way on Linux

But it's difference anyway

[04-Mar-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
does the replay show the same game that you played?

[04-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are able to play short games on windows and it works properly

[04-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577

@jl777c btw is it normal that when I'm starting (I'm on linux now) `rogue anyseed gui` I'm getting into the same level as for 777 seed? (with long sword in right room)

[04-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
seem that is a bug

[04-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, the windows data is confusing...
games played on windows are able to be extracted on unix?

[04-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810

`windows is totally broken in all cases?` in 99.99% cases  it seems - wasn't able to get extract print with gold, experience and etc for more than a few keystrokes game, and never with dl  > 1

[04-Mar-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Replay starting from just blank room

[04-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that could just be due to speed of playback

Even of this game played on Windows

[04-Mar-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
When rogue trying to send first keystroke

[04-Mar-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Should `register` be confirmed?

[04-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[04-Mar-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha! I'm waiting only for newgame transaction confirmation, then sending register transaction and then game starting

[04-Mar-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Before when keystrokes broadcasted not after each level it wasn't visible

[04-Mar-19 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
But now I have to start only when register confirmed, ok

[04-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be possible to allow it to work from mempool, but really it is more reliable to have registration tx confirmed

[04-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that alone could make it much more reliable!

[04-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
lets see if it does, then I wont need to destablize things with the keystrokes syncing

[04-Mar-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577

I think no. If warrior die, it shouldn't be alive.

it seems TUI needs to wait for last keystrokes tx to confirm

I feel most easier to start new warrior. I started 4 warrior and none died. 😄

null baton is not good

`it seems TUI needs to wait for last keystrokes tx to confirm` - sometimes dead warrior not counting as dead even in single keystroke (1 lvl) game. So I wonder maybe there is some non-det stuff with death causes also

latest jl777 not builds for windows atm: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/pjfXbp4mTc/
trying latest FSM

[04-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
looks like some libs went missing. this is from make clean and build-win.sh ?
