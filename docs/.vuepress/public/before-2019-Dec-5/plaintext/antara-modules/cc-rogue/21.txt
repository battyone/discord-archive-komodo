[15-Feb-19 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I set my VM to 2 vcpu and 4 GB RAM

[15-Feb-19 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and 2+GB Swap

[15-Feb-19 10:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
shows palyers now:
```{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "players",
  "playerdata": [
    "09035cd939b1c5f38cd08ddf04c908f918eb855875cad975196988c527a439e6"
  ],
  "numplayerdata": 1
}
```

[15-Feb-19 10:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
will i be fine with my 1vcpu 2gb ram

[15-Feb-19 10:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
if i wait it out to build

[15-Feb-19 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL When should I execute setname command?
after newgame->register?

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Crabby Paddy should be fine I guess... but in case your compile doesn't complete, if failes, shutdown your vm and update it's vcpu and ram

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if limited on ram, then make bigger swap

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
its been on init.cpp

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
for 15 minutes

[15-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
not sure if its frozen or working 😄

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder I do it before register, possible to do after - not very matters. Most important to do it before bailout if you want your new warrior to have this name

[15-Feb-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`H` hobgoblins don't like arrows 😉

[15-Feb-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe setname -> register order matters actually, not checked it yet but setname before register definitely works as expected

[15-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
after makerogue, komodod needs to be built again

[15-Feb-19 11:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Definitely not recommend to fight in melee with `A` Aquators - they break armor. It might be difficult to fight centaurus `C` also if you're not well prepared.
On lvl12+ you may find really bad `T` trolls - they can one hit 20-30 hp ez. Not recommended for melee at all.  Also there are `H` who stealing stuff and `L` who stealing gold - better to kill on range as well.

[15-Feb-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL okay mate 👍

[15-Feb-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
just wait till you run into U

[15-Feb-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm always die because of troll one hit 😦

[15-Feb-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
D are also pretty nasty

[15-Feb-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Intrigued. Need to make deep run to check 😃

[15-Feb-19 11:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn' know a text only game could be interesting 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will play it with good focus once I feel I done some progress on my go side work

[15-Feb-19 11:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
reminds me of Sheldon Cooper for some reason 😅

I'm nuclear physicist by degree same as Sheldon haha

[15-Feb-19 11:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yea mate I know 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
But not so strange as him. At least I hope so 😂

[15-Feb-19 11:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😹

[15-Feb-19 11:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I feel sometimes I am strange.... hope not as as him either

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
be careful. if you get addicted to rogue....

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
you will disappear for a while

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
strangeness and normality are relative definitions 😃

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually all definitions are relative...

{Reactions}
💯 

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes James, that's why I want to focus more on troubleshooting code than playing game 😂

[15-Feb-19 11:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I guess I don't have any choice

[15-Feb-19 11:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
have to play if need deving 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the deep level gameplay has no need in the coding, a good thing

[15-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just quickly frolic with hobgoblins and bats

[15-Feb-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
But when you start deep run it's sometimes hard to stop 😂

[15-Feb-19 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just run back when I see K and B.... then attack back and they die quicker... at least that's what I found with my quick play trials 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
You have a bow on start - can equip by `w` and then throw arrows

[15-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
It usually one hits `H`

[15-Feb-19 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh! so just press `w` ?

[15-Feb-19 11:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what's the key combination if I'm standing right side of H or K or B ?

[15-Feb-19 11:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like 1 or 2 steps distance?

[15-Feb-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
in 1 step distance you'll not have enough time to equip bow since equipment change spending move

[15-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
So if you not have some magic stuff only way is to fight and pray for luck

[15-Feb-19 11:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay may be that's why I don't make to level 2 ever! 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will give that a try next time

[15-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
In case if you surrounded by many enemies it might be a good idea to go corridor to fight them one by one

[15-Feb-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Or use the teleportation scroll if you have any for sure 😃

[15-Feb-19 11:12 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
couldn find valid game

[15-Feb-19 11:12 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so close

[15-Feb-19 11:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh I remember I got some scrolls, but didn't even read what those were 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
feel like I'm a dumb player now 😛

[15-Feb-19 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now that reminds me of Penny 😄

[15-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[15-Feb-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@Crabby Paddy you might use TUI to play - it's super easy

[15-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
whats tui 😮

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Terminal User Interface

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
```sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip libgnutls28-dev
pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc
git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
cd komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
cp -r * ~/komodo_rogue/komodo/src```

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Then run `./rogue_tui.py` from `~/komodo_rogue/komodo/src`

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
where do i run that

[15-Feb-19 11:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
in komodo_rogue?

[15-Feb-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Not matters

[15-Feb-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Last command will copy TUI files to your `komodo_rogue` `src` folder

It's expect correct input in most of the places so might crash on incorrect ones
