If use as tokenid baton of game which I didn't start yet (only registered)

[17-Feb-19 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
For non-existing tokenid there is other error:
```{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find tokenid"
}```

[17-Feb-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
In general I think 10000 supply token creating somehow when `newgame` (since only newgame have 10000 sat vouts) and then 1 token sending to player on register

[17-Feb-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats why `tokenbalance` is 1 but `tokensupply` is 10000
If create token with 1 supply manually it have 1 supply

[17-Feb-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
register spends token, bailout creates

[17-Feb-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i think tokeninfo is assuming specific vout, seems it might need to scan for valid CCvout

[17-Feb-19 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c vouts of bailout of first game are 10000 sat as well, there is no output of 1 satoshie

[17-Feb-19 03:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Bailout have 1 sat output

[17-Feb-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so where is the 10000 output from? and is it the token output?

[17-Feb-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
And 10000 sat output to  "addresses": "RAMvUfoyURBRxAdVeTMHxn3giJZCFWeha2"

[17-Feb-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokenaddress

  "mybalance": 672.99174913
}
```

[17-Feb-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Which is "TokensCCAddress": "RAMvUfoyURBRxAdVeTMHxn3giJZCFWeha2",

[17-Feb-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a markeraddress for tokenlist to see it

[17-Feb-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
So I wonder tokeinfo is confused by this output

[17-Feb-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
And maybe thats why burned tokens still appears in tokenlist

[17-Feb-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to ask @dimxy

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-Feb-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
when I checked last after register burned the token it didnt appear in tokenlist

[17-Feb-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe tokenlist needs to do a check against the burn address

[17-Feb-19 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
``` bailout: must be within ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP blocks of last keystrokes
 vin0 -> keystrokes baton of completed game with Q
 vout0 -> 1% ingame gold```
By description in github bailout have 1 vout but I have 6 vouts so confused very much 😃

[17-Feb-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
docs are way out of date

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-Feb-19 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will test refreshed rogue GUI better so

[17-Feb-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know of anything wonky with new cursesd, bugs will exhibit as playerdata not the same due to game replay not the same

👌 

[17-Feb-19 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Are old warriors compatible with update?

[17-Feb-19 03:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, old are in players list - let's try 😃

[17-Feb-19 03:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Bug with strength not persists anymore

[17-Feb-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
should be compatibnle

[17-Feb-19 04:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Interface seems to work smooth

[17-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c  I think I did drink a brown potion, it said some thing like "everything feels cosmic"  then I assume it had no effects i could see at the moment.  When I got a couple of rooms over things got weird.     At that point  I thought it was just the game.   

Later I thought it could be the potion, I looked it up online for a while,  the reaction text was hard to find anywhere, not in any game item guides online.   I DID find it in github with an "LSD" effect near it in the code..... but thats not something I understand well,  maybe you can look and see.    

 I DID get a lot of gold and treasure rooms, not actual teleporting though, character didn't jump around.  The items I got were high level, plate mail was one.

Ive drank the cosmic potion before and shit got weird real fast 😂

[17-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have gotten two since super ASCII LSD PARTY TIME

[17-Feb-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
wear a teleport ring and dring LSD

[17-Feb-19 04:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Did the mosters and items change on every move @CryptoNinjaa  ?

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so it IS that, sweet.

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
brown potion i think

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and you should be in tune with the universe and find a lot more than usual treasure rooms

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah pretty sure its the potion

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
color is different each game

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
as is the "latin" words for scrolls

[17-Feb-19 04:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Had one that reverses key strokes aswell

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Grabbed my mums old lappy she doesnt use anymore and installing ubuntu so i have a dedicated rogue machine now 🤪

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How is the pack size calculated?  It seems at some point i dropped a piece of armor after it being full, then could pick up 2 more things?  I played with it for a bit, didnt figure it out.

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
some dual items take up more than one spot in the pack

[17-Feb-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you ate some slime molds?

[17-Feb-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
slime molds are not to eat?

[17-Feb-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is your favorite food, unless you changed it

[17-Feb-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
talking about using up spots in the pack

[17-Feb-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess multiplayer mode is the next frontier

[17-Feb-19 04:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe.... Do they show up as food or slime mold automatically?

[17-Feb-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
:

[17-Feb-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
that is food

[17-Feb-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you can name it whatever, default is slime mold

[17-Feb-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds slimey and moldy, but it works as food, regardless of what it is called. without it you faint and eventually die

[17-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah did that a few times early on.

[17-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
My son was playing LoZ Breath of the wild and I explained to him that Rogue is the first digital version of that game type.  " Rogue? You mean the letter game?? How?" Que Zelda game history over view. 😀  Man, 2 was hard.

so, 2 different types of food in pack

[17-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Thats why I asked ^

[17-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL dont turn your game off. lol

[17-Feb-19 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm also noob playing this game. :abusedsmily:

[17-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Same, its been less than 24 hours for me.

[17-Feb-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe slime mold works better than normal food

[17-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
but ya know.... I dived in hard.

[17-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do we check that?

[17-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Duration?

After slime mold you should be not hungry for a longer time

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
As far as what I read online about the game anyway.

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
some rings make food last longer,most use up food a lot faster

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Seems there are surprises beyond the guides I have read, which is awesome

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh thats why there are scrolls of monster detection

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it is amazingly complex game

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Invisible monsters here

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a chameleon monster

[17-Feb-19 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Ring of protection is allows to eat less as I remember
