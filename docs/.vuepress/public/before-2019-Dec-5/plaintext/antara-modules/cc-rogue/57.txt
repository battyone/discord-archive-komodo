i usulally use make, and it that fail

[21-Feb-19 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then zbuild

[21-Feb-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just want to confirm make will slso compile rogue updates

[21-Feb-19 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep, I follow the same for non rogue branches

[21-Feb-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm my guess is that you would need to rebuild rogue first

[21-Feb-19 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then make ... but not 100% sure tbh

[21-Feb-19 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nope zbuild compile rogue for mac too

[21-Feb-19 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That's why the questions

[21-Feb-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if zbuild works... guess just use that

[21-Feb-19 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[21-Feb-19 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That take long time then 😅

okay so I have daemon running and have a second terminal running. I'm on main screen but tried to start single player game
```python

[21-Feb-19 02:50 AM] Regnar#6164
says I have zero warriors

[21-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep. Happens every night

[21-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Jk

[21-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
But yeah that happened to me again a bit ago

[21-Feb-19 02:56 AM] Regnar#6164
hmm still getting no players available to select. I tried set warriors name and that said it worked, but still says I have none.

[21-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm assuming I need some rogue to start?

[21-Feb-19 03:05 AM] TonyL#3577
@Regnar check if you're in sync and have all blocks

[21-Feb-19 03:05 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I thought it gave you some to start too.

[21-Feb-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Behaviour which you posted happens when daemon isn't fully synced

[21-Feb-19 03:06 AM] Regnar#6164
hmm I think I figured it out

[21-Feb-19 03:07 AM] Regnar#6164
one sec

[21-Feb-19 03:07 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll add some chain sync validation in next version

[21-Feb-19 03:08 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sent a PM Tony , whenever you have time. I walked away from it. Getting grumpy at the game. Lol

[21-Feb-19 03:09 AM] Regnar#6164
it said I was on a fork, reorg of like 156 blocks so it shut down the daemon. I'm thinking I tried to play before it sync'd

I have a couple of things to finish writing and then I might have some more cool things to share.

[21-Feb-19 03:16 AM] wookie#7663
so, I stopped ROGUE daemon a couple of hours ago. just turned my laptop back on, restarted rogue daemon, but this time with my own pubkey. I ran the TUI, but when I try to check my warrior list, I get this error and was bumped out of the TUI:

[21-Feb-19 03:41 AM] Regnar#6164
-ac_cclib=rogue

[21-Feb-19 03:41 AM] Regnar#6164
put me on a fork again and shut down

[21-Feb-19 03:43 AM] wookie#7663
thanks, I see where I went wrong

[21-Feb-19 03:44 AM] Regnar#6164

Please help, human!

[21-Feb-19 04:35 AM] Regnar#6164
deleted the chain and trying from scratch, I was using -addnode= but am going to try -connect= when I finish loading up

[21-Feb-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL that game where you had 7800+ keystrokes but died on level 1... toward the end of the replay you are fighting against H:
(h) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(h) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.15
(s) hp.15
(h) hp.11
(k) hp.11
(s) hp.11
(h) hp.5
(s) hp.5
but duting the fight you are searching and hitting in different directions and then the H killed you

[21-Feb-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so I think what happened was one of the keystrokes files didnt get saved?

[21-Feb-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess it is time to add keystrokes tx queueing

[21-Feb-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I didn't search and quit with 5 hp (maybe autofight until someone is dead: f + direction arrow saving some special way)

[21-Feb-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
is it first time you used autofight?

[21-Feb-19 07:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, I'm using it for a week already

[21-Feb-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
for now I made the keystrokes buffer 8x bigger, so even this entire game would have fit in a single keystrokes tx

shexy 

[21-Feb-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Auto-fight allows to clear dungeons super fast 😃

[21-Feb-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
that creates other issues, but until I get tx queuing fixed, it seems a decent workaround

[21-Feb-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL can you gather a lot of rogue.530623577502174316.0 keystrokes files (from extract) and make one big file out of it? just make a zip file for me out of all the extracted files you can get

[21-Feb-19 08:07 AM] TonyL#3577

those are old games, likely buggy pattern

[21-Feb-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL is there build instructions for the windows rogue app?

[21-Feb-19 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
just the rogue app, not interested in the daemon and TUI

[21-Feb-19 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I see it's separated out in that build, might be able to use that exe

[21-Feb-19 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
How did you package TUI as exe?

[21-Feb-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i am converting rogue dapp to use curl

{Reactions}
🙌 

[21-Feb-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that will make it OS independent

[21-Feb-19 09:48 AM] ca333#0118
i will push the WIN mods to the rogue_multiOS branch shortly @Alright

[21-Feb-19 09:48 AM] ca333#0118
its final and OS independent

[21-Feb-19 09:52 AM] ca333#0118
@Alright - https://ufile.io/6u1ar <-- this is rogue.exe (game) 
not stat. dyn. checked and not secure reviewed/virus sacnned. Its based on the original rogue sources from our github repo. Built on our CD/CI infrastructure.

[21-Feb-19 09:52 AM] Alright#0419
Thanks, but I will wait for curl thing. I was going to have to edit the source where it calls `komodo-cli` anyway

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] Alright#0419
how did you do that for windows btw? just replace it will komodo-cli.exe?

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use that one as it does the komodo-cli.exe

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a while before I stabilize the next iteration

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think some keystrokes files are going missing

[21-Feb-19 09:53 AM] Alright#0419
@ca333 does that build have komodo-cli.exe commands included? or should I use .exe from packaged release for that?

[21-Feb-19 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright I've installed precompiled pip deps from wheels and then built --onefile executable  by PyInstaller (to question about TUI)

[21-Feb-19 09:57 AM] ca333#0118
@Alright that build i posted you is the "winyfied" rogue game using komodo-cli.exe - it will work on WIN. you d need to just add it to the dir you have komodod/cli.exe in.

[21-Feb-19 09:57 AM] ca333#0118
James will notify us when he has curl migration done - by then we will run another build test and merge all WIN related fixes to James (official) repo.

[21-Feb-19 09:58 AM] ca333#0118
if you re interested in the particular fixes: multiOS_nocurses branch has most WIN specific fixes puhsed.

[21-Feb-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
Thanks, will start playing with it

[21-Feb-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
btw @jl777c making a wrapper named `komodo-cli` worked on linux. This might be an easier solution for curl, not sure

[21-Feb-19 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
would just require a similar script for each OS

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jeezy#3408
ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL.(ROGUE) port.0 ()
you must copy ROGUE.conf from ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf (or equivalent location) to current dir

[21-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jeezy#3408
is this new?

[21-Feb-19 10:10 AM] barv#0867

use FSM branch or the external repo

[21-Feb-19 10:27 AM] barv#0867
thx @jl777c that worked

[21-Feb-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM branch has curl based rogue dapp. if to build with win, it could just work. also it is more reliable with playerdata and kinder too. regardless of game, your playerdata should be saved

[21-Feb-19 10:50 AM] jeezy#3408
will try FSM branch, cant seem to get jl777 to work
