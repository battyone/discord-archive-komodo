writing 0 to the NULL ptr will crash things

[13-Mar-19 08:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Kinda 0/0 ?

[13-Mar-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
illegal access of memory, very bad

[13-Mar-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway it is fixed now and i think we might finally have a deterministic playback and all OS!

@TonyL on MacOS. Quit with warrior alive, last keystroke was "confirmed". But gold amount was wrong and skill level was wrong too.

Gold was 1078, skill was level 7.

[14-Mar-19 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie Are you using daemon from bundle? Sounds pretty similar to issue with corrupted level hmm

[14-Mar-19 11:03 AM] wookie#7663
Yes. It's the latest 0.3 bundle.

[14-Mar-19 03:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm is only issue so far this 1 level lost on OSX?

[14-Mar-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Any Windows testers? 😃

[14-Mar-19 03:30 PM] ronyi#5719
Sorry, today i’m busy. I played 2 games on OS X without issue. I can help you soon.

[14-Mar-19 03:31 PM] TonyL#3577

[14-Mar-19 03:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Played a few more games. But all I quit before level 10. No issues.

[14-Mar-19 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Could you please clarify on what is the difference between gameheight and height in `cclib gameinfo 17` output?:
```  "gameheight": 12436,
  "height": 12436,
```

[14-Mar-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-Mar-19 04:46 PM] TonyL#3577

[14-Mar-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the height of the gametxid

[14-Mar-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm using `gameheight` in TUI

[14-Mar-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Please not remove this one 😃

[15-Mar-19 03:34 AM] wookie#7663
I quit this game with full HP, full strength, level 9. But the gold from this game was not converted to ROGUE. It's been a few hours since the game ended and still not on blockchain: 
Game txid: 0669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a

I also "lost" my warrior. Was clearly alive, but when I started a new game, I had no warrior.

[15-Mar-19 04:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie Try to execute bailout manually:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 '["0669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a"]'```

[15-Mar-19 04:15 AM] wookie#7663
every time?

[15-Mar-19 04:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope - usually it broadcast from first attempt. It seems just not in 100% of cases.

Will add now to TUI waiting for bailout tx confirmation with re-broadcasting attempts (same as for last keystroke)

[15-Mar-19 04:44 AM] wookie#7663
I just tried the manual bailout now, I get the same issue: 
in the window running the daemon, it shows only this:
extracted $$$gold.1501 -> 2.02770090 ROGUE hp.53 strength.16/16 level.9 exp.1794 dl.9 n.1 amulet.0

[15-Mar-19 04:45 AM] wookie#7663
normally there's more after that. this one is just "stuck"

[15-Mar-19 04:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Is CLI printing txid and hex on your bailout call?

[15-Mar-19 04:51 AM] wookie#7663
yes

[15-Mar-19 04:52 AM] wookie#7663
I waited a few minutes more, but nothing else came out, so I ran the manual bailout again and this time I got an extra line:
extracted $$$gold.1501 -> 2.02770090 ROGUE hp.53 strength.16/16 level.9 exp.1794 dl.9 n.1 amulet.0

But still nothing on the block explorer

[15-Mar-19 04:53 AM] wookie#7663
that 2 ROGUEs still not showing up at the address

[15-Mar-19 04:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Check if transaction id generated by bailout call appears in explorer / mempool

[15-Mar-19 04:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's just not confirmed yet

[15-Mar-19 04:54 AM] wookie#7663
entered this: 0d19747711c993391b297777484e35e0ca92285b206916bb8b134058aa2b92c3
and explorer says No matching records found

[15-Mar-19 04:55 AM] wookie#7663
I ended this game almost 5 hours ago

[15-Mar-19 04:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Try the following please:

In one terminal window:
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/ROGUE/debug.log

In second:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"


And check what first window printing after bailout call

[15-Mar-19 05:01 AM] wookie#7663
got this:
2019-03-15 05:00:37 ERROR: CheckTransaction(): txout.nValue negative

[15-Mar-19 05:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please share your call and full CLI output here please (with hex)?

[15-Mar-19 05:07 AM] wookie#7663
the first one when I first exited the game, or the one from the manual bailout?

[15-Mar-19 05:07 AM] TonyL#3577

I have problems with bailout broadcasting also (on Linux).
Maybe bailout transactions not broadcasting at all at the moment, hmm.
Added to TUI attempt to broadcast until it on blockchain:

[15-Mar-19 05:27 AM] TonyL#3577

[15-Mar-19 05:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, and for this game with `couldnt finalize CCtx` - just bailout already done so made mistake somewhere in fresh commit logic

@jl777c https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/5bQsgY77Mh/ looks very scary by some reasons can't broadcast bailout for this game with such errors in debug log (tx not accepting to mempool at all)

[15-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Added waiting for bailout confirmation to TUI - so now such cases detecting by long waiting (when bailout not broadcasting on chain)

[15-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder this problem was actual before - just wasn't tracked (both ronyi and wookie reported before about similar cases - now with tracking easiliy reproduced on my side)

[15-Mar-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like it is using a vin that got reorged. the bailout needs to be done again and post the rawtx

[15-Mar-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Exactly same behaviour on new attempt (and few hours passed since first ones):

that is the problem. 0.0095 claimed vs 160 sats earned

glad it isnt a CC signature issue. i guess daemon was in a different screen so couldnt see the critical prints

[15-Mar-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
gold of 4 would be 160 sats

[15-Mar-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so bailout is using the wrong amount somehow?

[15-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, seems like it's the clue

[15-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
4 * 4 * 10 = 160 yup

[15-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's an edge case because too little progress

[15-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the bailout should be printing $$$gold -> ...

[15-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's in paste:

[15-Mar-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
extracted 4 gold but mismatched cashout amount

[15-Mar-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe something is wrong with vouts struct?

[15-Mar-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
replay the game and see what the dapp does

[15-Mar-19 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
I see my short game and 4 gold

[15-Mar-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
found it!

pushed fix. non-consensus change, so no need to update all nodes, just nodes that have this problem

[15-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it was indeed a problem with short games, where the gold cashout was less than the txfee

[15-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
this made it not generate the cashout vout2, which then would fail the vout2 check in validation

[15-Mar-19 08:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so games with less than 10000 satoshi reward were affected?

[15-Mar-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, all such short games would have failed

[15-Mar-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Yay, it's huge fix!

[15-Mar-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
May it somehow be connected with not passing bailout of wookie?
He have a long game and bailout not accepting with:
```2019-03-15 05:00:37 ERROR: CheckTransaction(): txout.nValue negative
2019-03-15 05:00:37 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: CheckTransaction failed```

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie When you'll be with PC:
Could you please restart daemon with --daemon param (restart to be sure that see all prints) and call again: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%220669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a%22]"``` and post full output to: https://paste.ubuntu.com

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems different. what is the decoded tx?

[15-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
does it have a negative vout value?
