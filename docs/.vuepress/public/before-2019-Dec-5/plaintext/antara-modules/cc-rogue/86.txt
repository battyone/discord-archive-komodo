I think more interesting might be mode like a: who will extract more gold in 20-30 minites win the game or something like this (more dynamic and with countable score result).Lets say auto bailout based on current extract making on block X and gold counting to decide the winner. 

 But here community opinion is important - it's just my personal one 😀

[07-Mar-19 11:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm idea is pretty straight forward:

1) Add game length param (in blocks amount) to multiplayer games creation 
2) After game_end_length height is reached dont accept more keystrokes from players
3)  After it on game_end_length height  decide winner  from players extracts based on most gold collected and send buyins to winner

It will allow to create blitz games, rapid games, long games and etc so player will be able to decide which game join/create depends of how much free time he have / in which mode he interested in + winner determination  and in-game goal is clear and understandable in such case and strategy when you not start game and waiting for everybody die will not work.

@jl777c How do you think is it worth to be implemented?

[08-Mar-19 12:31 AM] Cryptofist#7504

I like the idea of multiple multiplayer formats, but we will need an interface to do that, correct?

[08-Mar-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Some modificaitons in CC needed (new param for game creation + keystrokes accepting lock / auto game finishing with gold calculation in extracts)
Displaying GUI/TUI have to handle (check how much blocks left in active game and show countdown X blocks left till finish)

[08-Mar-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
I already thought about implementation from TUI side: I think I can just open rogue subprocess in new terminal window and print constantly updating information about current game state in TUI terminal (looks like simpliest solution to not defect rogue gameplay)

[08-Mar-19 05:18 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm going to push for some more people to come test again now. Is there any updates on a windows installer?   Do we have anything important to look at right now and can we maybe try the form bounty again?

[08-Mar-19 05:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Or any other incentives for testers?

[08-Mar-19 06:11 AM] TonyL#3577
There are no any updates regards Windows one yet (it's not saving progress and I'm not sure atm how to troubleshoot it). I think it's better to start such bounty when Windows version will be ready. Will try to research some solution for win from my side today. I think that maybe it's some specifics of windows terminal and will try to play on some Unix terminal ported to Windows or something like that - maybe it'll help.

Possible to create "setpubkey.bat" create new address and print new address with private key for new players and set pubkey and write, how to start this game next time? Or this is stupid idea?

[08-Mar-19 07:25 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI setting pubkey automatically if it wasn't set in daemon params, copying ROGUE.conf also and waiting for sync (tested on Windows and it worked)

[08-Mar-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but not sure if it'll be the same each time btw

[08-Mar-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
It using address from `getaccountaddress ""`

[08-Mar-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to save this pubkey to file also I think and if there pubkey.txt file grab it from there

[08-Mar-19 07:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Write it somewhere it's definetly great idea @ronyi

make sure to get build instructions from him and maybe we can get a stable windows bundle

[08-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
for multiplayer, i think being able to see the other players games as they do new levels is needed

[08-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so that would require to extract the other players games and then show a replay in a window when it changes in size

[08-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
probably would need a way to pause a replay and add keystrokes to it

[08-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Don't like the idea with limited game duration / most gold collected winner?

[08-Mar-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be pretty random based on gold generated on the levels

Hey @CrisF ! What do you mean by is correct?

{Reactions}
👋 

[08-Mar-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
some games there is a lot of gold, others not much at all  and every action changes the RNG

[08-Mar-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is if we want rogue to be more a game of skill or of luck

[08-Mar-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but surviving is the point of luck as well since a lot of things based on RNG

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
And if you playing longer and faster becaause of skills you can collect more gold

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, binary state of killed or survived, vs random gold amounts...

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a poker - combination of luck and skills

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
like winning or losing based on how many S you killed

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
what if your levels didnt have many snakes

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
On distation skilled player will win despite of luck swings

[08-Mar-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is already a big luck component

[08-Mar-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810

`Some combination collected gold and killed monsters and highest lvl?` might be too complicated for player to understand how it's calculating but sounds interesting - can be abstracted to some ROGUE score, or rogue-hot level 😃

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Can make rumbles like a 5-10 minutes games and you have to destroy/collect everything to get highest score

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] ronyi#5719
if collect 700gold/50killed monster * lvl7

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to make formula with weights argumented by in-game RNG to keep the balance

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] ronyi#5719
I think is much more correct way than highest lvl or more collected gold or time based solution. But i don't know the right formula. 😄

@ronyi You may find your gametxid in `cclib games 17` past games (or in not finished games if bailout wasn't actually broadcasted)
Then check `cclib gameinfo 17` for this game if you need to find a seed

[08-Mar-19 11:32 AM] ronyi#5719
I not find my seed in my gameinfo. rogue.573308751621131768.x

It is possible to get seed only from gameinfo - like a no other ways to get it
