Windows is not currently working.  You can use a virtual  machine with ubuntu to run it on windows.

[28-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
We will update everyone when we have a solid windows installer.

[28-Feb-19 12:39 PM] ciumete#3212
now i build for linux, let's see if working...

[28-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sounds good!

[28-Feb-19 01:21 PM] ronyi#5719
cautiously, there are many strange things

[28-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Indeed @ronyi

[28-Feb-19 01:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
*"Strange things are afoot at the circle K"*

[28-Feb-19 01:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I haven't had many issues myself since I did a make clean and new install.  I ran three games this morning and only lost a warrior when I cancelled out of TUI on accident

[28-Feb-19 01:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I use Ctrl + C a crap ton on a daily basis (Photoshop, Evernote ) and messed myself up.

[28-Feb-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem things got destabilized... i wont be able to fix it till tomorrow. somehow the playerdata is going to a totally different address? that seems the worst issue

[28-Feb-19 02:18 PM] _PureHate_#9411
on mac game freez on start

[28-Feb-19 02:19 PM] _PureHate_#9411
anyway 10.12.6

[28-Feb-19 02:23 PM] _PureHate_#9411
its ok now

[28-Feb-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810

Take you r time jl777

[28-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is there a way to rollback? Use the FSM branch?

[28-Feb-19 04:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@_PureHate_  When was the last time you updated and how did you do so?

[28-Feb-19 04:51 PM] ronyi#5719
I tryed FSM branch, but failed on linux.

[28-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I updated to what ever Tony told me too and it works mostly fine.

[28-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
```cd ~/komodo
git checkout jl777
git pull
make clean
cd src
rm komodod komodo-cli komodo-tx *.so
cd cc
rm *.so
cd rogue 
make clean
make
cd ../../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) ```

[28-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
For this I was also told to Ignore error messages given during install and keep going.

[28-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
My warriors die and come back every time now.

[28-Feb-19 05:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
BUUUUUUT like JL said. It's dead broken. Can't guarantee it will work.

[28-Feb-19 05:06 PM] ronyi#5719
We use FSM branch or jl777? I deleted all komodo dir.

[28-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I use jl777

awthanks

[28-Feb-19 05:07 PM] ronyi#5719
Okay thank you.

[28-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It mostly works for me aside from zombie tokens

[28-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
---- I'm going to pull the testing posts until we have a good feeling about updates again. I'll position the idea in my wrote up as something we will do next week. Maybe drum up more interest.

[28-Feb-19 05:47 PM] _PureHate_#9411
@Cryptofist  at time posting and i start from scratch  aftett build i run the game manually coz no way yet to use rogue_tui.py

[28-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Got it

[28-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So tony + I both had the game freeze issue, then we came to that last set of instructions I have posted,  to make it work.

[28-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
basically double delete things and reinstall and then we didnt have the lockdown upon start

[28-Feb-19 05:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think there is an issue upon start unless you do it that specific way

[28-Feb-19 05:53 PM] _PureHate_#9411
my first mistake was unzipping to /komodo instead of /komodo/src after ni freez but i play 30sec

[28-Feb-19 05:53 PM] _PureHate_#9411

i run bailout for this and creat new game start it get killed and same if i want to restart

[28-Feb-19 09:37 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'd like to show multiplayer set up at some point , joining  and game play in a 3-8 minute long video.  if we need to do a couple of rounds to get a good recording that is fine by me.  It might take us a solid day of playing to do so. 

Soooo... If you can, lets all get some high level characters built.  We can use them next week (maybe later depending on bugs) for a multiplayer session, that we can all play slowly to record. If we all have a google account of some type I think we can all stream our screens  in a one screen stream .   I know there is the bug with 3 player but we can see what we can accomplish anyway.  I might push it directly to gaming.youtube.com

any idea why I cannot sync past height 12972
I get

or how to fix it?

[01-Mar-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
From which repo/branch are you using daemon @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ and how fresh is it?

Try to build from FSM

[01-Mar-19 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
that is FSM

[01-Mar-19 01:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Ouch

[01-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577

shuts it down and goes back to üì∫ until later

[01-Mar-19 01:42 AM] TonyL#3577
If it's broken on jl777 and can't sync on FSM unlikely we can do something until his fixes

[01-Mar-19 01:42 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
any idea of a known good commit that I can pull?

[01-Mar-19 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it might break things even more. Do you want sync to play or mine? If to mine - try to use jl777 branch - maybe it'll sync, if to play - I think there is no way to relatively smooth gameplay atm if FSM not syncing

[01-Mar-19 01:45 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
atm I just need the chain and a working transaction

[01-Mar-19 02:05 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
That didn't work either @TonyL same auto shutdown based on fork ‚òπ 
Giess I'll have to wait and play with pool later

[01-Mar-19 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ Just synced fine from scratch on jl777.
Do you have `rogue` calls in `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclibinfo` output?

use jl777 branch @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  Maybe look at what i posted above ? It worked great for me twice

[01-Mar-19 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
just merged a fix in that allows it to sync, both braches

[01-Mar-19 04:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Building, will try to sync from scratch

[01-Mar-19 05:09 AM] TonyL#3577
jl777 with latest merge synced fine from scratch

[01-Mar-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the last I saw, everything was broken? but that seems hard to understand as all I changed was keystrokes tx handling

[01-Mar-19 05:14 AM] TonyL#3577
A lot of issues were reported, some deadlocks, I lost warriors somehow on bailouts

[01-Mar-19 05:14 AM] TonyL#3577
```So what we have for now:

1) Deadlock on bailout
komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22]" -> (Minironyi) found baton 22b7f6bb559eb3919a2c0de2b51dfb0135dab73f683091ce96d756faf2ac8cee numkeys.1417 seed.1862856489122242256 playerdata.812 Node just hanging.

2) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with"couldnt find batontxid" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

3) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - invalid gametxid, or already started  on game start and bailout with warrior gone

-) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in 2 (mentioned in report) 
UPD: it happened in these strange times when I lost warriors - and now I enlarged warrior strength and he started with 17/17 so I wonder it can be not reviewed on this point

-) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):
UPD: not reproducible at the moment 
```

[01-Mar-19 05:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Strength 17/16 - never was before as well üòÉ

[01-Mar-19 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
When I lost warriors - in bailout vout with gold was sent to my address, warriors were sent to not my address

[01-Mar-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so the warriors were created, just sent to the wrong address. let me check

[01-Mar-19 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
There are bailout/game txids in googledoc

[01-Mar-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n is not the CC address for RF4G3G8ewN5TA6itxs7nXCY28iADaFW5sy ?

[01-Mar-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/dbb8c979b96b5ccd9465a1e6c3f07e9ec684628ae0a5386988d3b1e2a335f33a

[01-Mar-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the code is sending the NFT to the mypk CC address

[01-Mar-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I really have hard time to believe this all of a sudden broke. could you have been running a daemon with a different -pubkey= value?

[01-Mar-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
what are some typical lines from rogue.sendlog

[01-Mar-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that disables looping on waiting for last keystrokes file to be finished

[01-Mar-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577
It might be a good explanation if pubkey was wrong on this node - I felt myself not very well yesterday so mistake is possible + nobody else had the same problem. Shouldn't gold be sent on not my address too in such case?

[01-Mar-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
RF4G3G8ewN5TA6itxs7nXCY28iADaFW5sy is the gold address and RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n is the matched CC address

[01-Mar-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, removing the while loop should fix the deadlock

Yes it's some random address it seems - thats why I was very confused

[01-Mar-19 05:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a gold sending to me - but warriors disappear to nowhere, and nobody else have such issue

[01-Mar-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
more than one node using that address does this same thing?

[01-Mar-19 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
I wasn't able to reproduce from other node

[01-Mar-19 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
But if I use pubkey from this node on other node - I can see only 1 warrior in list as well
