buy  gamble boxes with loot for $ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder there is no any donation stuff planning

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Point is that there are DEX features embeed

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] jeezy#3408
im kidding

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
So you can trade your warrior with very unique loot

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
But in general you might implement your very own lootboxes on top

[20-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Just farm a lot of warriors

[20-Feb-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And then sell it in boxes - user paying lets say 2 ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 08:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Will individual gear (items) be tradable too, Tony?

[20-Feb-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And can randomly receive good or bad warrior

[20-Feb-19 08:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I see.

I played 10 games and only have 0.001 is that correct?

[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] jeezy#3408
collected 100+ gold each game

[20-Feb-19 08:57 AM] jeezy#3408
but I died every time maybe I should try to  bailout alive

[20-Feb-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to bailout alive and track your balance. I've not carefully tracked my balance when played so may be wrong that gold collecting by dead player

[20-Feb-19 09:02 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
200-300 gold and a bail out gets you about 0.15 rogue ish from my experience. 1200 gold got me about 0.6 rogue on bailout one time

[20-Feb-19 09:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
do i need to update anything before trying today?

[20-Feb-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha so 0.0005 per gold

[20-Feb-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
@CryptoNinjaa It's easy to check if you need an update - if `git pull` in komodo and TUI folders returned not `Already up to date` it means that update is needed üòÉ

@TonyL   would it not make sense to skip bailout block waiting if you died on your first mob without collecting gold?

How to get step by step actions printouts? I think maybe I did something "special" again on place where it's interrupting, but in replay nothing special happened on last frame

[20-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
I'm getting `didnt register in time, ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP` when I try to register to a game

[20-Feb-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
any idea why? I'm doing it immediately after the newgame tx is broadcast

@benohanlon sure - if you can push it towards end of week would be good (for sake of multi OS compatibility and potential non-techy installer scripts/bundles)

[20-Feb-19 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
@ronyi are you able to get the actual rogue app running?

[20-Feb-19 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
the `rogue.c` source needs to be edited it or we need a wrapper for when it calls `komodo-cli` so it will issue rpc commands instead

[20-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jeezy#3408
can I not see which characters are on a specific pubkey?

[20-Feb-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
You can if you start daemon with `-pubkey=` param of pubkey for which you want to see it

[20-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jeezy#3408
I'm always using new characters, trying to level some up  and save them

[20-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jeezy#3408
I did that

[20-Feb-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
In this case `cclib players 17` will display characters for this pubkey

[20-Feb-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
`Tony, this is happening after trying to start a sp game for me`
With or without rogue source code modifications?
