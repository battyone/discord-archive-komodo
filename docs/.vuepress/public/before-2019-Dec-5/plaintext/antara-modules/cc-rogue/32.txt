It's just a model name

[16-Feb-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Customers here means players - business anyone who operate GUI

[16-Feb-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
with high stakes buyin games, people can do level by level commentary on each of the players

[16-Feb-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also top players will be showing how to win to other players

[16-Feb-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Can prepare by watching top players replays and own to find any mistakes or places where you can play better

[16-Feb-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess a function to scan the blockchain for top warriors would be cool

[16-Feb-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh nice idea

[16-Feb-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm scanning now for all warrirors, can filter it and make a top X list

[16-Feb-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
then find their pubkeys and watch them play. I guess I need to put pause, forward/backward controls in the replay. but that actually seems not so hard to add

[16-Feb-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
remind me if I forget

Keystroke by keystroke would be great, and also ability to check what warrior have in inventory on this moment

[16-Feb-19 09:12 PM] TonyL#3577
To understand which possibilities he have now

[16-Feb-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be a bit harder, i will see what I can do. I guess if it is just looking at inventory that is ok

[16-Feb-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe possible to permanently print it let's say on right side of the screen (without watcher interaction)

[16-Feb-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Will make now top20 warriors rating ranged by experience

[16-Feb-19 09:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Whats the minimum amount of gold needed to Quit and save your warrior?

[16-Feb-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
1

[16-Feb-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you also kill 1 monster

[16-Feb-19 09:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Noted

[16-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
There are so many bits of info to take note. I got a good little list going.

[16-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Any other Rogue Chain specific things that should be mentioned to new players, please please let me know.

[16-Feb-19 09:19 PM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptofist are you planning to release a blog post with the info you are taking notes of? would be good for new users.

[16-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think I have the basics from A-B now.

[16-Feb-19 09:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep

[16-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I want to make sure getting the game going and playing for the first time is  clearly presented.

[16-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Or we are all gonna be answering the same questions for a few weeks.

[16-Feb-19 09:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so when I quit: It then says I quit with 56 Gold, What happens? Does the Gold convert to Rogue automagically?

[16-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
when the bailout tx confirms you will get 0.0005 ROGUE per gold for a single player game

[16-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
0.001 for multiplayer

[16-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
0.01 if you win the multiplayer

[16-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Multi-player is not working yet, correct?

[16-Feb-19 09:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I finally saved a warrior! üèÅ

[16-Feb-19 09:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Losing that glitched game warrior sucks, I had all kinds of crazy stuff.

[16-Feb-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
multiplayer has been coded but not sure if anybody ever tested it

[16-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
OK

[16-Feb-19 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe it works flawlessly, or maybe it will crash and burn

[16-Feb-19 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
added couple of good info to the guide

[16-Feb-19 09:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Awesome!!!

[16-Feb-19 09:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do I load a  saved warrior to play?
Will he remain saved as it is now IF I play then he dies?

[16-Feb-19 09:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im using the TUI at the moment.

[16-Feb-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
he is a collectible until he is put into a game

[16-Feb-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
he is on the blockchain so will be there

[16-Feb-19 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
only if you play a game with him, is he at risk. just need to get some gold, kill a monster and bailout before you get kille

[16-Feb-19 09:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Got it!

[16-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm going to see if i can recreate the glitch of randomness  I did earlier.

(that took way too many tries :'

[16-Feb-19 10:19 PM] JvdP#8992
anyway, question is... am I doing something wrong or is this supposed to take very long?

[16-Feb-19 10:19 PM] JvdP#8992
mempool option in the TUI shows the transaction

[16-Feb-19 10:20 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to wait for the tx to be mined

[16-Feb-19 10:23 PM] JvdP#8992
Thanks! That's what I figured initially, but how long should I expect this to take?

[16-Feb-19 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
it should be running already now. new blocks are there http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/

[16-Feb-19 10:26 PM] JvdP#8992
Noob question, but how can I tell?

[16-Feb-19 10:27 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo` and check the number of `blocks` and `longestchain`

[16-Feb-19 10:28 PM] JvdP#8992
got 'em. they're the same. 20415

[16-Feb-19 10:28 PM] JvdP#8992
same as on the explorer

[16-Feb-19 10:30 PM] SHossain#0007
then, if your game didn't start yet, use CTRL+C and start `./rogue_tui.py` again

[16-Feb-19 10:31 PM] JvdP#8992
alright, hitting that. stand by.,..

There is no easy way to check if warrior dead or alive so counting all - it's kinda high-score board

[16-Feb-19 10:44 PM] JvdP#8992
Alright so I'm rolling. Just bailed out. When I was playing I had a "brown potion" and a scroll that said "blah blah something". Once bailed out, my inventory reveals what these things really were (1 - yay I managed to bail out, 2 - they were potion of magic detection and scroll of remove curse, resp.). Should that be the case?

Thank you for joining the dungeon adventures! üòÉ

[16-Feb-19 11:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c If warrior max strength more than 16 (possible to permanently increase max. strength by strength gain potions) and you quit game (let's say with max strength and current strength 18).
When start next game with this warrior: max strength will be 18 but current strength is always 16. 
Is it possible to transfer current strength between games same as hp? It might be not a big clue when your max strength is <20 but if you improved max strength much - should be quite annoying

[16-Feb-19 11:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@JvdP  Welcome! How did you find out about the game and what made you come to test it?

[16-Feb-19 11:08 PM] JvdP#8992
darn, just got killed when I glitched/spawned next to a bunch of bad guys... all in a day's work I guess

[16-Feb-19 11:20 PM] JvdP#8992
anyway turns out it's past midnight and I should really get some rest before driving >6 hrs tomorrow. might have gotten carried away here. Thanks for your help here, and for creating stuff that's so fun that people will see how useful it is. Until next time!

He had said ```well barring catastrophic problem or abuse, it will become the official mainchain```
```just keep in mind the chain might get reset back to genesis
or not
do you feel lucky?```
