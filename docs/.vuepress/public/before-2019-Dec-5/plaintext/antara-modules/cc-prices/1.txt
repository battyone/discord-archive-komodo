./makeprices to create the .so for prices dapp
cc/games/prices starts a very simple game, it isnt complete yet, but I thought I would explain what it is about
there is a reference node based on -ac_pubkey which is posting special reference tx with the price of BTC/USD by using the dapp
all other nodes also run the dapp and you can change the betsize with ^ or /, and change the price premium with + or -

[28-Mar-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
every 10 seconds your node will make a bet of betsize with the adjusted BTC/USD price

[28-Mar-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
these bets will then be compared to a future blocks reference prices to determine the winner(s). for now i set it to 3 blocks gap, so if you can predict BTC/USD prices half hour ahead, you will win more often than not

[28-Mar-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
just a simple example of bet (lock) and settle based on external data, though i still need to get the settle part working

[28-Mar-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
while it is in games CC and thus supports the rogue game rpc calls, most of them dont really apply, as this is an always running game

So binary options in the blockchain is born?

[28-Mar-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is more a contest among all participants to see who is the most accurate (without going all crazy with protections against miners cheating and having a trusted reference price source). Still not sure how to determine payouts. I have a block full of predictions.

[28-Mar-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I am wondering if to aggregate by pubkey and choose the pubkey with the most accurate prediction, or just find the single bet that was most accurate

[28-Mar-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be many reference points, so maybe the closest to each one wins...

[28-Mar-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
many ways to do this and it is just a proof of concept, so I think I will just do a simple aggregation of the reference and then find the closest to make a winner take all for that block. the way the dapp works is that you are making a new bet every 10 seconds, so it shouldnt be a disaster even if you dont win in a specific block

[28-Mar-19 05:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like super interesting gambling. 
Is it testable already? 😃

there was a bug in determining if a price was within tolerance

[29-Mar-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
with all the cryptos, there are now occasional >1% changes

[29-Mar-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
a few other edge cases too, so now just need to see what happens with a 1% clamped block when the real price is beyond the 1%. online nodes should accept it, worst case if they reject it, they should get stuck for a bit and then rejoin the main chain when a new block arrives

[29-Mar-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is no valid miner making good blocks, the chain will stall. that is the one different with the trustless oracle. if things are not right, it will just stop

[29-Mar-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
now that the raw prices are coming in, the next layer is adding consensus prices based on the raw prices. due to the required delay for using the prices for settlement of money results, I plan to use the prior days blocks to generate the consensus price. Once we have that, it should be slower to adjust, but could be relied upon to be non-manipulated

[29-Mar-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
however, the nature of removing any manipulation requires a majority consensus (within an epsilon factor) starting from a deterministic random starting point in a rotating buffer. so as you can see, the price output wont be very smooth at all

[29-Mar-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so I think we will need a third layer of smoothed consensus prices, which can finally be used for settlements block by block. it should behave as approx a daily SMA

[29-Mar-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
which means when making a bet the context is the current price, the prior days smoothed price, so there will be a fair amount of inertia to the price. I guess having something that displays the prices would be very good to have

only one node missed one price change during todays giant revaluation across the board. it is a very rare case, but it got hit and pretty sure I can make it better. just restarting made it sync up though, so i think it isnt so bad as it is, but might as well make it handle even very volatile conditions. after that I  think it is open for price attack testing. the code should just make any node that mines invalid prices to go off on its own fork, so as long as there is one honest miner, the chain will continue to advance. that is the theory

@gcharang ok, it is syncing to existing chain from scratch now (with the 3 restarts). still working on rpc calls,but the next level consensus code is active. I havent verified it stays in sync yet, so still experimental status. there is even a prices rpc call that returns most recent prices, but the prices logic is still being worked on for the second two prices of each block

[02-Apr-19 03:03 PM] gcharang#6833
thank you, will keep that in mind while experimenting

@TonyL PRICES chain now has prices rpc working. it shows the specified number of samples and 3 prices per sample: mined, correlated, smoothed
