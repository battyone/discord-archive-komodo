Oh right, there is no `prices` method in cclib. But crash is not gentle way to say about it aha :)
Got the samples. Is samples amount depth some fixed number and it will shift or it will just stack each other until inifinity?

http://159.69.45.70:8050/ made super basic POC. It grabbing one price data only (from 3) and with fixed depth.
Have an other widescale and urgent task ongoing atm. Will polish this oracle visualisation server asap

[03-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
ok. no rush. I synced FSM branch with current jl777, about to make changes for new coinbase format that will break existing ac_cbopret chains

[03-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
now the prices layer seems reasonably stable, i will start on the next step. but the prices dapp is still not in the next cycle as I need a bit more infrastructure in place

[03-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
which of the three prices is that site showing?

[03-Apr-19 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Great! These data viz frameworks are very user-friendly so took only 1 hour for some working example. I think if work on it few days - it's possible to make very cool interactive web-plots

[03-Apr-19 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577

[03-Apr-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm taking only 10 timestamps in this demo-version so thats why so short timescale

[03-Apr-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
144 for a day

[03-Apr-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
my calcs are based on prior 2 days + 7 data points

I think I made it static for now (list loading once when I'm starting the server)

At the moment I'm making CSV from prices output and displaying it from this file - will make a simple script now which refreshing this CSV each minute let's say so will be possible to get more actual data on page refresh

[03-Apr-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577

üëå 

[03-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain the problem is that the trustless oracles allow anybody to mine a block and as long as it is within 1% of previous block and a nodes local data, it is accepted

[03-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
still it is possible for a miner to consistently bias the price by up to 1%, maybe a bit more

[03-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we are allowing leverage even a 0.5% biasing of price will skew the results of a 100x leveraged bet

[03-Apr-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so....

[03-Apr-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to randomize the price that is actually used. while the blue line by miners looks actually quite good, there were no attackers during this period

[03-Apr-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the algo is to use a deterministic random starting point within the past day. starting from that point if there are 51% of the prior days prices that are within 3% of the starting price, the correlated price is the starting price. I tried to smooth the correlated data but as we can see from the orange it isnt very smooth at all. and the green data is not any better, so I need to restart from the very raw data and see what it looks like. that is what the current version does

[03-Apr-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I am hoping the orange becomes a lot more randomized, but the green to be somewhat smoothed

[03-Apr-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
though thinking about it, the orange is actually not so bad considering the constraints it is under
