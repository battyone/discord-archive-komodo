why is redline strange?

[24-Apr-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
It's connected to dimxy repo daemon

[24-Apr-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Graphs part I not touched at all

[24-Apr-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
But it looks totally different from http://159.69.45.70:8050/ which connected to jl777

[24-Apr-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what I am saying.

[24-Apr-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
greenline seems wrong

[24-Apr-19 05:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Orange fluctuate very little also

[24-Apr-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it makes it a much more realtime signal. maybe it is some test version i made. whatever it is, maybe we consider using that mode?

[24-Apr-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Lines on this graph http://18.219.69.40:777/ looks adequate, not sure what is the difference in calculations

[24-Apr-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in the smooth function call

[24-Apr-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe it is due to DAYWINDOW 7

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[24-Apr-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that makes it a one hour delay

[24-Apr-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
this opens up 2% attack

[24-Apr-19 05:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Most probably - it's daemon with DAYWINDOW 7, yes

[24-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that explains it

[24-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
redline needs to be shifted by DAYWINDOW

[24-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
or not displayed if it is so short

[24-Apr-19 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, I see - it shifting same 24 hours what have no sense with such daemon

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
http://18.219.69.40:777/ - changed shift to 1 hour

[24-Apr-19 05:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Difference is visible only with zoom now, so can just not display it in this mode

[24-Apr-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
agreed

[24-Apr-19 07:08 PM] dimxy#2587
What I am still concerned with is how to get the cashout price.
it was suggested to use the smoothed price at the cashout moment for it.
But smoothed price is calculated as 24h-period-averaged value and it is actually correlated to raw price at 24h ago point. 
So at the cashout moment the actual raw price might be high, but we may get it it as low just because it was also low 24h ago.

[24-Apr-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the average value of DAYWINDOW

[24-Apr-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is correlated to the average value, so maybe 12 hours ago if it is a steady increase/decline

[24-Apr-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
since we calculate the costbasis from the smoothed, what is wrong with using smoothed for cashout?

[24-Apr-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
for longer term positions, it wont really matter that much

[24-Apr-19 07:21 PM] dimxy#2587
ok, I'll make changes and let's see what we get as profits/losses and compare it with the chart

[25-Apr-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
is it my imagination or is this getting almost ready for public testing?

[25-Apr-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we can start testing before all the validations as getting user feedback is likely an important factor that will take time and can be done in parallel with validation

[25-Apr-19 07:46 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I'm finishing the lastest changes for added bets and  making the validation less strict
and  hope it is ready for testing

[25-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c how does the whole concept look like? will u be able to bet on any crypto either going up or down? will u pay with that crypto u bet on and get paid in that crypto or will there be a standard coin/token used?

[25-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
for now you bet in the native coin, but we plan to add token betting

[25-Apr-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
with token betting you could then bet the supported gateways CC coins

[25-Apr-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you can bet long or short, with margin for any synthetic you can construct out of the prices at http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[25-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
@dimxy you will need to have some global exposure based limiting of positionsize leverage

[25-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be possible to be exact but you should be able to deterministically calculate the total amount of bets that are possible to accept in a given block

[25-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
then using that to approve/reject bets during validation

[25-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
this way, we can avoid the system being bankrupted no matter what and if people want to allow more bets, additional funds need to be able to be added to the global balance

[25-Apr-19 01:57 PM] dimxy#2587
so it probably should take into account existing bets and  total bankroll  amount and set some bet limit to protect bankroll to go negative?

[25-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so at first only small bets would be able to do maxleverage

[25-Apr-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but as people get rekt the bankroll gets bigger and people can bet more and more

[25-Apr-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
I want to make a REKT as a sidechain for BET, and then have the profits go to snapshot payments CC

[25-Apr-19 02:48 PM] Markus#5464
Will there be a explorer or so for open positions/rekt contracts/closed positions?

[25-Apr-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm working on demo interface (http://18.219.69.40:777/)

[25-Apr-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
So it's not hard to get lists of open/closed positions now and I think that somebody will make beauty explorer

[25-Apr-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i forgot to mention that anybody can rekt any open position eligible to be rekt and collect a fee. sort of like mining

[25-Apr-19 03:15 PM] TonyL#3577
First person who will implement rekt mining pool (which will not mine coins but rekt positions) should be monopolist for some time üòÉ

Have also no luck so far with ```* /  ! ``` symbols usage

* and / need 2 values in stack

[25-Apr-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Apr-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577

Will the bankroll be generated through a premine? Also if gateways cc is used how will the bankroll be generated?

[25-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
bankroll will need to be funded if it is a sidechain

[25-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is a standalone chain then there can be a premine, but then you arent betting anything with known value

all validation needs to be disabled until it is merged into my repo and I update all my nodes

I've reviewed all validation once more (updated my repo). Might need to use reconsiderblock to force sync

[26-Apr-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that my nodes are not running with any validation, so if the validation on your nodes reject any tx it will fork

yes as TonyL use my repo with faulty validation he might need to  force resync after updating

and totals after it

[26-Apr-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are allowing more funds to be added, but each is treated as an independent bet? with the 24hrs scanning for MAX costbasis

[26-Apr-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise future knowledge is being used with the addition of funds

[26-Apr-19 07:25 AM] dimxy#2587
For a new added bet I calculate a new costbasis beginning from the block where the bet was added and for 24h  (as max value)
